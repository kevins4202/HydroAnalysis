5350,anomalous atmospheric conditions which for the most part manifest in the form of heavy precipitation events leading to the generation of pluvial or fluvial flooding in some years or as extended extreme dry spells resulting in the development of severe drought conditions in other years has significant implications for subsurface moisture budgets in regional and local catchments in the canadian prairies the myriad implications of these frequent and extended dry spells over alberta s agricultural region can be far reaching economically socially and otherwise thereby exerting substantial negative toll on agricultural productivity crop cultivation livestock husbandry and pasture management within the province soil moisture dynamics both in spatial and temporal scales has critical implications for agricultural water management especially under semi arid climate conditions that are typical of the local and regional scale catchments in southern alberta this study is focused on the assessment of the observations of the soil water storage soil temperature and meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature acquired from 39 monitoring stations spanning a 12 year period with the principal objective of examining the spatial and temporal dynamics in the shallow and deep soil water storage processes across the study domain this study revealed that the moisture anomalies in the deep soil moisture store exhibit the longest hydrologic memory relative to those in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture storages as well as those in the meteorological variables across the study domain the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store revealed frequency features that are dominant at seasonal cycle 9 month and at a higher periodicity of 32 month cycle this low frequency feature 32 month cycle is evidently non existent in the soil water storage measured at the shallower soil depths nor in the meteorological variables evaluated in this study this implies that the low frequency feature of the soil water storage wavelet spectra increases with increasing soil depth across the agricultural region indicating that at deeper soil depths the largest variances are shifted to lower frequencies this observed dominant long memory feature in the deep soil moisture store could have important implications for characterizing the development of temperature extremes as well as for the evaluation of the severity of the recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and potentially for other canadian prairie catchments keywords soil water storage continuous wavelet transform hydrologic memory autocorrelation function canadian prairies 1 introduction a number of key hydrological and ecological processes over a large river catchment such as flooding drought evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater surface water interactions are influenced to varying degrees by the available soil water storage in a catchment s subsurface stores soil water storage exists at the critical nexus between the atmosphere and the land surface hydrologic processes and occurs as a balance between the competing demands of the atmosphere vegetation and gravitation drainage williams et al 2009 besides soil water storage exerts controls on soil albedo thermal inertia hydraulic conductivity and soil matric potential through myriad direct or indirect pathways thereby affecting various land surface and atmospheric processes salvucci 1998 furthermore the variability in soil water storage within a regional catchment s subsurface stores is heavily linked to the spatial and temporal variability in atmospheric variables e g precipitation and evaporation as well as to other watershed physiographic characteristics such as land surface topography surficial geology and vegetation cover these dynamic variations in the soil water storage within regional scale catchments are of importance for better understanding the land surface atmosphere interactions as they exert significant influence on the partitioning of the surface available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as on the partitioning of precipitation events into evapotranspiration infiltration and subsequent runoff on the land surface in accordance with huang and van den dool 1993 as reported in illston et al 2004 it was demonstrated that a negative precipitation anomaly estimated as less than the long term average rainfall amounts initiated a decrease in the near surface soil moisture that preceded above average summer temperatures by as much as one month similarly other previous studies such as those by delworth and manabe 1989 as well as manabe and delworth 1990 clearly demonstrated that persistent anomalies in the subsurface soil moisture exert significant impacts on the variability of the lower troposphere moreover it was adduced that the persistence in the wet soil moisture anomalies initiates an alteration in the land surface temperatures and humidity through an increase in the latent heat flux with a corresponding reduction in the sensible heat flux it was further concluded that persistent soil moisture anomalies induce the largest impacts on the atmosphere especially across large spatial scales however beyond the impacts soil moisture exert on the lower atmosphere accurate information on the shallow and deep soil moisture regimes in subsurface store is required to better understand crop water use agriculture soil chemistry groundwater surface water interactions from and to shallow and deep aquifer systems in addition in situ soil moisture observations are essential for the evaluation of regional soil water balance models understanding and predicting climatological processes at various spatial scales as well as to ground truth remote sensing observations of surficial soil moisture the natural ecosystem socio economic development and agricultural activities across the watersheds in alberta one of the three provinces in the canadian prairies are intricately linked with and sustained by the availability of sufficient surface water and groundwater resources wen et al 2011 these local and regional scale watersheds in the province are characterized by anomalous atmospheric conditions which for the most part manifest in the form of heavy precipitation events leading to the generation of pluvial or fluvial flooding in some years or as extended extreme dry spells resulting in the development of severe drought conditions in other years the myriad implications of these frequent extended dry spells over these various river catchments can be far reaching economically socially and otherwise exerting substantial negative toll on agricultural productivity crop cultivation livestock husbandry and pasture management within the province given the large urban centres in some parts of the province that require substantial supplies of freshwater for domestic and industrial consumption the undesirable impacts of these incessant and prolonged dry spells on the surface water and groundwater systems necessitate a closer attention by the various public and private stakeholder groups within the province as established in an earlier study completed by roberts et al 2006 it was indicated that there was at least one catastrophic drought per century dating back as far as the 17th century in the canadian prairies furthermore during the last century there were outbreaks of multi year droughts in the early 1930 s and the 1980 s however the most severe and widespread canadian prairie drought was the recent drought episode that commenced in 1999 and ended in 2004 recorded precipitation amounts in alberta were evidently well below the long term normal precipitation for more than four consecutive years spanning between autumn 1999 to spring 2004 this recent drought outbreak peaked between 2001 and 2002 and has been recognized as one of canada s worst natural disasters in history wheaton et al 2007 the spatio temporal dynamics in the soil moisture regime within subsurface moisture stores across regional scale watersheds is one of the hydrologic variables that has been identified to play an important role as a slow driver of frequent canadian prairies multi year drought outbreaks agboma et al 2009 agboma and lye 2015 soil moisture droughts generally precede the onset of either meteorological or hydrological droughts and can result from a short term several days to several weeks shortage of precipitation an increase in evapotranspiration or both factors working in concert leathers et al 2000 this especially could be the case during some parts of the growing season with the prevalence of scattered mesoscale convective precipitation consequently it is often a common occurrence for a sub catchment within a canadian prairie regional watershed to have received an above normal annual or seasonal precipitation amounts and could still have experienced a period of severe soil water storage deficit during some portion of the annual cycle the government of alberta through its agriculture drought risk management adrm initiative had developed an automated hydrometeorological observing network comprising 39 monitoring stations to provide reliable dataset for understanding seasonal and inter annual variability in the subsurface moisture storage and soil thermal regimes at measurement depths of 5 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm below the ground surface this observation network which spans the entire agricultural region of alberta is critical in support of various risk mitigation measures to the agricultural and other sectors of its economy adequate analysis of these dataset can be leveraged to provide invaluable information and advice to farmers in the province on irrigation related issues develop an early warning system for drought and flood forecasting or baseline water stress per catchment and can assist to improve their crop yield predictions this study focuses on the assessment of the observations of the soil moisture and other meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature acquired from the 39 monitoring sites spanning a 12 year period with the principal objective of examining the spatial and temporal dynamics of the shallow and deep soil water storage processes across the agricultural region of the province a further goal of this study is to better characterize areas within this region that can be considered as moisture stressed based on the distribution of the soil moisture deficit both in temporal and spatial scales additionally this study explores the characterization of the inherent hydrological memory characteristics in the shallow and deep soil water storage and a subsequent comparison of these with the estimated memory scales in the relevant atmospheric variables over the agricultural region potential natural and human induced climate changes have led to concerns about the supply of freshwater for human consumption and for effective functioning of the natural and agricultural ecosystems across the earth leathers et al 2000 these concerns are particularly relevant in the agricultural region of the province a region that regularly experiences soil moisture meteorological and hydrological droughts the availability of more than a decade observations of soil moisture soil temperature and meteorological variables from this extensive network of sensors provide a unique opportunity to obtain an insight into the physical nature of the near surface soil moisture and soil thermal regimes across this regional catchment in alberta 2 methods 2 1 study domain the study domain is the agricultural white zone region that encompasses approximately 42 of the province of alberta canada and consists of four principal regions namely the northern central southern and peace river as illustrated in fig 1 the southern and central sub regions are underlain with glacial till lacustrine deposits and some fluvial and eolian materials mostly with chernozemic soils the nature and behavior of chernozemic soils are in large part determined by the accumulation decomposition and transformation of soil organic matter within the topsoil fuller 2010 the role of native grassland vegetation and climate play an important role in determining the nature and amount of organic matter contents retained within this type of soil the peace river sub region is covered by glacial till with dominant black chernozemic soils under grassland or cultivated land and consists of the most fertile soils within the province the agricultural region spans approximately latitude 49 0 to 58 7 n and from longitude 110 to 120 w and covers a catchment area of about 259 767 km2 the terrain is characterized by a topographic relief which varies from approximately 232 to 2959 m above sea level masl the annual precipitation ranges from about 296 mm to 694 mm at the foothills of the southern region with a long term average annual precipitation of approximately 454 mm similarly the long term mean monthly temperature varies from about 20 5 to 4 8 c in january and from 11 2 to 19 5 c for the month of july with a long term mean annual temperature of 2 5 c over the entire agricultural region 2 2 soil moisture and climate dataset as indicated in the earlier section a good understanding of the province s soil water groundwater crop and climate inter relationship is key for a proactive cost effective mitigation practices for various environmental risks historically the available meteorological dataset at the provincial weather stations prior to 2002 were severely limited for use in undertaking comprehensive climatological hydrological near surface geophysical assessments as these suffer from a number of different problems associated with the acquired data integrity representativeness and sufficient record lengths however between 2002 and 2003 the province developed a pragmatic approach relating to water resources risk characterization and management to better mitigate the impacts of frequent drought outbreaks this initiative entailed the installation of 39 hydrometeorological stations as part of the established provincial wide drought risk monitoring network which is generally referred to as the agricultural drought monitoring network agdm the spatial distribution of the observation stations in this network spans the entire agricultural region of the province as presented in figs 1 and 2 all the stations were designed and equipped with the capability to monitor air temperature humidity wind speed precipitation as well as solar radiation at an hourly timescale subsequently the need for collocated soil moisture measurements and climate monitoring necessitated the installation of soil moisture and soil temperature probes at most of the observation network stations to facilitate the province s capability to meet its mandate of drought risk monitoring and reporting the installation of these latter probes provided spatially time varying snapshots of the near surface and deep moisture and temperature regime changes which have improved the province drought monitoring capabilities and will continue to play a crucial role in the various studies designed to better conceptualize and assess key land surface atmosphere interaction processes over this region this information will be used to inform agricultural production activities environmental monitoring and for the development of various mitigation plans associated with water resources risks across the province the soil moisture observations from the agdm network are acquired using the ml2x thetaprobe soil moisture sensors from delta t device ltd while the soil temperature sensors are the 107 temperature probes manufactured by campbell scientific inc the delta t thetaprobe ml2x measures volumetric soil moisture content θv by responding to changes in the apparent dielectric constant which is proportional to the soil moisture content the accuracy levels specified by the manufacturer are 0 05 m3 m3 0 to 70 c using the supplied soil calibration 0 01 m3 m3 0 to 40 c and 0 02 m3 m3 40 to 70 c after calibration to a specific soil type holzman et al 2017 soil specific calibration provides the full 2 accuracy however for general use where soil salinity is limited to 250 msm 1 delta t thetaprobe provides generic calibration coefficients for mineral soils which can lead to a 5 accuracy in volumetric moisture content for the intended goals the soil moisture measurements from the agdm network were the products of the implementation of the manufacturer s calibration for the soil moisture probes with 5 measurement accuracy the soil water storage in subsurface stores within the agricultural region undergoes freezing and thawing processes during the winter months as such a proportion of the soil water changes phase and freezes in situ during this period however some of the water that remains unfrozen is present in absorbed films around soil particles in crevices between soil particles and in pores of sufficiently small diameters spaans and baker 1996 as temperature decreases further more water in subsurface store will freeze leaving the remaining unfrozen water in progressively thinner absorbed films and smaller pores and crevices these installed frequency based soil moisture probes generally utilize high permittivity of liquid water 80 relative to the surrounding soil and air 2 9 and 1 respectively in establishing the relationships between the recorded electromagnetic signals from the soil probes and the liquid soil moisture pellet and hauck 2017 however the permittivity of liquid water is correlated with and sensitive to temperature variations and can increase from 80 at 2 c up to 88 0 c therefore this introduces an additional uncertainty in the calibration of unfrozen soil conditions consequently when the soil is in frozen state the recorded signals from the soil moisture probes and the corresponding measured soil water storage strongly decreases although the total soil moisture content remains constant therefore to minimize the effects of soil freezing and thawing processes on the magnitude of the soil moisture measurements acquired from the soil moisture probes soil moisture measurements made when the corresponding soil temperature measurements were below 0 c as recorded by the 107 soil temperature probes for the various soil depths were removed from the analyses conducted in this study as the hydrometeorological stations are planned and designed for long term monitoring a critical consideration for suitable site selection entailed the installation of the stations in isolated open areas with non changing land use and preferably covered by pastures however given that the installation of the climate stations preceded the plan for collocated observations of soil moisture and soil temperature with measurements of relevant meteorological variables not all sites were ideal for the installation of the soil moisture and soil temperature probes additional considerations for the selection of suitable sites entailed choosing locations with very low vehicular and human traffic as well as areas where the soils are undisturbed these selected locations must also be vegetated with grass or short weeds and not in proximity to external disturbances such as roads and ditches the installation of the soil moisture and soil temperature probes were completed in pits that were dug with very low disturbance to minimize impacts to the immediate surroundings of the probes and their measurements the agdm network implements a near real time quality assurance program for all the raw climate and soil observations itenfisu and wright 2006 the quality control algorithm for the hourly measurements of the soil moisture and the soil temperature detects any measurement that exceeds the expected normal ranges or thresholds as defined in the quality assurance program to ensure their validity before being included as reasonable measurements inaccurate or unreasonable readings are appropriately flagged as suspect and are further evaluated to ensure that a sensor s measurement does not wet or dry in an unrealistic manner raw soil moisture or temperature measurements are clearly identified as missing when no data is received from a specific sensor the quality assurance operational algorithm deployed for the soil moisture measurements program entails measurement range checks and validation procedure which ensures that the observed volumetric soil moisture value range between 0 and 60 as valid reading this algorithm also implements an hourly step change in observed volumetric measurement that is not greater than 10 as reasonable observation else the soil moisture value is flagged as suspect and is then subjected to additional investigation by the quality manager the volumetric soil moisture contents and the soil temperature were continuously measured at various soil depths below the ground surface and the depths of the soil moisture probe installation represents measurements for a range of soil horizons as follows 5 cm 0 10 cm 20 cm 10 30 cm 50 cm 30 70 cm and 100 cm 70 100 cm a summary of the pertinent monitoring station information as well as the data records acquired at the 39 hydrometeorological stations across this region is presented as shown in table 1 volumetric soil moisture contents measured within the soil profile was converted to the corresponding soil water storage by estimating the product of the soil moisture probes observed volumetric moisture contents and the average depth of the soil layer it represents within the soil profile there are approximately 13 years worth of available soil moisture and climate dataset acquired from most of the monitoring stations that constitute the agdm network as presented in table 1 however the fort vermilion onefour cda st albert research stations have shorter temporal records of measured dataset relative to the remaining 36 stations with the fort vermillion station holding the shortest record of measured dataset within the entire monitoring network 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization a phased approach was adopted in attempting to gain a better understanding of the spatio temporal patterns and variability in the soil moisture and climate variables measured at the 39 monitoring sites across the region the time series of the observed soil moisture profiles precipitation and air temperature at the 39 monitoring stations commencing from april 1 2006 to december 31 2017 at daily time steps were analyzed for this study measurements made at the various observation stations prior to january 2006 were eliminated from the assessments conducted as part of this study this is reasonable as this period is characterized by high proportion of missing values in the time series of the different hydrometeorological observations under consideration dataset post december 31 2017 were equally excluded as these were insufficient to conduct any defensible inter seasonal assessments over this region the daily soil moisture dataset from the alberta agdm network were temporally aggregated through averaging to generate the equivalent monthly soil moisture measurements from january 2006 to december 2017 monthly and seasonal soil water storage measurements over the study domain were generated through spatial interpolation of all the observations across the 39 stations the cressman analysis scheme cressman 1959 was implemented in the generation of 9118 gridded long term mean monthly soil moisture and precipitation dataset which spans the entire agricultural region of the province individual long term mean monthly soil moisture grid has a spatial resolution of 11 km 11 km this selected grid size is considered reasonable for this assessment to represent the heterogeneity in the soil types vegetation and topography across the region an important consideration when mapping the precipitation field relates to the effects of terrain heterogeneity in defining the spatial distribution of precipitation especially over mountainous regions this is so because terrain changes exert significant effects on the spatial patterns or increases the variability in the observed precipitation over regional or continental scale river catchments however over the watersheds in the study domain the effects of terrain variations on precipitation variability is not so pronounced especially given that this region is characterized by flat to gently sloping topography and the application of elevation correction may not result in any significant difference the temporal aggregation of the observed daily soil moisture dataset into monthly temporal scale was subsequently undertaken given that a key component of the goal of this study is to better represent the seasonal and inter annual behaviors and changes in the shallow and deep soil moisture regimes over this region the representation of the instantaneous and dynamic response of the soil moisture regime to daily or sub daily precipitation events will be investigated in future assessments over this study domain from a climatological and hydrological standpoint the watersheds in alberta experience similar influences as those of similar sized watersheds situated in other cold regions globally winter in the watersheds within the study domain represents a period during which most of the precipitation events fall as snow rather than rain and subsequent ice cover development leads to significant annual low flow rates and decreased water levels in the various river systems correspondingly the soil moisture storage infiltration and groundwater recharge rates groundwater surface interaction processes in conjunction with groundwater elevations in the unconfined aquifer system within these watersheds are affected to varying degrees by the ambient conditions during these winter months therefore based on the distinct dominant hydrological regimes characterizing these catchments over the region part of the assessments completed in this study entailed the partitioning of the time series of the measured soil moisture dataset into two temporal frames characterized as open water and ice cover seasons the open water season evaluation comprises aggregated monthly soil moisture measurements that were made from the month of april to october of each year under consideration while the corresponding ice cover season analysis entails monthly aggregated soil moisture observations acquired for the months of november to march 2 4 normalized soil moisture anomaly accurate inter comparison of soil moisture observations measured at multiple sites over regional catchments that are characterized by marked heterogeneities in soil types soil texture vegetation and available water for plants can be extremely challenging and sometimes fraught with misleading interpretation when attempting to draw conclusions as to which flanks of these watersheds are wetter or drier this is especially true given that accurate interpretation of the spatial representation of soil moisture storage under this situation requires the incorporation of the boundaries of the soil units with different water holding capacities in such an assessment hollinger and isard 1994 given that soil types and soil textures for the most part across the agricultural region are not homogeneous a reasonable approach to better capture and represent the spatial variability in the soil moisture storage at the various depths in the soil horizons across this regional catchment becomes imperative and desirable in this study the normalized monthly soil moisture anomaly nsma was computed for the 9118 continuous grids spanning the entire agricultural region this was then utilized in assessing the variability in the soil water storage as well as to undertake the inter comparison of the degree of soil wetness or dryness over the study domain the normalized monthly soil moisture anomalies are estimated employing the mathematical formulation for the computation of the standardized monthly z scores which is given as 1 nsm a x i k s m i k μ x i σ x i s m i k is the average monthly soil moisture at a specific soil depth estimated for the ith month in the kth year within a specified grid in the regional watershed while μ x i and σ x i are respectively the long term spatially integrated mean and standard deviation of the monthly soil moisture storage over the entire study domain the normalized annual z scores were equally estimated for the interpolated precipitation field over this region the underlying premise of this approach is based on the utilization of the standardized soil moisture z scores rather than the absolute values of the soil moisture measurements to explain how many standard deviations an estimated monthly soil moisture value departs from the historical soil moisture measurements over a regional watershed thus this approach enables an identification of the localized areas of excessive dryness moisture stressed areas or wetness within that watershed the computation of the normalized soil moisture anomalies utilizing a monthly timescale is considered reasonable for this study to ensure statistical robustness in the computed anomalies as well as to minimize the impacts of the presence of any missing values in the daily time series of the soil moisture measurements that were undertaken for the different soil depths 2 5 soil moisture persistence and wavelet analysis a key characteristic of the soil water storage effect is related to the memory timescale which is an approximate measure of the time needed by the soil moisture column to forget or dissipate an imposed anomaly such as that associated with a rainfall event or lack thereof ghannam et al 2016 this memory timescale is often employed as a surrogate for the persistence in the soil moisture regime within a river catchment these two terms are frequently used interchangeably to express how the effects of a short term forcing such as a storm event can persist within the soil column long after the forcing ceases the persistence is generally derived from the corresponding time lagged autocorrelation function acf and is typically on the order of a week to a few months for soil moisture measurements acquired at different depths below the ground surface within a river catchment however the magnitude of the acf is dependent on the soil properties and the meteorological or biophysical variables and generally reflects the tendency of the temporal statistics of the soil moisture to maintain a finite temporal correlation in this study a one month lag autocorrelation function was employed to estimate the persistence in the measured soil moisture storage as well as those in the observed meteorological variables over the agricultural region this estimated acf provides a single parameter measure of the memory or persistence in these hydroclimatological variable which can serve as a measure of their predictability wei et al 2006 the memory effect within a soil moisture store is manifested in the slow decay of the corresponding autocorrelation function and is often determined from the integral timescale s of the autocorrelation function priestley 1981 and is mathematically given as 2 ρ s t α s t s t α σ s 2 in eq 2 the subscript s denotes the soil moisture state variable while the prime superscript indicates the fluctuations around the mean value the α represents the lag time and the σ s 2 denotes the variance in the soil moisture the resulting soil moisture persistence may last from weeks to months which is especially remarkable in comparison with that of variables such as precipitation and temperature furthermore a continuous wavelet transform cwt terrence and compo 1998 lakshmi et al 2004 using the morlet wavelet was employed in the decomposition of the generated monthly time series of the soil moisture storage at various depths and precipitation into time and frequency domains to facilitate the detection and isolation of dominant patterns across various temporal scales the cwt allows for the detection of the location dependent amplitude and phase in the frequencies contained within the temporally soil moisture and precipitation variables being analyzed in this study in accordance with agboma and lye 2015 a wavelet transform entails a convolution integral between a real signal x t and a corresponding wavelet function ψ as expressed in eq 3 3 w β α 1 α 0 t x t ψ t β α d t in this expression w β α represents the wavelet spectrum which consists of a matrix of energy coefficients in the decomposed hydrometeorological variable at each scale α and time β ψ denotes the complex conjugate of the wavelet function t represents the time function while t is the total length of the hydrometeorological time series the magnitude of the wavelet spectrum is an indication of the degree of correlation between the wavelet and the hydroclimatological time series mwale and gan 2005 furthermore this transform enables broad features within a hydroclimatological time series to be resolved at large scales whereas fine features are captured and resolved at smaller scales si 2007 3 results and discussion shallow and deep soil moisture in subsurface storages over regional catchments tend to exhibit variability both in the temporal and spatial domains the variability in shallow and deep soil moisture over regional catchments are controlled among other factors by the effects of dynamic soil moisture processes surface topography in conjunction with the dominant vegetation cover over the watershed the tabulation of the summarized statistical metrics for the observed soil water storages in the shallow intermediate and deep moisture stores within the agricultural region is presented for the open water ow as shown in table 2 as discussed in section 2 2 the uncertainty in the daily soil moisture measurements associated with the calibration of the soil moisture probes for unfrozen soil conditions for the various soil depths when the soil temperature drops below 0 c precludes the computation of defensible soil moisture statistical metrics for the ice cover ic season similarly the derived statistical metrics for the long term monthly observations are presented as shown in table 3 as depicted in table 3 the saturation of the pore spaces in the shallow and deep subsurface stores within this region is relatively higher for the months in the ow season in comparison with those measured in november and december which are in the ic period for the 50 and 100 cm soil depths this is not unexpected especially given that the mean seasonal precipitation across this region during the ow season is evidently higher than in the ic season as indicated in the previous section most of the precipitation that are recorded in the ow season falls as rain rather than snow over this region whereas snowfall dominates the precipitation pattern in the ic season associated with the higher sub zero air temperature during this period consequently most of the precipitation during this period are stored in snowpack resulting in reduced infiltration into the vadoze zone and surface runoff over this region the long term monthly cycle of observed soil water contents and soil temperature across this region at the various measurement depths are presented as shown in fig 3 additionally the long term average monthly precipitation and air temperature are subsumed as plots in fig 3 to provide context in terms of the degree of similarities or otherwise with the observed temporal patterns of the estimated monthly soil moisture climatology over the study domain the boxplots in fig 3 represent the interquartile ranges of the mean monthly soil water storage measured at the different soil moisture measurement depths while the horizontal lines within the respective boxplots indicate the median of the monthly soil water storage potential outliers in the time series of the monthly soil water storage are marked as crosses these boxplots do not only provide an increased understanding of the temporal variations of soil water storage on a long term monthly cycle over this region but also enable an inter comparison of the drying and wetting trends as well as the differences between the soil moisture measurements made at the different soil depths as depicted in fig 3 the boxplots of the long term cycles of the soil water storage for the months of november to march are not presented for the measurements made at the 5 and 20 cm soil depths for reason earlier adduced regarding the soil thermal regime during these months of the year however the temporal length of the long term monthly estimates of the soil water storage increased progressively for the 50 and 100 cm soil depths as the number of months characterized by sub zero average soil temperature decreased the long term temporal behavior of the regional soil moisture regime is marked by pronounced patterns of wetting moisture replenishment and drying moisture declining phases as reflected in the plots for the soil water storage measurements made at the 50 and 100 cm soil depths as shown in fig 3 continuous and gradual decline in the soil moisture available within the moisture stores in the vadoze zone is apparent in the month of july through to the month of december and this period essentially constitutes the drying phase in the soil moisture climatology of the various catchments within this study domain this observed pattern of progressive decline in the soil water storage potentially extends into the ic season attributable to the lower soil thermal regime and the attendant effects of frozen soils on subsurface moisture storage conversely a wetting phase in the soil moisture store commences during a period in the ic season as evident from the progressive increase in the soil thermal regime until the month of april this latter month corresponds to the peak of the spring freshet across the watersheds in the study domain for the most part the wet phase occurs between may and july and is characterized by the highest soil water storage in the subsurface stores except for the shallowest soil moisture store 5 cm where the highest water storage peaks in april the temporal variability in soil water storage measured in the shallow and intermediate depths reflects identical temporal variability to that of the precipitation field for the different months precipitation decreases progressively from june to december and soil moisture replenishment to the subsurface storages decreases especially in the shallow 5 cm and intermediate soil moisture storages 20 cm and 50 cm soil horizons moisture depletion in the deep soil moisture store 100 cm soil horizon is relatively less pronounced during this period in comparison to those in the shallow and intermediate soil horizons the principal driving factor for this sustained moisture depletion beyond the apparent decreases in the precipitation amounts during this period can be attributed to the impacts of increased evapotranspiration rates during the summer months evapotranspiration rate increases are generally associated with increasing vegetation cover arising from increased cropping activities during the summer months in conjunction with increased land surface and air temperatures over this region however the lesser soil moisture deficits as observed in the deep soil horizon 100 cm are potentially related to the reduced impacts of evapotranspiration losses at this depth in conjunction with the buffering effects of various near surface geophysical processes these processes are principally associated with the dynamic interactions between the surface water and groundwater systems due to the presence of myriad groundwater fed wetlands sloughs and potholes as well as shallow unconfined aquifers in the quaternary formations underneath this region soil moisture measurements acquired at the 50 cm depth has the highest mean soil water storage of about 131 mm as presented in fig 3 and table 3 this highest long term mean in the soil water storage occurred in the month of may whereas the mean soil water storage in the 5 cm depth was the lowest at 24 mm which occurred in the month of august during the ow season the long term mean soil water storage are approximately 99 mm and 63 mm for the measurements made at the 100 cm and 20 cm respectively over the region the soil water storage averaged over all the measurement depths was maximum at approximately 316 mm and occurred in may while the lowest mean soil water storage occurred in november it has to be highlighted that the interpretation of the estimates of the long term soil water storage as presented above and subsequently may be influenced to varying degrees at finer spatial scales by the impacts of vegetation types over this region especially given that regional watersheds characterized by mixed plant functional types pfts may lead to different soil moisture dynamics for instance cultivated areas e g wheat typically use a summer fallow to increase soil moisture whereas permanent grassland areas will always tend to have lower or equal soil water contents compared to cropland pfts affect the dissipation of precipitation signal in soil the attenuation of microwave radiation emitted by the underlying soils and the extraction of root rooting zone soil moisture liu et al 2017 drusch et al 2001 given that all the monitoring sites for the observation of the soil moisture and soil temperature measurements are located on permanent grassland the estimated soil moisture levels trends and anomalies as presented herein are to a larger extent more representative of the soil moisture dynamics within a permanent grassland than over cultivated areas which comprise fraction of this region it is not the focus of this current study to explore the inter relationships between soil moisture dynamics and heterogeneous pfts however our alternate study is focused on characterizing and relating soil moisture dynamics over this region to different pfts under the same or different precipitation regimes to characterize the interannual variability in the regional soil moisture conditions the soil water storage deficits were derived from the temporally varying spatially interpolated soil moisture grids generated for the period commencing from 2006 to 2017 and presented as shown in fig 4 these moisture deficits were computed as departures of the monthly soil water storage values from the long term multi year mean of the soil water storage for the respective soil moisture measurements from the various soil depths the multi year mean value of the soil water storage is centered at zero on the vertical axes of the respective plots presented in fig 4 while one standard deviation above and below the multi year mean soil moisture value were computed using all soil moisture observations for the 12 year period under assessment a regression fit line is drawn through the individual soil moisture deficit plot to provide a general indication of the trajectory of the linear trend inherent in these variables the time series of the derivatives of the departures from the long term mean in the soil water storage values demonstrate considerable interannual fluctuations between high soil moisture surplus and low soil moisture deficits within the subsurface moisture stores over the agricultural region in this study a soil moisture surplus is characterized as a scenario in which the computed monthly soil water storage value is significantly higher than the estimated multi year mean in the soil water storage plus one standard deviation of all observed soil water storage values for that specific soil moisture measurement horizon conversely a soil moisture deficit corresponds to a scenario wherein the computed monthly soil water storage value is significantly lower than the computed multi year mean in the soil water storage less one standard deviation of all observed soil water storage values for that specific soil moisture measurement horizon persistent soil moisture deficits are notably apparent in 2008 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 in the time series of the soil water storage estimated for the shallow and intermediate soil moisture measurement depths similarly persistent soil moisture deficits are clearly evidenced in 2007 2009 and 2010 in the deep soil moisture storage over the region in the shallow soil moisture horizon a maximum soil moisture deficit of about 8 mm equivalent water thickness was estimated for the region and occurred in the month of september 2009 while the highest soil moisture surplus of 13 mm was computed for this horizon and occurred in the month of april 2017 in the 20 cm soil depth the highest deficit in soil water storage is 11 mm and was estimated in september 2017 and a corresponding maximum soil moisture surplus of 11 mm was computed in the month of may 2017 in the intermediate soil moisture measurement horizon which is 50 cm below the ground surface a 15 mm equivalent water height was estimated as the maximum soil moisture deficit and was determined to have occurred in november 2006 while the corresponding highest soil water storage surplus of 15 mm was observed over the region and occurred in may 2017 furthermore a maximum soil moisture deficit of 11 mm on average was estimated in april 2006 in the deep soil moisture zone over the study domain a soil moisture surplus of approximately 6 mm of equivalent water height was available in storage in the deep soil moisture store and was estimated for the month of june 2017 overall the highest degree of soil saturation or soil wetness consistently occurred in the month of april may or june of 2017 across all soil horizons under consideration whereas the months and years of the highest soil moisture deficit over this region are variable for the ow season a remarkable upward increasing trend in the soil water storage is apparent in the deep moisture store over this region and to a lesser extent relatively smaller gradient a similar upward trend is observable in the soil water storage regime in the 50 cm soil moisture measurement depth however very mild upward trends not statistically significant can be observed in the soil water storage estimated for the 5 and 20 cm depth no apparent trend is visible in the time series of the precipitation deficit as depicted by the regression fit in fig 4 the distribution of the average soil water storage as a function of depth from 2006 to 2017 over the agricultural region for the open water is presented as shown in fig 5 the observed temporal patterns of the soil water storage as a function of depth over this region exhibit strong resemblance over the different annual temporal scales the annual soil water storage peaks at about 129 mm in 2014 and was as low as 29 mm in 2009 for the open water season over this region the low soil water storage regime observed in the measurements acquired in 2009 is not unexpected as this year was characterized as a drought year on record with lower than normal annual precipitation for the entire province an apparent characteristic observed in these soil moisture measurements over these annual cycles under consideration is the consistently higher average moisture regime at the 50 cm depth over the study domain measurements made at shallower depths than the 50 cm horizon in this region exhibits lower soil water storage potentially due to the higher plant uptakes or larger evaporative losses from these surficial horizons however a regional depletion in the soil water storage was observed in the deep moisture store at horizons deeper than the 50 cm depth for the periods of investigation the cause of this depletion pattern is not immediately evident at the time of this assessment and further investigations will be required to better understand the drivers of the reduced soil water storage at this deeper zone potentially it is assumed that this pattern is reflective of decreased soil porosity with increasing depth across the region or attributable to other issues associated with the calibration of the soil moisture probes that were used in completing these long term soil moisture measurements over the study domain it needs to be highlighted and has largely been established in plethora of previous studies globally that soil water storage in subsurface stores varies dynamically with season vegetation soil type location and scale of observation and all these factors may contribute linearly or non linearly to the observed spatial and temporal patterns of soil water storage within regional scale catchments the coefficients of variation cv were estimated for the soil water storage measured at the various soil horizons over the 12 year period of continuous monitoring in the region as presented in table 2 for the ow season as well for the corresponding long term monthly cycles as presented in table 3 as depicted in fig 6 the mathematical relationship between the estimated cv and the mean soil water storage for the different soil moisture measurement depths follows an empirical power function that can be expressed as 4 cv λ ϕ α in eq 4 λ and α are model coefficients while ϕ is the monthly mean soil water storage estimated for the measurements made at the various soil depths the fitted functions for the power relationship for the various soil moisture measurement depths are captured and inset as shown in fig 6 the cv varies from about 2 5 to approximately 16 1 from the deep to the shallow soil moisture stores this is suggestive of a weak to moderate soil moisture variability across the region the higher scatter in this plot for the soil moisture measurements made at the shallower soil horizon relative to those made in the deeper soil horizon can partly be attributed to the wider range of standard deviations within the range of the mean soil water storage between 22 and 30 mm as well as between 49 and 62 mm as cv is determined by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean moisture content the spread in the standard deviation is amplified as the mean soil moisture decreases resulting in higher scattered cv values with lower soil moisture contents consequently the heterogeneity in the soil water storage in the shallow subsurface stores up to 20 cm below the ground surface is evidently higher relative to the corresponding soil moisture content in the deeper moisture storage zones as illustrated in fig 6 the cv decreases with increasing mean soil water storage across all soil moisture measurement depths in the shallow soil horizons 5 cm and 20 cm there are significantly weak relationships between the cv and mean soil moisture with the coefficients of correlation much lower than 1 however at the intermediate and deep soil moisture storage zones 50 cm and 100 cm there exist stronger relationships between the cv and the mean soil water storage across the agricultural region he spatial variability in the computed nsmas as derived from the continuous soil moisture grids developed for all the soil moisture measurements acquired from the various soil horizons within the study domain is depicted as shown in fig 7 normalized anomalies were equally generated for the precipitation field and the results are captured as shown in fig 7 f as illustrated in the various plots presented in fig 7 the yellow to red values of the nsmas are indicative of areas in this regional watershed where the estimated monthly soil water storage values are a number of standard deviation below the long term spatially integrated mean soil moisture value these areas can be characterized as moisture stressed areas within the agricultural region additionally the green to blue colored nsma values correspond to the areas in this region where the estimated monthly soil water storage values are a number of standard deviations proportionately higher than the long term spatially integrated mean soil moisture value as illustrated in these plots the spatial distribution of the positive and negative nsma values varied considerably across the region clearly indicative of significant spatial heterogeneity in the soil moisture conditions as determined from over a decade averaged soil moisture balance along the western flank of the peace region latitude 56on 57 n and longitude 119 w 118 w just upgradient of the city of grande prairie a localized area of extreme soil dryness is clearly apparent within the 5 cm and 20 cm soil moisture measurement depths fig 7a and 7b however this dominant dry soil condition moisture stressed is less pronounced in the intermediate and deep soil moisture horizons fig 7c and 7d this localized area of soil moisture deficit is approximately contained in the same area that is characterized by below normal long term average precipitation within the peace region strong negative moisture anomalies in precipitation which are as much as one standard deviation below the historical average precipitation pattern are apparent in the southern and peace regions as revealed in fig 7f however the spatial configuration of the area of extreme deficits in the soil moisture regime diminishes progressively in the eastward direction from the peace region to the northern region a few other areas of exceptional soil dryness relative to the long term mean soil moisture conditions are also noticeable in the northern central and southern sub regions of the agricultural regions latitude 56 n 50 n longitude 115 w 110 w across all the soil moisture measurement depths the spatial extent of the moisture stressed areas within the southern portion of the agricultural region especially near the city of calgary is comparatively smaller in the deep soil horizon than those estimated in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture measurement zones the observed soil moisture dynamics at various spatial scales are heavily influenced by a number of important soil properties such as the soil texture particle size distribution porosity hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics consequently the spatial distribution in the lower nsma values red or yellow bands as depicted in fig 7 may be attributed to localized areas in the agricultural region that are characterized by coarser soil textures or areas that exhibit significant heterogeneities in any of the aforementioned soil properties furthermore an autocorrelation analysis was conducted to characterize the temporal dynamics inherent in the soil water storage measured at the various soil depths over the study domain specifically the temporal autocorrelation functions were derived for the anomalies in the soil moisture storage average soil temperature as well as for the measured meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature and these are presented as shown in fig 8 the estimation of the autocorrelation functions in the time series of the various anomalies generated for these hydrometeorological variables is considered reasonable in order to prevent the correlations of the actual variable time series with their seasonal cycles evaluation of the plots in fig 8 reveals that the persistence in the meteorological variables dissipate after a few weeks less than 4 months whereas the soil water storage anomaly in the shallow soil moisture store is characterized by the shortest memory relative to all the other hydrometeorological variables under consideration moreover the temporal response of the soil moisture anomaly in the 20 cm soil depth to various hydrometeorological processes reveals a characteristic curve that resembles that of the soil moisture measurements acquired in the 50 cm soil horizon as depicted in this figure the estimated memory for the anomaly in the soil water storage at the 20 cm soil depth is approximately equal to those estimated for the meteorological variables the anomaly in the soil water storage acquired derived from the soil moisture measurements made at the 50 cm soil depth is comparatively longer than those of the two uppermost layers as well as those estimated for the meteorological variables nevertheless these patterns of temporal responses in the time series of these anomalies support the conclusion relating to the dominance of the inherent short memory features within these variables over canadian prairies regional catchments in accordance with an earlier study by agboma and lye 2015 however the anomalies in the deep soil moisture storage reveals the longest persistence approximately 39 5 months in comparison to those of the shallow and intermediate soil moisture storages as well as those computed for the meteorological variables measured over the agricultural region this long memory feature in the deep soil moisture storage has important implication for characterizing the severity of recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and in other canadian prairie regional catchments the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 has been widely explored and applied for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and severity of drought outbreaks and remains one of the most popular indices that is based on a catchment s water budget method as formulated the computation of the pdsi simply utilizes future precipitation and temperature dataset a so called look ahead procedure that is restrictive in its usefulness in the prediction of extreme temperature over a region huang et al 1996 consequently as drought outbreaks in alberta are usually multi year dry spell phenomena and in light of the limited short memory timescales inherent in the atmospheric variables precipitation and temperature as computed over this region drought indices that can leverage the deep soil moisture information with its longer memory timescale would be expected to provide better measures for characterizing drought severity and impacts over the watersheds within this study domain the continuous wavelet transform cwt of the estimated anomalies in the soil water storage across all the soil moisture measurement depths 5 20 50 and 100 cm are respectively presented as shown in fig 9 a d furthermore the cwt of the anomalies in the integrated soil water storage i e average soil moisture measurements acquired between 0 and 100 cm depths meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature in conjunction with the anomalies in the average soil temperature over the agricultural region are depicted respectively in fig 9 f h the computation of the cwt of the anomalies for the eight hydrometeorological variables under consideration in this study utilized dataset commencing from 2006 to 2017 that were acquired over the study domain as depicted in fig 9 the vertical axis in these spectral plots represents the fourier periods which are specified in monthly timescale while the horizontal axis represents the temporal length in annual time steps the legend represents the various wavelet power levels in each spectral plot additionally the legend color code for the continuous wavelet power spectrum ranges from dark blue which signifies periodicities with low power values to dark red representing periodicities with high values the solid black lines within these spectral plots indicate periodicities with 5 significance level in accordance with torrence and compo 1998 the mathematical formulation underpinning the cwt assumes that the dataset being analyzed exhibits a cyclic temporal pattern hence there are some errors at the beginning and at the end of the continuous wavelet power spectrum principally associated with and influenced by edge effects consequently the cone of influence coi depicted in the respective plots provided in fig 9 represents regions in the respective spectral plots influenced by edge effects hence the information captured within those regions outside the coi can be neglected as they remain largely unreliable as revealed in the wavelet power spectral plots in fig 9 a c there are two dominant periodicities that are apparent in the computed anomalies of the soil water storage measured in the shallow and intermediate soil horizons across this region this dominant feature is visibly apparent in the 9 month and 6 month temporal scales and represent the seasonal ow and sub seasonal cycles inherent in these variables for the period investigated over the agricultural region the computation of the cwt not presented in this study for the soil water storage acquired from the shallow and intermediate soil depths utilizing the complete observations in the year rather than those observed specifically in the ow season revealed periodicities are dominant in the 12 month and sub seasonal temporal scales however the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store reveal frequency features that are dominant at a seasonal cycle 9 month as well as at 32 month cycle this latter low frequency feature does not appear to be dominant over the complete period of assessment conducted for this study as it slightly tapers off somewhat prior to 2015 moreover this low frequency feature inherent in the anomalies in the deep soil moisture are evidently absent in the anomalies derived from the measurements made in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture stores these storage effects particularly within the root zone tend to last for several weeks and are perceived as a principal modulator of short term atmospheric anomalies and driver of longer term seasonal forecasts of overland atmospheric states e g summer rainfall droughts and floods ghannam et al 2016 as expected the wavelet power spectral plots for the meteorological and soil temperature variables are characterized by a 9 month periodicity that clearly represents the seasonal cycles ow period inherent in these variables and are consistently dominant across the period of assessment being investigated as illustrated in fig 9 f h 4 conclusions soil moisture dynamics both in the spatial and temporal scales has critical implications for agricultural water management especially under semi arid climate conditions that are typical of the catchments in southern alberta canada this study has addressed the spatio temporal variability in the soil water storage measured at various soil depths 5 20 50 and 100 cm below the ground surface over a 12 year period across the agricultural region of the province it was demonstrated in this study that the soil moisture measurements acquired at the 50 cm soil depth exhibits the highest long term average soil water storage whereas the long term mean soil water storage in the shallowest soil moisture store was the lowest over the study domain this study revealed that the heterogeneity in the observed soil water storage in the shallower soil horizon up 20 cm below the ground surface is evidently higher relative to that of the soil water stored in the deeper soil horizon this study has further demonstrated through leveraging the continuous wavelet power spectrum and temporal autocorrelation function analyses that the moisture anomalies in the deep soil moisture storage exhibit the longest persistence characteristics or memory effects relative to those inherent in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture stores as well as those in the meteorological variables across the study domain moreover the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store reveal frequency features that are dominant at intra and inter annual temporal scales with a periodicity as much as a 32 month cycle this low frequency feature as established is evidently non existent in the soil water storage measured in the shallower soil horizons nor in the meteorological variables that were evaluated furthermore the assessments completed in this study revealed that the low frequency feature in the soil water storage wavelet spectra increases with increasing soil depth across the study domain indicating that at deeper soil depths the largest variances are shifted to lower frequencies this estimated long memory in the deep soil moisture store will be relevant and critical for improvements in the seasonal forecast skill of soil moisture regimes and streamflow especially with respect to soil moisture initialization in land surface schemes developed over this region finally this observed dominant low frequency feature in the deep soil moisture store could have important implications for characterizing the development of temperature extremes as well as for the evaluation of the severity of the recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and potentially for other canadian prairie catchments the results with respect to soil moisture levels trends and anomalies as presented in this study are more reflective of the seasonal and inter annual soil water storage dynamics in a permanent grassland than cultivated cropland areas given that most of the monitoring sites for the observations of soil moisture and soil temperature are located on permanent grasslands

canadian prairies the myriad implications of these frequent and extended dry spells over alberta s agricultural region can be far reaching economically socially and otherwise thereby exerting substantial negative toll on agricultural productivity crop cultivation livestock husbandry and pasture management within the province soil moisture dynamics both in spatial and temporal scales has critical implications for agricultural water management especially under semi arid climate conditions that are typical of the local and regional scale catchments in southern alberta this study is focused on the assessment of the observations of the soil water storage soil temperature and meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature acquired from 39 monitoring stations spanning a 12 year period with the principal objective of examining the spatial and temporal dynamics in the shallow and deep soil water storage processes across the study domain this study revealed that the moisture anomalies in the deep soil moisture store exhibit the longest hydrologic memory relative to those in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture storages as well as those in the meteorological variables across the study domain the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store revealed frequency features that are dominant at seasonal cycle 9 month and at a higher periodicity of 32 month cycle this low frequency feature 32 month cycle is evidently non existent in the soil water storage measured at the shallower soil depths nor in the

implications for characterizing the development of temperature extremes as well as for the evaluation of the severity of the recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and potentially for other canadian prairie catchments keywords soil water storage continuous wavelet transform hydrologic memory autocorrelation function canadian prairies 1 introduction a number of key hydrological and ecological processes over a large river catchment such as flooding drought evapotranspiration infiltration and groundwater surface water interactions are influenced to varying degrees by the available soil water storage in a catchment s subsurface stores soil water storage exists at the critical nexus between the atmosphere and the land surface hydrologic processes and occurs as a balance between the competing demands of the atmosphere vegetation and gravitation drainage williams et al 2009 besides soil water storage exerts controls on soil albedo thermal inertia hydraulic conductivity and soil matric potential through myriad direct or indirect pathways thereby affecting various land surface and atmospheric processes salvucci 1998 furthermore the variability in soil water storage within a regional catchment s subsurface stores is heavily linked to the spatial and temporal variability in atmospheric variables e g precipitation and evaporation as well as to other watershed physiographic characteristics such as land surface topography surficial geology and vegetation cover these dynamic variations in the soil water storage within regional scale catchments are of importance for better understanding the land surface atmosphere interactions as they exert significant influence on the partitioning of the surface available energy into sensible and latent heat fluxes as well as on the partitioning of precipitation events into evapotranspiration infiltration and subsequent runoff on the land surface in accordance with huang and van den dool 1993 as reported in illston et al 2004 it was demonstrated that a negative precipitation anomaly estimated as less than the long term average rainfall amounts initiated a decrease in the near surface soil moisture that preceded above average summer temperatures by as much as one month similarly other previous studies such as those by delworth and manabe 1989 as well as manabe and delworth 1990 clearly demonstrated that persistent anomalies in the subsurface soil moisture exert significant impacts on the variability of the lower troposphere moreover it was adduced that the persistence in the wet soil moisture anomalies initiates an alteration in the land surface temperatures and humidity through an increase in the latent heat flux with a corresponding reduction in the sensible heat flux it was further concluded that persistent soil moisture anomalies induce the largest impacts on the atmosphere especially across large spatial scales however beyond the impacts soil moisture exert on the lower atmosphere accurate information on the shallow and deep soil moisture regimes in subsurface store is required to better understand crop water use agriculture soil chemistry groundwater surface water interactions from and to shallow and deep aquifer systems in addition in situ soil moisture observations are essential for the evaluation of regional soil water balance models understanding and predicting climatological processes at various spatial scales as well as to ground truth remote sensing observations of surficial soil moisture the natural ecosystem socio economic development and agricultural activities across the watersheds in alberta one of the three provinces in the canadian prairies are intricately linked with and sustained by the availability of sufficient surface water and groundwater resources wen et al 2011 these local and regional scale watersheds in the province are characterized by anomalous atmospheric conditions which for the most part manifest in the form of heavy precipitation events leading to the generation of pluvial or fluvial flooding in some years or as extended extreme dry spells resulting in the development of severe drought conditions in other years the myriad implications of these frequent extended dry spells over these various river catchments can be far reaching economically socially and otherwise exerting substantial negative toll on agricultural productivity crop cultivation livestock husbandry and pasture management within the province given the large urban centres in some parts of the province that require substantial supplies of freshwater for domestic and industrial consumption the undesirable impacts of these incessant and prolonged dry spells on the surface water and groundwater systems necessitate a closer attention by the various public and private stakeholder groups within the province as established in an earlier study completed by roberts et al 2006 it was indicated that there was at least one catastrophic drought per century dating back as far as the 17th century in the canadian prairies furthermore during the last century there were outbreaks of multi year droughts in the early 1930 s and the 1980 s however the most severe and widespread canadian prairie drought was the recent drought episode that commenced in 1999 and ended in 2004 recorded precipitation amounts in alberta were evidently well below the long term normal precipitation for more than four consecutive years spanning between autumn 1999 to spring 2004 this recent drought outbreak peaked between 2001 and 2002 and has been recognized as one of canada s worst natural disasters in history wheaton et al 2007 the spatio temporal dynamics in the soil moisture regime within subsurface moisture stores across regional scale watersheds is one of the hydrologic variables that has been identified to play an important role as a slow driver of frequent canadian prairies multi year drought outbreaks agboma et al 2009 agboma and lye 2015 soil moisture droughts generally precede the onset of either meteorological or hydrological droughts and can result from a short term several days to several weeks shortage of precipitation an increase in evapotranspiration or both factors working in concert leathers et al 2000 this especially could be the case during some parts of the growing season with the prevalence of scattered mesoscale convective precipitation consequently it is often a common occurrence for a sub catchment within a canadian prairie regional watershed to have received an above normal annual or seasonal precipitation amounts and could still have experienced a period of severe soil water storage deficit during some portion of the annual cycle the government of alberta through its agriculture drought risk management adrm initiative had developed an automated hydrometeorological observing network comprising 39 monitoring stations to provide reliable dataset for understanding seasonal and inter annual variability in the subsurface moisture storage and soil thermal regimes at measurement depths of 5 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 100 cm below the ground surface this observation network which spans the entire agricultural region of alberta is critical in support of various risk mitigation measures to the agricultural and other sectors of its economy adequate analysis of these dataset can be leveraged to provide invaluable information and advice to farmers in the province on irrigation related issues develop an early warning system for drought and flood forecasting or baseline water stress per catchment and can assist to improve their crop yield predictions this study focuses on the assessment of the observations of the soil moisture and other meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature acquired from the 39 monitoring sites spanning a 12 year period with the principal objective of examining the spatial and temporal dynamics of the shallow and deep soil water storage processes across the agricultural region of the province a further goal of this study is to better characterize areas within this region that can be considered as moisture stressed based on the distribution of the soil moisture deficit both in temporal and spatial scales additionally this study explores the characterization of the inherent hydrological memory characteristics in the shallow and deep soil water storage and a subsequent comparison of these with the estimated memory scales in the relevant atmospheric variables over the agricultural region potential natural and human induced climate changes have led to concerns about the supply of freshwater for human consumption and for effective functioning of the natural and agricultural ecosystems across the earth leathers et al 2000 these concerns are particularly relevant in the agricultural region of the province a region that regularly experiences soil moisture meteorological and hydrological droughts the availability of more than a decade observations of soil moisture soil temperature and meteorological variables from this extensive network of sensors provide a unique opportunity to obtain an insight into the physical nature of the near surface soil moisture and soil thermal regimes across this regional catchment in alberta 2 methods 2 1 study domain the study domain is the agricultural white zone region that encompasses approximately 42 of the province of alberta canada and consists of four principal regions namely the northern central southern and peace river as illustrated in fig 1 the southern and central sub regions are underlain with glacial till lacustrine deposits and some fluvial and eolian materials mostly with chernozemic soils the nature and behavior of chernozemic soils are in large part determined by the accumulation decomposition and transformation of soil organic matter within the topsoil fuller 2010 the role of native grassland vegetation and climate play an important role in determining the nature and amount of organic matter contents retained within this type of soil the peace river sub region is covered by glacial till with dominant black chernozemic soils under grassland or cultivated land and consists of the most fertile soils within the province the agricultural region spans approximately latitude 49 0 to 58 7 n and from longitude 110 to 120 w and covers a catchment area of about 259 767 km2 the terrain is characterized by a topographic relief which varies from approximately 232 to 2959 m above sea level masl the annual precipitation ranges from about 296 mm to 694 mm at the foothills of the southern region with a long term average annual precipitation of approximately 454 mm similarly the long term mean monthly temperature varies from about 20 5 to 4 8 c in january and from 11 2 to 19 5 c for the month of july with a long term mean annual temperature of 2 5 c over the entire agricultural region 2 2 soil moisture and climate dataset as indicated in the earlier section a good understanding of the province s soil water groundwater crop and climate inter relationship is key for a proactive cost effective mitigation practices for various environmental risks historically the available meteorological dataset at the provincial weather stations prior to 2002 were severely limited for use in undertaking comprehensive climatological hydrological near surface geophysical assessments as these suffer from a number of different problems associated with the acquired data integrity representativeness and sufficient record lengths however between 2002 and 2003 the province developed a pragmatic approach relating to water resources risk characterization and management to better mitigate the impacts of frequent drought outbreaks this initiative entailed the installation of 39 hydrometeorological stations as part of the established provincial wide drought risk monitoring network which is generally referred to as the agricultural drought monitoring network agdm the spatial distribution of the observation stations in this network spans the entire agricultural region of the province as presented in figs 1 and 2 all the stations were designed and equipped with the capability to monitor air temperature humidity wind speed precipitation as well as solar radiation at an hourly timescale subsequently the need for collocated soil moisture measurements and climate monitoring necessitated the installation of soil moisture and soil temperature probes at most of the observation network stations to facilitate the province s capability to meet its mandate of drought risk monitoring and reporting the installation of these latter probes provided spatially time varying snapshots of the near surface and deep moisture and temperature regime changes which have improved the province drought monitoring capabilities and will continue to play a crucial role in the various studies designed to better conceptualize and assess key land surface atmosphere interaction processes over this region this information will be used to inform agricultural production activities environmental monitoring and for the development of various mitigation plans associated with water resources risks across the province the soil moisture observations from the agdm network are acquired using the ml2x thetaprobe soil moisture sensors from delta t device ltd while the soil temperature sensors are the 107 temperature probes manufactured by campbell scientific inc the delta t thetaprobe ml2x measures volumetric soil moisture content θv by responding to changes in the apparent dielectric constant which is proportional to the soil moisture content the accuracy levels specified by the manufacturer are 0 05 m3 m3 0 to 70 c using the supplied soil calibration 0 01 m3 m3 0 to 40 c and 0 02 m3 m3 40 to 70 c after calibration to a specific soil type holzman et al 2017 soil specific calibration provides the full 2 accuracy however for general use where soil salinity is limited to 250 msm 1 delta t thetaprobe provides generic calibration coefficients for mineral soils which can lead to a 5 accuracy in volumetric moisture content for the intended goals the soil moisture measurements from the agdm network were the products of the implementation of the manufacturer s calibration for the soil moisture probes with 5 measurement accuracy the soil water storage in subsurface stores within the agricultural region undergoes freezing and thawing processes during the winter months as such a proportion of the soil water changes phase and freezes in situ during this period however some of the water that remains unfrozen is present in absorbed films around soil particles in crevices between soil particles and in pores of sufficiently small diameters spaans and baker 1996 as temperature decreases further more water in subsurface store will freeze leaving the remaining unfrozen water in progressively thinner absorbed films and smaller pores and crevices these installed frequency based soil moisture probes generally utilize high permittivity of liquid water 80 relative to the surrounding soil and air 2 9 and 1 respectively in establishing the relationships between the recorded electromagnetic signals from the soil probes and the liquid soil moisture pellet and hauck 2017 however the permittivity of liquid water is correlated with and sensitive to temperature variations and can increase from 80 at 2 c up to 88 0 c therefore this introduces an additional uncertainty in the calibration of unfrozen soil conditions consequently when the soil is in frozen state the recorded signals from the soil moisture probes and the corresponding measured soil water storage strongly decreases although the total soil moisture content remains constant therefore to minimize the effects of soil freezing and thawing processes on the magnitude of the soil moisture measurements acquired from the soil moisture probes soil moisture measurements made when the corresponding soil temperature measurements were below 0 c as recorded by the 107 soil temperature probes for the various soil depths were removed from the analyses conducted in this study as the hydrometeorological stations are planned and designed for long term monitoring a critical consideration for suitable site selection entailed the installation of the stations in isolated open areas with non changing land use and preferably covered by pastures however given that the installation of the climate stations preceded the plan for collocated observations of soil moisture and soil temperature with measurements of relevant meteorological variables not all sites were ideal for the installation of the soil moisture and soil temperature probes additional considerations for the selection of suitable sites entailed choosing locations with very low vehicular and human traffic as well as areas where the soils are undisturbed these selected locations must also be vegetated with grass or short weeds and not in proximity to external disturbances such as roads and ditches the installation of the soil moisture and soil temperature probes were completed in pits that were dug with very low disturbance to minimize impacts to the immediate surroundings of the probes and their measurements the agdm network implements a near real time quality assurance program for all the raw climate and soil observations itenfisu and wright 2006 the quality control algorithm for the hourly measurements of the soil moisture and the soil temperature detects any measurement that exceeds the expected normal ranges or thresholds as defined in the quality assurance program to ensure their validity before being included as reasonable measurements inaccurate or unreasonable readings are appropriately flagged as suspect and are further evaluated to ensure that a sensor s measurement does not wet or dry in an unrealistic manner raw soil moisture or temperature measurements are clearly identified as missing when no data is received from a specific sensor the quality assurance operational algorithm deployed for the soil moisture measurements program entails measurement range checks and validation procedure which ensures that the observed volumetric soil moisture value range between 0 and 60 as valid reading this algorithm also implements an hourly step change in observed volumetric measurement that is not greater than 10 as reasonable observation else the soil moisture value is flagged as suspect and is then subjected to additional investigation by the quality manager the volumetric soil moisture contents and the soil temperature were continuously measured at various soil depths below the ground surface and the depths of the soil moisture probe installation represents measurements for a range of soil horizons as follows 5 cm 0 10 cm 20 cm 10 30 cm 50 cm 30 70 cm and 100 cm 70 100 cm a summary of the pertinent monitoring station information as well as the data records acquired at the 39 hydrometeorological stations across this region is presented as shown in table 1 volumetric soil moisture contents measured within the soil profile was converted to the corresponding soil water storage by estimating the product of the soil moisture probes observed volumetric moisture contents and the average depth of the soil layer it represents within the soil profile there are approximately 13 years worth of available soil moisture and climate dataset acquired from most of the monitoring stations that constitute the agdm network as presented in table 1 however the fort vermilion onefour cda st albert research stations have shorter temporal records of measured dataset relative to the remaining 36 stations with the fort vermillion station holding the shortest record of measured dataset within the entire monitoring network 2 3 spatial and temporal discretization a phased approach was adopted in attempting to gain a better understanding of the spatio temporal patterns and variability in the soil moisture and climate variables measured at the 39 monitoring sites across the region the time series of the observed soil moisture profiles precipitation and air temperature at the 39 monitoring stations commencing from april 1 2006 to december 31 2017 at daily time steps were analyzed for this study measurements made at the various observation stations prior to january 2006 were eliminated from the assessments conducted as part of this study this is reasonable as this period is characterized by high proportion of missing values in the time series of the different hydrometeorological observations under consideration dataset post december 31 2017 were equally excluded as these were insufficient to conduct any defensible inter seasonal assessments over this region the daily soil moisture dataset from the alberta agdm network were temporally aggregated through averaging to generate the equivalent monthly soil moisture measurements from january 2006 to december 2017 monthly and seasonal soil water storage measurements over the study domain were generated through spatial interpolation of all the observations across the 39 stations the cressman analysis scheme cressman 1959 was implemented in the generation of 9118 gridded long term mean monthly soil moisture and precipitation dataset which spans the entire agricultural region of the province individual long term mean monthly soil moisture grid has a spatial resolution of 11 km 11 km this selected grid size is considered reasonable for this assessment to represent the heterogeneity in the soil types vegetation and topography across the region an important consideration when mapping the precipitation field relates to the effects of terrain heterogeneity in defining the spatial distribution of precipitation especially over mountainous regions this is so because terrain changes exert significant effects on the spatial patterns or increases the variability in the observed precipitation over regional or continental scale river catchments however over the watersheds in the study domain the effects of terrain variations on precipitation variability is not so pronounced especially given that this region is characterized by flat to gently sloping topography and the application of elevation correction may not result in any significant difference the temporal aggregation of the observed daily soil moisture dataset into monthly temporal scale was subsequently undertaken given that a key component of the goal of this study is to better represent the seasonal and inter annual behaviors and changes in the shallow and deep soil moisture regimes over this region the representation of the instantaneous and dynamic response of the soil moisture regime to daily or sub daily precipitation events will be investigated in future assessments over this study domain from a climatological and hydrological standpoint the watersheds in alberta experience similar influences as those of similar sized watersheds situated in other cold regions globally winter in the watersheds within the study domain represents a period during which most of the precipitation events fall as snow rather than rain and subsequent ice cover development leads to significant annual low flow rates and decreased water levels in the various river systems correspondingly the soil moisture storage infiltration and groundwater recharge rates groundwater surface interaction processes in conjunction with groundwater elevations in the unconfined aquifer system within these watersheds are affected to varying degrees by the ambient conditions during these winter months therefore based on the distinct dominant hydrological regimes characterizing these catchments over the region part of the assessments completed in this study entailed the partitioning of the time series of the measured soil moisture dataset into two temporal frames characterized as open water and ice cover seasons the open water season evaluation comprises aggregated monthly soil moisture measurements that were made from the month of april to october of each year under consideration while the corresponding ice cover season analysis entails monthly aggregated soil moisture observations acquired for the months of november to march 2 4 normalized soil moisture anomaly accurate inter comparison of soil moisture observations measured at multiple sites over regional catchments that are characterized by marked heterogeneities in soil types soil texture vegetation and available water for plants can be extremely challenging and sometimes fraught with misleading interpretation when attempting to draw conclusions as to which flanks of these watersheds are wetter or drier this is especially true given that accurate interpretation of the spatial representation of soil moisture storage under this situation requires the incorporation of the boundaries of the soil units with different water holding capacities in such an assessment hollinger and isard 1994 given that soil types and soil textures for the most part across the agricultural region are not homogeneous a reasonable approach to better capture and represent the spatial variability in the soil moisture storage at the various depths in the soil horizons across this regional catchment becomes imperative and desirable in this study the normalized monthly soil moisture anomaly nsma was computed for the 9118 continuous grids spanning the entire agricultural region this was then utilized in assessing the variability in the soil water storage as well as to undertake the inter comparison of the degree of soil wetness or dryness over the study domain the normalized monthly soil moisture anomalies are estimated employing the mathematical formulation for the computation of the standardized monthly z scores which is given as 1 nsm a x i k s m i k μ x i σ x i s m i k is the average monthly soil moisture at a specific soil depth estimated for the ith month in the kth year within a specified grid in the regional watershed while μ x i and σ x i are respectively the long term spatially integrated mean and standard deviation of the monthly soil moisture storage over the entire study domain the normalized annual z scores were equally estimated for the interpolated precipitation field over this region the underlying premise of this approach is based on the utilization of the standardized soil moisture z scores rather than the absolute values of the soil moisture measurements to explain how many standard deviations an estimated monthly soil moisture value departs from the historical soil moisture measurements over a regional watershed thus this approach enables an identification of the localized areas of excessive dryness moisture stressed areas or wetness within that watershed the computation of the normalized soil moisture anomalies utilizing a monthly timescale is considered reasonable for this study to ensure statistical robustness in the computed anomalies as well as to minimize the impacts of the presence of any missing values in the daily time series of the soil moisture measurements that were undertaken for the different soil depths 2 5 soil moisture persistence and wavelet analysis a key characteristic of the soil water storage effect is related to the memory timescale which is an approximate measure of the time needed by the soil moisture column to forget or dissipate an imposed anomaly such as that associated with a rainfall event or lack thereof ghannam et al 2016 this memory timescale is often employed as a surrogate for the persistence in the soil moisture regime within a river catchment these two terms are frequently used interchangeably to express how the effects of a short term forcing such as a storm event can persist within the soil column long after the forcing ceases the persistence is generally derived from the corresponding time lagged autocorrelation function acf and is typically on the order of a week to a few months for soil moisture measurements acquired at different depths below the ground surface within a river catchment however the magnitude of the acf is dependent on the soil properties and the meteorological or biophysical variables and generally reflects the tendency of the temporal statistics of the soil moisture to maintain a finite temporal correlation in this study a one month lag autocorrelation function was employed to estimate the persistence in the measured soil moisture storage as well as those in the observed meteorological variables over the agricultural region this estimated acf provides a single parameter measure of the memory or persistence in these hydroclimatological variable which can serve as a measure of their predictability wei et al 2006 the memory effect within a soil moisture store is manifested in the slow decay of the corresponding autocorrelation function and is often determined from the integral timescale s of the autocorrelation function priestley 1981 and is mathematically given as 2 ρ s t α s t s t α σ s 2 in eq 2 the subscript s denotes the soil moisture state variable while the prime superscript indicates the fluctuations around the mean value the α represents the lag time and the σ s 2 denotes the variance in the soil moisture the resulting soil moisture persistence may last from weeks to months which is especially remarkable in comparison with that of variables such as precipitation and temperature furthermore a continuous wavelet transform cwt terrence and compo 1998 lakshmi et al 2004 using the morlet wavelet was employed in the decomposition of the generated monthly time series of the soil moisture storage at various depths and precipitation into time and frequency domains to facilitate the detection and isolation of dominant patterns across various temporal scales the cwt allows for the detection of the location dependent amplitude and phase in the frequencies contained within the temporally soil moisture and precipitation variables being analyzed in this study in accordance with agboma and lye 2015 a wavelet transform entails a convolution integral between a real signal x t and a corresponding wavelet function ψ as expressed in eq 3 3 w β α 1 α 0 t x t ψ t β α d t in this expression w β α represents the wavelet spectrum which consists of a matrix of energy coefficients in the decomposed hydrometeorological variable at each scale α and time β ψ denotes the complex conjugate of the wavelet function t represents the time function while t is the total length of the hydrometeorological time series the magnitude of the wavelet spectrum is an indication of the degree of correlation between the wavelet and the hydroclimatological time series mwale and gan 2005 furthermore this transform enables broad features within a hydroclimatological time series to be resolved at large scales whereas fine features are captured and resolved at smaller scales si 2007 3 results and discussion shallow and deep soil moisture in subsurface storages over regional catchments tend to exhibit variability both in the temporal and spatial domains the variability in shallow and deep soil moisture over regional catchments are controlled among other factors by the effects of dynamic soil moisture processes surface topography in conjunction with the dominant vegetation cover over the watershed the tabulation of the summarized statistical metrics for the observed soil water storages in the shallow intermediate and deep moisture stores within the agricultural region is presented for the open water ow as shown in table 2 as discussed in section 2 2 the uncertainty in the daily soil moisture measurements associated with the calibration of the soil moisture probes for unfrozen soil conditions for the various soil depths when the soil temperature drops below 0 c precludes the computation of defensible soil moisture statistical metrics for the ice cover ic season similarly the derived statistical metrics for the long term monthly observations are presented as shown in table 3 as depicted in table 3 the saturation of the pore spaces in the shallow and deep subsurface stores within this region is relatively higher for the months in the ow season in comparison with those measured in november and december which are in the ic period for the 50 and 100 cm soil depths this is not unexpected especially given that the mean seasonal precipitation across this region during the ow season is evidently higher than in the ic season as indicated in the previous section most of the precipitation that are recorded in the ow season falls as rain rather than snow over this region whereas snowfall dominates the precipitation pattern in the ic season associated with the higher sub zero air temperature during this period consequently most of the precipitation during this period are stored in snowpack resulting in reduced infiltration into the vadoze zone and surface runoff over this region the long term monthly cycle of observed soil water contents and soil temperature across this region at the various measurement depths are presented as shown in fig 3 additionally the long term average monthly precipitation and air temperature are subsumed as plots in fig 3 to provide context in terms of the degree of similarities or otherwise with the observed temporal patterns of the estimated monthly soil moisture climatology over the study domain the boxplots in fig 3 represent the interquartile ranges of the mean monthly soil water storage measured at the different soil moisture measurement depths while the horizontal lines within the respective boxplots indicate the median of the monthly soil water storage potential outliers in the time series of the monthly soil water storage are marked as crosses these boxplots do not only provide an increased understanding of the temporal variations of soil water storage on a long term monthly cycle over this region but also enable an inter comparison of the drying and wetting trends as well as the differences between the soil moisture measurements made at the different soil depths as depicted in fig 3 the boxplots of the long term cycles of the soil water storage for the months of november to march are not presented for the measurements made at the 5 and 20 cm soil depths for reason earlier adduced regarding the soil thermal regime during these months of the year however the temporal length of the long term monthly estimates of the soil water storage increased progressively for the 50 and 100 cm soil depths as the number of months characterized by sub zero average soil temperature decreased the long term temporal behavior of the regional soil moisture regime is marked by pronounced patterns of wetting moisture replenishment and drying moisture declining phases as reflected in the plots for the soil water storage measurements made at the 50 and 100 cm soil depths as shown in fig 3 continuous and gradual decline in the soil moisture available within the moisture stores in the vadoze zone is apparent in the month of july through to the month of december and this period essentially constitutes the drying phase in the soil moisture climatology of the various catchments within this study domain this observed pattern of progressive decline in the soil water storage potentially extends into the ic season attributable to the lower soil thermal regime and the attendant effects of frozen soils on subsurface moisture storage conversely a wetting phase in the soil moisture store commences during a period in the ic season as evident from the progressive increase in the soil thermal regime until the month of april this latter month corresponds to the peak of the spring freshet across the watersheds in the study domain for the most part the wet phase occurs between may and july and is characterized by the highest soil water storage in the subsurface stores except for the shallowest soil moisture store 5 cm where the highest water storage peaks in april the temporal variability in soil water storage measured in the shallow and intermediate depths reflects identical temporal variability to that of the precipitation field for the different months precipitation decreases progressively from june to december and soil moisture replenishment to the subsurface storages decreases especially in the shallow 5 cm and intermediate soil moisture storages 20 cm and 50 cm soil horizons moisture depletion in the deep soil moisture store 100 cm soil horizon is relatively less pronounced during this period in comparison to those in the shallow and intermediate soil horizons the principal driving factor for this sustained moisture depletion beyond the apparent decreases in the precipitation amounts during this period can be attributed to the impacts of increased evapotranspiration rates during the summer months evapotranspiration rate increases are generally associated with increasing vegetation cover arising from increased cropping activities during the summer months in conjunction with increased land surface and air temperatures over this region however the lesser soil moisture deficits as observed in the deep soil horizon 100 cm are potentially related to the reduced impacts of evapotranspiration losses at this depth in conjunction with the buffering effects of various near surface geophysical processes these processes are principally associated with the dynamic interactions between the surface water and groundwater systems due to the presence of myriad groundwater fed wetlands sloughs and potholes as well as shallow unconfined aquifers in the quaternary formations underneath this region soil moisture measurements acquired at the 50 cm depth has the highest mean soil water storage of about 131 mm as presented in fig 3 and table 3 this highest long term mean in the soil water storage occurred in the month of may whereas the mean soil water storage in the 5 cm depth was the lowest at 24 mm which occurred in the month of august during the ow season the long term mean soil water storage are approximately 99 mm and 63 mm for the measurements made at the 100 cm and 20 cm respectively over the region the soil water storage averaged over all the measurement depths was maximum at approximately 316 mm and occurred in may while the lowest mean soil water storage occurred in november it has to be highlighted that the interpretation of the estimates of the long term soil water storage as presented above and subsequently may be influenced to varying degrees at finer spatial scales by the impacts of vegetation types over this region especially given that regional watersheds characterized by mixed plant functional types pfts may lead to different soil moisture dynamics for instance cultivated areas e g wheat typically use a summer fallow to increase soil moisture whereas permanent grassland areas will always tend to have lower or equal soil water contents compared to cropland pfts affect the dissipation of precipitation signal in soil the attenuation of microwave radiation emitted by the underlying soils and the extraction of root rooting zone soil moisture liu et al 2017 drusch et al 2001 given that all the monitoring sites for the observation of the soil moisture and soil temperature measurements are located on permanent grassland the estimated soil moisture levels trends and anomalies as presented herein are to a larger extent more representative of the soil moisture dynamics within a permanent grassland than over cultivated areas which comprise fraction of this region it is not the focus of this current study to explore the inter relationships between soil moisture dynamics and heterogeneous pfts however our alternate study is focused on characterizing and relating soil moisture dynamics over this region to different pfts under the same or different precipitation regimes to characterize the interannual variability in the regional soil moisture conditions the soil water storage deficits were derived from the temporally varying spatially interpolated soil moisture grids generated for the period commencing from 2006 to 2017 and presented as shown in fig 4 these moisture deficits were computed as departures of the monthly soil water storage values from the long term multi year mean of the soil water storage for the respective soil moisture measurements from the various soil depths the multi year mean value of the soil water storage is centered at zero on the vertical axes of the respective plots presented in fig 4 while one standard deviation above and below the multi year mean soil moisture value were computed using all soil moisture observations for the 12 year period under assessment a regression fit line is drawn through the individual soil moisture deficit plot to provide a general indication of the trajectory of the linear trend inherent in these variables the time series of the derivatives of the departures from the long term mean in the soil water storage values demonstrate considerable interannual fluctuations between high soil moisture surplus and low soil moisture deficits within the subsurface moisture stores over the agricultural region in this study a soil moisture surplus is characterized as a scenario in which the computed monthly soil water storage value is significantly higher than the estimated multi year mean in the soil water storage plus one standard deviation of all observed soil water storage values for that specific soil moisture measurement horizon conversely a soil moisture deficit corresponds to a scenario wherein the computed monthly soil water storage value is significantly lower than the computed multi year mean in the soil water storage less one standard deviation of all observed soil water storage values for that specific soil moisture measurement horizon persistent soil moisture deficits are notably apparent in 2008 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 in the time series of the soil water storage estimated for the shallow and intermediate soil moisture measurement depths similarly persistent soil moisture deficits are clearly evidenced in 2007 2009 and 2010 in the deep soil moisture storage over the region in the shallow soil moisture horizon a maximum soil moisture deficit of about 8 mm equivalent water thickness was estimated for the region and occurred in the month of september 2009 while the highest soil moisture surplus of 13 mm was computed for this horizon and occurred in the month of april 2017 in the 20 cm soil depth the highest deficit in soil water storage is 11 mm and was estimated in september 2017 and a corresponding maximum soil moisture surplus of 11 mm was computed in the month of may 2017 in the intermediate soil moisture measurement horizon which is 50 cm below the ground surface a 15 mm equivalent water height was estimated as the maximum soil moisture deficit and was determined to have occurred in november 2006 while the corresponding highest soil water storage surplus of 15 mm was observed over the region and occurred in may 2017 furthermore a maximum soil moisture deficit of 11 mm on average was estimated in april 2006 in the deep soil moisture zone over the study domain a soil moisture surplus of approximately 6 mm of equivalent water height was available in storage in the deep soil moisture store and was estimated for the month of june 2017 overall the highest degree of soil saturation or soil wetness consistently occurred in the month of april may or june of 2017 across all soil horizons under consideration whereas the months and years of the highest soil moisture deficit over this region are variable for the ow season a remarkable upward increasing trend in the soil water storage is apparent in the deep moisture store over this region and to a lesser extent relatively smaller gradient a similar upward trend is observable in the soil water storage regime in the 50 cm soil moisture measurement depth however very mild upward trends not statistically significant can be observed in the soil water storage estimated for the 5 and 20 cm depth no apparent trend is visible in the time series of the precipitation deficit as depicted by the regression fit in fig 4 the distribution of the average soil water storage as a function of depth from 2006 to 2017 over the agricultural region for the open water is presented as shown in fig 5 the observed temporal patterns of the soil water storage as a function of depth over this region exhibit strong resemblance over the different annual temporal scales the annual soil water storage peaks at about 129 mm in 2014 and was as low as 29 mm in 2009 for the open water season over this region the low soil water storage regime observed in the measurements acquired in 2009 is not unexpected as this year was characterized as a drought year on record with lower than normal annual precipitation for the entire province an apparent characteristic observed in these soil moisture measurements over these annual cycles under consideration is the consistently higher average moisture regime at the 50 cm depth over the study domain measurements made at shallower depths than the 50 cm horizon in this region exhibits lower soil water storage potentially due to the higher plant uptakes or larger evaporative losses from these surficial horizons however a regional depletion in the soil water storage was observed in the deep moisture store at horizons deeper than the 50 cm depth for the periods of investigation the cause of this depletion pattern is not immediately evident at the time of this assessment and further investigations will be required to better understand the drivers of the reduced soil water storage at this deeper zone potentially it is assumed that this pattern is reflective of decreased soil porosity with increasing depth across the region or attributable to other issues associated with the calibration of the soil moisture probes that were used in completing these long term soil moisture measurements over the study domain it needs to be highlighted and has largely been established in plethora of previous studies globally that soil water storage in subsurface stores varies dynamically with season vegetation soil type location and scale of observation and all these factors may contribute linearly or non linearly to the observed spatial and temporal patterns of soil water storage within regional scale catchments the coefficients of variation cv were estimated for the soil water storage measured at the various soil horizons over the 12 year period of continuous monitoring in the region as presented in table 2 for the ow season as well for the corresponding long term monthly cycles as presented in table 3 as depicted in fig 6 the mathematical relationship between the estimated cv and the mean soil water storage for the different soil moisture measurement depths follows an empirical power function that can be expressed as 4 cv λ ϕ α in eq 4 λ and α are model coefficients while ϕ is the monthly mean soil water storage estimated for the measurements made at the various soil depths the fitted functions for the power relationship for the various soil moisture measurement depths are captured and inset as shown in fig 6 the cv varies from about 2 5 to approximately 16 1 from the deep to the shallow soil moisture stores this is suggestive of a weak to moderate soil moisture variability across the region the higher scatter in this plot for the soil moisture measurements made at the shallower soil horizon relative to those made in the deeper soil horizon can partly be attributed to the wider range of standard deviations within the range of the mean soil water storage between 22 and 30 mm as well as between 49 and 62 mm as cv is determined by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean moisture content the spread in the standard deviation is amplified as the mean soil moisture decreases resulting in higher scattered cv values with lower soil moisture contents consequently the heterogeneity in the soil water storage in the shallow subsurface stores up to 20 cm below the ground surface is evidently higher relative to the corresponding soil moisture content in the deeper moisture storage zones as illustrated in fig 6 the cv decreases with increasing mean soil water storage across all soil moisture measurement depths in the shallow soil horizons 5 cm and 20 cm there are significantly weak relationships between the cv and mean soil moisture with the coefficients of correlation much lower than 1 however at the intermediate and deep soil moisture storage zones 50 cm and 100 cm there exist stronger relationships between the cv and the mean soil water storage across the agricultural region he spatial variability in the computed nsmas as derived from the continuous soil moisture grids developed for all the soil moisture measurements acquired from the various soil horizons within the study domain is depicted as shown in fig 7 normalized anomalies were equally generated for the precipitation field and the results are captured as shown in fig 7 f as illustrated in the various plots presented in fig 7 the yellow to red values of the nsmas are indicative of areas in this regional watershed where the estimated monthly soil water storage values are a number of standard deviation below the long term spatially integrated mean soil moisture value these areas can be characterized as moisture stressed areas within the agricultural region additionally the green to blue colored nsma values correspond to the areas in this region where the estimated monthly soil water storage values are a number of standard deviations proportionately higher than the long term spatially integrated mean soil moisture value as illustrated in these plots the spatial distribution of the positive and negative nsma values varied considerably across the region clearly indicative of significant spatial heterogeneity in the soil moisture conditions as determined from over a decade averaged soil moisture balance along the western flank of the peace region latitude 56on 57 n and longitude 119 w 118 w just upgradient of the city of grande prairie a localized area of extreme soil dryness is clearly apparent within the 5 cm and 20 cm soil moisture measurement depths fig 7a and 7b however this dominant dry soil condition moisture stressed is less pronounced in the intermediate and deep soil moisture horizons fig 7c and 7d this localized area of soil moisture deficit is approximately contained in the same area that is characterized by below normal long term average precipitation within the peace region strong negative moisture anomalies in precipitation which are as much as one standard deviation below the historical average precipitation pattern are apparent in the southern and peace regions as revealed in fig 7f however the spatial configuration of the area of extreme deficits in the soil moisture regime diminishes progressively in the eastward direction from the peace region to the northern region a few other areas of exceptional soil dryness relative to the long term mean soil moisture conditions are also noticeable in the northern central and southern sub regions of the agricultural regions latitude 56 n 50 n longitude 115 w 110 w across all the soil moisture measurement depths the spatial extent of the moisture stressed areas within the southern portion of the agricultural region especially near the city of calgary is comparatively smaller in the deep soil horizon than those estimated in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture measurement zones the observed soil moisture dynamics at various spatial scales are heavily influenced by a number of important soil properties such as the soil texture particle size distribution porosity hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics consequently the spatial distribution in the lower nsma values red or yellow bands as depicted in fig 7 may be attributed to localized areas in the agricultural region that are characterized by coarser soil textures or areas that exhibit significant heterogeneities in any of the aforementioned soil properties furthermore an autocorrelation analysis was conducted to characterize the temporal dynamics inherent in the soil water storage measured at the various soil depths over the study domain specifically the temporal autocorrelation functions were derived for the anomalies in the soil moisture storage average soil temperature as well as for the measured meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature and these are presented as shown in fig 8 the estimation of the autocorrelation functions in the time series of the various anomalies generated for these hydrometeorological variables is considered reasonable in order to prevent the correlations of the actual variable time series with their seasonal cycles evaluation of the plots in fig 8 reveals that the persistence in the meteorological variables dissipate after a few weeks less than 4 months whereas the soil water storage anomaly in the shallow soil moisture store is characterized by the shortest memory relative to all the other hydrometeorological variables under consideration moreover the temporal response of the soil moisture anomaly in the 20 cm soil depth to various hydrometeorological processes reveals a characteristic curve that resembles that of the soil moisture measurements acquired in the 50 cm soil horizon as depicted in this figure the estimated memory for the anomaly in the soil water storage at the 20 cm soil depth is approximately equal to those estimated for the meteorological variables the anomaly in the soil water storage acquired derived from the soil moisture measurements made at the 50 cm soil depth is comparatively longer than those of the two uppermost layers as well as those estimated for the meteorological variables nevertheless these patterns of temporal responses in the time series of these anomalies support the conclusion relating to the dominance of the inherent short memory features within these variables over canadian prairies regional catchments in accordance with an earlier study by agboma and lye 2015 however the anomalies in the deep soil moisture storage reveals the longest persistence approximately 39 5 months in comparison to those of the shallow and intermediate soil moisture storages as well as those computed for the meteorological variables measured over the agricultural region this long memory feature in the deep soil moisture storage has important implication for characterizing the severity of recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and in other canadian prairie regional catchments the palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 has been widely explored and applied for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and severity of drought outbreaks and remains one of the most popular indices that is based on a catchment s water budget method as formulated the computation of the pdsi simply utilizes future precipitation and temperature dataset a so called look ahead procedure that is restrictive in its usefulness in the prediction of extreme temperature over a region huang et al 1996 consequently as drought outbreaks in alberta are usually multi year dry spell phenomena and in light of the limited short memory timescales inherent in the atmospheric variables precipitation and temperature as computed over this region drought indices that can leverage the deep soil moisture information with its longer memory timescale would be expected to provide better measures for characterizing drought severity and impacts over the watersheds within this study domain the continuous wavelet transform cwt of the estimated anomalies in the soil water storage across all the soil moisture measurement depths 5 20 50 and 100 cm are respectively presented as shown in fig 9 a d furthermore the cwt of the anomalies in the integrated soil water storage i e average soil moisture measurements acquired between 0 and 100 cm depths meteorological variables precipitation and air temperature in conjunction with the anomalies in the average soil temperature over the agricultural region are depicted respectively in fig 9 f h the computation of the cwt of the anomalies for the eight hydrometeorological variables under consideration in this study utilized dataset commencing from 2006 to 2017 that were acquired over the study domain as depicted in fig 9 the vertical axis in these spectral plots represents the fourier periods which are specified in monthly timescale while the horizontal axis represents the temporal length in annual time steps the legend represents the various wavelet power levels in each spectral plot additionally the legend color code for the continuous wavelet power spectrum ranges from dark blue which signifies periodicities with low power values to dark red representing periodicities with high values the solid black lines within these spectral plots indicate periodicities with 5 significance level in accordance with torrence and compo 1998 the mathematical formulation underpinning the cwt assumes that the dataset being analyzed exhibits a cyclic temporal pattern hence there are some errors at the beginning and at the end of the continuous wavelet power spectrum principally associated with and influenced by edge effects consequently the cone of influence coi depicted in the respective plots provided in fig 9 represents regions in the respective spectral plots influenced by edge effects hence the information captured within those regions outside the coi can be neglected as they remain largely unreliable as revealed in the wavelet power spectral plots in fig 9 a c there are two dominant periodicities that are apparent in the computed anomalies of the soil water storage measured in the shallow and intermediate soil horizons across this region this dominant feature is visibly apparent in the 9 month and 6 month temporal scales and represent the seasonal ow and sub seasonal cycles inherent in these variables for the period investigated over the agricultural region the computation of the cwt not presented in this study for the soil water storage acquired from the shallow and intermediate soil depths utilizing the complete observations in the year rather than those observed specifically in the ow season revealed periodicities are dominant in the 12 month and sub seasonal temporal scales however the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store reveal frequency features that are dominant at a seasonal cycle 9 month as well as at 32 month cycle this latter low frequency feature does not appear to be dominant over the complete period of assessment conducted for this study as it slightly tapers off somewhat prior to 2015 moreover this low frequency feature inherent in the anomalies in the deep soil moisture are evidently absent in the anomalies derived from the measurements made in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture stores these storage effects particularly within the root zone tend to last for several weeks and are perceived as a principal modulator of short term atmospheric anomalies and driver of longer term seasonal forecasts of overland atmospheric states e g summer rainfall droughts and floods ghannam et al 2016 as expected the wavelet power spectral plots for the meteorological and soil temperature variables are characterized by a 9 month periodicity that clearly represents the seasonal cycles ow period inherent in these variables and are consistently dominant across the period of assessment being investigated as illustrated in fig 9 f h 4 conclusions soil moisture dynamics both in the spatial and temporal scales has critical implications for agricultural water management especially under semi arid climate conditions that are typical of the catchments in southern alberta canada this study has addressed the spatio temporal variability in the soil water storage measured at various soil depths 5 20 50 and 100 cm below the ground surface over a 12 year period across the agricultural region of the province it was demonstrated in this study that the soil moisture measurements acquired at the 50 cm soil depth exhibits the highest long term average soil water storage whereas the long term mean soil water storage in the shallowest soil moisture store was the lowest over the study domain this study revealed that the heterogeneity in the observed soil water storage in the shallower soil horizon up 20 cm below the ground surface is evidently higher relative to that of the soil water stored in the deeper soil horizon this study has further demonstrated through leveraging the continuous wavelet power spectrum and temporal autocorrelation function analyses that the moisture anomalies in the deep soil moisture storage exhibit the longest persistence characteristics or memory effects relative to those inherent in the shallow and intermediate soil moisture stores as well as those in the meteorological variables across the study domain moreover the anomalies computed for the soil moisture measurements undertaken in the deep soil moisture store reveal frequency features that are dominant at intra and inter annual temporal scales with a periodicity as much as a 32 month cycle this low frequency feature as established is evidently non existent in the soil water storage measured in the shallower soil horizons nor in the meteorological variables that were evaluated furthermore the assessments completed in this study revealed that the low frequency feature in the soil water storage wavelet spectra increases with increasing soil depth across the study domain indicating that at deeper soil depths the largest variances are shifted to lower frequencies this estimated long memory in the deep soil moisture store will be relevant and critical for improvements in the seasonal forecast skill of soil moisture regimes and streamflow especially with respect to soil moisture initialization in land surface schemes developed over this region finally this observed dominant low frequency feature in the deep soil moisture store could have important implications for characterizing the development of temperature extremes as well as for the evaluation of the severity of the recurrent drought outbreaks over regional watersheds in alberta and potentially for other canadian prairie catchments the results with respect to soil moisture levels trends and anomalies as presented in this study are more reflective of the seasonal and inter annual soil water storage dynamics in a permanent grassland than cultivated cropland areas given that most of the monitoring sites for the observations of soil moisture and soil temperature are located on permanent grasslands

study the performances of the various types of ai models viz ann gp gep anfis svm ibl abc rept tlbo decision tree and hybrid models viz wavelet ai gp ai are investigated as a means of prediction of sediment patterns in rivers published between 2001 and 2019 the 66 papers comprising the study deal with the usage of ai models in estimate of sediment and are undertaken in terms of data selection modeling approaches prediction time step and modeling performance evaluation this study presents an overview of ai techniques and a discussion of advantages to and applications of modeling sediment relations which to some extent have replaced time consuming conventional mathematical techniques however the study discusses major challenges and prospective research opportunities comparison of the results produced by the models indicated an improvement in the prediction accuracy through the use of hybrid models the most prominent feature of hybrid models is that they can provide more precise predictions for extremely high or low values due to the utilization of the distributed information processing system and the non linear transform involved in the most recent articles in competition with wavelets an iterative procedure namely hht introduced as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory like features at different time scales a review of published articles on sediment modeling showed the emergence of wavelet based methods since 2008 no wavelet ai based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far this subject was not investigated by any study in 2009 between 2010 and 2019 12 papers explored the use of a number of wavelet ai based methods about 19 percent 13 papers of the studies used hybrid wavelet models among the articles studied of all the papers only 6 papers investigated the performance of the models for the detection of hysteresis phenomenon this study showed that ai models could be successfully employed to simulate the complex river sediment process in situations where explicit knowledge of internal sub process is not required this study also presents several new thinking in the related field of research to develop innovative methods and improve the quality of modeling future research efforts should be focused on formulating guidelines that help to develop ai based models keywords artificial intelligence ensemble learning

algorithm 1 introduction the modeling and prediction of river sediment are essential in water recourses management and environmental engineering a large number of ambiguous parameters such as spatial variability of basin characteristics and river discharge patterns erosion and sediment load transported in watersheds and rivers led to the most complex hydrological and environmental phenomenon the magnitude and concentration of sediment are mainly affected by precipitation intensity and volume physical and topographical properties of soil texture and detachability and land cover vegetation the soil erosion process involves detachment of soil particles sediment transport by the raindrop impact and the shearing force of flowing water and deposition the quantity and size of sediments transported increase with the velocity and transport capacity of the overland flow while a decrease in transport capacity due to variation of rainfall soil properties slope and vegetation results in the deposition of eroded sediments thomas et al 2018 estimation of sediment has been approached through empirical relationships numerical simulations physically process based models mathematical models are also commonly handled for this object verstraeten and poesen 2001 ward et al 2009 however these techniques usually need a set of data and a long response time the non linear relationship between various physical variables geomorphologic properties of river basins and the sedimentation process has been major problem inaccurate prediction sediment in order to reduce the complexities of the problem in terms of developing practical techniques that do not require well on algorithm and theory in this regard classical time series models such as sediment rating curve src multi linear regression mlr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima have been widely used for sediment modeling such models are unable to estimate sediment under extreme hyper concentrated conditions this is mostly due to the fact that these are basically linear models assuming that data are stationary and have a limited ability to capture noise in sediment data the last decade application of artificial intelligence ai models to water resources and environmental problems have grown therefore ai methods are currently being used for the modeling of non linear hydrological processes like sediment in this review some very commonly used ai based methods for prediction and forecasting sediment are studied these methods include artificial neural networks ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm classification and regression tree cart instance based learning ibl artificial bee colony abc teaching learning based optimization tlbo genetic programming gp and gene expression programming gep as single ai based models despite the flexibility of ai based methods in modeling sediment a lack of input data preprocessing may not allow ai models to adequately employment non stationary data which vary over a wide scale of frequencies from hourly to multi decadal therefore hybrid models which combine data pre processing forms with ai methods can be helpful the hybrid models in this paper include wann wnf and new models included reduced error pruning tree rept bagging m5p random committee rept random subspace rept in order to develop new methods to improve prediction accuracy it needs researchers to know what other scientists have done in the field recently several review papers were published that discussed various fields of hydrological and water resources using ai models in hydrology maier and dandy 2000 and maier et al 2010 reviewed some advantages of ann for the prediction and forecasting of water resources variables govindaraju and rao 2000 evaluated review papers with title of ann in hydrology nourani et al 2014 reviewed and discussed several wavelet ai papers in sediment modeling 9 papers afan et al 2016 in their review paper focused on application of ai models include ann svm anfis ec and coupled ai models in sediment prediction although this review implementation surveyed ai based approaches no reviews focused on precise statistics and percentages of details related to sediment modeling these researchers in their review paper on methods used in improving ann for back propagation suggested that work should continue on the development and evaluation of new evolutionary algorithms eas that have the ability to search for global minima or maxima numerous high potential algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso ant colony optimization aco artificial bee colony algorithm abc ant lion optimizer alo bacterial colony optimization bco and gravitational search algorithm gsa are available although their efficiency in a sediment related modelling type is yet to be asserted with confidence the absence of review papers investigating the parallel implementation of the theory of ai models in sediment modeling resulted in the collective writing of the current review paper an updating analysis of combined ai and river sediment applications the main objective of this paper is to summarize and review the present researches and applications of ai based models in sediment estimation and try to give our opinions about the possible future researches on the method approximately two decades are spent applying artificial intelligence in hydrology especially sediment similar to the work of rajaee et al 2018 who conducted a comprehensive review of 67 groundwater journal articles in this research authors explain the several of ai based algorithm and to review the successes or failures of published applications with main emphasis on sediment and related concepts therefore this review has been divided into several sections a brief overview of various single soft computing techniques viz ann ga anfis and svm for sediment modeling is given in section 2 for each method three sub sections including a brief explanation of the principles of the methodology bibliographic review and results are considered section 3 provides brief descriptions and bibliographic reviews of a various hybrid soft computing techniques for sediment modeling other sediment related analyzes such as peak estimation and hysteresis modeling are given in section 4 the general results of the literature review have been briefly dealt with in section 5 in this section the steps that should be followed in the development of ai based models are described these include the select of evaluation criteria the division data the determination of appropriate model inputs distribution of published articles worldwide study areas time step selection the determination of appropriate variables lead time unit of measure sediment type of basins data division and data size set a summary and suggestions for future research are presented in the last two sections 6 and 7 of the paper the review restricts itself to papers published in international journals until the mid of 2019 sixty six papers on the subject of ai based models for sediment issues have been investigated however conference proceedings are not included in this review the present sources isi papers consulted were drawn from the thomson reuters scientific database 2 various single soft computing techniques for sediment modeling 2 1 artificial neural networks ann models 2 1 1 introductory ann a massively parallel distributed information processing system is based on concepts derived from research on the nature of human brains muller et al 1995 a common three layered feed forward neural network ffnn comprised multiple elements called nodes and connection pathways that link them haykin 1999 the sigmoid and tansig schmitz et al 2006 functions are applied as activation functions in hidden and output layer nodes to make ann model more effective an ann is based on a set of connected units called synthetic neurons normally the neurons are organized in layers signals travel from the first layer input layer to the last layer outlay layer and may run some layers several times in the hidden and output layers the net input to unit i is 1 y i j 1 p w i j x j θ i where wji w1 w2 wpi is the weight vector of unit i and p is the number of neurons in the above layer of unit i xi is the output from unit j and θi is the bias of unit i this weighted sum yi which is called the incoming signal of unit i is then passed through a transfer function a recommended literature for the ann approach could be masters 1993 algorithms such as conjugate gradient quasi newton and levenberg marquardt lm are faster algorithms that all of them can use of standard numerical optimization methods rajaee et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2013 there is a group of algorithms according to newton s method need no calculation of second derivatives such methods are known as quasi newton methods which have had a successful performance in conducted researches which was designed by broyden fletcher goldfarb and shanno bfgs bfgs algorithm requires much more computation in each repetition and also higher storage than the conjugate gradient cg methods although it is less convergent in the lower number of iterations nazareth 1977 has pointed out a close relationship that exists between the search directions defined by the cg minimization algorithm and the bfgs form of quasi newton algorithm qin 2007 showed that cg is the best choice for well conditioned problems because of its low memory requirement on large highly ill conditioned problems bfgs may be our only choice nevertheless on moderately ill conditioned problems with moderate sizes we may be able to take advantage of the limited memory algorithms depending on the amount of storage we have available in conducted study by apostolopoulou et al 2009 more details are provided they present a new curvilinear algorithmic model for training neural networks based on a memory less bfgs method that incorporates a curvilinear search this model exploits the no convexity of the surface error based on the information provided by the eigen system of memory less bfgs matrices using a pair of directions a memory less quasi newton direction and a negative curvature direction this model significantly improves the efficiency of the training process 2 1 1 1 generalized regression neural networks grnn models the grnn architecture specht 1991 subsumes the radial basis neural networks method this model is based on nonlinear regression theory for function estimation a grnn model consists of four layers an input layer a pattern layer a summation layer and an output layer the first layer is completely connected to the pattern layer where each unit represents a training pattern and its output is the distance from the input stored in the patterns the grnn method does not require an iterative training procedure for the multilayer perceptron mlp method this method is used for estimation of continuous variables as in standard regression techniques specht 1991 in the paper by ai daoud 2009 a comparison between grnn lm and lvq learning vector quantization models is done they stated that the main difficulty of grnn is that similar to kernel methods in general they suffer seriously from the curse of dimensionality grnn cannot ignore inessential inputs without major corrections to the basic algorithm lvq suffers the so called prototype under utilization problem i e only the winner is updated for each input and due to adopting euclidean distance measure lvq can cause bad proficiency when the data is non spherical distribution and especially includes noises or outliers the obtained result of this paper showed that the grnn outperform the other models 2 1 1 2 radial basis function rbf models rbf is an ann that uses radial base functions as an activity function the output of this network is a linear combination of radial base functions for input parameters and neurons the interpretation of the rbf method as an ann consists of three layers a layer of input neurons feeding the feature vectors into the network a hidden layer of rbf neurons calculating the outcome of the basic functions and a layer of output neurons calculating a linear combination of the basic functions taurino et al 2003 this network calculates a general approximation of the function using the sum of local approximations poggio and girosi 1990 lee et al 2003 2 1 1 3 neural differential evolution nde models nde models are improved by combining two methods neural networks and differential evolution the differential evolution algorithm can be classified as a floating point evolutionary optimization algorithm storn and price 1995 in the present study the differential evolution algorithm was used to obtain optimal parameters weights of the ann model the differential evolution algorithm can be classified as a floating point evolutionary optimization algorithm storn and price 1995 2 1 1 4 emotional artificial neural networks eann eann is based on standard anns jain 2001 improved by the features of a simulated hormonal neuromodulator system the artificial hormonal glands release a variety of digital hormones describing in a biological brain all types of neuromodulators such digital hormones affect the actions of the individual nodes representing the individual cells within a biological neural system including the synapses the functions that sum up the node s inputs and the output function analogous to the function of the neural cell s axon hill in addition the neural network regulates the hormone glands each cell within the network mentioned can emit hormones transforming each node in the network into a potential hormone gland hormonal receptors are modeled for each part of the virtual cell to allow a virtual cell to respond to a given hormonal level these hormonal receptors in the biological neuron membrane are similar to surface hormonal receptors the main difference between an ann and an eann nodes is that eann not only maps information from an input to an output level but also elements of a feedback system that alter the cells behavior based on dynamic hormone levels the ann s out function differs from the eann equivalent called hill function because the latter is heavily influenced during runtime by hormones but the former is usually stable during runtime more details can be found in khashman 2008 about eann s bp based training 2 1 2 bibliographic review ann approach has been used frequently as a tool of computation in different fields this section investigated papers that only emphasize the ann as the best ai based models in a preliminary study jain 2001 used the ann model to make an integrated stage discharge sediment concentration relation for each combination the number of nodes in the hidden layer with the best sediment estimation was determined the output layer had two neurons one for discharge and the other for sediment concentration after the trials the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 2 and 10 simulation results showed that the three layer feed forward ann with sigmoid transfer function model provided the most accurate predictions in comparison to the src model also cigizoglu 2004 compared ann and mlr in modeling sediment transfer he used ffnn with three hidden layers mlp with lm into bp algorithm learning rule and tansig transfer function the results of this comparison demonstrate that the ann model is able to exceed the limitations of traditional mlr the potential to create multiple solutions at different levels of generalization as well as robust solutions that can be transferred to unknown catchment types is illustrated kisi 2004 used three different ann techniques namely the mlp grnn and rbf for daily ssc the mlp model was trained using the lm algorithm the results indicated rbf and grnn models may efficiency better sediment load estimates than the mlp model based on the comparisons it was found that the mlp gives better ssc estimates than the other neural network techniques in maximum peak estimation rbf method gave a much better estimate than the other techniques cigizoglu and kisi 2006 developed a rdnn model for better ann performance in tss estimation the result showed that rdnn was found to be superior to conventional ann applications where only a single network is trained considering the entire training data set tayfur and guldal 2006 also predicted tss using precipitation they used a three layer ffnn using the back propagation algorithm for training in all the ann models the constructed network employed a single hidden layer and the sigmoid activation function the results of the investigation revealed that the ffnn significantly better performance than the non linear black box model based upon two dimensional unit sediment graph theory 2d usgt alp and cigizoglu 2007 examined two ann algorithm consist of ffbp and rbf in the estimation of ssl the performance of these models compared with the mlr model for ann modeling lm optimization technique three layer learning networks and tansig for transfer function were employed the number of nodes in hidden layers was determined by the trial error process ardiclioglu et al 2007 compared two different ffbp algorithms in suspended sediment prediction the ffbpnn model was trained using the lm and gradient descent gd optimization algorithms the sigmoid function was used for the activation function of the hidden and output nodes the result indicated the lm algorithm gave better performance than the gd algorithm kisi and cigizoglu 2007 applied a fuzzy model and three different ann models namely ffbp grnn and rbfnn to estimate ssl in rivers in the modeling process it was seemed the ffbp model had some drawbacks such a local minima problem and negative flow generation the constant spreads that give the minimum mse and conveniently hidden layer node numbers were simply found by trial and error results of the study revealed that the rbf is better than the other two ann methods zhu et al 2007 used an ann model for simulating the suspended sediment flux in this model suspended sediment flux was related to the temperature average rainfall rainfall intensity and flow discharge in this study authors used the mlp consisted of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and a logistic sigmoid function chosen as the transformation function the number of neurons in the hidden layers was determined by a trial and error method the networks were trained with a bp algorithm bp training involves information processing in two directions the feed forward of the input information and the back propagation of the error simulation results indicated that the ann model is capable of high accuracy concerning suitable variables and their correlation to the previous month sediment melesse et al 2011 examined the accuracy of mlp neural network consisted of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer with ffbp algorithm and a sigmoid logistic non linear function in the estimation of suspended sediment time series in this study authors have used two temporal resolutions daily and weekly result indicated performance of daily simulation is better than weekly resolution as well as according to obtained result precipitation wasn t a significant parameter and doesn t play an important role in sediment prediction bayram et al 2012 applied regression analysis and ann with three layer perceptron mlp with ffbp optimization algorithm to predict ssc based on in situ turbidity measurements a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tansig as the first transfer function and a linear as the second transfer function are used within the network also nourani et al 2012 investigated two ann based models integrated and geomorphology based models for estimation of ssl for both models a three layer ffbp network trained with lm optimization algorithm was selected the tansig function was used as an activation function in this study the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the ann model was determined after trying various network structures via trial and error process simulation results showed that the both models provided the high accurate predictions in src model result indicated the geomorphological ann model provided better performance than an integrated model because it uses spatially variable factors of the sub basins as the model s inputs also heng and suetsugi 2013 and makarynskyy et al 2015 used ann with sigmoid transfer function in hidden layer for sediment simulation and prediction they concluded that the neural network model has provided satisfactory performance abdulmohsin afan et al 2014 used ann by ffnn and rbf algorithms to predict daily ssl result indicated ffnn is accurate for sediment estimation ramezani et al 2014 different sba models such as ga pso and ica to optimize weighting in ann algorithm and estimate ssl in this research ff ica was best model demirci and uneş 2015 proposed a neural network approach by ffbp algorithm to predict ssc from stream flow including the mean water temperature daily real time flow rate and ssc with time lags a comparison was performed between ann src and mlr models based on comparison of the results it is found that the ann model gives better estimates than the src and mlr techniques chen and chau 2016 developed a novel ann model based on hybrid of double feed forward hdfnn by combining fuzzy pattern recognition and continuity equation for ssl prediction this model was compared with mfnn dpfnn and hfnn models in mfnn model used a network with three layer and sigmoid function for activation function result indicated hdfnn is accurate for sediment estimation bisoyi et al 2018 and khan et al 2018 evaluated the bpnn model to predict ssl the results showed that the proposed model with adequate training can predict daily sediment load accurately even in large basins with a nonlinear relationship between different hydrological variables 2 1 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section reveals the following fig 1 presented number of times various ann model architectures were used in published papers as can be seen from this figure ffbp were the most common ann architecture to be used in the 71 ann method development processes examined using only 50 ffbp among the algorithms proposed for ann the feed forward mlp algorithms were often used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of alternative ann architectures i in the majority of papers the input variables and number of lags were chosen using correlation analysis and sigmoid function was used as neuron transfer function in other papers the number of lags was chosen arbitrarily ii comparison of the results indicated that anns capture the complex non linear behavior of the sediment series relatively better than the classic models iii in the number of papers details of the optimum network geometry were not adequately discussed in a number of papers iv networks with one hidden layer were used in the majority of case studies although networks with two hidden layers were used well v in ann modeling two points are of importance and deserver more attention firstly the ann architecture and secondly the training iteration number epoch in which an appropriate selection can progress the model efficiency in both steps of training and testing in addition it prevents the ann model to be over trained vi in ann models determining the number of neurons in input and hidden layers for reaching the best training results is major point in all the studied the hidden layer node numbers of each model were determined after trying various network structures through a trial and error process since there is no theory yet to tell how many hidden units are needed to approximate a given function 2 2 genetic algorithms ga models 2 2 1 introductory gp is a generalization of gas starts with an initial population of randomly generated computer programs composed of functions and terminals appropriate to the problem domain goldberg 1989 gp is very similar to ga being an evolutionary algorithm based on darwinian theories of natural selection and survival of the fittest however gp operates on parse trees rather than on bit strings as in a ga to approximate the equation in a symbolic form that best describes how the output relates to the input variables the algorithm considers an initial population of randomly generated programs equations derived from the random combination of input variables random numbers and functions which include arithmetic operators plus minus multiply divide mathematical functions sin cos exp log logical comparison functions or and etc which has to be appropriately chosen based on some understanding of the process and the fitness a measure of how well the problem is solved of the evolved programs are evaluated individual programs that best fit the data are then selected from the initial population the main operators used in the evolutionary algorithm such as gp are crossover and mutation besides some control parameters that need to be set are population size a maximum number of generations and the function set gp has been implemented using disciplus tool and gene xpro program was used for modeling sediment for gep rajaee jafari 2018 generally gp solves any problem through five steps i generation of an initial population computer programs randomly by the functions and terminals of the problem ii execution of each program with certain fitness value iii creation of a new population of computer programs based on reproduction mutation and crossover operators iv comparison of new fitness values and v selection of the best computer program evolutionary process 2 2 2 bibliographic review gp can be successfully applied to areas i where the interrelationships among the relevant variables are poorly understood or where it is suspected that the current understanding may well be wrong ii finding the size and shape of the final solution is hard iii conventional mathematical analysis does not or cannot supply analytical solutions iv an approximate solution is acceptable or is the only result that is ever likely to be obtained v small improvements in performance are routinely measured or easily measurable vi there is a large amount of data in computer readable form that needs examination classification and integration banzhaf et al 1998 babovic 2000 employed experimental flume data utilized by zyserman and fredsoe 1994 and expressed a new formulation for bed concentration of suspended sediment aytek and kisi 2008 in their study proposed gp as a new approach for the expressed formulation of suspended sediment discharge relationship they compared expressed models obtained using the gp with src and mlr methods in ssl prediction altunkaynak 2009 applied ga model for suspended sediment concentration estimation in this study to consider the uncertainties without any basic assumptions such as linearity normality and homoscedasticity authors preferred to employ gas for the prediction of sediment load from discharge data one of the advantages of gas is its ability to generate more than one optimum solution points on the other hand rm with the limiting assumptions can only estimate one solution point in this study genetic curve predictions were compared to rm results another reason why the gas approach should be preferred is the independency of ga from restrictive assumptions it is shown that especially for the peak values gas predictions are better than rm ga provided better results than rm for the estimation of 365 days data set kisi and guven 2010 developed a machine code based gp for ssc forecasting the obtained result of the gp was compared with those of the adaptive nf ann and rating curve models the daily stream flow and ssc data from two stations were used for the modeling the comparison results showed that the gp model performed better than the nf ann and rating curve models 2 2 3 result the following offers a critical evaluation of the various papers examined for the present investigation vii it was observed that there is paucity in the literature regarding the use of gp in the field of water resources engineering in the other hand the application of gp technique to estimate the river sediment is relatively new compared to ann nevertheless gp s success indicates an increased interest in estimating the sediment by following this technique viii gp is capable of detecting the subtle non linear effect superimposed over the linear behavior ix in some studied the results obtained with gp models are better than those obtained using the src mlr and ann models x the fundamental difference between gas gp and gep is due to the nature of the individuals in gas the individuals are linear strings of fixed length chromosomes in gp the individuals are nonlinear existence of various sizes and shapes and in gep the individuals are encoded as linear strings of fixed length which are subsequently expressed as nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes xi the gp model is explicit and simple user friendly xii gp through its stochastic search ability can be harnessed for calibration of these sediment models 2 3 adaptive nero fuzzy inference system anfis models 2 3 1 introductory the fuzzy inference system fis is an ai approach that has been employed in the estimation of uncertainties in real situations each fuzzy system contains three main parts fuzzifier fuzzy database and defuzzifier the fuzzy database contains two main parts fuzzy rule base and inference engine neuro fuzzy simulation refers to the algorithm of applying different learning techniques produced in the neural network literature to fuzzy modeling or a fis brown and harris 1994 mamdani s approach uses fuzzy mfs whereas sugeno s approach uses linear or constant functions more details on the anfis model can be found in jang 1993 2 3 2 bibliographic review there are a few papers in the literature about the using of anfis algorithms to estimate sediment tayfur et al 2003 presented a fuzzy logic method using the rainfall intensity and slope data to predict sediment loads from bare soil surfaces result demonstrated that the fuzzy technique performed better under very high rainfall intensities over different slopes as well as over very steep slopes under various rainfall intensities kisi 2005 employed nf and ann approaches for estimating ssls for nf modeling triangular membership functions were used for practical applications the author concluded two or three membership functions to the nf models were found enough for modeling ssl the final architectures for the nf and ann models were found after many trials the node number in the hidden layer was found to change between 1 and 2 the nf and ann models perform better than the mlr and src kisi et al 2006 proposed a fuzzy logic approach to predict ssc from stream flow for this purpose input and output variables i e flow and ssc were divided into eight categories and eight triangular membership functions with equal base widths were assigned this model was calibrated by changing the shapes of the membership functions by help of the fuzzy editor in order to decrease the mrse value the result of fuzzy models compared to src model the results obtained with fuzzy model were better than src model lohani et al 2007 employed a fuzzy and ann model to simulate the stage discharge sediment concentration relationship in two gauging stations in the narmada basin in india in the trial and error process the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 2 and 10 after many trials the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network was finalized and they vary from 4 to 6 for fuzzy modeling the optimum model structure was determined after trials in the trials the cluster radius of the subtractive clustering algorithm was varied between 0 1 and 1 with steps of 0 02 each fuzzy model has a different number of rules between 4 and 7 for every input vector a membership degree to each fuzzy set greater than 0 is computed from the gaussian membership function therefore all the rules fire simultaneously for each combination of inputs and a crisp output value is thus provided for a given input data vector using equation results of the study illustrated that the fuzzy approach was capable of providing much better results than the ann and src model kisi et al 2008 studied the accuracy of a nf model in comparison to other data driven models such as rbnn ffnn and grnn for monthly ssc estimation in turkey the results illustrated that the nf method provided better performance than other methods kisi 2009 also proposed evolutionary fuzzy models for ssc estimation the triangular membership functions with equal base widths were selected for each evolutionary fuzzy model efm then the parameters of membership functions were found using de algorithm finally the efm models were tested and the results were compared with those of the nf ann and src models obtained from the previous study kisi 2005 kisi et al 2009 studied nf technique in comparison of ann and src models in ann modeling used both of logarithm sigmoid and linear activation function for hidden and output layer the results showed that the nf model can acceptably ssc estimate in rajaee et al 2009 studied nf ann mlr and src models were utilized in daily the models were trained using daily river discharge and ssc they applied ffnn with bp optimization algorithm and used tansig and purelin functions as transfer functions in the hidden and output layers comparison of the models results illustrated that the ann model is more accurate than the mlr and src models and nf model was more accuracy than ann furthermore the results showed that the nf and ann model can acceptably estimate cumulative cobaner et al 2009 using nf and ann models to estimate ssl by using hydro meteorological data the comparison results indicated the nf model was more accurate than other models for the particular data sets ulke et al 2009 employed ann nf src mlr and mnlr methods for sediment prediction result showed ann using conjugate gradient optimization method has the best performance among the other models vafakhah 2013 applied ann anfis cokriging ck and ordinary kriging ok models using rainfall and stream flow data for ssl forecasting comparison results showed that the anfis model provided better estimation than the other models sirabahenda et al 2017 developed anfis algorithm for prediction of ssc they used other hydrological parameters such as precipitation surface runoff stream flow and vulnerability index in inputs of different models buyukyildiz kumcu 2017 evaluated performance of svm anfis ann models to predict the ssl in this study obtained results of svm model were the best kaveh et al 2017 compared efficiency of anfis model that uses levenberg marquardt learning algorithm for training with similar networks trained with the common hybrid and bp algorithms obtained results showed that models trained with the hybrid and lm algorithms are accurate than similar networks trained with bp algorithm 2 3 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section demonstrates the following the main advantages of using nf method are their flexibility and ability to model nonlinear relationships and considering fuzzy nature of the real world system i it seems the nf and ann models to be more adequate than the src and mlr for the process of establishing a rating relationship between sediment and stream flow the results suggested that anfis has found solutions faster than alternative types of anns approaches and is the most accurate and reliable tool for processing non linear and non parametric large volumes of data ii nf emulation of human reasoning and decision making ability can be exploited for modeling problems governed by inexact vague and imprecise information therefore models based on the fuzzy theory lead to more reliable results than other ai models 2 4 support vector machine svm models 2 4 1 introductory mathematically support vector machine is placed in classification and regression algorithms range which is formulated using the principals of statistical learning theory by vapnik 1995 these models first were used for water resource management by sivapragasam et al 2001 dibike et al 2001 and its new models are called reference vector machines used by han et al 2002 svm implements a learning algorithm useful for recognizing subtle patterns in complex data sets vapnik and cortes 1995 svm is a learning system applied a high dimensional feature space instead of minimizing the observed training error support vector regression svr minimized the generalization error bound so as to obtain generalized performance there are two main categories for support vector machines support vector classification svc and svr the svr model is the most popular use form of svms support vector machines project the data into a higher dimensional space and maximize the margins between classes or minimize the error margin for regression cigizoglu 2003 one of the goals in svr is to find a function f x that has at most deviation from the actually obtained targets yi for all the training data support vector regression is the natural extension of large margin kernel methods cigizoglu and kisi 2005 used for classification to regression analysis the main relationship for statistical learning process is as follows rajaee and shahabi 2016 kakaei et al 2013 2 y f x i 1 m w i ϕ i x w ϕ x where the output of the model is the part of linear m and the converter is shown by the nonlinear model of

of learning patterns and xi data vector for network learning and x is an independent vector the parameters of the model are determined by maximizing the objective of function 2 4 2 bibliographic review cimen 2008 used svm with gaussian rbf kernel in order to predict ssc for two rivers located in the usa results indicated that svm model can estimate sediment without producing negative values kisi 2012 examined least square support vector machine lssvm to estimate discharge ssc relationship results showed that the lssvm model is capable to produce better accurate than the ann models lssvm and ann models were accurate than the src model for the upstream station for the downstream station however src model perform better than the lssvm and ann models as well as performance of the models were compared to each other in prediction of downstream ssl data using data from both stations results showed that lssvm model is more efficient than the ann models and both models performed much better than the src model kakaei lafdani et al 2013 applied the nu svr using the four kernels including linear polynomial sigmoid and rbf and ann models based on bfgs algorithm and conjugate algorithm the reliability of all models were evaluated using performance criteria such as root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae efficiency index and correlation coefficient result showed that ann models and nu svr model has better performance than regression combination rashidi et al 2016 investigated gamma test gt for pre processing of input variables on performance of svm with two kernels rbf and polynomial in order to predict ssl the result of these models compared to anfis model result indicated gt method had suitable ability in identifying an optimal combination of input parameters in this direction zounemat kermani et al 2016 evaluated the ability of different data driven models including four different support vector regression svr model kernels l svm p svm rbf svm and sigmoid s svm and three ann model algorithms cgnn gdnn and bfgs to estimate daily ssl in rivers in the usa they found that the bfgs ann and rbf svr models outperformed the other models 2 4 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section demonstrates the following i svm can be used for classification and regression obtaining a mathematical model to predict parameter they can be applied to both linear and nonlinear problems ii several variants of svm like nu svr and ls svm offers more flexibility in modeling specific data oriented problems more studies have to be performed in order to develop strategies that can accommodate many of the problems that are still challenging for traditional predictive regression models rajaee et al 2020 iii svms are able of producing exact and robust classification results even when input data are non linearly separable while the ann is sensitive to the number of hidden nodes the svm is sensitive to the select of the mapping kernel and c parameter to solve a nonlinear problem svm uses the kernel trick this is equivalent to perform an embedding project data to a different space where data is linearly separable moreover the kernel trick only works for a set of possible embedding there exist several kernels implemented e g rbf polinomial histogram intersection chi2 the c parameter is one very important that controls the over fitting then for each different kernel have different extra parameters that define it it is very important to optimize all these parameters usually is done using grid techniques iv input vectors of svm are quite flexible hence various other influential factors such as temperature and discharge can be easily incorporated into the model v svms do not perform well on highly skewed imbalanced data sets these are training data sets in which the number of samples that fall in one of the classes far outnumbers those that are a member of the other class also svms are not efficient if the number of features is very huge in number compared to the training samples 2 5 other classification models 2 5 1 introductory of decision tree a model decision tree is a data driven algorithm quinlan 1992 built of a rule based predictive structure using a top down induction approach the tree is fitted to a training data set by splitting the data into homogeneous subsets based on the data attributes thereafter the tree is constructed with all training cases being predicted by the tree leaves i e each leave is a linear regression model which predicts continuous values for the numerical attributes the tree is then pruned bottom up and transformed into a set of if then rules which simplify the tree structure and thus improves its ability to classify new instances the predictive ability of the tree is measured using a correlation coefficient for the training and validation data sets the correlation coefficient equals one in case of a complete fit between measured values and model tree predictions one of the most popular and at the same time the simplest decision trees is the cart decision tree which has many applications in cart cart model as an innovative form of recursive partitioning that provides multivariate analysis is based on binary trees binary trees unlike the classification tree which divides the input space of multiple variables into subspaces with each subspace related to a particular class of output variable the regression tree does not create classes of dependent variables choubin et al 2018 since regression trees do not have pre assigned classes the output of this stage is a response value to each of the new observations for the dependent variable the splitting rule in regression trees is made by the squared residuals minimization algorithm which means that expected sum variances for two resulting nodes should be minimized 2 5 2 introductory of instance based learning ibl according to the definition of ibl method in khosravi et al 2018 ibl is an extension of the nearest neighbor algorithm which is characterized by the need for large storage space they can also be used to describe probabilistic concepts since it can produce graded matches for specific instances in ibl classification or prediction is made by combining observations from the training data set that are close to the new vector of inputs 2 5 3 bibliographic review goyal 2014 developed decision tree based m5 and wavelet regression models for estimation of sediment yield the result indicated that m5 model tree enhanced the accuracy in compression to other models choubin et al 2018 compared efficiency of cart model with other ai based models such as anfis mlp and two kernels of svm include of rbf svm and p svm models in this research nu regression nu svr employed with polynomial and radial basis function rbf as two kernels of svm for ssl predict the optimal values of the kernel parameters i e cost of constraint violation c epsilon ε and gamma γ must be identified in predicting by nu regression using rbf and polynomial kernels rashidi et al 2016 in this research optimum values of c ε and γ were determined by the trial and error method 2 5 4 result i decision trees can be visualized and explain with simple math no complex formulas ii decision trees forces the consideration of all possible outcomes of a decision and traces each path to a conclusion it creates a comprehensive analysis of the consequences along each branch and identifies decision nodes that need further analysis iii they require very little data preparation whereas other techniques often require data normalization the creation of dummy variables and the removal of blank values also they can handle multi output problems 3 various hybrid soft computing techniques for sediment modeling 3 1 introductory natural processes are very complex therefore it is sometimes not possible to create a single comprehensive model that sufficiently can capture the phenomenon behavior to overcome these problems it is possible to combine models in a given solution such models that work together to create a single solution are called hybrid models 3 1 1 wavelet ai models 3 1 1 1 brief description of wavelet transform wt wavelet approach is a time dependent spectral analysis that decomposes time series in the time frequency space to provide a timescale illustration of processes and their relationships daubechies 1990 it has been found that an appropriate data pre processing which employs wavelet analysis can lead to models that more sufficiently represent the true characteristics of the underlying system wt decomposing the time series into a set of base functions of various frequencies helps to improve the capability of a predictive model by capturing effective information at various resolution levels kim and valdes 2003 when applying wavelet transforms selecting the basis function called the mother wavelet is important from which the base functions are formed through a process of translating and dilating rajaee and jafari 2018 the wt is similar to the fourier transform in the sense that a time series is presented as a linear combination of some base functions for the wt the base functions are translations and dilations of one function called the mother wavelet the current study will not delve into the theory behind wavelet transform and only the main concepts of the discrete wavelet transform dwt are briefly presented a mathematical overview of wt and a review of applications are presented by labat et al 2000 the wt carry out the decomposition of a signal into a group to functions 4 ψ j k x 2 j 2 ψ j k 2 j x k where ψj k x is produced from a mother wavelet ψ x which i dilated by j and translated by k the mother wavelet has to satisfy the condition 5 ψ x d x 0 the discrete wavelet function of a signal f x can be calculated as follows 6 c j k f x ψ j k x d x 7 f x j k c j k ψ j k x where c j k is the approximate coefficient of a signal the mother wavelet is formulated from the scaling function φ x as 8 φ x 2 h 0 n φ 2 x n 9 ψ x 2 h 1 n φ 2 x n where h 1 n 1 n h 0 2 x n different sets of coefficients h 0 n can be found corresponding to wavelet bases with various characteristics in the dwt coefficients h 0 n play a critical role gupta and gupta 2007 3 1 1 2 wavelet artificial neural networks wann models the wann tries to combine the attributes of anns with the characteristics of the wavelet transform wavelet analysis methods for data pre process can be classified into either decomposition or reconstruction methods in decomposition the signal is decomposed into several levels and all the levels are considered as inputs to the ann models two levels of decomposition have been shown to be appropriate greater than two levels of decomposition may lead to low model efficiency ravansalar et al 2015 nourani et al 2009b in the decomposition full use of the time frequency characteristics of the signal is made with reconstruction through correlation analysis of the original output data the effective decomposed series are selected and summed to form a new series that acts as the input data partal and cigizoglu 2008 rajaee and broumand 2015 the steps of the reconstruction method are briefly summarized as i wavelet decomposition by discrete wavelet transforms the wavelet decomposition level was determined by the length of the time series and the trend performance at low frequency then the subcomponents were obtained by individually reconstructing single branches from wavelet coefficients ii selection of effective components by cross correlation analysis the cross correlation analyses were carried out between the subcomponents and the original sediment time series subcomponents with low cross correlation coefficients were discarded as noises and the derived components were retained iii new series for sediment was reconstructed by summing the derived components the reconstructed time series also referred to as de noised signals were then used as input data for ann modeling the performance of different hybrid wavelet based models such as ann wavelet model is very sensitive to the selection of the mother wavelet function ravansalar and rajaee 2015 daubechies 1992 3 1 1 3 wavelet neuro fuzzy wnf models wnf models based on wavelet analysis and nf have been proven effective for modeling nonlinear and non stationary time series signals in the wnf models the data pre processed by the wavelet analysis were entered into the nf model for this purpose the dyadic discrete wavelet transforms were used mallat 1989 when multi level sub signals are entered to the model as inputs the applied weights to them by nf model will be different at different levels so that high weights will be applied to the worthy level of the signal 3 1 1 4 wavelet based least square support vector machine wlssvm models the wlssvm model consists of a three layer structure so that the first layer is the sediment sub signals time series got by the wavelet transform lssvm can be employed to get the weights through training the wlssvm for nonlinear calculations this method captures useful information from the decomposed sub signals because of the influence of random and unknown factors measured time series data including hydrologic time series always include noise sang et al 2009a b the reconstruction pre processing can be used to de noise hydrologic time series data 3 1 1 5 wavelet emotional artificial neural networks weann models similar to wann model wavelet based data processing approach with the ability of multi resolution analysis was linked to the eann to improve the modeling performance this model was first proposed in sharghi et al 2019 the steps of the wenn method are described in detail by them 3 1 2 fuzzy genetic fg models fg models are improved by combining two methods fuzzy logic and gas in this method the fuzzy rule base is automatically set alike to the anfis system the parameters of the input and output membership functions are optimized using ga in the ga parameters are optimized by minimizing the objective function which is an error between model results and observed values 3 1 3 ensemble learning 3 1 3 1 bagging m5p an m5 model tree quinlan 1992 is a binary decision tree having linear regression functions at the terminal leaf nodes which can predict continuous numerical attributes tree based models are constructed by a divide and conquer method khosravi et al 2018 first used the bagging m5p method to predict sediment yield often known as ensemble learning models are bagging algorithms a major advantage of which is their ability to predict better than single models first the bagging technique considers a training dataset d which is sampled randomly with replacement to obtain a new size m training dataset di next the bootstrapped sample n will be used to produce the corresponding template n then the average output of the n models is determined to generate a combined model that usually performs better than the individual n model khosravi et al 2018 3 1 3 2 reduced error pruning tree rept the rept is a hybrid of the reduced error pruning model and decision tree algorithms the complexity of the rept have been reduced by rep pruning technique this method can eliminate tree branches and leaves without significantly affecting the classification accuracy of the model khosravi et al 2018 breslow and aha 1997 3 1 3 3 random committee rept one of the meta algorithm subsets is random committee algorithm a hybrid of base classifiers such as random tree can be constructed with this algorithm for help to estimate by a straight averaging probability prediction the algorithm can be performed by different iterations and seed number 3 1 3 4 random subspace rept ho 1998 developed random subspace as a classic integrated algorithm alike to the bagging algorithm its training subset is created from the original randomly selected training set mielniczuk and teisseyre 2014 xia et al 2015 which is the only way it differs from the bagging algorithm bertoni et al 2005 the features of each sub classifier at the final prediction is obtained through a combined voting method zhang and jia 2007 the efficiency of the sub classifiers depends on integrated learning differences the subcategories of the bagging method are used to determine the differences in the training performance of the sub classifiers and the adopted ensemble learning method is used to pool samples with different spatial characteristics to determine differences in the performances of the sub classifiers nanni and lumini 2008 3 1 4 heuristic regression methods 3 1 4 1 artificial bee colony abc abc algorithm simulating the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarms is one of the most common swarm based optimization algorithms studies show that abc algorithm increases the interest in the implementation of many complex problems in real world ozkan et al 2011 the drawback of the abc algorithm is requirement of new fitness tests for the new parameters to improve performance ab wahab et al 2015 in the abc algorithm the foraging process consists of three groups of bees which are onlooker scout and employed bee in the process of the algorithm the first half of the colony comprises of employed bees and the second half consists of the onlookers karaboga and basturk 2007 3 1 4 2 teaching learning based optimization tlbo rao et al 2011 proposed a new algorithm based on the teacher s natural phenomenon and a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm tlbo they conclude the tlbo method is simpler than other advanced optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and different evaluation but is also stronger than them rao et al 2012 rao et al 2011 created a model which used natural teaching learning process in class tlbo algorithm doesn t contain any specific controlling parameters while other evolutionary methods contain them the most commonly used evolutionary optimization technique is ga however ga provides a near optimal solution for a complex problem having a large number of variables and constraints this is mainly due to the difficulty in determining the optimum controlling parameters such as population size crossover rate and mutation rate a change in the algorithm parameters changes the effectiveness of the algorithm the same is the case with pso which uses inertia weight social and cognitive parameters similarly abc requires optimum controlling parameters of number of bees employed scout and onlookers limit etc hs requires the harmony memory consideration rate pitch adjusting rate and the number of improvisations tlbo is a new optimization technique which is free from the algorithm parameters i e no algorithm parameters are required for the working of this algorithm rao et al 2012 indicated that tlbo algorithm is better than the state of art methods when it is applied continuously nevertheless it can be considered as a drawback that the rate of convergence with respect to the elitist teaching learning opposition based algorithm method which is a new variant of tlbo is getting worse while dealing with high dimensional problems rajasekhar et al 2012 if the tlbo is used in the optimization process it requires only population size and number of generation as common controlling parameters in the tlbo the initial population which includes the actual number of students is randomly generated these students comprise of a number of design variables dede and ayvaz 2015 tlbo algorithm has two vital components which describe two basic modes of the learning teacher phase learning from the teacher and learning phase information exchange between learners during teacher phase students learn ınformation from their teacher by patterning teacher gives information to the learners and tries to enhance the mean level of the class students can teach up to the teacher only the person who is most experienced and knowledgeable in the class rao et al 2011 3 1 5 eemd ann model an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise added signal time series and treats the mean as the final true result finite not infinitesimal amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions imf dictated by the dyadic filter banks as eemd is a time space analysis method the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal original data which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer the effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time frequency space therefore the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one imf yang et al 2003a b the emd algorithm can be summarized as follows 1 identify all local extrema of x t and connect all local extrema with a cubic spline line to generate the upper eup and lower elow envelopes 2 calculate the mean of the envelopes by m t elow eup 2 3 extract the first component c t x t m t 4 check the details of c t and generate an imf with the residual m t x t c t by replacing x t when c t satisfies the two imf characteristics otherwise c t is not an imf and c t replaces x t and 5 repeat steps 1 4 until the stop criterion is met the steps of the emd method are described in detail by di et al 2014 and huang et al 2014 because eemd extract imfs that represent the variability of the original data at different time scales the hybrid eemd ann model can be used to simulate the ssc therefore for comparison imfs falling above the 95 confidence line and all residuals of the hydrological time series are also considered as inputs for the ann simulation also cross correlation analyses are performed between each imf component and residual of the time series 3 2 bibliographic review although ai methods have been used extensively as useful tools for prediction of hydrological variables they may also include some drawbacks in dealing with non stationary data in the past few years more attentions are paid to apply hybrid models so that application of hybrid models leads to better results in comparison with ai based models therefore some hybrid soft computing techniques which include different data preprocessing and combine techniques have been also developed to increase generalizability of single ai based methods here some of such hybrid models employed in sediment modeling are presented the hybrid models discussed here represent the joint application of ai based methods with the wt to enhance overall model performance yet over the course of the last 5 6 years several research have been published that developed hybrid wt and ann or anfis models in certain hydrological and environmental engineering applications wt provide helpful decompositions of raw data and wt data improve the capability of the estimation model by capturing effective information on various resolution levels wann model has been widely used in recent years to forecast ssl a non stationary signal can be decomposed into a certain number of stationary signals by wt then ann is combined with wavelet transform to improve the prediction accuracy zhou et al 2008 partal and cigizoglu 2008 forecasted the ssl in rivers using a hybrid wann method measured data were decomposed into wavelet components wt and the new wavelet series consisting of the sum of selected decomposed time series was used as input for the ann model kisi 2010a proposed wnf technique for estimating daily ssc estimation this model was developed by combining two methods ann and discrete wavelet transform the wnf and ann models were tested by applying to different input combinations of daily stream flow and ssl data of two stations on tongue river in montana the comparison results indicated that the discrete wt could increase the accuracy of ann model in ssl estimation mirbagheri et al 2010 presented a new approach based on an nf and wnf approach for prediction of ssc their wnf model satisfactorily predicted ssls underestimated by ann nf and src models alone overall the wnf model which used decomposed data to extract important characteristics embedded in the ssc signal outperformed other models that employed raw data the applied nf inference system in this research used a fuzzy inference model in which the membership function parameters are used to fit a given input output set by an optimization algorithm rajaee 2010 compared nf wnf mlr and src models in forecasting ssl the measured time series of discharge and ssl were decomposed into sub series with dwt and the effective sub series used as inputs to the nf the results showed that the performance of wnf model while nf mlr and src models provided unacceptable predictions rajaee et al 2010 explored the performance of wnf model for ssl forecasting in a larger area of study with a lower discharge and ssl amount which achieved promising results in a wild watershed the observed time series of river discharge and ssl were decomposed and the effective wavelet components were summed and used in the nf model results indicated that the wnf model efficiency was better in prediction compared to the nf and src models particularly in extreme value estimation moreover the model can be employed to simulate the hysteresis phenomenon while the src method was not able to handle the involved hysteresis in rajaee 2011 and rajaee et al 2011 authors applied ann and wavelet conjunction model to predict river ssl the purpose of conjunction of the wavelet and ann models is to improve the accuracy of suspended sediment prediction in this direct observed time series of discharge and sediment were decomposed into several sub time series by discrete wt nourani et al 2013 conjugated wavelet pre processing technique via ann model to forecast ssl the results revealed that chosen mother wavelet and resolution level directly affect the prediction results on the other hand the threshold value as well as so called factors is another challenging issue according to the obtained results high values of threshold do not necessarily guarantee accuracy and after a specific threshold value a reduction in the performance of the model was observed results presented that this procedure dramatically enhanced the accuracy while modeling stream flow ssl process liu et al 2013 constructed a wann model to predict ssc during the following day the measured river discharge and ssc original time series were decomposed into sub series using dwt effective sub series were selected by cross correlation analysis and added to reconstruct noise free time series to apply as ann inputs for ssc forecasting the wann model was more capable of predicting the highly non linear and non stationary ssc time series than ann and src models kisi and fedakar 2014 proposed fg approach so as to predict ssc in rivers for a given stream cross section the accuracy of fg models was compared with those of the anfis ann and src models the results of the comparison revealed that the fg approach outperformed the other models in the estimation of the ssc nourani et al 2014 developed an ann based stream flow sediment model by focusing on a wt to de noise hydrological time series on a daily scale de noised time series were using to the ann model to predict discharge and sediment time series the results indicated that the wavelet based de noising approach can improve the ann based stream flow sediment forecasting models sadeghpourhaji et al 2014 employed svm and combination of svm to wavelet for ssl prediction they used stream flow in inputs of models result showed that wavelet improved accuracy of svm model olyaie et al 2015 compared the accuracy of three different ai based models visa anns anfis wann and conventional src approaches for estimating the daily ssl in two gauging stations in the usa the comparison of estimation accuracies of different models showed that the wann was the most accurate model in comparison to other models nourani and andalib 2015 examined the wlssvm model for prediction of daily and monthly ssl in the first step ssl was predicted with lssvm and ann models then stream flow and ssl data were decomposed into sub signals via wavelet and decomposed sub time series were entered to lssvm and ann to simulate discharge ssl relationship the ability of wlssvm was compared with other models in ssl predictions the results showed that in daily ssl prediction lssvm has better than ann wlssvm and wann models showed same subsequences in daily and different in monthly ssl estimations shamaei and kaedi 2016 proposed a method called stacking to predict the ssc they compared performance of lgp ann nf methods with stacking model they used the case study and methods lgp ann nf similar to kisi and guven 2010 research the results demonstrated that stacking method is able to predict the ssc accurately ghose and samantaray 2018 used ga with bpnn and multiple regressions to predict ssc the result obtained in this study do not determine any linear relationship the comparison of estimation accuracies of different models showed that the ga bpnn was the most accurate model in comparison to ga regression and ann models khosravi et al 2018 compared performance of data mining models include of three stand alone models such as reduced error pruning tree rept mp5 and instance based learning ibl models and three hybrid models such as bagging m5p models the random committee rept and random subspace rept to predict ssl the result showed that hybrid models enhance the accuracy of predict and hybrid bagging m5p model was the best in the other models yilmaz et al 2018 evaluated various rms including abc tlbo cra and mars models to predicted ssl the result demonstrate that mars is the most accurate model altunkaynak 2009 conducted similar studies but used genetic algorithms to optimize solutions kisi and yaseen 2019 developed a new hybrid intelligence method based on ef including anfis sc anfis gp and anfis fcm models to estimate ssc the results showed the potential of the evolutionary fuzzy predictive model to mimic the ssc pattern with a high level of accuracy over the comparable models the ef demonstrates an effective predictive model over the other variant of the integrated anfis models for the investigated ecological disaster the ef s main merit in its integration with the genetic algorithm inspired by nature contrary to the anfis method the gradient descent algorithm is used to describe the mfs in which it is possible to face some drawbacks such as tapping into the local minima liu et al 2019 suggested eemd ann method as an improved approach to model nonlinear and non stationary time series they used hilbert huang transform hht to remove noise from of the ssc rainfall runoff and vegetation cover signals the ssc simulation performances of different methods were then compared they applied mlr ann eemd mlr and eemd ann models to simulate the ssc the results indicated that the ssc of the kuye river decreased as the rainfall runoff and ndvi increased from 2006 to 2010 result showed that using imfs and residuals components as input data improved performance of both the ann model and the mlr model sharghi et al 2019 as a novel technique investigated capability of a new generation of ann models namely eann and weann models for daily and monthly ssl modeling through comparing the results obtained it was found that using wt as a pre processing method for data could lead to more accurate ssl predictions the results of this study showed weann s superiority over wann model due to its eann base which includes a few hormonal emotional parameters that handle the model s emotional conditions by operating as dynamic weights which frequently give feedback to the other system components 3 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section reveals the following i based on the reviewed papers the application of wavelets as a pre processing technique usually improves modeling performance after decomposition of the original signal to seasonal subseries at different scales via one of three scenarios the use of all decomposed time series as inputs of the ai model the use of only the dominant sub series as inputs of the ai model the use of the original sediment time series as the input of the ai model reconstructed by using only selected dominant sub series ii a wnf model which uses multi scale signals accompanied by the original signal as input data may present more skillful estimation rather than a single pattern input because it considers both the autocorrelation and seasonality features of the sediment discharge phenomenon the results showed that wnf provided not only a way of enhancing accuracy but also the ability to capture temporal trends in sediment it helps it to make significant improvements in forecast generation as a result the anfis model tends to be more able to capture the more complex and dynamic processes hidden within sediment information after with wdt iii the number of published papers on sediment modeling via wlssvm and fg is low which shows the need to develop the methods and relevant issues for sediment modeling iv the choice of appropriate type of mother wavelet and the number of decomposition levels are important in the analysis of time series by wt in the number of papers several important parameters such as wavelet decomposition level and wavelet filter type were not provided v in spite of the black box nature of ai methods the use of wavelet analysis with ai methods makes it possible to provide some insights into the physics of the process in both time and space by employing fuzzy and wavelet concepts connected to the ann framework the uncertainty and seasonality of the phenomena can respectively be better handled vi using the wavelet analysis to extract the input time series a greater understanding and ability to simulate sediment can be achieved the results of the studies explored in this section have revealed the good performance of wavelet ai models compared with other methods in accurately forecasting sediment vii a review of the literature shows that in recent years researchers have begun to use other new hybrid methods of soft computing in the yilmaz et al 2018 the mars method was used multivariate adaptive regression splines have been used for finding predictive models for difficult data mining problems i e when the predictor variables do not exhibit simple and or monotone relationships to the dependent variable of interest also mars does not require feature standardization and provide automated feature selection viii for nonlinear and non stationary ssc time series the hht also called empirical mode decomposition emd is an iterative procedure as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory like features at different time scales and it can significantly increase the simulation accuracy the main advantage of emd over wavelet convolution is the ability to estimate subtle changes in frequency estimating instantaneous frequency from a wavelet convolution is suboptimal because of frequency smoothing and because wavelet convolution assumes frequency stationary during the time span of the wavelet emd is also poorly suited for detecting relative suppressions of power at a specific frequency ix eann serves only a few hormonal weights that can lead to a good representation of irregular and extreme situations but when linked to the wavelet transformation leads to this study s most effective model x abc and tlbo algorithms are usually used to solve combinatorial optimization problems therefore yilmaz et al 2018 used them to optimize coefficients of regression equations used to estimate ssl although the models abc and tlbo are more predictive than traditional methods the mars model is even more exact and can be applied more easily 4 other sediment related analyzes 4 1 peak estimation the feasible estimation of the peak sediment values is the most important factor in any river management programs table 1 presents the details of the papers reviewed to examine the estimation of peak values according to table 1 it is evident that only 16 papers estimate the peak sediment values in this table the models used in the published papers are arranged in order on the basis of efficiency from left to right it was also found that wavelet based models are more efficient than other ai models in monitoring peak values 4 2 hysteresis modeling the interpretation of sediment hysteresis phenomenon has a long tradition in geomorphology and is regularly used to deduce geomorphic processes within a catchment and the distribution of sediment sources aich et al 2014 yeshaneh et al 2014 and fan et al 2013 as well as gao and josefson 2012 provide comprehensive overviews of studies that interpret the hysteresis between sediment and discharge however hysteresis patterns are ambiguous and typical patterns like clockwise or anti clockwise loops have been assigned to different phenomena depending on the characteristics and size of a catchment smith and dragovich 2009 number of researchers investigated the various models performances in capturing this event for example cigizoglu 2004 investigated the nf wnf and src models performances in capturing hysteresis event as it is seen nf and wnf models simulated the hysteresis event better than src method alp and cigizoglu 2007 showed that the hysteresis generated by ann simulations is more realistic than the mlr hysteresis plot it is clear that the mlr model does not capture the behavior of the measured ssl time series as strong as the considered two ann methods rajaee et al 2009 2010 2010 concluded the nf model has simulated the hysteresis better than other ann mlr and src models rajaee et al 2011 showed that the wnn model outperformed the other models acceptably simulated the hysteresis phenomenon while src method was incapable to handle the involved hysteresis rajaee 2011 showed that the wann model simulated the involved hysteresis better than the other models the ann model simulated the hysteresis only in one event while the src model was not able to simulate the hysteresis phenomenon wann model outperformed the other models acceptably simulated the hysteresis phenomenon while src method was not successfully in hysteresis regeneration mirbagheri et al 2010 indicated that wnf model simulated the hysteresis effect better than the ann nf and src models in this direction the wnf simulated the hysteresis shape and its simulation is rather unlike the observed time series the src method was not successfully in producing hysteresis whereas and ann and nf models can be capable of regenerating the hysteresis 5 general results and discussions 5 1 distribution of published papers the number of papers published between 2000 and 2019 in each year is shown in fig 2 there is a generally increasing trend in the number of papers published since 2001 even though there are some fluctuations with drops in the number of papers published in 2002 and 2003 6 papers were published in 2010 and 2013 compared with only one paper in 2001 as can be seen in fig 3 a review of published articles on sediment modeling shows the emergence of wavelet based methods since 2008 no wavelet ai based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far only one article in 2008 shows the use of wann in 2009 no research has examined this issue from 2010 to 2019 12 articles examined the use of a variety of wavelet ai methods and demonstrated the superiority of these methods over other ai based methods among the reviewed papers about 19 13 papers of studies used hybrid wavelet models according to fig 3 the type of single ann model are some of the widely used models among various ai based models used for sediment modeling in rivers as can be seen among the 66 articles reviewed 56 times the neural network architectures have been modeled uniformly from year 2001 to year 2019 after the neural network nf is another common algorithm that has been modeled 28 times the research approaches in 2018 and 2019 are towards new combinatorial algorithms based on heuristic regression and ensemble learning in addition to wavelet based methods that have greatly improved the performance of single models the ema based method as one of the time series preprocessing methods is expected to attract many researchers 5 2 study areas fig 4 shows the number of published papers regarding ai applications in sediment modeling with respect to study area the study areas of the surveyed papers where the ai methods were used to predict sediment are mostly located in united states which indicates the presence of data recorded on the usgs web server http cida usgs gov sediment details of the surveyed papers including authors year of publication dependent and independent variables temporal scale number of training and testing set region of study drainage area station time span types of models unit of measure sediment and the best input are given in table 2 5 3 evaluation criteria in fig 5 displayed performance criteria that used to evaluate the sediment modeling in the published the most popular performance criteria were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r in many of the studies investigated more than one performance criterion was considered this is particularly the case for the model validation aspect of predictive validity it is desirable to use multiple validation criteria as a single model performance criterion alone is often unable to test the model s performance across the entire output range 5 4 other details of the surveyed papers 5 4 1 time step selection it is understood that the estimation of sediment transport phenomena depends on the input variables of the time series where the time series can be viewed in multiple scales such as daily weekly monthly and annual according to table 2 the majority of researchers applied a daily time scale in order to model the sediment modeling the largest number of these papers showed that the forecast is more reliable on a daily time scale than other time scales where the data value of variability on a daily time scale can provide a better view of the conduct of sediment transport in rivers the maximum value can also be seen on a daily scale it is notable that in their study all studies except seven used a daily time scale 5 4 2 input variables soft computing models are based on analyzing the data about a river in particular finding connections between the system state variables input internal and output variables without explicit knowledge of the basin physical behavior the selection of appropriate model inputs is very important to prediction as such due to the limitation in data availability it is essential to develop a sediment transport prediction model based on minimal input fig 6 displays the input variables used in the simulation of ai sediment according to the papers examined 56 papers used the sediment as an input factor between 66 papers also 4 papers without any other physical input variable are considered the sediment as a single auto correlated input variable according to fig 6 and table 2 the flow and discharge are two other parameters which were mostly selected for simulation of sediment 57 times the utilization of discharge as independent variables in modeling of the majority of studies improved accuracy in addition some hydrological time series such as rainfall temperature phase precipitation evapotranspiration velocity and humidity were also used in the reviewed papers as input variables other input variables used such as surface runoff watershed vulnerability index electrical conductivity uniform vegetation difference index etc were used to a lesser extent in the surveyed articles and it would indicate that some of them could not be easily accommodated at the input point although some of the hydrological time series were used more than the others during the input consideration process it should be noted that the choice of input data was mostly based on the availability of information in the study area instead of on a physical examination of the necessary data to order to obtain the correct input pattern for ai models it is suggest to carry out a statistical analysis and to general a correlation analysis with different data before using them for modeling another method that can be used to find out the effect of exogenous factors on sediment changes is the entropy wavelet criterion for example in nourani et al 2015 work s to optimize the input layer and improve the efficiency of the plain s ann based gwl modeling the gwl data were pre processed spatially and temporarily using and temporarily using a newly proposed approach involving the principles of entropy som and wt 5 4 3 lead time one of the important concerns in sediment forecasting is the selection of a proper lead time as can be seen in table 2 in most of the reviewed articles analytical techniques such as correlation analysis or principal component analysis have been used to obtain the appropriate lag time step as input to the model on a daily time scale it was considered that longer lead times e g more than 2 days for sediment forecasting using ai approaches could not lead to accurate forecasting results while 1 or 2 day ahead forecasting was usually more effective 5 4 4 unit of measure sediment as can be seen from table 2 units of measure sediment in these papers included mg l ton ton day kg m3 kg l kg day the ton day and mg l were two units that were commonly used in measuring sediment furthermore table 2 compares the type of utilized ai techniques and applied hydrological variables of the reviewed papers 5 4 5 study areas and type of basins details of the basin stations and examined rivers are presented in table 2 the drainage area is directly related to hydrological reactions the smaller the area the more severe the hydrological reactions studies show that despite drastic changes in the physical conditions of the basins especially drainage area ai based models independent of the physical conditions have good accuracy 5 4 6 data division a data driven model can locate the relationship between a system s inputs and outputs using a training data set that is representative of all the behavior found in the system selecting a training and testing set is an important issue that does not have any specific guidelines usually the data can be divided into three parts train sets are part of the actual data used to train the model for example weights and biases on the neural network the validation set is used to evaluate a given model but this is for frequent evaluation in data driven models used this data to fine tune the model hyper parameters hence the model occasionally sees this data but never does it learn from this the test set is generally what is used to evaluate competing models many times the validation set is used as the test set fig 7 the majority of reviewed papers two parts of data division training and testing sets while a few papers included the validation set as can be seen from fig 8 in these reviews the testing set was considered in training set as can be seen from fig 8 there is anything ideal ratio for splitting a dataset authors considered different ratios i e 80 20 70 30 65 35 etc and to pick the ratio that gives the best performance result among 66 reviewed papers the training set has been included from 50 to 90 of the total data with an average of approximately 70 usually more data particularly for training will improve overall model efficiency giving a better probability of locating the global minimum of error feature if there is no overtraining during training however there are some examples where we may not even be able to gather 72 data to train the model such as the ardiclioglu et al 2007 monthly sediment results there was no specific guideline on how to get the best size of samples needed for ai modeling in the all 66 reviewed papers it can be concluded that there is a trial or error trial using the available data the fig 9 shows the steps that most papers followed to predict sediment 6 conclusions according to research conducted in the past years intelligence methods through an amalgamation of probabilistic statistical and optimization techniques into the computing sediment have presented a suitable substitute for traditional mathematical techniques this contribution provides a review of the most recent ai based models applications in this field in the current review 66 papers used ai based models with great operational or forecasting ability in order to model sediment i temporal resolution is an important factor in accuracy of modeling the results indicate that the majority of researchers applied a daily time scale to sediment modeling among the published papers only 7 papers have applied monthly time steps as well as only 1 paper was found to have used hourly time step and no paper was found to have used weekly time step which can be due to the availability of daily sediment data compared to other time steps the authors concluded performance of the monthly in comparison of daily simulations is poor also it can be due to the availability of shorter length of time series for training and lower correlation of monthly sediment data another reason is that the daily pattern of sediment provides comprehensive information on the phenomenon clearly the possibility of precise modeling is increased ii it can be found that past steps of the sediment time series is the most frequently used input for ai models that forecast sediment other hydrological time series such as flow rainfall and temperature have also been frequently used as appropriate inputs in many papers among the surveyed papers 48 of the studies which used ai methods to predict sediment were located in united states iii examination of the articles showed issues in relation to the desirable division of the observed data data pre processing and the select the appropriate model inputs are rarely considered among the articles examined several evaluation determinants i e r rmse mse mae nse and e were used to analyze models in the majority of reviewed papers evaluation efficiency criteria including the nash sutcliff coefficient mae and rmse were used to evaluate the model performance iv the result showed the mlr method in comparison with the intelligence models it was not an accurate model this may refer to linear substance of the mlr method whereas non linear characteristics with help the ann and nf models can be detected and captured non linear features of phenomenon in contrast to regression based models ai based models use the advantage of multiple adjustable parameters and configurations therefore they are prone to problems of over fitting v in the published papers different type of ann approaches have been used results indicate that the mlp algorithms were most common in evaluation of the performance of the ann architectures in majority of papers the optimum number of nodes in the hidden layer was determined through a trial and error process the result showed that ann performance is better than mlr for all the researches simulations according to obtained result although the use of anns has allowed significant progress in the estimation of sediment there is still a need for more sensitive estimation methods also although the ann approach has some disadvantages and limitations in clouding over fitting local minima slow learning speed and difficulty capturing the time series high complexity non stationary dynamism and non linearity ann s modeling output was consistently satisfactory we predict that the effectiveness of ann in the future is likely to be improved with further studies to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and limitations as in a study conducted by sharghi et al 2019 a eann approach was developed to improve neural network performance vi the comparison results in majority of published papers indicated that the gp is superior to the anfis ann and svm models in estimating sediment the results obtained in this study also indicated that the ann and svm methods may produce negative approximations for some of the low sediments whereas gp estimates are all positive and close to observations the results obtained with gp models are better than those obtained using the classic models and confirm the ability of this approach to provide a useful tool in solving specific problems in hydrology in the other words the gp model due to explicit and stochastic search ability can be used and harnessed by anyone not necessarily being familiar with gp in regards to the calibration of sediment models in general the results illustrated that nf model presents outperforms ann and svm models in sediment prediction vii the literature results reviewed here showed that ai models were powerful tools to model the sediment and could provide a better estimation than traditional approaches although used of single ai based models has usually allowed significant progress in the estimation of sediment but results illustrated the advantage of wavelet ai models in simultaneous consideration of several short and long term seasonality s in the modeling process which may lead to better estimation of peak points therefore to overcome the disadvantages of a single method combination and coupling are effective approaches the wavelet transform improve the ai based modeling performance in addition to extracting non stationary and multi scale features of time series various studies have manifested the better performance of wavelet ai models in analyzing the variability and complexity of hydrologic variables compared with single ai methods according to the published papers the conjunction models based on wavelet transform including wann model wnf model and wllsvm model detected wann models based on wavelet analysis and ann have proven effective for modeling non linear and non stationary time series signals this method captures effective information from the decomposed sub signals it is evident that extreme or peak values in the sediment time series which occur in a periodic pattern can be detected by the seasonal models wnf models can model such extreme values more accurately due to more compatibility with the uncertainty complex by using fuzzy and wavelet concepts connected to the ann framework the uncertainty and seasonality of the phenomena can be handled more successfully the selection of an efficient mother wavelet and decomposition levels are two important issues at the first stage in several papers such as rajaee 2010 rajaee 2011 nourani and andalib 2015 details of decomposition level and types of mother wavelets have been presented in these studies the efficiency and accuracy of sediment models using a wavelet ai method has been compared to single ai or regression based models viii among the published papers only 2 paper uses wllsvm model to estimate the sediment nourani et al 2015 sadeghpourhaji et al 2014 the results obtained in this study indicated that wlssvm performed better than wann where wlssvm and wann showed more robust performances than ad hoc lssvm and ann models the reviewed papers revealed that all of studies used the dwt for decomposing hydrological time series this can be related to the nature of sediment which is less stochastic thus dwt is more suitable than continuous wavelet transform cwt which generates much more redundant information ix one of the important issues in sediment modeling is the accurate modeling of peak values in water resources and environmental management result showed the wavelet based models are more efficient in monitoring peak values than ai models alone i e ann gp svm and anfis x comparisons showed that one of the important issues in sediment modeling is the hysteresis which is related to the season or month of occurrence thus the using of single ai models is not adequate in the presence of hysteresis phenomenon in this regard the application of the hybrid models which considers the seasonality of the hysteresis process is useful xi in general we can say the train test validation split ratio is also quite specific to each modeling and it gets easier to make a judgment as train and build more and more models 7 recommendations for future research based on the review of almost 66 papers the following recommendations for future research might prove helpful 1 due to the paucity of papers in the field of sediment modeling via hybrid models it is suggested that additional research be conducted on this topic 2 in addition to the ability of wavelet ai models they can also be linked to numerical based models such as wavelet weighted residual method wavelet finite element method wavelet boundary element and wavelet mesh less method to develop integrated modular models ramezani et al 2019 3 the presented ai models could be used to simulate hourly and event based sediment time series 4 several evolutionary algorithms such as gas and simulated annealing algorithms have been conducted in parameter selection but these algorithms often suffer from the possibility of being trapped in the local optima further investigation into hybridizing swarm intelligence si technique as well as relatively new optimization techniques namely artificial bee colony abc artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa ant colony optimization with ann aco and wavelet are recommended to obtain satisfactory global optimal results which facilitates the selection of optimal parameters for ann 5 further research on other field such as estimation of rainfall run off lake water level and combination of ai models with other commonly used data pre post processing techniques are highly recommended as well 6 further investigation into the use of suitable techniques such as wavelet entropy partial mutual information and fractal dimension for estimation of temporal evolution and quantification of the amount of complexity of hydrologic systems are also recommended wavelet measures such as shannon entropy mutual information content and relative entropy can be calculated based on wavelet analysis results of hydrologic series 7 in the reviewed papers the way the model inputs were determined was generally described well however some of the methods used raise considerable doubt about the optimality of the model inputs obtained in the majority of papers the input variables were chosen using a priori knowledge future research is suggested to consider other optimal ways to select model inputs such as entropy energy 8 more studies have to be performed in order to develop strategies that can accommodate many of the problems that are still challenging for traditional predictive regression models rm 9 maroufpoor et al 2019 proposed a newly developed hybrid intelligent model namely anfis gwo for soil moisture prediction it is suggested to be similar to work of maroufpoor et al 2019 a anfis gwo grey wolf optimizer algorithm model can be developed for sediment modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5351,simulation approaches employed in sediment processes are important for watershed management and environmental impact assessment use of stochastic models that based on time series observations and do not require heavy calculations and complex relationships is developing recent years artificial intelligence ai techniques have developed to improve the accuracy of sediment modeling in this review study the performances of the various types of ai models viz ann gp gep anfis svm ibl abc rept tlbo decision tree and hybrid models viz wavelet ai gp ai are investigated as a means of prediction of sediment patterns in rivers published between 2001 and 2019 the 66 papers comprising the study deal with the usage of ai models in estimate of sediment and are undertaken in terms of data selection modeling approaches prediction time step and modeling performance evaluation this study presents an overview of ai techniques and a discussion of advantages to and applications of modeling sediment relations which to some extent have replaced time consuming conventional mathematical techniques however the study discusses major challenges and prospective research opportunities comparison of the results produced by the models indicated an improvement in the prediction accuracy through the use of hybrid models the most prominent feature of hybrid models is that they can provide more precise predictions for extremely high or low values due to the utilization of the distributed information processing system and the non linear transform involved in the most recent articles in competition with wavelets an iterative procedure namely hht introduced as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory like features at different time scales a review of published articles on sediment modeling showed the emergence of wavelet based methods since 2008 no wavelet ai based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far this subject was not investigated by any study in 2009 between 2010 and 2019 12 papers explored the use of a number of wavelet ai based methods about 19 percent 13 papers of the studies used hybrid wavelet models among the articles studied of all the papers only 6 papers investigated the performance of the models for the detection of hysteresis phenomenon this study showed that ai models could be successfully employed to simulate the complex river sediment process in situations where explicit knowledge of internal sub process is not required this study also presents several new thinking in the related field of research to develop innovative methods and improve the quality of modeling future research efforts should be focused on formulating guidelines that help to develop ai based models keywords artificial intelligence ensemble learning

algorithm 1 introduction the modeling and prediction of river sediment are essential in water recourses management and environmental engineering a large number of ambiguous parameters such as spatial variability of basin characteristics and river discharge patterns erosion and sediment load transported in watersheds and rivers led to the most complex hydrological and environmental phenomenon the magnitude and concentration of sediment are mainly affected by precipitation intensity and volume physical and topographical properties of soil texture and detachability and land cover vegetation the soil erosion process involves detachment of soil particles sediment transport by the raindrop impact and the shearing force of flowing water and deposition the quantity and size of sediments transported increase with the velocity and transport capacity of the overland flow while a decrease in transport capacity due to variation of rainfall soil properties slope and vegetation results in the deposition of eroded sediments thomas et al 2018 estimation of sediment has been approached through empirical relationships numerical simulations physically process based models mathematical models are also commonly handled for this object verstraeten and poesen 2001 ward et al 2009 however these techniques usually need a set of data and a long response time the non linear relationship between various physical variables geomorphologic properties of river basins and the sedimentation process has been major problem inaccurate prediction sediment in order to reduce the complexities of the problem in terms of developing practical techniques that do not require well on algorithm and theory in this regard classical time series models such as sediment rating curve src multi linear regression mlr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima have been widely used for sediment modeling such models are unable to estimate sediment under extreme hyper concentrated conditions this is mostly due to the fact that these are basically linear models assuming that data are stationary and have a limited ability to capture noise in sediment data the last decade application of artificial intelligence ai models to water resources and environmental problems have grown therefore ai methods are currently being used for the modeling of non linear hydrological processes like sediment in this review some very commonly used ai based methods for prediction and forecasting sediment are studied these methods include artificial neural networks ann adaptive network based fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machine svm classification and regression tree cart instance based learning ibl artificial bee colony abc teaching learning based optimization tlbo genetic programming gp and gene expression programming gep as single ai based models despite the flexibility of ai based methods in modeling sediment a lack of input data preprocessing may not allow ai models to adequately employment non stationary data which vary over a wide scale of frequencies from hourly to multi decadal therefore hybrid models which combine data pre processing forms with ai methods can be helpful the hybrid models in this paper include wann wnf and new models included reduced error pruning tree rept bagging m5p random committee rept random subspace rept in order to develop new methods to improve prediction accuracy it needs researchers to know what other scientists have done in the field recently several review papers were published that discussed various fields of hydrological and water resources using ai models in hydrology maier and dandy 2000 and maier et al 2010 reviewed some advantages of ann for the prediction and forecasting of water resources variables govindaraju and rao 2000 evaluated review papers with title of ann in hydrology nourani et al 2014 reviewed and discussed several wavelet ai papers in sediment modeling 9 papers afan et al 2016 in their review paper focused on application of ai models include ann svm anfis ec and coupled ai models in sediment prediction although this review implementation surveyed ai based approaches no reviews focused on precise statistics and percentages of details related to sediment modeling these researchers in their review paper on methods used in improving ann for back propagation suggested that work should continue on the development and evaluation of new evolutionary algorithms eas that have the ability to search for global minima or maxima numerous high potential algorithms such as particle swarm optimization pso ant colony optimization aco artificial bee colony algorithm abc ant lion optimizer alo bacterial colony optimization bco and gravitational search algorithm gsa are available although their efficiency in a sediment related modelling type is yet to be asserted with confidence the absence of review papers investigating the parallel implementation of the theory of ai models in sediment modeling resulted in the collective writing of the current review paper an updating analysis of combined ai and river sediment applications the main objective of this paper is to summarize and review the present researches and applications of ai based models in sediment estimation and try to give our opinions about the possible future researches on the method approximately two decades are spent applying artificial intelligence in hydrology especially sediment similar to the work of rajaee et al 2018 who conducted a comprehensive review of 67 groundwater journal articles in this research authors explain the several of ai based algorithm and to review the successes or failures of published applications with main emphasis on sediment and related concepts therefore this review has been divided into several sections a brief overview of various single soft computing techniques viz ann ga anfis and svm for sediment modeling is given in section 2 for each method three sub sections including a brief explanation of the principles of the methodology bibliographic review and results are considered section 3 provides brief descriptions and bibliographic reviews of a various hybrid soft computing techniques for sediment modeling other sediment related analyzes such as peak estimation and hysteresis modeling are given in section 4 the general results of the literature review have been briefly dealt with in section 5 in this section the steps that should be followed in the development of ai based models are described these include the select of evaluation criteria the division data the determination of appropriate model inputs distribution of published articles worldwide study areas time step selection the determination of appropriate variables lead time unit of measure sediment type of basins data division and data size set a summary and suggestions for future research are presented in the last two sections 6 and 7 of the paper the review restricts itself to papers published in international journals until the mid of 2019 sixty six papers on the subject of ai based models for sediment issues have been investigated however conference proceedings are not included in this review the present sources isi papers consulted were drawn from the thomson reuters scientific database 2 various single soft computing techniques for sediment modeling 2 1 artificial neural networks ann models 2 1 1 introductory ann a massively parallel distributed information processing system is based on concepts derived from research on the nature of human brains muller et al 1995 a common three layered feed forward neural network ffnn comprised multiple elements called nodes and connection pathways that link them haykin 1999 the sigmoid and tansig schmitz et al 2006 functions are applied as activation functions in hidden and output layer nodes to make ann model more effective an ann is based on a set of connected units called synthetic neurons normally the neurons are organized in layers signals travel from the first layer input layer to the last layer outlay layer and may run some layers several times in the hidden and output layers the net input to unit i is 1 y i j 1 p w i j x j θ i where wji w1 w2 wpi is the weight vector of unit i and p is the number of neurons in the above layer of unit i xi is the output from unit j and θi is the bias of unit i this weighted sum yi which is called the incoming signal of unit i is then passed through a transfer function a recommended literature for the ann approach could be masters 1993 algorithms such as conjugate gradient quasi newton and levenberg marquardt lm are faster algorithms that all of them can use of standard numerical optimization methods rajaee et al 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2013 there is a group of algorithms according to newton s method need no calculation of second derivatives such methods are known as quasi newton methods which have had a successful performance in conducted researches which was designed by broyden fletcher goldfarb and shanno bfgs bfgs algorithm requires much more computation in each repetition and also higher storage than the conjugate gradient cg methods although it is less convergent in the lower number of iterations nazareth 1977 has pointed out a close relationship that exists between the search directions defined by the cg minimization algorithm and the bfgs form of quasi newton algorithm qin 2007 showed that cg is the best choice for well conditioned problems because of its low memory requirement on large highly ill conditioned problems bfgs may be our only choice nevertheless on moderately ill conditioned problems with moderate sizes we may be able to take advantage of the limited memory algorithms depending on the amount of storage we have available in conducted study by apostolopoulou et al 2009 more details are provided they present a new curvilinear algorithmic model for training neural networks based on a memory less bfgs method that incorporates a curvilinear search this model exploits the no convexity of the surface error based on the information provided by the eigen system of memory less bfgs matrices using a pair of directions a memory less quasi newton direction and a negative curvature direction this model significantly improves the efficiency of the training process 2 1 1 1 generalized regression neural networks grnn models the grnn architecture specht 1991 subsumes the radial basis neural networks method this model is based on nonlinear regression theory for function estimation a grnn model consists of four layers an input layer a pattern layer a summation layer and an output layer the first layer is completely connected to the pattern layer where each unit represents a training pattern and its output is the distance from the input stored in the patterns the grnn method does not require an iterative training procedure for the multilayer perceptron mlp method this method is used for estimation of continuous variables as in standard regression techniques specht 1991 in the paper by ai daoud 2009 a comparison between grnn lm and lvq learning vector quantization models is done they stated that the main difficulty of grnn is that similar to kernel methods in general they suffer seriously from the curse of dimensionality grnn cannot ignore inessential inputs without major corrections to the basic algorithm lvq suffers the so called prototype under utilization problem i e only the winner is updated for each input and due to adopting euclidean distance measure lvq can cause bad proficiency when the data is non spherical distribution and especially includes noises or outliers the obtained result of this paper showed that the grnn outperform the other models 2 1 1 2 radial basis function rbf models rbf is an ann that uses radial base functions as an activity function the output of this network is a linear combination of radial base functions for input parameters and neurons the interpretation of the rbf method as an ann consists of three layers a layer of input neurons feeding the feature vectors into the network a hidden layer of rbf neurons calculating the outcome of the basic functions and a layer of output neurons calculating a linear combination of the basic functions taurino et al 2003 this network calculates a general approximation of the function using the sum of local approximations poggio and girosi 1990 lee et al 2003 2 1 1 3 neural differential evolution nde models nde models are improved by combining two methods neural networks and differential evolution the differential evolution algorithm can be classified as a floating point evolutionary optimization algorithm storn and price 1995 in the present study the differential evolution algorithm was used to obtain optimal parameters weights of the ann model the differential evolution algorithm can be classified as a floating point evolutionary optimization algorithm storn and price 1995 2 1 1 4 emotional artificial neural networks eann eann is based on standard anns jain 2001 improved by the features of a simulated hormonal neuromodulator system the artificial hormonal glands release a variety of digital hormones describing in a biological brain all types of neuromodulators such digital hormones affect the actions of the individual nodes representing the individual cells within a biological neural system including the synapses the functions that sum up the node s inputs and the output function analogous to the function of the neural cell s axon hill in addition the neural network regulates the hormone glands each cell within the network mentioned can emit hormones transforming each node in the network into a potential hormone gland hormonal receptors are modeled for each part of the virtual cell to allow a virtual cell to respond to a given hormonal level these hormonal receptors in the biological neuron membrane are similar to surface hormonal receptors the main difference between an ann and an eann nodes is that eann not only maps information from an input to an output level but also elements of a feedback system that alter the cells behavior based on dynamic hormone levels the ann s out function differs from the eann equivalent called hill function because the latter is heavily influenced during runtime by hormones but the former is usually stable during runtime more details can be found in khashman 2008 about eann s bp based training 2 1 2 bibliographic review ann approach has been used frequently as a tool of computation in different fields this section investigated papers that only emphasize the ann as the best ai based models in a preliminary study jain 2001 used the ann model to make an integrated stage discharge sediment concentration relation for each combination the number of nodes in the hidden layer with the best sediment estimation was determined the output layer had two neurons one for discharge and the other for sediment concentration after the trials the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 2 and 10 simulation results showed that the three layer feed forward ann with sigmoid transfer function model provided the most accurate predictions in comparison to the src model also cigizoglu 2004 compared ann and mlr in modeling sediment transfer he used ffnn with three hidden layers mlp with lm into bp algorithm learning rule and tansig transfer function the results of this comparison demonstrate that the ann model is able to exceed the limitations of traditional mlr the potential to create multiple solutions at different levels of generalization as well as robust solutions that can be transferred to unknown catchment types is illustrated kisi 2004 used three different ann techniques namely the mlp grnn and rbf for daily ssc the mlp model was trained using the lm algorithm the results indicated rbf and grnn models may efficiency better sediment load estimates than the mlp model based on the comparisons it was found that the mlp gives better ssc estimates than the other neural network techniques in maximum peak estimation rbf method gave a much better estimate than the other techniques cigizoglu and kisi 2006 developed a rdnn model for better ann performance in tss estimation the result showed that rdnn was found to be superior to conventional ann applications where only a single network is trained considering the entire training data set tayfur and guldal 2006 also predicted tss using precipitation they used a three layer ffnn using the back propagation algorithm for training in all the ann models the constructed network employed a single hidden layer and the sigmoid activation function the results of the investigation revealed that the ffnn significantly better performance than the non linear black box model based upon two dimensional unit sediment graph theory 2d usgt alp and cigizoglu 2007 examined two ann algorithm consist of ffbp and rbf in the estimation of ssl the performance of these models compared with the mlr model for ann modeling lm optimization technique three layer learning networks and tansig for transfer function were employed the number of nodes in hidden layers was determined by the trial error process ardiclioglu et al 2007 compared two different ffbp algorithms in suspended sediment prediction the ffbpnn model was trained using the lm and gradient descent gd optimization algorithms the sigmoid function was used for the activation function of the hidden and output nodes the result indicated the lm algorithm gave better performance than the gd algorithm kisi and cigizoglu 2007 applied a fuzzy model and three different ann models namely ffbp grnn and rbfnn to estimate ssl in rivers in the modeling process it was seemed the ffbp model had some drawbacks such a local minima problem and negative flow generation the constant spreads that give the minimum mse and conveniently hidden layer node numbers were simply found by trial and error results of the study revealed that the rbf is better than the other two ann methods zhu et al 2007 used an ann model for simulating the suspended sediment flux in this model suspended sediment flux was related to the temperature average rainfall rainfall intensity and flow discharge in this study authors used the mlp consisted of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer and a logistic sigmoid function chosen as the transformation function the number of neurons in the hidden layers was determined by a trial and error method the networks were trained with a bp algorithm bp training involves information processing in two directions the feed forward of the input information and the back propagation of the error simulation results indicated that the ann model is capable of high accuracy concerning suitable variables and their correlation to the previous month sediment melesse et al 2011 examined the accuracy of mlp neural network consisted of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer with ffbp algorithm and a sigmoid logistic non linear function in the estimation of suspended sediment time series in this study authors have used two temporal resolutions daily and weekly result indicated performance of daily simulation is better than weekly resolution as well as according to obtained result precipitation wasn t a significant parameter and doesn t play an important role in sediment prediction bayram et al 2012 applied regression analysis and ann with three layer perceptron mlp with ffbp optimization algorithm to predict ssc based on in situ turbidity measurements a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid tansig as the first transfer function and a linear as the second transfer function are used within the network also nourani et al 2012 investigated two ann based models integrated and geomorphology based models for estimation of ssl for both models a three layer ffbp network trained with lm optimization algorithm was selected the tansig function was used as an activation function in this study the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the ann model was determined after trying various network structures via trial and error process simulation results showed that the both models provided the high accurate predictions in src model result indicated the geomorphological ann model provided better performance than an integrated model because it uses spatially variable factors of the sub basins as the model s inputs also heng and suetsugi 2013 and makarynskyy et al 2015 used ann with sigmoid transfer function in hidden layer for sediment simulation and prediction they concluded that the neural network model has provided satisfactory performance abdulmohsin afan et al 2014 used ann by ffnn and rbf algorithms to predict daily ssl result indicated ffnn is accurate for sediment estimation ramezani et al 2014 different sba models such as ga pso and ica to optimize weighting in ann algorithm and estimate ssl in this research ff ica was best model demirci and uneş 2015 proposed a neural network approach by ffbp algorithm to predict ssc from stream flow including the mean water temperature daily real time flow rate and ssc with time lags a comparison was performed between ann src and mlr models based on comparison of the results it is found that the ann model gives better estimates than the src and mlr techniques chen and chau 2016 developed a novel ann model based on hybrid of double feed forward hdfnn by combining fuzzy pattern recognition and continuity equation for ssl prediction this model was compared with mfnn dpfnn and hfnn models in mfnn model used a network with three layer and sigmoid function for activation function result indicated hdfnn is accurate for sediment estimation bisoyi et al 2018 and khan et al 2018 evaluated the bpnn model to predict ssl the results showed that the proposed model with adequate training can predict daily sediment load accurately even in large basins with a nonlinear relationship between different hydrological variables 2 1 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section reveals the following fig 1 presented number of times various ann model architectures were used in published papers as can be seen from this figure ffbp were the most common ann architecture to be used in the 71 ann method development processes examined using only 50 ffbp among the algorithms proposed for ann the feed forward mlp algorithms were often used as a benchmark for evaluating the performance of alternative ann architectures i in the majority of papers the input variables and number of lags were chosen using correlation analysis and sigmoid function was used as neuron transfer function in other papers the number of lags was chosen arbitrarily ii comparison of the results indicated that anns capture the complex non linear behavior of the sediment series relatively better than the classic models iii in the number of papers details of the optimum network geometry were not adequately discussed in a number of papers iv networks with one hidden layer were used in the majority of case studies although networks with two hidden layers were used well v in ann modeling two points are of importance and deserver more attention firstly the ann architecture and secondly the training iteration number epoch in which an appropriate selection can progress the model efficiency in both steps of training and testing in addition it prevents the ann model to be over trained vi in ann models determining the number of neurons in input and hidden layers for reaching the best training results is major point in all the studied the hidden layer node numbers of each model were determined after trying various network structures through a trial and error process since there is no theory yet to tell how many hidden units are needed to approximate a given function 2 2 genetic algorithms ga models 2 2 1 introductory gp is a generalization of gas starts with an initial population of randomly generated computer programs composed of functions and terminals appropriate to the problem domain goldberg 1989 gp is very similar to ga being an evolutionary algorithm based on darwinian theories of natural selection and survival of the fittest however gp operates on parse trees rather than on bit strings as in a ga to approximate the equation in a symbolic form that best describes how the output relates to the input variables the algorithm considers an initial population of randomly generated programs equations derived from the random combination of input variables random numbers and functions which include arithmetic operators plus minus multiply divide mathematical functions sin cos exp log logical comparison functions or and etc which has to be appropriately chosen based on some understanding of the process and the fitness a measure of how well the problem is solved of the evolved programs are evaluated individual programs that best fit the data are then selected from the initial population the main operators used in the evolutionary algorithm such as gp are crossover and mutation besides some control parameters that need to be set are population size a maximum number of generations and the function set gp has been implemented using disciplus tool and gene xpro program was used for modeling sediment for gep rajaee jafari 2018 generally gp solves any problem through five steps i generation of an initial population computer programs randomly by the functions and terminals of the problem ii execution of each program with certain fitness value iii creation of a new population of computer programs based on reproduction mutation and crossover operators iv comparison of new fitness values and v selection of the best computer program evolutionary process 2 2 2 bibliographic review gp can be successfully applied to areas i where the interrelationships among the relevant variables are poorly understood or where it is suspected that the current understanding may well be wrong ii finding the size and shape of the final solution is hard iii conventional mathematical analysis does not or cannot supply analytical solutions iv an approximate solution is acceptable or is the only result that is ever likely to be obtained v small improvements in performance are routinely measured or easily measurable vi there is a large amount of data in computer readable form that needs examination classification and integration banzhaf et al 1998 babovic 2000 employed experimental flume data utilized by zyserman and fredsoe 1994 and expressed a new formulation for bed concentration of suspended sediment aytek and kisi 2008 in their study proposed gp as a new approach for the expressed formulation of suspended sediment discharge relationship they compared expressed models obtained using the gp with src and mlr methods in ssl prediction altunkaynak 2009 applied ga model for suspended sediment concentration estimation in this study to consider the uncertainties without any basic assumptions such as linearity normality and homoscedasticity authors preferred to employ gas for the prediction of sediment load from discharge data one of the advantages of gas is its ability to generate more than one optimum solution points on the other hand rm with the limiting assumptions can only estimate one solution point in this study genetic curve predictions were compared to rm results another reason why the gas approach should be preferred is the independency of ga from restrictive assumptions it is shown that especially for the peak values gas predictions are better than rm ga provided better results than rm for the estimation of 365 days data set kisi and guven 2010 developed a machine code based gp for ssc forecasting the obtained result of the gp was compared with those of the adaptive nf ann and rating curve models the daily stream flow and ssc data from two stations were used for the modeling the comparison results showed that the gp model performed better than the nf ann and rating curve models 2 2 3 result the following offers a critical evaluation of the various papers examined for the present investigation vii it was observed that there is paucity in the literature regarding the use of gp in the field of water resources engineering in the other hand the application of gp technique to estimate the river sediment is relatively new compared to ann nevertheless gp s success indicates an increased interest in estimating the sediment by following this technique viii gp is capable of detecting the subtle non linear effect superimposed over the linear behavior ix in some studied the results obtained with gp models are better than those obtained using the src mlr and ann models x the fundamental difference between gas gp and gep is due to the nature of the individuals in gas the individuals are linear strings of fixed length chromosomes in gp the individuals are nonlinear existence of various sizes and shapes and in gep the individuals are encoded as linear strings of fixed length which are subsequently expressed as nonlinear entities of different sizes and shapes xi the gp model is explicit and simple user friendly xii gp through its stochastic search ability can be harnessed for calibration of these sediment models 2 3 adaptive nero fuzzy inference system anfis models 2 3 1 introductory the fuzzy inference system fis is an ai approach that has been employed in the estimation of uncertainties in real situations each fuzzy system contains three main parts fuzzifier fuzzy database and defuzzifier the fuzzy database contains two main parts fuzzy rule base and inference engine neuro fuzzy simulation refers to the algorithm of applying different learning techniques produced in the neural network literature to fuzzy modeling or a fis brown and harris 1994 mamdani s approach uses fuzzy mfs whereas sugeno s approach uses linear or constant functions more details on the anfis model can be found in jang 1993 2 3 2 bibliographic review there are a few papers in the literature about the using of anfis algorithms to estimate sediment tayfur et al 2003 presented a fuzzy logic method using the rainfall intensity and slope data to predict sediment loads from bare soil surfaces result demonstrated that the fuzzy technique performed better under very high rainfall intensities over different slopes as well as over very steep slopes under various rainfall intensities kisi 2005 employed nf and ann approaches for estimating ssls for nf modeling triangular membership functions were used for practical applications the author concluded two or three membership functions to the nf models were found enough for modeling ssl the final architectures for the nf and ann models were found after many trials the node number in the hidden layer was found to change between 1 and 2 the nf and ann models perform better than the mlr and src kisi et al 2006 proposed a fuzzy logic approach to predict ssc from stream flow for this purpose input and output variables i e flow and ssc were divided into eight categories and eight triangular membership functions with equal base widths were assigned this model was calibrated by changing the shapes of the membership functions by help of the fuzzy editor in order to decrease the mrse value the result of fuzzy models compared to src model the results obtained with fuzzy model were better than src model lohani et al 2007 employed a fuzzy and ann model to simulate the stage discharge sediment concentration relationship in two gauging stations in the narmada basin in india in the trial and error process the number of neurons in the hidden layer was varied between 2 and 10 after many trials the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the network was finalized and they vary from 4 to 6 for fuzzy modeling the optimum model structure was determined after trials in the trials the cluster radius of the subtractive clustering algorithm was varied between 0 1 and 1 with steps of 0 02 each fuzzy model has a different number of rules between 4 and 7 for every input vector a membership degree to each fuzzy set greater than 0 is computed from the gaussian membership function therefore all the rules fire simultaneously for each combination of inputs and a crisp output value is thus provided for a given input data vector using equation results of the study illustrated that the fuzzy approach was capable of providing much better results than the ann and src model kisi et al 2008 studied the accuracy of a nf model in comparison to other data driven models such as rbnn ffnn and grnn for monthly ssc estimation in turkey the results illustrated that the nf method provided better performance than other methods kisi 2009 also proposed evolutionary fuzzy models for ssc estimation the triangular membership functions with equal base widths were selected for each evolutionary fuzzy model efm then the parameters of membership functions were found using de algorithm finally the efm models were tested and the results were compared with those of the nf ann and src models obtained from the previous study kisi 2005 kisi et al 2009 studied nf technique in comparison of ann and src models in ann modeling used both of logarithm sigmoid and linear activation function for hidden and output layer the results showed that the nf model can acceptably ssc estimate in rajaee et al 2009 studied nf ann mlr and src models were utilized in daily the models were trained using daily river discharge and ssc they applied ffnn with bp optimization algorithm and used tansig and purelin functions as transfer functions in the hidden and output layers comparison of the models results illustrated that the ann model is more accurate than the mlr and src models and nf model was more accuracy than ann furthermore the results showed that the nf and ann model can acceptably estimate cumulative cobaner et al 2009 using nf and ann models to estimate ssl by using hydro meteorological data the comparison results indicated the nf model was more accurate than other models for the particular data sets ulke et al 2009 employed ann nf src mlr and mnlr methods for sediment prediction result showed ann using conjugate gradient optimization method has the best performance among the other models vafakhah 2013 applied ann anfis cokriging ck and ordinary kriging ok models using rainfall and stream flow data for ssl forecasting comparison results showed that the anfis model provided better estimation than the other models sirabahenda et al 2017 developed anfis algorithm for prediction of ssc they used other hydrological parameters such as precipitation surface runoff stream flow and vulnerability index in inputs of different models buyukyildiz kumcu 2017 evaluated performance of svm anfis ann models to predict the ssl in this study obtained results of svm model were the best kaveh et al 2017 compared efficiency of anfis model that uses levenberg marquardt learning algorithm for training with similar networks trained with the common hybrid and bp algorithms obtained results showed that models trained with the hybrid and lm algorithms are accurate than similar networks trained with bp algorithm 2 3 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section demonstrates the following the main advantages of using nf method are their flexibility and ability to model nonlinear relationships and considering fuzzy nature of the real world system i it seems the nf and ann models to be more adequate than the src and mlr for the process of establishing a rating relationship between sediment and stream flow the results suggested that anfis has found solutions faster than alternative types of anns approaches and is the most accurate and reliable tool for processing non linear and non parametric large volumes of data ii nf emulation of human reasoning and decision making ability can be exploited for modeling problems governed by inexact vague and imprecise information therefore models based on the fuzzy theory lead to more reliable results than other ai models 2 4 support vector machine svm models 2 4 1 introductory mathematically support vector machine is placed in classification and regression algorithms range which is formulated using the principals of statistical learning theory by vapnik 1995 these models first were used for water resource management by sivapragasam et al 2001 dibike et al 2001 and its new models are called reference vector machines used by han et al 2002 svm implements a learning algorithm useful for recognizing subtle patterns in complex data sets vapnik and cortes 1995 svm is a learning system applied a high dimensional feature space instead of minimizing the observed training error support vector regression svr minimized the generalization error bound so as to obtain generalized performance there are two main categories for support vector machines support vector classification svc and svr the svr model is the most popular use form of svms support vector machines project the data into a higher dimensional space and maximize the margins between classes or minimize the error margin for regression cigizoglu 2003 one of the goals in svr is to find a function f x that has at most deviation from the actually obtained targets yi for all the training data support vector regression is the natural extension of large margin kernel methods cigizoglu and kisi 2005 used for classification to regression analysis the main relationship for statistical learning process is as follows rajaee and shahabi 2016 kakaei et al 2013 2 y f x i 1 m w i ϕ i x w ϕ x where the output of the model is the part of linear m and the converter is shown by the nonlinear model of φ x this equation is converted as the below for using the svm model kakaei et al 2013 3 y f x i 1 n w i k x i x b here k is the kernel function wi and b are parameters of the model n the total number of learning patterns and xi data vector for network learning and x is an independent vector the parameters of the model are determined by maximizing the objective of function 2 4 2 bibliographic review cimen 2008 used svm with gaussian rbf kernel in order to predict ssc for two rivers located in the usa results indicated that svm model can estimate sediment without producing negative values kisi 2012 examined least square support vector machine lssvm to estimate discharge ssc relationship results showed that the lssvm model is capable to produce better accurate than the ann models lssvm and ann models were accurate than the src model for the upstream station for the downstream station however src model perform better than the lssvm and ann models as well as performance of the models were compared to each other in prediction of downstream ssl data using data from both stations results showed that lssvm model is more efficient than the ann models and both models performed much better than the src model kakaei lafdani et al 2013 applied the nu svr using the four kernels including linear polynomial sigmoid and rbf and ann models based on bfgs algorithm and conjugate algorithm the reliability of all models were evaluated using performance criteria such as root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae efficiency index and correlation coefficient result showed that ann models and nu svr model has better performance than regression combination rashidi et al 2016 investigated gamma test gt for pre processing of input variables on performance of svm with two kernels rbf and polynomial in order to predict ssl the result of these models compared to anfis model result indicated gt method had suitable ability in identifying an optimal combination of input parameters in this direction zounemat kermani et al 2016 evaluated the ability of different data driven models including four different support vector regression svr model kernels l svm p svm rbf svm and sigmoid s svm and three ann model algorithms cgnn gdnn and bfgs to estimate daily ssl in rivers in the usa they found that the bfgs ann and rbf svr models outperformed the other models 2 4 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section demonstrates the following i svm can be used for classification and regression obtaining a mathematical model to predict parameter they can be applied to both linear and nonlinear problems ii several variants of svm like nu svr and ls svm offers more flexibility in modeling specific data oriented problems more studies have to be performed in order to develop strategies that can accommodate many of the problems that are still challenging for traditional predictive regression models rajaee et al 2020 iii svms are able of producing exact and robust classification results even when input data are non linearly separable while the ann is sensitive to the number of hidden nodes the svm is sensitive to the select of the mapping kernel and c parameter to solve a nonlinear problem svm uses the kernel trick this is equivalent to perform an embedding project data to a different space where data is linearly separable moreover the kernel trick only works for a set of possible embedding there exist several kernels implemented e g rbf polinomial histogram intersection chi2 the c parameter is one very important that controls the over fitting then for each different kernel have different extra parameters that define it it is very important to optimize all these parameters usually is done using grid techniques iv input vectors of svm are quite flexible hence various other influential factors such as temperature and discharge can be easily incorporated into the model v svms do not perform well on highly skewed imbalanced data sets these are training data sets in which the number of samples that fall in one of the classes far outnumbers those that are a member of the other class also svms are not efficient if the number of features is very huge in number compared to the training samples 2 5 other classification models 2 5 1 introductory of decision tree a model decision tree is a data driven algorithm quinlan 1992 built of a rule based predictive structure using a top down induction approach the tree is fitted to a training data set by splitting the data into homogeneous subsets based on the data attributes thereafter the tree is constructed with all training cases being predicted by the tree leaves i e each leave is a linear regression model which predicts continuous values for the numerical attributes the tree is then pruned bottom up and transformed into a set of if then rules which simplify the tree structure and thus improves its ability to classify new instances the predictive ability of the tree is measured using a correlation coefficient for the training and validation data sets the correlation coefficient equals one in case of a complete fit between measured values and model tree predictions one of the most popular and at the same time the simplest decision trees is the cart decision tree which has many applications in cart cart model as an innovative form of recursive partitioning that provides multivariate analysis is based on binary trees binary trees unlike the classification tree which divides the input space of multiple variables into subspaces with each subspace related to a particular class of output variable the regression tree does not create classes of dependent variables choubin et al 2018 since regression trees do not have pre assigned classes the output of this stage is a response value to each of the new observations for the dependent variable the splitting rule in regression trees is made by the squared residuals minimization algorithm which means that expected sum variances for two resulting nodes should be minimized 2 5 2 introductory of instance based learning ibl according to the definition of ibl method in khosravi et al 2018 ibl is an extension of the nearest neighbor algorithm which is characterized by the need for large storage space they can also be used to describe probabilistic concepts since it can produce graded matches for specific instances in ibl classification or prediction is made by combining observations from the training data set that are close to the new vector of inputs 2 5 3 bibliographic review goyal 2014 developed decision tree based m5 and wavelet regression models for estimation of sediment yield the result indicated that m5 model tree enhanced the accuracy in compression to other models choubin et al 2018 compared efficiency of cart model with other ai based models such as anfis mlp and two kernels of svm include of rbf svm and p svm models in this research nu regression nu svr employed with polynomial and radial basis function rbf as two kernels of svm for ssl predict the optimal values of the kernel parameters i e cost of constraint violation c epsilon ε and gamma γ must be identified in predicting by nu regression using rbf and polynomial kernels rashidi et al 2016 in this research optimum values of c ε and γ were determined by the trial and error method 2 5 4 result i decision trees can be visualized and explain with simple math no complex formulas ii decision trees forces the consideration of all possible outcomes of a decision and traces each path to a conclusion it creates a comprehensive analysis of the consequences along each branch and identifies decision nodes that need further analysis iii they require very little data preparation whereas other techniques often require data normalization the creation of dummy variables and the removal of blank values also they can handle multi output problems 3 various hybrid soft computing techniques for sediment modeling 3 1 introductory natural processes are very complex therefore it is sometimes not possible to create a single comprehensive model that sufficiently can capture the phenomenon behavior to overcome these problems it is possible to combine models in a given solution such models that work together to create a single solution are called hybrid models 3 1 1 wavelet ai models 3 1 1 1 brief description of wavelet transform wt wavelet approach is a time dependent spectral analysis that decomposes time series in the time frequency space to provide a timescale illustration of processes and their relationships daubechies 1990 it has been found that an appropriate data pre processing which employs wavelet analysis can lead to models that more sufficiently represent the true characteristics of the underlying system wt decomposing the time series into a set of base functions of various frequencies helps to improve the capability of a predictive model by capturing effective information at various resolution levels kim and valdes 2003 when applying wavelet transforms selecting the basis function called the mother wavelet is important from which the base functions are formed through a process of translating and dilating rajaee and jafari 2018 the wt is similar to the fourier transform in the sense that a time series is presented as a linear combination of some base functions for the wt the base functions are translations and dilations of one function called the mother wavelet the current study will not delve into the theory behind wavelet transform and only the main concepts of the discrete wavelet transform dwt are briefly presented a mathematical overview of wt and a review of applications are presented by labat et al 2000 the wt carry out the decomposition of a signal into a group to functions 4 ψ j k x 2 j 2 ψ j k 2 j x k where ψj k x is produced from a mother wavelet ψ x which i dilated by j and translated by k the mother wavelet has to satisfy the condition 5 ψ x d x 0 the discrete wavelet function of a signal f x can be calculated as follows 6 c j k f x ψ j k x d x 7 f x j k c j k ψ j k x where c j k is the approximate coefficient of a signal the mother wavelet is formulated from the scaling function φ x as 8 φ x 2 h 0 n φ 2 x n 9 ψ x 2 h 1 n φ 2 x n where h 1 n 1 n h 0 2 x n different sets of coefficients h 0 n can be found corresponding to wavelet bases with various characteristics in the dwt coefficients h 0 n play a critical role gupta and gupta 2007 3 1 1 2 wavelet artificial neural networks wann models the wann tries to combine the attributes of anns with the characteristics of the wavelet transform wavelet analysis methods for data pre process can be classified into either decomposition or reconstruction methods in decomposition the signal is decomposed into several levels and all the levels are considered as inputs to the ann models two levels of decomposition have been shown to be appropriate greater than two levels of decomposition may lead to low model efficiency ravansalar et al 2015 nourani et al 2009b in the decomposition full use of the time frequency characteristics of the signal is made with reconstruction through correlation analysis of the original output data the effective decomposed series are selected and summed to form a new series that acts as the input data partal and cigizoglu 2008 rajaee and broumand 2015 the steps of the reconstruction method are briefly summarized as i wavelet decomposition by discrete wavelet transforms the wavelet decomposition level was determined by the length of the time series and the trend performance at low frequency then the subcomponents were obtained by individually reconstructing single branches from wavelet coefficients ii selection of effective components by cross correlation analysis the cross correlation analyses were carried out between the subcomponents and the original sediment time series subcomponents with low cross correlation coefficients were discarded as noises and the derived components were retained iii new series for sediment was reconstructed by summing the derived components the reconstructed time series also referred to as de noised signals were then used as input data for ann modeling the performance of different hybrid wavelet based models such as ann wavelet model is very sensitive to the selection of the mother wavelet function ravansalar and rajaee 2015 daubechies 1992 3 1 1 3 wavelet neuro fuzzy wnf models wnf models based on wavelet analysis and nf have been proven effective for modeling nonlinear and non stationary time series signals in the wnf models the data pre processed by the wavelet analysis were entered into the nf model for this purpose the dyadic discrete wavelet transforms were used mallat 1989 when multi level sub signals are entered to the model as inputs the applied weights to them by nf model will be different at different levels so that high weights will be applied to the worthy level of the signal 3 1 1 4 wavelet based least square support vector machine wlssvm models the wlssvm model consists of a three layer structure so that the first layer is the sediment sub signals time series got by the wavelet transform lssvm can be employed to get the weights through training the wlssvm for nonlinear calculations this method captures useful information from the decomposed sub signals because of the influence of random and unknown factors measured time series data including hydrologic time series always include noise sang et al 2009a b the reconstruction pre processing can be used to de noise hydrologic time series data 3 1 1 5 wavelet emotional artificial neural networks weann models similar to wann model wavelet based data processing approach with the ability of multi resolution analysis was linked to the eann to improve the modeling performance this model was first proposed in sharghi et al 2019 the steps of the wenn method are described in detail by them 3 1 2 fuzzy genetic fg models fg models are improved by combining two methods fuzzy logic and gas in this method the fuzzy rule base is automatically set alike to the anfis system the parameters of the input and output membership functions are optimized using ga in the ga parameters are optimized by minimizing the objective function which is an error between model results and observed values 3 1 3 ensemble learning 3 1 3 1 bagging m5p an m5 model tree quinlan 1992 is a binary decision tree having linear regression functions at the terminal leaf nodes which can predict continuous numerical attributes tree based models are constructed by a divide and conquer method khosravi et al 2018 first used the bagging m5p method to predict sediment yield often known as ensemble learning models are bagging algorithms a major advantage of which is their ability to predict better than single models first the bagging technique considers a training dataset d which is sampled randomly with replacement to obtain a new size m training dataset di next the bootstrapped sample n will be used to produce the corresponding template n then the average output of the n models is determined to generate a combined model that usually performs better than the individual n model khosravi et al 2018 3 1 3 2 reduced error pruning tree rept the rept is a hybrid of the reduced error pruning model and decision tree algorithms the complexity of the rept have been reduced by rep pruning technique this method can eliminate tree branches and leaves without significantly affecting the classification accuracy of the model khosravi et al 2018 breslow and aha 1997 3 1 3 3 random committee rept one of the meta algorithm subsets is random committee algorithm a hybrid of base classifiers such as random tree can be constructed with this algorithm for help to estimate by a straight averaging probability prediction the algorithm can be performed by different iterations and seed number 3 1 3 4 random subspace rept ho 1998 developed random subspace as a classic integrated algorithm alike to the bagging algorithm its training subset is created from the original randomly selected training set mielniczuk and teisseyre 2014 xia et al 2015 which is the only way it differs from the bagging algorithm bertoni et al 2005 the features of each sub classifier at the final prediction is obtained through a combined voting method zhang and jia 2007 the efficiency of the sub classifiers depends on integrated learning differences the subcategories of the bagging method are used to determine the differences in the training performance of the sub classifiers and the adopted ensemble learning method is used to pool samples with different spatial characteristics to determine differences in the performances of the sub classifiers nanni and lumini 2008 3 1 4 heuristic regression methods 3 1 4 1 artificial bee colony abc abc algorithm simulating the intelligent foraging behavior of honey bee swarms is one of the most common swarm based optimization algorithms studies show that abc algorithm increases the interest in the implementation of many complex problems in real world ozkan et al 2011 the drawback of the abc algorithm is requirement of new fitness tests for the new parameters to improve performance ab wahab et al 2015 in the abc algorithm the foraging process consists of three groups of bees which are onlooker scout and employed bee in the process of the algorithm the first half of the colony comprises of employed bees and the second half consists of the onlookers karaboga and basturk 2007 3 1 4 2 teaching learning based optimization tlbo rao et al 2011 proposed a new algorithm based on the teacher s natural phenomenon and a new meta heuristic optimization algorithm tlbo they conclude the tlbo method is simpler than other advanced optimization techniques such as particle swarm optimization ant colony optimization and different evaluation but is also stronger than them rao et al 2012 rao et al 2011 created a model which used natural teaching learning process in class tlbo algorithm doesn t contain any specific controlling parameters while other evolutionary methods contain them the most commonly used evolutionary optimization technique is ga however ga provides a near optimal solution for a complex problem having a large number of variables and constraints this is mainly due to the difficulty in determining the optimum controlling parameters such as population size crossover rate and mutation rate a change in the algorithm parameters changes the effectiveness of the algorithm the same is the case with pso which uses inertia weight social and cognitive parameters similarly abc requires optimum controlling parameters of number of bees employed scout and onlookers limit etc hs requires the harmony memory consideration rate pitch adjusting rate and the number of improvisations tlbo is a new optimization technique which is free from the algorithm parameters i e no algorithm parameters are required for the working of this algorithm rao et al 2012 indicated that tlbo algorithm is better than the state of art methods when it is applied continuously nevertheless it can be considered as a drawback that the rate of convergence with respect to the elitist teaching learning opposition based algorithm method which is a new variant of tlbo is getting worse while dealing with high dimensional problems rajasekhar et al 2012 if the tlbo is used in the optimization process it requires only population size and number of generation as common controlling parameters in the tlbo the initial population which includes the actual number of students is randomly generated these students comprise of a number of design variables dede and ayvaz 2015 tlbo algorithm has two vital components which describe two basic modes of the learning teacher phase learning from the teacher and learning phase information exchange between learners during teacher phase students learn ınformation from their teacher by patterning teacher gives information to the learners and tries to enhance the mean level of the class students can teach up to the teacher only the person who is most experienced and knowledgeable in the class rao et al 2011 3 1 5 eemd ann model an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd consists of sifting an ensemble of white noise added signal time series and treats the mean as the final true result finite not infinitesimal amplitude white noise is necessary to force the ensemble to exhaust all possible solutions in the sifting process thus making the different scale signals to collate in the proper intrinsic mode functions imf dictated by the dyadic filter banks as eemd is a time space analysis method the added white noise is averaged out with sufficient number of trials the only persistent part that survives the averaging process is the component of the signal original data which is then treated as the true and more physical meaningful answer the effect of the added white noise is to provide a uniform reference frame in the time frequency space therefore the added noise collates the portion of the signal of comparable scale in one imf yang et al 2003a b the emd algorithm can be summarized as follows 1 identify all local extrema of x t and connect all local extrema with a cubic spline line to generate the upper eup and lower elow envelopes 2 calculate the mean of the envelopes by m t elow eup 2 3 extract the first component c t x t m t 4 check the details of c t and generate an imf with the residual m t x t c t by replacing x t when c t satisfies the two imf characteristics otherwise c t is not an imf and c t replaces x t and 5 repeat steps 1 4 until the stop criterion is met the steps of the emd method are described in detail by di et al 2014 and huang et al 2014 because eemd extract imfs that represent the variability of the original data at different time scales the hybrid eemd ann model can be used to simulate the ssc therefore for comparison imfs falling above the 95 confidence line and all residuals of the hydrological time series are also considered as inputs for the ann simulation also cross correlation analyses are performed between each imf component and residual of the time series 3 2 bibliographic review although ai methods have been used extensively as useful tools for prediction of hydrological variables they may also include some drawbacks in dealing with non stationary data in the past few years more attentions are paid to apply hybrid models so that application of hybrid models leads to better results in comparison with ai based models therefore some hybrid soft computing techniques which include different data preprocessing and combine techniques have been also developed to increase generalizability of single ai based methods here some of such hybrid models employed in sediment modeling are presented the hybrid models discussed here represent the joint application of ai based methods with the wt to enhance overall model performance yet over the course of the last 5 6 years several research have been published that developed hybrid wt and ann or anfis models in certain hydrological and environmental engineering applications wt provide helpful decompositions of raw data and wt data improve the capability of the estimation model by capturing effective information on various resolution levels wann model has been widely used in recent years to forecast ssl a non stationary signal can be decomposed into a certain number of stationary signals by wt then ann is combined with wavelet transform to improve the prediction accuracy zhou et al 2008 partal and cigizoglu 2008 forecasted the ssl in rivers using a hybrid wann method measured data were decomposed into wavelet components wt and the new wavelet series consisting of the sum of selected decomposed time series was used as input for the ann model kisi 2010a proposed wnf technique for estimating daily ssc estimation this model was developed by combining two methods ann and discrete wavelet transform the wnf and ann models were tested by applying to different input combinations of daily stream flow and ssl data of two stations on tongue river in montana the comparison results indicated that the discrete wt could increase the accuracy of ann model in ssl estimation mirbagheri et al 2010 presented a new approach based on an nf and wnf approach for prediction of ssc their wnf model satisfactorily predicted ssls underestimated by ann nf and src models alone overall the wnf model which used decomposed data to extract important characteristics embedded in the ssc signal outperformed other models that employed raw data the applied nf inference system in this research used a fuzzy inference model in which the membership function parameters are used to fit a given input output set by an optimization algorithm rajaee 2010 compared nf wnf mlr and src models in forecasting ssl the measured time series of discharge and ssl were decomposed into sub series with dwt and the effective sub series used as inputs to the nf the results showed that the performance of wnf model while nf mlr and src models provided unacceptable predictions rajaee et al 2010 explored the performance of wnf model for ssl forecasting in a larger area of study with a lower discharge and ssl amount which achieved promising results in a wild watershed the observed time series of river discharge and ssl were decomposed and the effective wavelet components were summed and used in the nf model results indicated that the wnf model efficiency was better in prediction compared to the nf and src models particularly in extreme value estimation moreover the model can be employed to simulate the hysteresis phenomenon while the src method was not able to handle the involved hysteresis in rajaee 2011 and rajaee et al 2011 authors applied ann and wavelet conjunction model to predict river ssl the purpose of conjunction of the wavelet and ann models is to improve the accuracy of suspended sediment prediction in this direct observed time series of discharge and sediment were decomposed into several sub time series by discrete wt nourani et al 2013 conjugated wavelet pre processing technique via ann model to forecast ssl the results revealed that chosen mother wavelet and resolution level directly affect the prediction results on the other hand the threshold value as well as so called factors is another challenging issue according to the obtained results high values of threshold do not necessarily guarantee accuracy and after a specific threshold value a reduction in the performance of the model was observed results presented that this procedure dramatically enhanced the accuracy while modeling stream flow ssl process liu et al 2013 constructed a wann model to predict ssc during the following day the measured river discharge and ssc original time series were decomposed into sub series using dwt effective sub series were selected by cross correlation analysis and added to reconstruct noise free time series to apply as ann inputs for ssc forecasting the wann model was more capable of predicting the highly non linear and non stationary ssc time series than ann and src models kisi and fedakar 2014 proposed fg approach so as to predict ssc in rivers for a given stream cross section the accuracy of fg models was compared with those of the anfis ann and src models the results of the comparison revealed that the fg approach outperformed the other models in the estimation of the ssc nourani et al 2014 developed an ann based stream flow sediment model by focusing on a wt to de noise hydrological time series on a daily scale de noised time series were using to the ann model to predict discharge and sediment time series the results indicated that the wavelet based de noising approach can improve the ann based stream flow sediment forecasting models sadeghpourhaji et al 2014 employed svm and combination of svm to wavelet for ssl prediction they used stream flow in inputs of models result showed that wavelet improved accuracy of svm model olyaie et al 2015 compared the accuracy of three different ai based models visa anns anfis wann and conventional src approaches for estimating the daily ssl in two gauging stations in the usa the comparison of estimation accuracies of different models showed that the wann was the most accurate model in comparison to other models nourani and andalib 2015 examined the wlssvm model for prediction of daily and monthly ssl in the first step ssl was predicted with lssvm and ann models then stream flow and ssl data were decomposed into sub signals via wavelet and decomposed sub time series were entered to lssvm and ann to simulate discharge ssl relationship the ability of wlssvm was compared with other models in ssl predictions the results showed that in daily ssl prediction lssvm has better than ann wlssvm and wann models showed same subsequences in daily and different in monthly ssl estimations shamaei and kaedi 2016 proposed a method called stacking to predict the ssc they compared performance of lgp ann nf methods with stacking model they used the case study and methods lgp ann nf similar to kisi and guven 2010 research the results demonstrated that stacking method is able to predict the ssc accurately ghose and samantaray 2018 used ga with bpnn and multiple regressions to predict ssc the result obtained in this study do not determine any linear relationship the comparison of estimation accuracies of different models showed that the ga bpnn was the most accurate model in comparison to ga regression and ann models khosravi et al 2018 compared performance of data mining models include of three stand alone models such as reduced error pruning tree rept mp5 and instance based learning ibl models and three hybrid models such as bagging m5p models the random committee rept and random subspace rept to predict ssl the result showed that hybrid models enhance the accuracy of predict and hybrid bagging m5p model was the best in the other models yilmaz et al 2018 evaluated various rms including abc tlbo cra and mars models to predicted ssl the result demonstrate that mars is the most accurate model altunkaynak 2009 conducted similar studies but used genetic algorithms to optimize solutions kisi and yaseen 2019 developed a new hybrid intelligence method based on ef including anfis sc anfis gp and anfis fcm models to estimate ssc the results showed the potential of the evolutionary fuzzy predictive model to mimic the ssc pattern with a high level of accuracy over the comparable models the ef demonstrates an effective predictive model over the other variant of the integrated anfis models for the investigated ecological disaster the ef s main merit in its integration with the genetic algorithm inspired by nature contrary to the anfis method the gradient descent algorithm is used to describe the mfs in which it is possible to face some drawbacks such as tapping into the local minima liu et al 2019 suggested eemd ann method as an improved approach to model nonlinear and non stationary time series they used hilbert huang transform hht to remove noise from of the ssc rainfall runoff and vegetation cover signals the ssc simulation performances of different methods were then compared they applied mlr ann eemd mlr and eemd ann models to simulate the ssc the results indicated that the ssc of the kuye river decreased as the rainfall runoff and ndvi increased from 2006 to 2010 result showed that using imfs and residuals components as input data improved performance of both the ann model and the mlr model sharghi et al 2019 as a novel technique investigated capability of a new generation of ann models namely eann and weann models for daily and monthly ssl modeling through comparing the results obtained it was found that using wt as a pre processing method for data could lead to more accurate ssl predictions the results of this study showed weann s superiority over wann model due to its eann base which includes a few hormonal emotional parameters that handle the model s emotional conditions by operating as dynamic weights which frequently give feedback to the other system components 3 3 result an evaluation of the published papers that have been reviewed in this sub section reveals the following i based on the reviewed papers the application of wavelets as a pre processing technique usually improves modeling performance after decomposition of the original signal to seasonal subseries at different scales via one of three scenarios the use of all decomposed time series as inputs of the ai model the use of only the dominant sub series as inputs of the ai model the use of the original sediment time series as the input of the ai model reconstructed by using only selected dominant sub series ii a wnf model which uses multi scale signals accompanied by the original signal as input data may present more skillful estimation rather than a single pattern input because it considers both the autocorrelation and seasonality features of the sediment discharge phenomenon the results showed that wnf provided not only a way of enhancing accuracy but also the ability to capture temporal trends in sediment it helps it to make significant improvements in forecast generation as a result the anfis model tends to be more able to capture the more complex and dynamic processes hidden within sediment information after with wdt iii the number of published papers on sediment modeling via wlssvm and fg is low which shows the need to develop the methods and relevant issues for sediment modeling iv the choice of appropriate type of mother wavelet and the number of decomposition levels are important in the analysis of time series by wt in the number of papers several important parameters such as wavelet decomposition level and wavelet filter type were not provided v in spite of the black box nature of ai methods the use of wavelet analysis with ai methods makes it possible to provide some insights into the physics of the process in both time and space by employing fuzzy and wavelet concepts connected to the ann framework the uncertainty and seasonality of the phenomena can respectively be better handled vi using the wavelet analysis to extract the input time series a greater understanding and ability to simulate sediment can be achieved the results of the studies explored in this section have revealed the good performance of wavelet ai models compared with other methods in accurately forecasting sediment vii a review of the literature shows that in recent years researchers have begun to use other new hybrid methods of soft computing in the yilmaz et al 2018 the mars method was used multivariate adaptive regression splines have been used for finding predictive models for difficult data mining problems i e when the predictor variables do not exhibit simple and or monotone relationships to the dependent variable of interest also mars does not require feature standardization and provide automated feature selection viii for nonlinear and non stationary ssc time series the hht also called empirical mode decomposition emd is an iterative procedure as effective filter for extracting the oscillatory like features at different time scales and it can significantly increase the simulation accuracy the main advantage of emd over wavelet convolution is the ability to estimate subtle changes in frequency estimating instantaneous frequency from a wavelet convolution is suboptimal because of frequency smoothing and because wavelet convolution assumes frequency stationary during the time span of the wavelet emd is also poorly suited for detecting relative suppressions of power at a specific frequency ix eann serves only a few hormonal weights that can lead to a good representation of irregular and extreme situations but when linked to the wavelet transformation leads to this study s most effective model x abc and tlbo algorithms are usually used to solve combinatorial optimization problems therefore yilmaz et al 2018 used them to optimize coefficients of regression equations used to estimate ssl although the models abc and tlbo are more predictive than traditional methods the mars model is even more exact and can be applied more easily 4 other sediment related analyzes 4 1 peak estimation the feasible estimation of the peak sediment values is the most important factor in any river management programs table 1 presents the details of the papers reviewed to examine the estimation of peak values according to table 1 it is evident that only 16 papers estimate the peak sediment values in this table the models used in the published papers are arranged in order on the basis of efficiency from left to right it was also found that wavelet based models are more efficient than other ai models in monitoring peak values 4 2 hysteresis modeling the interpretation of sediment hysteresis phenomenon has a long tradition in geomorphology and is regularly used to deduce geomorphic processes within a catchment and the distribution of sediment sources aich et al 2014 yeshaneh et al 2014 and fan et al 2013 as well as gao and josefson 2012 provide comprehensive overviews of studies that interpret the hysteresis between sediment and discharge however hysteresis patterns are ambiguous and typical patterns like clockwise or anti clockwise loops have been assigned to different phenomena depending on the characteristics and size of a catchment smith and dragovich 2009 number of researchers investigated the various models performances in capturing this event for example cigizoglu 2004 investigated the nf wnf and src models performances in capturing hysteresis event as it is seen nf and wnf models simulated the hysteresis event better than src method alp and cigizoglu 2007 showed that the hysteresis generated by ann simulations is more realistic than the mlr hysteresis plot it is clear that the mlr model does not capture the behavior of the measured ssl time series as strong as the considered two ann methods rajaee et al 2009 2010 2010 concluded the nf model has simulated the hysteresis better than other ann mlr and src models rajaee et al 2011 showed that the wnn model outperformed the other models acceptably simulated the hysteresis phenomenon while src method was incapable to handle the involved hysteresis rajaee 2011 showed that the wann model simulated the involved hysteresis better than the other models the ann model simulated the hysteresis only in one event while the src model was not able to simulate the hysteresis phenomenon wann model outperformed the other models acceptably simulated the hysteresis phenomenon while src method was not successfully in hysteresis regeneration mirbagheri et al 2010 indicated that wnf model simulated the hysteresis effect better than the ann nf and src models in this direction the wnf simulated the hysteresis shape and its simulation is rather unlike the observed time series the src method was not successfully in producing hysteresis whereas and ann and nf models can be capable of regenerating the hysteresis 5 general results and discussions 5 1 distribution of published papers the number of papers published between 2000 and 2019 in each year is shown in fig 2 there is a generally increasing trend in the number of papers published since 2001 even though there are some fluctuations with drops in the number of papers published in 2002 and 2003 6 papers were published in 2010 and 2013 compared with only one paper in 2001 as can be seen in fig 3 a review of published articles on sediment modeling shows the emergence of wavelet based methods since 2008 no wavelet ai based methods have been used in any of the articles reviewed so far only one article in 2008 shows the use of wann in 2009 no research has examined this issue from 2010 to 2019 12 articles examined the use of a variety of wavelet ai methods and demonstrated the superiority of these methods over other ai based methods among the reviewed papers about 19 13 papers of studies used hybrid wavelet models according to fig 3 the type of single ann model are some of the widely used models among various ai based models used for sediment modeling in rivers as can be seen among the 66 articles reviewed 56 times the neural network architectures have been modeled uniformly from year 2001 to year 2019 after the neural network nf is another common algorithm that has been modeled 28 times the research approaches in 2018 and 2019 are towards new combinatorial algorithms based on heuristic regression and ensemble learning in addition to wavelet based methods that have greatly improved the performance of single models the ema based method as one of the time series preprocessing methods is expected to attract many researchers 5 2 study areas fig 4 shows the number of published papers regarding ai applications in sediment modeling with respect to study area the study areas of the surveyed papers where the ai methods were used to predict sediment are mostly located in united states which indicates the presence of data recorded on the usgs web server http cida usgs gov sediment details of the surveyed papers including authors year of publication dependent and independent variables temporal scale number of training and testing set region of study drainage area station time span types of models unit of measure sediment and the best input are given in table 2 5 3 evaluation criteria in fig 5 displayed performance criteria that used to evaluate the sediment modeling in the published the most popular performance criteria were nash sutcliffe efficiency nse mean square error mse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r in many of the studies investigated more than one performance criterion was considered this is particularly the case for the model validation aspect of predictive validity it is desirable to use multiple validation criteria as a single model performance criterion alone is often unable to test the model s performance across the entire output range 5 4 other details of the surveyed papers 5 4 1 time step selection it is understood that the estimation of sediment transport phenomena depends on the input variables of the time series where the time series can be viewed in multiple scales such as daily weekly monthly and annual according to table 2 the majority of researchers applied a daily time scale in order to model the sediment modeling the largest number of these papers showed that the forecast is more reliable on a daily time scale than other time scales where the data value of variability on a daily time scale can provide a better view of the conduct of sediment transport in rivers the maximum value can also be seen on a daily scale it is notable that in their study all studies except seven used a daily time scale 5 4 2 input variables soft computing models are based on analyzing the data about a river in particular finding connections between the system state variables input internal and output variables without explicit knowledge of the basin physical behavior the selection of appropriate model inputs is very important to prediction as such due to the limitation in data availability it is essential to develop a sediment transport prediction model based on minimal input fig 6 displays the input variables used in the simulation of ai sediment according to the papers examined 56 papers used the sediment as an input factor between 66 papers also 4 papers without any other physical input variable are considered the sediment as a single auto correlated input variable according to fig 6 and table 2 the flow and discharge are two other parameters which were mostly selected for simulation of sediment 57 times the utilization of discharge as independent variables in modeling of the majority of studies improved accuracy in addition some hydrological time series such as rainfall temperature phase precipitation evapotranspiration velocity and humidity were also used in the reviewed papers as input variables other input variables used such as surface runoff watershed vulnerability index electrical conductivity uniform vegetation difference index etc were used to a lesser extent in the surveyed articles and it would indicate that some of them could not be easily accommodated at the input point although some of the hydrological time series were used more than the others during the input consideration process it should be noted that the choice of input data was mostly based on the availability of information in the study area instead of on a physical examination of the necessary data to order to obtain the correct input pattern for ai models it is suggest to carry out a statistical analysis and to general a correlation analysis with different data before using them for modeling another method that can be used to find out the effect of exogenous factors on sediment changes is the entropy wavelet criterion for example in nourani et al 2015 work s to optimize the input layer and improve the efficiency of the plain s ann based gwl modeling the gwl data were pre processed spatially and temporarily using and temporarily using a newly proposed approach involving the principles of entropy som and wt 5 4 3 lead time one of the important concerns in sediment forecasting is the selection of a proper lead time as can be seen in table 2 in most of the reviewed articles analytical techniques such as correlation analysis or principal component analysis have been used to obtain the appropriate lag time step as input to the model on a daily time scale it was considered that longer lead times e g more than 2 days for sediment forecasting using ai approaches could not lead to accurate forecasting results while 1 or 2 day ahead forecasting was usually more effective 5 4 4 unit of measure sediment as can be seen from table 2 units of measure sediment in these papers included mg l ton ton day kg m3 kg l kg day the ton day and mg l were two units that were commonly used in measuring sediment furthermore table 2 compares the type of utilized ai techniques and applied hydrological variables of the reviewed papers 5 4 5 study areas and type of basins details of the basin stations and examined rivers are presented in table 2 the drainage area is directly related to hydrological reactions the smaller the area the more severe the hydrological reactions studies show that despite drastic changes in the physical conditions of the basins especially drainage area ai based models independent of the physical conditions have good accuracy 5 4 6 data division a data driven model can locate the relationship between a system s inputs and outputs using a training data set that is representative of all the behavior found in the system selecting a training and testing set is an important issue that does not have any specific guidelines usually the data can be divided into three parts train sets are part of the actual data used to train the model for example weights and biases on the neural network the validation set is used to evaluate a given model but this is for frequent evaluation in data driven models used this data to fine tune the model hyper parameters hence the model occasionally sees this data but never does it learn from this the test set is generally what is used to evaluate competing models many times the validation set is used as the test set fig 7 the majority of reviewed papers two parts of data division training and testing sets while a few papers included the validation set as can be seen from fig 8 in these reviews the testing set was considered in training set as can be seen from fig 8 there is anything ideal ratio for splitting a dataset authors considered different ratios i e 80 20 70 30 65 35 etc and to pick the ratio that gives the best performance result among 66 reviewed papers the training set has been included from 50 to 90 of the total data with an average of approximately 70 usually more data particularly for training will improve overall model efficiency giving a better probability of locating the global minimum of error feature if there is no overtraining during training however there are some examples where we may not even be able to gather 72 data to train the model such as the ardiclioglu et al 2007 monthly sediment results there was no specific guideline on how to get the best size of samples needed for ai modeling in the all 66 reviewed papers it can be concluded that there is a trial or error trial using the available data the fig 9 shows the steps that most papers followed to predict sediment 6 conclusions according to research conducted in the past years intelligence methods through an amalgamation of probabilistic statistical and optimization techniques into the computing sediment have presented a suitable substitute for traditional mathematical techniques this contribution provides a review of the most recent ai based models applications in this field in the current review 66 papers used ai based models with great operational or forecasting ability in order to model sediment i temporal resolution is an important factor in accuracy of modeling the results indicate that the majority of researchers applied a daily time scale to sediment modeling among the published papers only 7 papers have applied monthly time steps as well as only 1 paper was found to have used hourly time step and no paper was found to have used weekly time step which can be due to the availability of daily sediment data compared to other time steps the authors concluded performance of the monthly in comparison of daily simulations is poor also it can be due to the availability of shorter length of time series for training and lower correlation of monthly sediment data another reason is that the daily pattern of sediment provides comprehensive information on the phenomenon clearly the possibility of precise modeling is increased ii it can be found that past steps of the sediment time series is the most frequently used input for ai models that forecast sediment other hydrological time series such as flow rainfall and temperature have also been frequently used as appropriate inputs in many papers among the surveyed papers 48 of the studies which used ai methods to predict sediment were located in united states iii examination of the articles showed issues in relation to the desirable division of the observed data data pre processing and the select the appropriate model inputs are rarely considered among the articles examined several evaluation determinants i e r rmse mse mae nse and e were used to analyze models in the majority of reviewed papers evaluation efficiency criteria including the nash sutcliff coefficient mae and rmse were used to evaluate the model performance iv the result showed the mlr method in comparison with the intelligence models it was not an accurate model this may refer to linear substance of the mlr method whereas non linear characteristics with help the ann and nf models can be detected and captured non linear features of phenomenon in contrast to regression based models ai based models use the advantage of multiple adjustable parameters and configurations therefore they are prone to problems of over fitting v in the published papers different type of ann approaches have been used results indicate that the mlp algorithms were most common in evaluation of the performance of the ann architectures in majority of papers the optimum number of nodes in the hidden layer was determined through a trial and error process the result showed that ann performance is better than mlr for all the researches simulations according to obtained result although the use of anns has allowed significant progress in the estimation of sediment there is still a need for more sensitive estimation methods also although the ann approach has some disadvantages and limitations in clouding over fitting local minima slow learning speed and difficulty capturing the time series high complexity non stationary dynamism and non linearity ann s modeling output was consistently satisfactory we predict that the effectiveness of ann in the future is likely to be improved with further studies to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks and limitations as in a study conducted by sharghi et al 2019 a eann approach was developed to improve neural network performance vi the comparison results in majority of published papers indicated that the gp is superior to the anfis ann and svm models in estimating sediment the results obtained in this study also indicated that the ann and svm methods may produce negative approximations for some of the low sediments whereas gp estimates are all positive and close to observations the results obtained with gp models are better than those obtained using the classic models and confirm the ability of this approach to provide a useful tool in solving specific problems in hydrology in the other words the gp model due to explicit and stochastic search ability can be used and harnessed by anyone not necessarily being familiar with gp in regards to the calibration of sediment models in general the results illustrated that nf model presents outperforms ann and svm models in sediment prediction vii the literature results reviewed here showed that ai models were powerful tools to model the sediment and could provide a better estimation than traditional approaches although used of single ai based models has usually allowed significant progress in the estimation of sediment but results illustrated the advantage of wavelet ai models in simultaneous consideration of several short and long term seasonality s in the modeling process which may lead to better estimation of peak points therefore to overcome the disadvantages of a single method combination and coupling are effective approaches the wavelet transform improve the ai based modeling performance in addition to extracting non stationary and multi scale features of time series various studies have manifested the better performance of wavelet ai models in analyzing the variability and complexity of hydrologic variables compared with single ai methods according to the published papers the conjunction models based on wavelet transform including wann model wnf model and wllsvm model detected wann models based on wavelet analysis and ann have proven effective for modeling non linear and non stationary time series signals this method captures effective information from the decomposed sub signals it is evident that extreme or peak values in the sediment time series which occur in a periodic pattern can be detected by the seasonal models wnf models can model such extreme values more accurately due to more compatibility with the uncertainty complex by using fuzzy and wavelet concepts connected to the ann framework the uncertainty and seasonality of the phenomena can be handled more successfully the selection of an efficient mother wavelet and decomposition levels are two important issues at the first stage in several papers such as rajaee 2010 rajaee 2011 nourani and andalib 2015 details of decomposition level and types of mother wavelets have been presented in these studies the efficiency and accuracy of sediment models using a wavelet ai method has been compared to single ai or regression based models viii among the published papers only 2 paper uses wllsvm model to estimate the sediment nourani et al 2015 sadeghpourhaji et al 2014 the results obtained in this study indicated that wlssvm performed better than wann where wlssvm and wann showed more robust performances than ad hoc lssvm and ann models the reviewed papers revealed that all of studies used the dwt for decomposing hydrological time series this can be related to the nature of sediment which is less stochastic thus dwt is more suitable than continuous wavelet transform cwt which generates much more redundant information ix one of the important issues in sediment modeling is the accurate modeling of peak values in water resources and environmental management result showed the wavelet based models are more efficient in monitoring peak values than ai models alone i e ann gp svm and anfis x comparisons showed that one of the important issues in sediment modeling is the hysteresis which is related to the season or month of occurrence thus the using of single ai models is not adequate in the presence of hysteresis phenomenon in this regard the application of the hybrid models which considers the seasonality of the hysteresis process is useful xi in general we can say the train test validation split ratio is also quite specific to each modeling and it gets easier to make a judgment as train and build more and more models 7 recommendations for future research based on the review of almost 66 papers the following recommendations for future research might prove helpful 1 due to the paucity of papers in the field of sediment modeling via hybrid models it is suggested that additional research be conducted on this topic 2 in addition to the ability of wavelet ai models they can also be linked to numerical based models such as wavelet weighted residual method wavelet finite element method wavelet boundary element and wavelet mesh less method to develop integrated modular models ramezani et al 2019 3 the presented ai models could be used to simulate hourly and event based sediment time series 4 several evolutionary algorithms such as gas and simulated annealing algorithms have been conducted in parameter selection but these algorithms often suffer from the possibility of being trapped in the local optima further investigation into hybridizing swarm intelligence si technique as well as relatively new optimization techniques namely artificial bee colony abc artificial fish swarm algorithm afsa ant colony optimization with ann aco and wavelet are recommended to obtain satisfactory global optimal results which facilitates the selection of optimal parameters for ann 5 further research on other field such as estimation of rainfall run off lake water level and combination of ai models with other commonly used data pre post processing techniques are highly recommended as well 6 further investigation into the use of suitable techniques such as wavelet entropy partial mutual information and fractal dimension for estimation of temporal evolution and quantification of the amount of complexity of hydrologic systems are also recommended wavelet measures such as shannon entropy mutual information content and relative entropy can be calculated based on wavelet analysis results of hydrologic series 7 in the reviewed papers the way the model inputs were determined was generally described well however some of the methods used raise considerable doubt about the optimality of the model inputs obtained in the majority of papers the input variables were chosen using a priori knowledge future research is suggested to consider other optimal ways to select model inputs such as entropy energy 8 more studies have to be performed in order to develop strategies that can accommodate many of the problems that are still challenging for traditional predictive regression models rm 9 maroufpoor et al 2019 proposed a newly developed hybrid intelligent model namely anfis gwo for soil moisture prediction it is suggested to be similar to work of maroufpoor et al 2019 a anfis gwo grey wolf optimizer algorithm model can be developed for sediment modeling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5352,floods are widespread natural disasters having significant socio economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management strategies flood modelling is an enduring challenge especially over the data sparse mountainous regions such as the himalayas due to the lack of accurate rainfall measurements global datasets are often employed for flood modelling however their applicability over the himalayan terrain is still uncertain in this regard the weather research and forecasting wrf numerical weather prediction model is increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates this work aims at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets satellite product and the wrf model to represent heavy rainfall over the himalayan terrain further these datasets are used to drive the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model to assess their ability to reconstruct floods in the himalayan region a rainfall flood skill score rfss is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the region the range of rfss can vary from to 1 with positive values as the desired value the analysis is conducted over the upstream part of the upper ganga basin spanning from high elevation mountains to the foothills of the himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that caused flooding in the region quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets in terms of bias rmse and scale errors shows high spatial variability with different datasets performing differently over various regions of the study area the topography is observed to influence the performance of rainfall datasets based on the error metrics it is found that the rainfall simulated using the wrf model exhibits least error in high elevation and valley regions of the himalayas whereas tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr in some cases datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the himalayas on forcing the vic model with these datasets the wrf model with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest rfss score of 0

process dimri et al 2016 ray et al 2019 this is further complicated by the fact that obtaining accurate and timely knowledge of rainfall in such regions is challenging due to high space time variability in the rainfall regime rain gauges provide accurate point measurements of the rainfall for flood modelling however there are several shortcomings with the gauge data particularly for heavy rainfall events and consequent flood analysis in the mountainous regions rain gauges may get destroyed during heavy rainfall events and they may be sparsely located in the complex terrain with high elevation therefore may not provide the complete areal extent of the rainfall in the region to circumvent these issues gridded precipitation data products are being developed using three research approaches i satellite based gridded precipitation ii atmospheric reanalysis with assimilation of observations in the climate models and iii numerical weather prediction models xu et al 2019 an intercomparison between the rainfall obtained from these three approaches is still an active area of research the global reanalysis datasets and satellite rainfall products are often considered as a proxy to observations kalnay et al 1996 banerjee et al 2020 in the hydrologic models to simulate floods andreadis et al 2017 hong et al 2007 pappenberger et al 2012 seyyedi et al 2015 due to their high spatial and temporal coverage although these datasets are successfully employed in several studies for flood modelling their applicability over data scarce mountainous terrain is still unclear ward et al 2011 evaluated the performance of different reanalysis and satellite products to simulate rainfall over the tropical andes mountains and inferred that although all the products are capable of representing the seasonal rainfall high biases exist in daily and monthly simulations shah and mishra 2014 found high biases in rainfall estimates from the reanalysis products during the monsoon season over india rana et al 2015 reported that satellite rainfall product performs better than the reanalysis datasets in capturing the summer monsoon rainfall variability in india especially over the mountainous regions kishore et al 2016 observed reasonable performance of different reanalysis datasets in representing spatio temporal patterns of rainfall over india ghodichore et al 2018 identified that most of the reanalysis products fail to correctly reproduce the spatio temporal trends in rainfall over india reanalysis datasets were noticed to perform satisfactorily in reproducing the climatology and interannual variability of east asian summer monsoon precipitation by huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2009 established that on a synoptic scale the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa data could reasonably depict the heavy rainfall pattern and intensity in the himalayan foothills particularly for the uttarakhand state in india banerjee et al 2020 noticed that the trmm 3b42 data underestimates rainfall above 3 mm day in comparison to the india meteorological department imd gridded data from the literature it is evident that there is no clear consensus on the usability of the reanalysis datasets and the satellite products over the mountainous terrains instead they are associated with substantial uncertainty with regard to the rainfall estimates aghakouchak et al 2009 bosilovich et al 2008 hong et al 2006 furthermore physical processes that control the spatial and temporal distribution of heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas are poorly understood at the scales relevant for flood modelling zhang and smith 2003 therefore it is necessary to evaluate these datasets before employing them in the hydrologic models for flood discharge simulations the numerical weather prediction nwp models are increasingly used to simulate rainfall in complex terrain regions chawla et al 2018 chevuturi et al 2015 chevuturi and dimri 2016 givati et al 2011 hong and lee 2009 li et al 2017 lo et al 2008 marteau et al 2015 srinivas et al 2013 silverman et al 2013 thayyen et al 2013 during recent decades due to advancements in the high performance computation significant developments have taken place in the nwp models in terms of sophisticated physics parametrization options and improved horizontal resolution as a result the new generation nwp models are skillful and may provide realistic estimates of high intensity rainfall at a fine spatial resolution however obtaining accurate rainfall estimates over the mountainous areas such as the himalayas and at a scale relevant for flood modelling continue to be a challenge to the research community argüeso et al 2012 chevuturi and dimri 2016 karki et al 2017 nam et al 2014 raju et al 2015 sikder and hossain 2016 yucel and onen 2014 further it is widely agreed that nwp models at high spatial resolution may be suitable for simulation of extreme rainfall events givati et al 2011 roberts et al 2009 weisman et al 2008 chevuturi et al 2015 chevuturi and dimri 2016 there is a need to examine this assumption over the mountainous regions in this paper the advanced research version of the weather research and forecasting wrf nwp model skamarock and klemp 2008 is assessed for its ability to simulate heavy rainfall events over the himalayan terrain the details of the wrf model structure are presented in section 2 2 a key aspect of this paper is to reconstruct floods in the data sparse himalayan region for this the aforementioned rainfall datasets are used to drive a calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model liang et al 1994 the calibration and validation of the vic model are discussed in detail in section 2 3 the errors present in the rainfall datasets may get accumulated in the flood simulations obtained from the model therefore it is necessary to quantify the errors in the flood simulations in association with the errors in the rainfall datasets there are several indices reported in the literature to evaluate the performance of either rainfall datasets or simulated discharges however to the best of our knowledge there is no single index that takes into account the errors from both the variables simultaneously particularly for flood estimation case in addition to this most of the performance evaluation indices reported in the literature are used for data with long record length the prime focus of this work is on the extreme events which are of short duration rendering the generally used indices unusable to address these shortcomings a new skill score termed as rainfall flood skill score rfss is developed in this paper the details of the rfss are provided in section 2 4 based on rfss measure different rainfall datasets are ranked in order of their ability to simulate flood discharges in the study region with this background the general aim of this work is to identify datasets that can best represent the rainfall over the data sparse himalayan terrain and thereby can be used for flood modelling to achieve this the following specific objectives are undertaken first provide an intercomparison between different rainfall datasets over the study region second provide a guideline for the reliability and usability of different datasets over the data sparse himalayan terrain third rank different datasets with respect to their ability to simulate floods in the region the following sub section describes the study region and the events considered for the analysis subsequently in section 2 the data and the models used in this work are presented 1 1 study area the upstream part of the upper ganga basin up ugb extending from the high elevation mountains to the foothills of the himalayas in northern india is selected as the region of interest for the assessment fig 1 owing to its geographical location the up ugb experiences extremely heavy rainfall and is highly vulnerable to flooding causing devastating effects on life and property satendra et al 2014 the region is approximately 23 000 sq km in area encompassing the origin point of river ganga in india and is of great socio economic importance to the country the up ugb is high in altitude and exhibits significant variability in the topography with elevation varying between 250 m and 7800 m above mean sea level fig 1 due to the lack of accessibility there are very few rain gauge stations in this area which are mostly concentrated in the foothills making it a data sparse region and thus crucial for this analysis dense and scrub forests are the dominant land use lu types in the region chawla and mujumdar 2015 for analysis the region is divided into four zones north west n w north east n e south west s e and south west s w as indicated in fig 1 for the analysis three heavy rainfall events which caused flooding in the up ugb satendra et al 2014 are selected the events are selected in such a manner that they cover the monsoon months june july august and september and also have a different nature of cause this may provide insight to the effectiveness of rainfall datasets in representing different types of events which may subsequently influence the flood discharge simulations details pertaining to these events are listed in table 1 it is to be noted that there are other flood events that occurred in the region post 2013 but to align with the available hydro meteorological data only three events are selected 2 data and methods 2 1 rainfall datasets 2 1 1 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa product 3b42 the near real time rt tmpa product is available since january 1998 at three hourly temporal scale and is intended to provide reliable rainfall estimates within the latitude band 50 n s at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution huffman et al 2007 the tmpa product is created by using two sets of data first passive microwave data including microwave imager tmi special sensor microwave imager ssm i advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e and the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b second infrared ir data collected by the geosynchronous satellites further details regarding the preparation of the tmpa dataset can be obtained from huffman et al 2007 for the present work 3b42rt level 3 tmpa product aggregated to the daily time scale is considered for evaluation 2 1 2 retrospective analysis or reanalysis products the global reanalysis datasets provide a gridded representation of the atmospheric processes and are produced by assimilating observations from multiple sources into the climate models at every 6 12 h duration making them a viable option for climate studies bosilovich et al 2011 saha et al 2010 in the present work four reanalysis datasets namely a national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr b ncep final fnl c japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 and d modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 are considered the cfsr data available from 1979 to present at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 at 6 hour interval saha et al 2010 it is a coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system expected to provide best estimates of the atmospheric states at high resolution globally and for a long period initial cfsr data version ds093 0 is available from 1979 to march 2011 and then extended to version 2 cfsr v ds094 0 from march 2011 to the present saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 in this work both ds093 0 and ds094 0 versions are used and referred to as the cfsr dataset the ncep fnl final is an operational global analysis data available at 1 1 resolution at a 6 hour interval from 1999 to present the dataset is generated from the global data assimilation system gdas using observations from the global telecommunication system gts and other sources it is produced from the same climate model that is used in global forecast system gfs but an hour later after gfs is initialized to employ more observational data the jra 55 hereafter referred as jra available from 1958 to present at 0 562 0 562 resolution at a 6 hourly interval is an improvement over the jra 25 years reanalysis product by increasing resolution incorporating new radiation scheme 4d var data assimilating system variation bias correction for satellite radiances and considering greenhouse gases with time varying concentrations the merra2 data available from 1980 to present at an hourly scale at 0 5 0 625 resolution is produced by the nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao the merra2 aims at providing a regularly gridded homogeneous record of the global atmosphere and incorporate trace gas constituents stratospheric ozone and improve land surface representation and cryospheric processes to achieve integrated earth system analysis for evaluating the aforementioned rainfall datasets the daily observed rainfall data from 17 rain gauges fig 1iii for the event durations as mentioned in table 1 three events are procured from meteorological centre dehradun india meteorological department imd 2 2 the weather research and forecasting wrf model the advanced research core of the wrf model version 3 8 used in this study is a fully compressible non hydrostatic mesoscale model with versatility in the selection of horizontal grid resolution and physics parameterization schemes designed for reliable simulation of the atmospheric processes the model allows multiple nesting options to obtain climate information at high resolution further details related to the wrf model can be obtained from skamarock and klemp 2008 the model is initiated by considering large scale atmospheric fields as input for boundary conditions from reanalysis datasets in this work the initial and boundary conditions for the wrf model are taken from the ncep fnl global analysis data available at a resolution of 1 1 at six hours interval 00 06 12 and 18 utc coordinated universal time these large scale conditions are regridded to the model domains considering the horizontal grid spacing and regional topography information the configuration of three one way nested domains in the wrf model is considered in this work the purpose of nesting is to obtain rainfall at high resolution as accurately as possible over the study region lo et al 2008 the outermost domain or the parent domain domain 1 wrf d01 covers almost the whole of india 11 42 n and 63 97 e at 27 km grid spacing domain 2 wrf d02 covers most parts of the ganga basin 23 35 n and 70 84 e at 9 km spacing and domain 3 wrf d03 focuses exclusively on the up ugb 29 33 n and 77 81 e at 3 km spacing fig 1 the wrf d01 provides lateral boundary conditions to both the inner domains the model time step which is a function of grid resolution is considered to be 135 s 45 s and 15 s respectively for the three wrf domains the model is initialized independently for each event considering fixed sea surface temperature sst throughout the integration and lateral boundary conditions are updated at every 6 hour interval the vertical profile is divided into 30 pressure levels with the model top fixed at 50 hpa moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis international geosphere biosphere programme igbp 21 category landuse cover fields available with a horizontal grid spacing of 10 min is used to provide the land surface boundary conditions several physics parametrization options are available in the wrf model for customization however chawla et al 2018 noted that there is no known wrf model set up that can best simulate heavy rainfall events over the himalayan region in this regard chawla et al 2018 tested four microphysics mp schemes two cumulus cu parameterization schemes two planetary boundary layer pbl schemes and two land surface models lsms it was found that goddard microphysics mellor yamada janjic pbl and betts miller janjic cu parameterization schemes along with noah lsm perform best in simulating extreme rainfall events over the up ugb the noah lsm is a fairly detailed model with a single canopy layer and canopy resistance scheme of noilhan and planton 1989 and four soil layers at 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m this configuration is selected to simulate the rainfall for all the three events under investigation the longwave radiation parameterization is based on the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm mlawer et al 1997 and the shortwave radiation parameterization scheme is based on dudhia dudhia 1989 the wrf model is executed independently for each of the three events table 1 under consideration the wrf model is started at least 24 h prior to the first event day to take into account the effect of model initialization the rainfall simulated at different wrf domain resolutions is evaluated against the observed gauge data and also considered as an input to the vic model for generating the flood discharges 2 3 the variable infiltration capacity vic model set up calibration and validation the variable infiltration capacity vic is a semi distributed soil vegetation atmosphere transfer macroscale model which solves the water and the energy balance over a gridded domain liang et al 1994 each grid is divided into multiple tiles based on the vegetation type and generates a different hydrologic response in the form of infiltration soil moisture storage runoff and evaporation therefore taking into account the sub grid variability the sub surface is represented by three soil layers which are responsible for the generation of surface runoff through infiltration and baseflow upon conclusion of the vic model execution the runoff and baseflow generated by each grid are transported to the edge of the grid cell from where they are routed to the watershed outlet using the 1 d lohmann s routing model lohmann et al 1998 the vic model version 4 2 c in conjugation with the routing model is implemented at 0 5 spatial resolution to simulate the flood discharges in the up ugb since the focus of this paper is on the flood discharge simulations the vic model is executed in the water balance mode the observed discharge is available at the bhimgodha station fig 1 from the year 1987 to 2005 and is therefore considered as the outlet of the region a total of 15 vic model grids covered the up ugb region and topographic soil meteorology and lu information are obtained for each of the grid cell the elevation information is derived from the aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer dem digital elevation model data available at 30 m resolution the lu information of the year 2011 which is obtained by classifying the landsat satellite imageries chawla and mujumdar 2015 is considered for the simulations since all the events under investigation are corresponding to the years 2010 and 2013 the lu is assumed not to vary significantly across the events digital soil map for the up ugb procured from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup india was available with the soil texture information of different soil layers in the region the texture information is used to obtain soil parameters such as porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity field capacity wilting point etc using transfer function equations given by cosby et al 1984 apart from the parameters that can be obtained using the texture details certain parameters are subject to model calibration as it is difficult to determine their values based on soil properties xie et al 2007 these are mainly three parameters namely infiltration curve parameter b which controls the amount of water that can infiltrate into the soil the fraction of maximum baseflow ds and the fraction of maximum soil moisture at which nonlinear baseflow is initiated ws to calibrate and validate the vic model gridded meteorological data corresponding to rainfall maximum temperature and minimum temperature for the period 1987 2005 at daily timescales is procured from the indian meteorological department imd the gridded meteorological data represents the observed conditions imd created the gridded daily rainfall dataset for india using the rain gauge information and is available at 0 25 resolution pai et al 2014 from these grid points the locations which match with the vic grids at 0 5 resolution are selected gridded daily temperature dataset is available at 1 resolution which is further re gridded using the bilinear interpolation method to 0 5 resolution to make is consistent with the resolution of the vic model the wind speed dataset at 0 5 resolution is extracted from the princeton university database sheffield et al 2006 it has been generally agreed that the hydrologic model set up over the long term monthly or annual records may not be useful for simulating peak discharges chawla and mujumdar 2017 since the focus of this work is to simulate flood discharges accurately the model calibration is carried out with respect to the annual maximum discharge values for the years 1987 1999 at the bhimgodha station it is expected that the model set up and calibrated for the annual maximum discharge time series would be able to reproduce the flood discharges the values of the three vic model calibration parameters b ds ws obtained from the model calibration phase were validated by simulating annual maximum discharge for the years 2000 2005 the comparison between the observed and simulated annual maximum discharges is carried out using correlation coefficient r2 normalized root mean squared error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and bias β the corresponding results are provided in table 2 and fig 2 the calibration and validation results indicate that there is a significant correlation between the simulated and observed discharges with very less bias less than5 in both cases therefore the vic model with the parameter values as mentioned in table 2 is considered to perform reasonably well in simulating the flood discharges and is further used to simulate the three events table 1 for simulating the selected events the rainfall forcing data is considered from three sources i wrf simulations ii reanalysis datasets and iii tmpa product the temperature and the wind speed fields are considered from the cfsr reanalysis dataset to force the model with different input rainfall datasets and make the model output i e flood discharges comparable the following three main challenges were addressed i model initialization ii difference in the spatial scales of the forcing datasets and the vic model resolution and iii difference in the temporal scales of forcing datasets and model execution for initialization the vic model is run 15 days prior to the first day of the event using forcings from the imd gridded data and the initial soil moisture from the level 3 version 300 dataset of european space agency s soil moisture ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2012 since the satellite soil moisture retrievals are used to drive the vic model the 15 days time period is assumed to be sufficient for model spin up the model initialization is carried out similarly for all the forcing datasets to address the issue of difference in the spatial scales across different datasets and the vic models the datasets such as the three wrf domains tmpa and cfsr which are at either finer or similar resolution as of the vic model the grid points closest to the vic model grid points are considered the jra and merra2 datasets had a slight offset from the vic model grid point locations and therefore interpolated using the inverse distance weighted average idwa method the ncep fnl dataset being at the coarse resolution of 1 was re gridded using the bilinear interpolation method to make it compatible with the vic model resolution the vic model in this work is executed at daily scale while the forcing datasets were available at sub daily scale to address this difference in the temporal scales the rainfall output from different datasets was aggregated to daily scale and then supplied to the vic model it is to be noted that no bias correction of the rainfall datasets is carried out to ensure that the datasets are independent of any in situ observations 2 4 the rainfall flood skill score rfss it is necessary to assess the accuracy and usefulness of various rainfall datasets to simulate floods conventional verification measures such as bias root mean square error rmse correlation mean absolute error etc are commonly used to quantify the performance of a single predicted variable such as rainfall or discharge against the observed data however the objective of this work is to evaluate errors in simulated discharge with reference to the errors in the rainfall datasets with a focus on the extreme events therefore most of the traditional metrics may not deem suitable in this case this motivated us to propose a new metric in this work termed as rainfall flood skill score rfss the rfss is based on the brier skill score brier 1950 which compares the probability functions of forecasted or predicted data to the reference data in the past there have been several modifications to the brier skill score to incorporate errors in the observed and the forecasted data mittermaier et al 2013 weigel et al 2007 to further make the skill score application specific for the case of extreme events normalized squared sum of error nsse between the predicted and observed data is considered as the measure wherein nsse in the simulated discharge is related to the nsse in the rainfall dataset the proposed measure will assist in getting an indication on the extent of error induced by the hydrological model while simulating floods with respect to errors in rainfall simulations based on this the rfss is given by the eqs 1 3 1 rfss 1 nss e discharge nss e rainfall where 2 nss e discharge i 1 n q si m i q ob s i 2 i 1 n q ob s i 2 3 nss e rainfall i 1 n p si m i p ob s i 2 i 1 n p ob s i 2 where q sim represent simulated discharge at the outlet q obs represent the observed discharge at the outlet p sim is the rainfall simulated estimated by a given dataset averaged over the region and p obs is the observed rainfall averaged over the region n is the number of days in a particular extreme event the squared error formulation of nsse eqs 2 and 3 helps in magnifying the errors thereby facilitating the analysis of the datasets when dealing with extreme events further dividing the squared sum of errors with the square of the observed data normalizes the errors making nss e discharge comparable to nss e rainfall this leads to the rfss measure as unitless with the range varying from 1 the negative rfss values i e rfss less than 0 indicate that the nsse in the discharge is higher than the nsse in the rainfall dataset this may imply either ill simulation of discharge by the hydrological model or significant propagation of errors from the input data to the hydrological model output a high negative value of rfss may indicate the need to improve the hydrological model a zero value of rfss suggests that nsse in discharge is the same as nsse in the rainfall dataset and no additional errors bias is being added by the hydrological model a positive value of rfss 0 rfss 1 indicates nsse in discharge to be less than nsse in rainfall this can be attributed to two factors first the hydrological model is well calibrated and is able to perform satisfactorily second the lessened effect of the spatial distribution of rainfall on discharge discharge is a point variable which is computed at the outlet rainfall on the other hand varies spatially and is averaged over the region to obtain an error value due to varying spatial characteristics of the rainfall its errors are also likely to vary spatially resulting in a few locations or grids in the rainfall product which may have a high error if these grids are crucial for the discharge regime of the catchment the errors in the rainfall datasets can significantly impact the errors in the simulated flood discharges under such situations high nsse in rainfall can get propagated as high nsse in discharge and vice versa however low nsse in discharge compared to that of rainfall may indicate that high error bias in rainfall at a few locations in the region does not significantly affect the discharge regime of the region it is to be noted that there can be inconsistencies in the observed data which are not possible to validate at this stage therefore the observed data is considered as the benchmark in this work for evaluating accuracy of the rainfall datasets and their corresponding flood discharge output and inferring the rfss measure the desirable value of rfss in the present case is 0 1 preferably 0 the higher the rfss value the lower is the error in the simulated discharge based on this ranks to different rainfall datasets can be allotted 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating rainfall datasets spatial and quantitative intercomparison between various rainfall datasets is carried out to identify the datasets that can accurately characterize the rainfall patterns in the up ugb region 3 1 1 spatial variability in the rainfall datasets spatial variability ideally measures the distribution of rainfall across different grids within the region to identify the overall spatial variability in different rainfall datasets spatial probability distribution functions pdfs are computed by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution and the corresponding plots are presented in fig 3 right panel the spatial pdfs provide information on the ability of a given dataset to capture spatial variability in rainfall of different magnitudes however the locations at which the rainfall occurs in the region cannot be inferred from these plots to address this the spatial plots for the cumulative rainfall obtained across different rainfall datasets for the three events under consideration are prepared and are presented in fig 4 fig 3 left panel presents the barplots of rainfall recorded at different rain gauges during the three events with thresholds of heavy 64 5 124 4 mm very heavy 124 5 244 4 mm and extremely heavy 244 5 mm rainfall at each station these threshold values are considered from the imd guidelines indian meteorological department terminologies and glossary http imd gov in section nhac termglossary pdf for event a the gauge data represented as barplot in fig 3 left panel indicates that there are clusters of heavy rainfall in the n w region the southern part of the s e region and the western part of the s w region the three wrf datasets wrf d01 wrf d02 and wrf d03 are able to represent these clusters well the wrf d02 in particular is noticed to capture the spatial locations of the heavy rainfall pockets fairly accurately the tmpa dataset is noticed to have a band of cumulative rainfall within the range of 200 250 mm passing through the middle of the study region however most of the heavy rainfall clusters as observed in the gauge data are underestimated by the tmpa dataset for the cfsr dataset there is a gradation in the rainfall from n e to s w with two distinct clusters of moderate rainfall in the southern region whose spatial location does not match with the observed data however the cluster in the s w region is found to be consistent with the wrf datasets but with a lower magnitude and could not be verified due to the absence of the gauge data the fnl and jra datasets are found to have similar spatial rainfall patterns with distinct bands of rainfall increasing from north to south further the fnl dataset is noticed to display a cluster of rainfall with the lowest magnitude in the n w part of the region which received the highest rainfall indicating its inability to capture the spatial variability in the rainfall the merra2 dataset is noticed to show uniform rainfall over the entire up ugb region indicating its unsuitability to represent event a these observations are corroborated by the spatial pdfs obtained for these datasets fig 3 i right panel the wrf datasets are noticed to have heavier right tails compared to other datasets indicating their ability to capture spatial variation in rainfall values with high magnitude the cfsr and tmpa datasets showed variability only in the low magnitude rainfall values further the tmpa data lacks the right tail indicating the absence of high magnitude rainfall values the fnl and jra datasets have sudden peaks and sharp decline with narrow base widths indicating a lack of spatial variability for event b the gauge data fig 3 left panel indicates that there are isolated pockets in s e and s w regions that received heavy to very heavy rainfall only one station dehradun showed extremely heavy rainfall for this event the wrf d03 fig 4 is noticed to capture the spatial variability in the rainfall in the s e and s w parts of the region with a slight mismatch in the location of clusters in the tmpa dataset a band of heavy to very heavy rainfall within the range 100 200 mm is noticed passing through the central part of the study region which is not demonstrated in the observed data however a cluster of heavy rainfall is noticed in the southern part of the s e region which to a certain extent match the observed data the cfsr dataset exhibited clusters of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the s e and n w parts of the study region which is not observed in the gauge data the fnl jra and merra2 datasets performed similarly to event a with a gradation in the rainfall from n e to s w regions and merra2 dataset having a wet bias in rainfall over the entire study region therefore these datasets are unable to represent spatial variability in the rainfall the spatial pdfs fig 3 ii right panel indicate that the wrf and cfsr datasets have base widths similar to the observed pdf indicating the ability of these datasets to represent spatial variability in rainfall comparable to the observed data in event c it is noticed that most of the locations in the region received very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall among the datasets that are considered the wrf datasets demonstrated clusters of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the western part of the region while tmpa dataset showed a cluster of heavy and very heavy rainfall in the s e region the cfsr could fairly accurately capture the rainfall in the southern and the n w regions therefore each of these datasets could partially capture the spatial variability in the rainfall the fnl and jra datasets performed similarly to the other two events unlike the other two events the merra2 dataset in this case is found to exhibit spatial variability in the rainfall and is able to capture the blocks of very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the southern region however merra2 has a wet bias in the rainfall in the northern parts of the region this observation is also substantiated by the spatial pdf plot fig 3 iii right panel which shows the base width and the range of the merra2 dataset pdf similar to the observed data pdf the other datasets except fnl and jra are found to have higher variability in the rainfall at low magnitudes to further quantify the error in each dataset with respect to the gauge data quantitative verification is carried out which is presented in the following section 3 1 2 quantitative verification of the rainfall datasets the rainfall obtained from the wrf datasets reanalysis datasets and the tmpa product are compared with the observed rain gauge data using three performance metrics bias b root mean square error rmse and scale error σ for comparison the grid point from the rainfall dataset closest to the gauge location is considered and the corresponding errors are plotted in fig 5 for the three events under evaluation b and rmse quantify the magnitude of error in each dataset and are computed as the percent of total rainfall recorded at a particular station negative b means underestimation of the rainfall by the dataset in comparison to the observed data the scale error σ which is the ratio of variance in the rainfall dataset to the variance in the gauge data measures the variability in the rainfall with respect to the observed data the σ value can vary from 0 to wherein 0 means that the rainfall dataset is lacking variability ideally the σ value should be close to 1 indicating that the rainfall dataset has variability similar to the observed data for event a fig 5 top panel the north part of the region is represented well by the wrf d01 dataset further the wrf d01 also shows least b 20 and rmse 20 in the stations such as chamoli mussoorie and tehri located in northern areas of s e and s w parts respectively the southern region which is at a lower elevation is captured well by both wrf all domains and tmpa datasets indicating their ability to perform reasonably well in the lower elevation areas for several locations such as uttarakashi and dehradun the jra dataset is noticed to produce b less than 20 however due to lack of variability in rainfall indicated by σ 0 the jra dataset is not considered for the analysis in event b several stations recorded less rainfall which is reflected in less temporal variability low σ values in the rainfall for several datasets similar to event a the rainfall at the stations located in the north such as uttarakashi are well characterized by the wrf d01 dataset with b 16 and rmse 21 however the joshimath station which is located in the n e part and received low rainfall during this event is represented fairly accurately by tmpa dataset with b 15 and rmse 42 in the s e region although spatially tmpa dataset showed a cluster of heavy rainfall quantitatively only two stations out of seven ranikhet and champawat are typified by this dataset for most of the stations in the s e and s w regions wrf domains are found to perform well in the rainfall with wrf d02 showing least b of 3 and rmse of 35 for pauri station s w region of up ugb the fnl jra merra2 datasets are found to produce very high b 100 and rmse 50 and therefore not considered for further analysis for event c it was noticed that tmpa dataset showed less b with respect to the stations located in the eastern region n e and s e with joshimath station having the least b of 20 the wrf datasets showed less b in the rainfall in the western region with least b of 1 in the haridwar station this observation is in accordance with the spatial characteristics noticed in these datasets fig 4 further in this case the cfsr and merra2 datasets are also found to perform reasonably well in capturing rainfall in the southern areas of the region with stations like haridwar and nainital having b less than 10 the cfsr dataset has performed moderately well at some of the stations in the other two events therefore this observation might be justified however the merra2 results appear to be inconsistent and require further evaluation from the analysis it is noticed that there is significant variability in the rainfall over the north and the south parts of the study region for different events the stations in the north viz a viz uttarakashi joshimath chamoli tehri pauri and deoprayag are located in the valley regions of the himalayan mountains whereas the stations in the south have a moderately uniform or flat landscape in the foothills of the himalayas the interaction between the topography of the region and the monsoon system along with the altitude and steepness of mountains are noticed to significantly influence the performance of different datasets over the region however the detailed analysis pertaining to the effect of orography on the rainfall in the region is beyond the scope of the present work banerjee et al 2020 provides an explanation for understanding the effect of orography elevation on the rainfall profile of the region the tmpa dataset is found to satisfactorily capture the heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over the flat terrain situated in the foothills of the himalayas albeit with slight dry bias tmpa being a composite product of several microwave sensors huffman et al 2007 can characterize the hydrometeors with reasonable accuracy in this region the decent performance of tmpa in the foothills of the himalayas for indian summer monsoon rainfall is also recorded by joshi et al 2013 and rahman et al 2009 in addition the spurious measurements by the tmpa data over the orographic himalayan region has been reported in several works such as by prakash et al 2015 prakash et al 2016 and prakash et al 2014 which could be attributed to high variations in earth s emissivity in the mountains dinku et al 2010 explained that tmpa relies extensively on the cloud top temperature which exceeds the rain no rain threshold specified in the algorithm over the orographic regions leading to the underestimation of rainfall further houze 2012 reported that the trmm precipitation radar against which all the passive microwave sensors of tmpa are calibrated does not obtain measurements from the lowest point in the mountainous terrains and therefore cannot fully resolve the rainfall patterns in the valley areas these factors can contribute to the unreliability of the tmpa data in the high elevation himalayan terrain in a few cases the cfsr dataset is found to perform reasonably in the flat terrain of himalayan foothills this could be attributed to better horizontal and vertical resolution t382l64 enhanced physics schemes coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice and land surface model improved data assimilation with the inclusion of satellite radiances instead of retrievals and consideration of prescribed co2 concentrations and other trace gases as a function of time saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 however the findings of this work are contrasting to the analysis carried out by ghodichore et al 2019 ghodichore et al 2018 and shah and mishra 2014 and require further examination having said that none of the reanalysis product is able to perform well in the valley areas of the study region furthermore the jra fnl and merra2 datasets are found to have a wet bias in the rainfall over the entire study area the excessive rainfall over the tropical regions by the reanalysis datasets is mentioned in several works bosilovich et al 2011 kang and ahn 2015 kishore et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015 trenberth et al 2009 trenberth and smith 2008 and is attributed to various causes such as i energy imbalance at the surface and the top of atmosphere with excess global surface latent heating ii large positive bias in outgoing longwave radiation and iii large negative bias in absorbed solar radiation these factors together influence the cloud properties leading to an overestimation of rainfall the jra dataset in particular is reported to have a wet bias in rainfall in the intertropical convergence zone itcz which passes through the himalayan belt during the indian summer monsoon kang and ahn 2015 among all the datasets the wrf data is found to perform well over both valleys and flat terrains of the himalayas this could be attributed to the ability of the wrf model to accurately simulate the interactions between topography and the weather phenomenon and consequently able to represent the convection in the area explicitly however the wrf d02 which is at a moderate spatial resolution of 9 km is found to perform better than wrf d03 at 3 km resolution this observation is consistent with the results of chawla et al 2018 and sikder and hossain 2016 the inferior performance of wrf d03 could be due to two reasons first the influence of windward leeward effects which are predominant in the mountainous regions at high resolution second the inability of the model to accurately simulate convection in the region as the convective parameterization scheme is not considered at a fine resolution of 3 km it is widely agreed that convective parameterization schemes may work well at a grid spacing of 10 km but fail at fine resolution due to invalidity of scale separation assumption related to the convective updraft at high resolution deng and stauffer 2006 molinari and dudek 1992 weisman et al 1997 therefore the effect of incorporation of convective parameterization scheme at a fine resolution on rainfall simulation over the himalayan terrain needs to be examined and shall be attempted in the future based on the analysis carried out in this work the datasets as listed in table 3 can be considered for different rainfall ranges and topographies in the himalayan terrain 3 2 flood simulations using the hydrologic model to obtain the flood discharges the vic hydrologic model is set up over the up ugb region with bhimgodha station as the outlet fig 1 all the datasets described in section 2 1 were used to drive the vic model to obtain the flood discharges for the three events the corresponding results are presented in fig 6 the rainfall flood skill score rfss as described in section 2 4 eqs 1 3 is computed for different datasets nss e discharge given by eq 2 is calculated at the bhimgodha outlet however for nss e rainfall given by eq 3 average nss e rainfall over the 15 vic model grids covering the up ugb region is taken the corresponding results are presented in table 4 in addition to this the bias b and rmse error metrics are calculated between the simulated flood discharge from different datasets and the observed discharge q obs recorded at the bhimgodha outlet results of which are presented in table 4 the b and rmse are computed as the percent of total discharge during the event days for which q obs was available from the rfss values obtained for all the events table 4 it is clear that the vic model driven using the wrf datasets performs superior to the rest of the datasets this is found to be consistent with the variability noticed in the rainfall datasets in event a it is found that wrf d01 and wrf d02 accurately simulate the flood discharges with these datasets having high rfss values of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively along with less b rmse and nss e discharge the wrf d02 for event a is noticed to have higher nss e rainfall compared to wrf d01 and wrf d03 but least nss e discharge this could be attributed to the fact that for wrf d02 two grids located in the northern part of the up ugb exhibited high errors in the rainfall which may not have significantly affected the simulated discharge downstream as explained in section 2 4 the effect of dry bias in rainfall from the cfsr dataset is reflected in its low rfss value of 0 77 with high b negative rmse nss e rainfall and nss e discharge for the tmpa dataset although the effect of rainfall underestimation is evident in b and rmse measures due to similar discharge to rainfall ratio with wrf d03 the rfss value for tmpa is found to be close to the rfss value of wrf d03 the effect of wet bias in fnl jra and merra2 datasets is evident in the simulated discharge estimates through low rfss values the vic model forced with fnl and merra2 datasets in particular ill simulated the flood discharges yielding negative rfss values in event b based on the conventional measures the wrf d01 dataset can be wrongly concluded to perform the best as it has least b of 6 5 and rmse of 6 4 however the wrf d02 dataset is found to have the highest rfss value of 0 94 and considered to perform the best similar to event a the highest rfss value for wrf d02 could be due to less effect of errors in the rainfall in the grids located in the northern part of the up ugb on the simulated discharge such as observation indicate the superior performance of the rfss measure to simultaneously validate the rainfall and discharge datasets during short duration extreme events which may not be reflected in the conventional measures similar to the case of tmpa dataset in event a for event b despite higher errors in the cfsr dataset compared to wrf d01 the former is found to have a higher rfss value of 0 93 due to low discharge to rainfall ratio the tmpa dataset showed a positive b in rainfall and high nss e rainfall at most of the stations in the s w and n w regions resulting in high nss e discharge and subsequently low rfss of 0 87 the effect of wet bias in fnl jra and merra2 datasets is manifested in the flood discharges and can be noted through the negative rfss values and high error values for event c in general it is noticed that all the wrf domains along with the tmpa dataset perform well in simulating the flood discharges in the rainfall analysis most of the datasets showed negative b which is reflected in higher nss e rainfall values compared to the other two events the higher nss e rainfall values numerator in eq 1 lead to lower discharge to rainfall ratios causing higher rfss values almost equal to 1 compared to the other two events although wrf d02 and wrf d03 yielded the same rfss values considering the lowest b of 2 and rmse of 2 8 in the former it is concluded to perform the best this observation indicates that in case of the same rfss values other measures such as b rmse nss e rainfall and nss e discharge should be taken into account while analyzing the datasets further it is noticed that although tmpa dataset has a slightly lower bias than wrf d03 nss e discharge of tmpa is slightly higher which is expressed in the rfss with the former having a marginally lower value of 0 993 compared to rfss value of 0 994 by wrf d03 this indicates the ability of the rfss to capture subtle errors in the discharge regime of the region further emphasizing its utility in analyzing various datasets although in the rainfall analysis section 3 1 the merra2 rainfall dataset was found to perform reasonably over the region the downstream part of the up ugb region showed heavy rainfall in the range 250 300 mm causing high nss e rainfall value the unsatisfactory performance of the merra 2 dataset is shown through its low rfss value of 0 82 along with high b positive rmse and nss e discharge in the flood discharge such an observation indicates that although a rainfall dataset may generally well represent rainfall over the region it might not always yield reasonable flood discharge estimates at the outlet due to significant errors in the critical grids the cfsr dataset despite having less nss e rainfall value over the up ugb region showed a rfss value of 0 5 in association with high positive b rmse and nss e discharge in the flood discharge probably due to inability of the model to accurately simulate discharge for this case through this it can be inferred that the rfss measure can also help in examining the model performance the fnl and jra datasets similar to the other two events did not perform well in simulating flood discharges due to ill representation of rainfall considering the rfss obtained for each event overall rfss value for each dataset is computed sum of all the rfss values divided by the number of events and is presented in the last column of table 4 from this it is inferred that the wrf domains and the tmpa dataset perform reasonably in simulating floods across the three events on ranking the datasets based on the overall rfss values wrf d02 is found to have the highest score of 0 97 and therefore occupy the first place followed by wrf d01 wrf d03 and tmpa in the rainfall analysis although the cfsr dataset was found to perform moderately over the region the same was not concluded from the flood discharge simulations this further emphasizes the overall objective of this work to evaluate the errors in the flood discharge with respect to the rainfall datasets 4 summary and conclusions the overarching aim of this paper is to enable researchers to appropriately use the available rainfall datasets to accurately model floods in the data sparse himalayan region the detailed investigation is carried out over the mountainous terrain of the upstream part of the upper ganga basin up ugb for the three events that caused flooding in the region to identify the dataset that can best represent the rainfall over the up ugb region the rainfall obtained from the wrf simulations reanalysis datasets cfsr fnl jra and merra2 and tmpa satellite product are compared with the in situ rain gauge data the topography of the region is found to significantly influence the rainfall and causing large spatial variability the tmpa product is inferred to perform fairly accurately over the flat terrains in the foothills of the himalayas due to its ability to accurately receive the hydrometeor information in this region however it is unable to capture heavy rainfall in the valley areas of high altitude mountains probably due to inaccuracy in the cloud top temperature the reanalysis datasets are concluded to perform unsatisfactorily over the entire study region which is in line with the conclusions drawn in other studies such as ghodichore et al 2019 ghodichore et al 2018 kishore et al 2016 misra et al 2012 rana et al 2015 and shah and mishra 2014 the unsuitability of the reanalysis datasets over the himalayan terrain could be due to two reasons first ill simulation of cloud structure by the climate models used in the reanalysis leading to either wet or dry bias in the rainfall second the reanalysis datasets are generated by assimilating observations into the climate model the unavailability of reliable observations over the himalayan terrain could have contributed to errors in the reanalysis datasets from this it can be implied that although reanalysis datasets might be useful in simulating large scale weather conditions care must be taken while using them for regional studies especially over the mountainous areas quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets showed that among all the datasets the wrf simulated rainfall has less errors in terms of bias rmse and scale over both valley and the flat terrain regions therefore through this work the importance of employing a nwp model the wrf model for simulating the heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the data sparse himalayan region is established further wrf d01 and wrf d02 which are at a moderate spatial resolution of 27 km and 9 km respectively gave less errors bias and rmse compared to the fine resolution wrf d03 this inference highlights that fine resolution does not always yield best results rainfall simulations especially in convectively unstable regions such as the himalayas to obtain flood discharges for the up ugb region the calibrated vic hydrologic model is forced with all the rainfall datasets the variability in the rainfall is manifested in the flood discharges a rainfall flood skill score rfss is developed in this work to quantify the errors in simulated discharge with respect to the errors in the rainfall datasets the rfss is used to rank different datasets in the order of their ability to simulate floods in the up ugb region among all the datasets the three wrf domains are noticed to have high rfss values of 0 95 the wrf d02 is found to have maximum rfss value of 0 97 and therefore concluded to perform best and occupy the top place apart from wrf domains the tmpa dataset also yielded a reasonable rfss value of 0 94 and therefore inferred to successfully simulate floods in the region based on the analysis presented in this paper it is concluded that a vic model forced with the output from the wrf model set up over the up ugb or tmpa dataset can be used in future to perform flood forecasts in lead time for early detection and warning of floods in the up ugb region the analysis further suggests that the rainfall datasets which might overall perform good in representing rainfall over the region may not be able to well simulate the flood discharges due to significant errors in the critical grids locations the analysis presented in this work is subjected to a few limitations a the rain gauge density in the high mountainous terrain is very less and inclusion of additional data might cause slight variations in the results b for comparison against the station data the nearest grid point to the gauge is considered and selection of some other grid point might slightly alter the results c four reanalysis datasets and one satellite product are considered for the analysis and d comprehensive assessment of the systematic and random errors associated with the gauge data is not carried out nevertheless the conclusions of this study contribute towards understanding the performance of different datasets in the data sparse up ugb region and will benefit the hydrologic and climate community in selecting the appropriate rainfall dataset which will have critical implications on the flood modelling although the inferences made in this work are based on the case study area of up ugb but the work can be extended to any region in the himalayan terrain credit

5352,floods are widespread natural disasters having significant socio economic impacts and require appropriate modelling and management strategies flood modelling is an enduring challenge especially over the data sparse mountainous regions such as the himalayas due to the lack of accurate rainfall measurements global datasets are often employed for flood modelling however their applicability over the himalayan terrain is still uncertain in this regard the weather research and forecasting wrf numerical weather prediction model is increasingly used to obtain reliable rainfall estimates this work aims at evaluating the performance of different reanalysis datasets satellite product and the wrf model to represent heavy rainfall over the himalayan terrain further these datasets are used to drive the variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model to assess their ability to reconstruct floods in the himalayan region a rainfall flood skill score rfss is proposed in this work to rank different rainfall datasets in the order of their ability to represent flooding in the region the range of rfss can vary from to 1 with positive values as the desired value the analysis is conducted over the upstream part of the upper ganga basin spanning from high elevation mountains to the foothills of the himalayas for three heavy rainfall events that caused flooding in the region quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets in terms of bias rmse and scale errors shows high spatial variability with different datasets performing differently over various regions of the study area the topography is observed to influence the performance of rainfall datasets based on the error metrics it is found that the rainfall simulated using the wrf model exhibits least error in high elevation and valley regions of the himalayas whereas tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr in some cases datasets can capture the rainfall in the foothills of the himalayas on forcing the vic model with these datasets the wrf model with a moderate resolution of 9 km is found to have an overall highest rfss score of 0 97 among all the datasets and therefore considered most suitable for simulating floods in the study region keywords floods himalayan region reanalysis data wrf model vic hydrologic model rainfall flood skill score 1 introduction changes in the land use and climate conditions are causing an increase in the intensity and frequency of flood events resulting in the rise of flood associated losses unisdr 2015 monitoring and forecasting the flood events are critical for appropriately managing the flood responses in this regard hydrologic hydraulic models are commonly used in the flood monitoring systems to obtain flood discharges jain et al 2018 trigg et al 2016 hydrologic model based flood monitoring systems require inputs of rainfall temperature wind land use and topography amongst which rainfall is a key variable for obtaining accurate flood discharge estimates wu et al 2014 zhang and smith 2003 in mountainous areas flood caused due to heavy rainfall is a complex non interactive process dimri et al 2016 ray et al 2019 this is further complicated by the fact that obtaining accurate and timely knowledge of rainfall in such regions is challenging due to high space time variability in the rainfall regime rain gauges provide accurate point measurements of the rainfall for flood modelling however there are several shortcomings with the gauge data particularly for heavy rainfall events and consequent flood analysis in the mountainous regions rain gauges may get destroyed during heavy rainfall events and they may be sparsely located in the complex terrain with high elevation therefore may not provide the complete areal extent of the rainfall in the region to circumvent these issues gridded precipitation data products are being developed using three research approaches i satellite based gridded precipitation ii atmospheric reanalysis with assimilation of observations in the climate models and iii numerical weather prediction models xu et al 2019 an intercomparison between the rainfall obtained from these three approaches is still an active area of research the global reanalysis datasets and satellite rainfall products are often considered as a proxy to observations kalnay et al 1996 banerjee et al 2020 in the hydrologic models to simulate floods andreadis et al 2017 hong et al 2007 pappenberger et al 2012 seyyedi et al 2015 due to their high spatial and temporal coverage although these datasets are successfully employed in several studies for flood modelling their applicability over data scarce mountainous terrain is still unclear ward et al 2011 evaluated the performance of different reanalysis and satellite products to simulate rainfall over the tropical andes mountains and inferred that although all the products are capable of representing the seasonal rainfall high biases exist in daily and monthly simulations shah and mishra 2014 found high biases in rainfall estimates from the reanalysis products during the monsoon season over india rana et al 2015 reported that satellite rainfall product performs better than the reanalysis datasets in capturing the summer monsoon rainfall variability in india especially over the mountainous regions kishore et al 2016 observed reasonable performance of different reanalysis datasets in representing spatio temporal patterns of rainfall over india ghodichore et al 2018 identified that most of the reanalysis products fail to correctly reproduce the spatio temporal trends in rainfall over india reanalysis datasets were noticed to perform satisfactorily in reproducing the climatology and interannual variability of east asian summer monsoon precipitation by huang et al 2016 rahman et al 2009 established that on a synoptic scale the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa data could reasonably depict the heavy rainfall pattern and intensity in the himalayan foothills particularly for the uttarakhand state in india banerjee et al 2020 noticed that the trmm 3b42 data underestimates rainfall above 3 mm day in comparison to the india meteorological department imd gridded data from the literature it is evident that there is no clear consensus on the usability of the reanalysis datasets and the satellite products over the mountainous terrains instead they are associated with substantial uncertainty with regard to the rainfall estimates aghakouchak et al 2009 bosilovich et al 2008 hong et al 2006 furthermore physical processes that control the spatial and temporal distribution of heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas are poorly understood at the scales relevant for flood modelling zhang and smith 2003 therefore it is necessary to evaluate these datasets before employing them in the hydrologic models for flood discharge simulations the numerical weather prediction nwp models are increasingly used to simulate rainfall in complex terrain regions chawla et al 2018 chevuturi et al 2015 chevuturi and dimri 2016 givati et al 2011 hong and lee 2009 li et al 2017 lo et al 2008 marteau et al 2015 srinivas et al 2013 silverman et al 2013 thayyen et al 2013 during recent decades due to advancements in the high performance computation significant developments have taken place in the nwp models in terms of sophisticated physics parametrization options and improved horizontal resolution as a result the new generation nwp models are skillful and may provide realistic estimates of high intensity rainfall at a fine spatial resolution however obtaining accurate rainfall estimates over the mountainous areas such as the himalayas and at a scale relevant for flood modelling continue to be a challenge to the research community argüeso et al 2012 chevuturi and dimri 2016 karki et al 2017 nam et al 2014 raju et al 2015 sikder and hossain 2016 yucel and onen 2014 further it is widely agreed that nwp models at high spatial resolution may be suitable for simulation of extreme rainfall events givati et al 2011 roberts et al 2009 weisman et al 2008 chevuturi et al 2015 chevuturi and dimri 2016 there is a need to examine this assumption over the mountainous regions in this paper the advanced research version of the weather research and forecasting wrf nwp model skamarock and klemp 2008 is assessed for its ability to simulate heavy rainfall events over the himalayan terrain the details of the wrf model structure are presented in section 2 2 a key aspect of this paper is to reconstruct floods in the data sparse himalayan region for this the aforementioned rainfall datasets are used to drive a calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic hydrologic model liang et al 1994 the calibration and validation of the vic model are discussed in detail in section 2 3 the errors present in the rainfall datasets may get accumulated in the flood simulations obtained from the model therefore it is necessary to quantify the errors in the flood simulations in association with the errors in the rainfall datasets there are several indices reported in the literature to evaluate the performance of either rainfall datasets or simulated discharges however to the best of our knowledge there is no single index that takes into account the errors from both the variables simultaneously particularly for flood estimation case in addition to this most of the performance evaluation indices reported in the literature are used for data with long record length the prime focus of this work is on the extreme events which are of short duration rendering the generally used indices unusable to address these shortcomings a new skill score termed as rainfall flood skill score rfss is developed in this paper the details of the rfss are provided in section 2 4 based on rfss measure different rainfall datasets are ranked in order of their ability to simulate flood discharges in the study region with this background the general aim of this work is to identify datasets that can best represent the rainfall over the data sparse himalayan terrain and thereby can be used for flood modelling to achieve this the following specific objectives are undertaken first provide an intercomparison between different rainfall datasets over the study region second provide a guideline for the reliability and usability of different datasets over the data sparse himalayan terrain third rank different datasets with respect to their ability to simulate floods in the region the following sub section describes the study region and the events considered for the analysis subsequently in section 2 the data and the models used in this work are presented 1 1 study area the upstream part of the upper ganga basin up ugb extending from the high elevation mountains to the foothills of the himalayas in northern india is selected as the region of interest for the assessment fig 1 owing to its geographical location the up ugb experiences extremely heavy rainfall and is highly vulnerable to flooding causing devastating effects on life and property satendra et al 2014 the region is approximately 23 000 sq km in area encompassing the origin point of river ganga in india and is of great socio economic importance to the country the up ugb is high in altitude and exhibits significant variability in the topography with elevation varying between 250 m and 7800 m above mean sea level fig 1 due to the lack of accessibility there are very few rain gauge stations in this area which are mostly concentrated in the foothills making it a data sparse region and thus crucial for this analysis dense and scrub forests are the dominant land use lu types in the region chawla and mujumdar 2015 for analysis the region is divided into four zones north west n w north east n e south west s e and south west s w as indicated in fig 1 for the analysis three heavy rainfall events which caused flooding in the up ugb satendra et al 2014 are selected the events are selected in such a manner that they cover the monsoon months june july august and september and also have a different nature of cause this may provide insight to the effectiveness of rainfall datasets in representing different types of events which may subsequently influence the flood discharge simulations details pertaining to these events are listed in table 1 it is to be noted that there are other flood events that occurred in the region post 2013 but to align with the available hydro meteorological data only three events are selected 2 data and methods 2 1 rainfall datasets 2 1 1 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multisatellite precipitation analysis tmpa product 3b42 the near real time rt tmpa product is available since january 1998 at three hourly temporal scale and is intended to provide reliable rainfall estimates within the latitude band 50 n s at 0 25 0 25 spatial resolution huffman et al 2007 the tmpa product is created by using two sets of data first passive microwave data including microwave imager tmi special sensor microwave imager ssm i advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e and the advanced microwave sounding unit b amsu b second infrared ir data collected by the geosynchronous satellites further details regarding the preparation of the tmpa dataset can be obtained from huffman et al 2007 for the present work 3b42rt level 3 tmpa product aggregated to the daily time scale is considered for evaluation 2 1 2 retrospective analysis or reanalysis products the global reanalysis datasets provide a gridded representation of the atmospheric processes and are produced by assimilating observations from multiple sources into the climate models at every 6 12 h duration making them a viable option for climate studies bosilovich et al 2011 saha et al 2010 in the present work four reanalysis datasets namely a national centers for environmental prediction ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr b ncep final fnl c japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 and d modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra2 are considered the cfsr data available from 1979 to present at a resolution of 0 5 0 5 at 6 hour interval saha et al 2010 it is a coupled atmosphere ocean land surface sea ice system expected to provide best estimates of the atmospheric states at high resolution globally and for a long period initial cfsr data version ds093 0 is available from 1979 to march 2011 and then extended to version 2 cfsr v ds094 0 from march 2011 to the present saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 in this work both ds093 0 and ds094 0 versions are used and referred to as the cfsr dataset the ncep fnl final is an operational global analysis data available at 1 1 resolution at a 6 hour interval from 1999 to present the dataset is generated from the global data assimilation system gdas using observations from the global telecommunication system gts and other sources it is produced from the same climate model that is used in global forecast system gfs but an hour later after gfs is initialized to employ more observational data the jra 55 hereafter referred as jra available from 1958 to present at 0 562 0 562 resolution at a 6 hourly interval is an improvement over the jra 25 years reanalysis product by increasing resolution incorporating new radiation scheme 4d var data assimilating system variation bias correction for satellite radiances and considering greenhouse gases with time varying concentrations the merra2 data available from 1980 to present at an hourly scale at 0 5 0 625 resolution is produced by the nasa global modeling and assimilation office gmao the merra2 aims at providing a regularly gridded homogeneous record of the global atmosphere and incorporate trace gas constituents stratospheric ozone and improve land surface representation and cryospheric processes to achieve integrated earth system analysis for evaluating the aforementioned rainfall datasets the daily observed rainfall data from 17 rain gauges fig 1iii for the event durations as mentioned in table 1 three events are procured from meteorological centre dehradun india meteorological department imd 2 2 the weather research and forecasting wrf model the advanced research core of the wrf model version 3 8 used in this study is a fully compressible non hydrostatic mesoscale model with versatility in the selection of horizontal grid resolution and physics parameterization schemes designed for reliable simulation of the atmospheric processes the model allows multiple nesting options to obtain climate information at high resolution further details related to the wrf model can be obtained from skamarock and klemp 2008 the model is initiated by considering large scale atmospheric fields as input for boundary conditions from reanalysis datasets in this work the initial and boundary conditions for the wrf model are taken from the ncep fnl global analysis data available at a resolution of 1 1 at six hours interval 00 06 12 and 18 utc coordinated universal time these large scale conditions are regridded to the model domains considering the horizontal grid spacing and regional topography information the configuration of three one way nested domains in the wrf model is considered in this work the purpose of nesting is to obtain rainfall at high resolution as accurately as possible over the study region lo et al 2008 the outermost domain or the parent domain domain 1 wrf d01 covers almost the whole of india 11 42 n and 63 97 e at 27 km grid spacing domain 2 wrf d02 covers most parts of the ganga basin 23 35 n and 70 84 e at 9 km spacing and domain 3 wrf d03 focuses exclusively on the up ugb 29 33 n and 77 81 e at 3 km spacing fig 1 the wrf d01 provides lateral boundary conditions to both the inner domains the model time step which is a function of grid resolution is considered to be 135 s 45 s and 15 s respectively for the three wrf domains the model is initialized independently for each event considering fixed sea surface temperature sst throughout the integration and lateral boundary conditions are updated at every 6 hour interval the vertical profile is divided into 30 pressure levels with the model top fixed at 50 hpa moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis international geosphere biosphere programme igbp 21 category landuse cover fields available with a horizontal grid spacing of 10 min is used to provide the land surface boundary conditions several physics parametrization options are available in the wrf model for customization however chawla et al 2018 noted that there is no known wrf model set up that can best simulate heavy rainfall events over the himalayan region in this regard chawla et al 2018 tested four microphysics mp schemes two cumulus cu parameterization schemes two planetary boundary layer pbl schemes and two land surface models lsms it was found that goddard microphysics mellor yamada janjic pbl and betts miller janjic cu parameterization schemes along with noah lsm perform best in simulating extreme rainfall events over the up ugb the noah lsm is a fairly detailed model with a single canopy layer and canopy resistance scheme of noilhan and planton 1989 and four soil layers at 0 1 0 3 0 6 and 1 0 m this configuration is selected to simulate the rainfall for all the three events under investigation the longwave radiation parameterization is based on the rapid radiative transfer model rrtm mlawer et al 1997 and the shortwave radiation parameterization scheme is based on dudhia dudhia 1989 the wrf model is executed independently for each of the three events table 1 under consideration the wrf model is started at least 24 h prior to the first event day to take into account the effect of model initialization the rainfall simulated at different wrf domain resolutions is evaluated against the observed gauge data and also considered as an input to the vic model for generating the flood discharges 2 3 the variable infiltration capacity vic model set up calibration and validation the variable infiltration capacity vic is a semi distributed soil vegetation atmosphere transfer macroscale model which solves the water and the energy balance over a gridded domain liang et al 1994 each grid is divided into multiple tiles based on the vegetation type and generates a different hydrologic response in the form of infiltration soil moisture storage runoff and evaporation therefore taking into account the sub grid variability the sub surface is represented by three soil layers which are responsible for the generation of surface runoff through infiltration and baseflow upon conclusion of the vic model execution the runoff and baseflow generated by each grid are transported to the edge of the grid cell from where they are routed to the watershed outlet using the 1 d lohmann s routing model lohmann et al 1998 the vic model version 4 2 c in conjugation with the routing model is implemented at 0 5 spatial resolution to simulate the flood discharges in the up ugb since the focus of this paper is on the flood discharge simulations the vic model is executed in the water balance mode the observed discharge is available at the bhimgodha station fig 1 from the year 1987 to 2005 and is therefore considered as the outlet of the region a total of 15 vic model grids covered the up ugb region and topographic soil meteorology and lu information are obtained for each of the grid cell the elevation information is derived from the aster advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer dem digital elevation model data available at 30 m resolution the lu information of the year 2011 which is obtained by classifying the landsat satellite imageries chawla and mujumdar 2015 is considered for the simulations since all the events under investigation are corresponding to the years 2010 and 2013 the lu is assumed not to vary significantly across the events digital soil map for the up ugb procured from the national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss lup india was available with the soil texture information of different soil layers in the region the texture information is used to obtain soil parameters such as porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity field capacity wilting point etc using transfer function equations given by cosby et al 1984 apart from the parameters that can be obtained using the texture details certain parameters are subject to model calibration as it is difficult to determine their values based on soil properties xie et al 2007 these are mainly three parameters namely infiltration curve parameter b which controls the amount of water that can infiltrate into the soil the fraction of maximum baseflow ds and the fraction of maximum soil moisture at which nonlinear baseflow is initiated ws to calibrate and validate the vic model gridded meteorological data corresponding to rainfall maximum temperature and minimum temperature for the period 1987 2005 at daily timescales is procured from the indian meteorological department imd the gridded meteorological data represents the observed conditions imd created the gridded daily rainfall dataset for india using the rain gauge information and is available at 0 25 resolution pai et al 2014 from these grid points the locations which match with the vic grids at 0 5 resolution are selected gridded daily temperature dataset is available at 1 resolution which is further re gridded using the bilinear interpolation method to 0 5 resolution to make is consistent with the resolution of the vic model the wind speed dataset at 0 5 resolution is extracted from the princeton university database sheffield et al 2006 it has been generally agreed that the hydrologic model set up over the long term monthly or annual records may not be useful for simulating peak discharges chawla and mujumdar 2017 since the focus of this work is to simulate flood discharges accurately the model calibration is carried out with respect to the annual maximum discharge values for the years 1987 1999 at the bhimgodha station it is expected that the model set up and calibrated for the annual maximum discharge time series would be able to reproduce the flood discharges the values of the three vic model calibration parameters b ds ws obtained from the model calibration phase were validated by simulating annual maximum discharge for the years 2000 2005 the comparison between the observed and simulated annual maximum discharges is carried out using correlation coefficient r2 normalized root mean squared error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and bias β the corresponding results are provided in table 2 and fig 2 the calibration and validation results indicate that there is a significant correlation between the simulated and observed discharges with very less bias less than5 in both cases therefore the vic model with the parameter values as mentioned in table 2 is considered to perform reasonably well in simulating the flood discharges and is further used to simulate the three events table 1 for simulating the selected events the rainfall forcing data is considered from three sources i wrf simulations ii reanalysis datasets and iii tmpa product the temperature and the wind speed fields are considered from the cfsr reanalysis dataset to force the model with different input rainfall datasets and make the model output i e flood discharges comparable the following three main challenges were addressed i model initialization ii difference in the spatial scales of the forcing datasets and the vic model resolution and iii difference in the temporal scales of forcing datasets and model execution for initialization the vic model is run 15 days prior to the first day of the event using forcings from the imd gridded data and the initial soil moisture from the level 3 version 300 dataset of european space agency s soil moisture ocean salinity smos mission kerr et al 2012 since the satellite soil moisture retrievals are used to drive the vic model the 15 days time period is assumed to be sufficient for model spin up the model initialization is carried out similarly for all the forcing datasets to address the issue of difference in the spatial scales across different datasets and the vic models the datasets such as the three wrf domains tmpa and cfsr which are at either finer or similar resolution as of the vic model the grid points closest to the vic model grid points are considered the jra and merra2 datasets had a slight offset from the vic model grid point locations and therefore interpolated using the inverse distance weighted average idwa method the ncep fnl dataset being at the coarse resolution of 1 was re gridded using the bilinear interpolation method to make it compatible with the vic model resolution the vic model in this work is executed at daily scale while the forcing datasets were available at sub daily scale to address this difference in the temporal scales the rainfall output from different datasets was aggregated to daily scale and then supplied to the vic model it is to be noted that no bias correction of the rainfall datasets is carried out to ensure that the datasets are independent of any in situ observations 2 4 the rainfall flood skill score rfss it is necessary to assess the accuracy and usefulness of various rainfall datasets to simulate floods conventional verification measures such as bias root mean square error rmse correlation mean absolute error etc are commonly used to quantify the performance of a single predicted variable such as rainfall or discharge against the observed data however the objective of this work is to evaluate errors in simulated discharge with reference to the errors in the rainfall datasets with a focus on the extreme events therefore most of the traditional metrics may not deem suitable in this case this motivated us to propose a new metric in this work termed as rainfall flood skill score rfss the rfss is based on the brier skill score brier 1950 which compares the probability functions of forecasted or predicted data to the reference data in the past there have been several modifications to the brier skill score to incorporate errors in the observed and the forecasted data mittermaier et al 2013 weigel et al 2007 to further make the skill score application specific for the case of extreme events normalized squared sum of error nsse between the predicted and observed data is considered as the measure wherein nsse in the simulated discharge is related to the nsse in the rainfall dataset the proposed measure will assist in getting an indication on the extent of error induced by the hydrological model while simulating floods with respect to errors in rainfall simulations based on this the rfss is given by the eqs 1 3 1 rfss 1 nss e discharge nss e rainfall where 2 nss e discharge i 1 n q si m i q ob s i 2 i 1 n q ob s i 2 3 nss e rainfall i 1 n p si m i p ob s i 2 i 1 n p ob s i 2 where q sim represent simulated discharge at the outlet q obs represent the observed discharge at the outlet p sim is the rainfall simulated estimated by a given dataset averaged over the region and p obs is the observed rainfall averaged over the region n is the number of days in a particular extreme event the squared error formulation of nsse eqs 2 and 3 helps in magnifying the errors thereby facilitating the analysis of the datasets when dealing with extreme events further dividing the squared sum of errors with the square of the observed data normalizes the errors making nss e discharge comparable to nss e rainfall this leads to the rfss measure as unitless with the range varying from 1 the negative rfss values i e rfss less than 0 indicate that the nsse in the discharge is higher than the nsse in the rainfall dataset this may imply either ill simulation of discharge by the hydrological model or significant propagation of errors from the input data to the hydrological model output a high negative value of rfss may indicate the need to improve the hydrological model a zero value of rfss suggests that nsse in discharge is the same as nsse in the rainfall dataset and no additional errors bias is being added by the hydrological model a positive value of rfss 0 rfss 1 indicates nsse in discharge to be less than nsse in rainfall this can be attributed to two factors first the hydrological model is well calibrated and is able to perform satisfactorily second the lessened effect of the spatial distribution of rainfall on discharge discharge is a point variable which is computed at the outlet rainfall on the other hand varies spatially and is averaged over the region to obtain an error value due to varying spatial characteristics of the rainfall its errors are also likely to vary spatially resulting in a few locations or grids in the rainfall product which may have a high error if these grids are crucial for the discharge regime of the catchment the errors in the rainfall datasets can significantly impact the errors in the simulated flood discharges under such situations high nsse in rainfall can get propagated as high nsse in discharge and vice versa however low nsse in discharge compared to that of rainfall may indicate that high error bias in rainfall at a few locations in the region does not significantly affect the discharge regime of the region it is to be noted that there can be inconsistencies in the observed data which are not possible to validate at this stage therefore the observed data is considered as the benchmark in this work for evaluating accuracy of the rainfall datasets and their corresponding flood discharge output and inferring the rfss measure the desirable value of rfss in the present case is 0 1 preferably 0 the higher the rfss value the lower is the error in the simulated discharge based on this ranks to different rainfall datasets can be allotted 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluating rainfall datasets spatial and quantitative intercomparison between various rainfall datasets is carried out to identify the datasets that can accurately characterize the rainfall patterns in the up ugb region 3 1 1 spatial variability in the rainfall datasets spatial variability ideally measures the distribution of rainfall across different grids within the region to identify the overall spatial variability in different rainfall datasets spatial probability distribution functions pdfs are computed by fitting the generalized extreme value gev distribution and the corresponding plots are presented in fig 3 right panel the spatial pdfs provide information on the ability of a given dataset to capture spatial variability in rainfall of different magnitudes however the locations at which the rainfall occurs in the region cannot be inferred from these plots to address this the spatial plots for the cumulative rainfall obtained across different rainfall datasets for the three events under consideration are prepared and are presented in fig 4 fig 3 left panel presents the barplots of rainfall recorded at different rain gauges during the three events with thresholds of heavy 64 5 124 4 mm very heavy 124 5 244 4 mm and extremely heavy 244 5 mm rainfall at each station these threshold values are considered from the imd guidelines indian meteorological department terminologies and glossary http imd gov in section nhac termglossary pdf for event a the gauge data represented as barplot in fig 3 left panel indicates that there are clusters of heavy rainfall in the n w region the southern part of the s e region and the western part of the s w region the three wrf datasets wrf d01 wrf d02 and wrf d03 are able to represent these clusters well the wrf d02 in particular is noticed to capture the spatial locations of the heavy rainfall pockets fairly accurately the tmpa dataset is noticed to have a band of cumulative rainfall within the range of 200 250 mm passing through the middle of the study region however most of the heavy rainfall clusters as observed in the gauge data are underestimated by the tmpa dataset for the cfsr dataset there is a gradation in the rainfall from n e to s w with two distinct clusters of moderate rainfall in the southern region whose spatial location does not match with the observed data however the cluster in the s w region is found to be consistent with the wrf datasets but with a lower magnitude and could not be verified due to the absence of the gauge data the fnl and jra datasets are found to have similar spatial rainfall patterns with distinct bands of rainfall increasing from north to south further the fnl dataset is noticed to display a cluster of rainfall with the lowest magnitude in the n w part of the region which received the highest rainfall indicating its inability to capture the spatial variability in the rainfall the merra2 dataset is noticed to show uniform rainfall over the entire up ugb region indicating its unsuitability to represent event a these observations are corroborated by the spatial pdfs obtained for these datasets fig 3 i right panel the wrf datasets are noticed to have heavier right tails compared to other datasets indicating their ability to capture spatial variation in rainfall values with high magnitude the cfsr and tmpa datasets showed variability only in the low magnitude rainfall values further the tmpa data lacks the right tail indicating the absence of high magnitude rainfall values the fnl and jra datasets have sudden peaks and sharp decline with narrow base widths indicating a lack of spatial variability for event b the gauge data fig 3 left panel indicates that there are isolated pockets in s e and s w regions that received heavy to very heavy rainfall only one station dehradun showed extremely heavy rainfall for this event the wrf d03 fig 4 is noticed to capture the spatial variability in the rainfall in the s e and s w parts of the region with a slight mismatch in the location of clusters in the tmpa dataset a band of heavy to very heavy rainfall within the range 100 200 mm is noticed passing through the central part of the study region which is not demonstrated in the observed data however a cluster of heavy rainfall is noticed in the southern part of the s e region which to a certain extent match the observed data the cfsr dataset exhibited clusters of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the s e and n w parts of the study region which is not observed in the gauge data the fnl jra and merra2 datasets performed similarly to event a with a gradation in the rainfall from n e to s w regions and merra2 dataset having a wet bias in rainfall over the entire study region therefore these datasets are unable to represent spatial variability in the rainfall the spatial pdfs fig 3 ii right panel indicate that the wrf and cfsr datasets have base widths similar to the observed pdf indicating the ability of these datasets to represent spatial variability in rainfall comparable to the observed data in event c it is noticed that most of the locations in the region received very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall among the datasets that are considered the wrf datasets demonstrated clusters of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the western part of the region while tmpa dataset showed a cluster of heavy and very heavy rainfall in the s e region the cfsr could fairly accurately capture the rainfall in the southern and the n w regions therefore each of these datasets could partially capture the spatial variability in the rainfall the fnl and jra datasets performed similarly to the other two events unlike the other two events the merra2 dataset in this case is found to exhibit spatial variability in the rainfall and is able to capture the blocks of very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the southern region however merra2 has a wet bias in the rainfall in the northern parts of the region this observation is also substantiated by the spatial pdf plot fig 3 iii right panel which shows the base width and the range of the merra2 dataset pdf similar to the observed data pdf the other datasets except fnl and jra are found to have higher variability in the rainfall at low magnitudes to further quantify the error in each dataset with respect to the gauge data quantitative verification is carried out which is presented in the following section 3 1 2 quantitative verification of the rainfall datasets the rainfall obtained from the wrf datasets reanalysis datasets and the tmpa product are compared with the observed rain gauge data using three performance metrics bias b root mean square error rmse and scale error σ for comparison the grid point from the rainfall dataset closest to the gauge location is considered and the corresponding errors are plotted in fig 5 for the three events under evaluation b and rmse quantify the magnitude of error in each dataset and are computed as the percent of total rainfall recorded at a particular station negative b means underestimation of the rainfall by the dataset in comparison to the observed data the scale error σ which is the ratio of variance in the rainfall dataset to the variance in the gauge data measures the variability in the rainfall with respect to the observed data the σ value can vary from 0 to wherein 0 means that the rainfall dataset is lacking variability ideally the σ value should be close to 1 indicating that the rainfall dataset has variability similar to the observed data for event a fig 5 top panel the north part of the region is represented well by the wrf d01 dataset further the wrf d01 also shows least b 20 and rmse 20 in the stations such as chamoli mussoorie and tehri located in northern areas of s e and s w parts respectively the southern region which is at a lower elevation is captured well by both wrf all domains and tmpa datasets indicating their ability to perform reasonably well in the lower elevation areas for several locations such as uttarakashi and dehradun the jra dataset is noticed to produce b less than 20 however due to lack of variability in rainfall indicated by σ 0 the jra dataset is not considered for the analysis in event b several stations recorded less rainfall which is reflected in less temporal variability low σ values in the rainfall for several datasets similar to event a the rainfall at the stations located in the north such as uttarakashi are well characterized by the wrf d01 dataset with b 16 and rmse 21 however the joshimath station which is located in the n e part and received low rainfall during this event is represented fairly accurately by tmpa dataset with b 15 and rmse 42 in the s e region although spatially tmpa dataset showed a cluster of heavy rainfall quantitatively only two stations out of seven ranikhet and champawat are typified by this dataset for most of the stations in the s e and s w regions wrf domains are found to perform well in the rainfall with wrf d02 showing least b of 3 and rmse of 35 for pauri station s w region of up ugb the fnl jra merra2 datasets are found to produce very high b 100 and rmse 50 and therefore not considered for further analysis for event c it was noticed that tmpa dataset showed less b with respect to the stations located in the eastern region n e and s e with joshimath station having the least b of 20 the wrf datasets showed less b in the rainfall in the western region with least b of 1 in the haridwar station this observation is in accordance with the spatial characteristics noticed in these datasets fig 4 further in this case the cfsr and merra2 datasets are also found to perform reasonably well in capturing rainfall in the southern areas of the region with stations like haridwar and nainital having b less than 10 the cfsr dataset has performed moderately well at some of the stations in the other two events therefore this observation might be justified however the merra2 results appear to be inconsistent and require further evaluation from the analysis it is noticed that there is significant variability in the rainfall over the north and the south parts of the study region for different events the stations in the north viz a viz uttarakashi joshimath chamoli tehri pauri and deoprayag are located in the valley regions of the himalayan mountains whereas the stations in the south have a moderately uniform or flat landscape in the foothills of the himalayas the interaction between the topography of the region and the monsoon system along with the altitude and steepness of mountains are noticed to significantly influence the performance of different datasets over the region however the detailed analysis pertaining to the effect of orography on the rainfall in the region is beyond the scope of the present work banerjee et al 2020 provides an explanation for understanding the effect of orography elevation on the rainfall profile of the region the tmpa dataset is found to satisfactorily capture the heavy to extremely heavy rainfall over the flat terrain situated in the foothills of the himalayas albeit with slight dry bias tmpa being a composite product of several microwave sensors huffman et al 2007 can characterize the hydrometeors with reasonable accuracy in this region the decent performance of tmpa in the foothills of the himalayas for indian summer monsoon rainfall is also recorded by joshi et al 2013 and rahman et al 2009 in addition the spurious measurements by the tmpa data over the orographic himalayan region has been reported in several works such as by prakash et al 2015 prakash et al 2016 and prakash et al 2014 which could be attributed to high variations in earth s emissivity in the mountains dinku et al 2010 explained that tmpa relies extensively on the cloud top temperature which exceeds the rain no rain threshold specified in the algorithm over the orographic regions leading to the underestimation of rainfall further houze 2012 reported that the trmm precipitation radar against which all the passive microwave sensors of tmpa are calibrated does not obtain measurements from the lowest point in the mountainous terrains and therefore cannot fully resolve the rainfall patterns in the valley areas these factors can contribute to the unreliability of the tmpa data in the high elevation himalayan terrain in a few cases the cfsr dataset is found to perform reasonably in the flat terrain of himalayan foothills this could be attributed to better horizontal and vertical resolution t382l64 enhanced physics schemes coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice and land surface model improved data assimilation with the inclusion of satellite radiances instead of retrievals and consideration of prescribed co2 concentrations and other trace gases as a function of time saha et al 2010 saha et al 2014 however the findings of this work are contrasting to the analysis carried out by ghodichore et al 2019 ghodichore et al 2018 and shah and mishra 2014 and require further examination having said that none of the reanalysis product is able to perform well in the valley areas of the study region furthermore the jra fnl and merra2 datasets are found to have a wet bias in the rainfall over the entire study area the excessive rainfall over the tropical regions by the reanalysis datasets is mentioned in several works bosilovich et al 2011 kang and ahn 2015 kishore et al 2016 kobayashi et al 2015 trenberth et al 2009 trenberth and smith 2008 and is attributed to various causes such as i energy imbalance at the surface and the top of atmosphere with excess global surface latent heating ii large positive bias in outgoing longwave radiation and iii large negative bias in absorbed solar radiation these factors together influence the cloud properties leading to an overestimation of rainfall the jra dataset in particular is reported to have a wet bias in rainfall in the intertropical convergence zone itcz which passes through the himalayan belt during the indian summer monsoon kang and ahn 2015 among all the datasets the wrf data is found to perform well over both valleys and flat terrains of the himalayas this could be attributed to the ability of the wrf model to accurately simulate the interactions between topography and the weather phenomenon and consequently able to represent the convection in the area explicitly however the wrf d02 which is at a moderate spatial resolution of 9 km is found to perform better than wrf d03 at 3 km resolution this observation is consistent with the results of chawla et al 2018 and sikder and hossain 2016 the inferior performance of wrf d03 could be due to two reasons first the influence of windward leeward effects which are predominant in the mountainous regions at high resolution second the inability of the model to accurately simulate convection in the region as the convective parameterization scheme is not considered at a fine resolution of 3 km it is widely agreed that convective parameterization schemes may work well at a grid spacing of 10 km but fail at fine resolution due to invalidity of scale separation assumption related to the convective updraft at high resolution deng and stauffer 2006 molinari and dudek 1992 weisman et al 1997 therefore the effect of incorporation of convective parameterization scheme at a fine resolution on rainfall simulation over the himalayan terrain needs to be examined and shall be attempted in the future based on the analysis carried out in this work the datasets as listed in table 3 can be considered for different rainfall ranges and topographies in the himalayan terrain 3 2 flood simulations using the hydrologic model to obtain the flood discharges the vic hydrologic model is set up over the up ugb region with bhimgodha station as the outlet fig 1 all the datasets described in section 2 1 were used to drive the vic model to obtain the flood discharges for the three events the corresponding results are presented in fig 6 the rainfall flood skill score rfss as described in section 2 4 eqs 1 3 is computed for different datasets nss e discharge given by eq 2 is calculated at the bhimgodha outlet however for nss e rainfall given by eq 3 average nss e rainfall over the 15 vic model grids covering the up ugb region is taken the corresponding results are presented in table 4 in addition to this the bias b and rmse error metrics are calculated between the simulated flood discharge from different datasets and the observed discharge q obs recorded at the bhimgodha outlet results of which are presented in table 4 the b and rmse are computed as the percent of total discharge during the event days for which q obs was available from the rfss values obtained for all the events table 4 it is clear that the vic model driven using the wrf datasets performs superior to the rest of the datasets this is found to be consistent with the variability noticed in the rainfall datasets in event a it is found that wrf d01 and wrf d02 accurately simulate the flood discharges with these datasets having high rfss values of 0 97 and 0 98 respectively along with less b rmse and nss e discharge the wrf d02 for event a is noticed to have higher nss e rainfall compared to wrf d01 and wrf d03 but least nss e discharge this could be attributed to the fact that for wrf d02 two grids located in the northern part of the up ugb exhibited high errors in the rainfall which may not have significantly affected the simulated discharge downstream as explained in section 2 4 the effect of dry bias in rainfall from the cfsr dataset is reflected in its low rfss value of 0 77 with high b negative rmse nss e rainfall and nss e discharge for the tmpa dataset although the effect of rainfall underestimation is evident in b and rmse measures due to similar discharge to rainfall ratio with wrf d03 the rfss value for tmpa is found to be close to the rfss value of wrf d03 the effect of wet bias in fnl jra and merra2 datasets is evident in the simulated discharge estimates through low rfss values the vic model forced with fnl and merra2 datasets in particular ill simulated the flood discharges yielding negative rfss values in event b based on the conventional measures the wrf d01 dataset can be wrongly concluded to perform the best as it has least b of 6 5 and rmse of 6 4 however the wrf d02 dataset is found to have the highest rfss value of 0 94 and considered to perform the best similar to event a the highest rfss value for wrf d02 could be due to less effect of errors in the rainfall in the grids located in the northern part of the up ugb on the simulated discharge such as observation indicate the superior performance of the rfss measure to simultaneously validate the rainfall and discharge datasets during short duration extreme events which may not be reflected in the conventional measures similar to the case of tmpa dataset in event a for event b despite higher errors in the cfsr dataset compared to wrf d01 the former is found to have a higher rfss value of 0 93 due to low discharge to rainfall ratio the tmpa dataset showed a positive b in rainfall and high nss e rainfall at most of the stations in the s w and n w regions resulting in high nss e discharge and subsequently low rfss of 0 87 the effect of wet bias in fnl jra and merra2 datasets is manifested in the flood discharges and can be noted through the negative rfss values and high error values for event c in general it is noticed that all the wrf domains along with the tmpa dataset perform well in simulating the flood discharges in the rainfall analysis most of the datasets showed negative b which is reflected in higher nss e rainfall values compared to the other two events the higher nss e rainfall values numerator in eq 1 lead to lower discharge to rainfall ratios causing higher rfss values almost equal to 1 compared to the other two events although wrf d02 and wrf d03 yielded the same rfss values considering the lowest b of 2 and rmse of 2 8 in the former it is concluded to perform the best this observation indicates that in case of the same rfss values other measures such as b rmse nss e rainfall and nss e discharge should be taken into account while analyzing the datasets further it is noticed that although tmpa dataset has a slightly lower bias than wrf d03 nss e discharge of tmpa is slightly higher which is expressed in the rfss with the former having a marginally lower value of 0 993 compared to rfss value of 0 994 by wrf d03 this indicates the ability of the rfss to capture subtle errors in the discharge regime of the region further emphasizing its utility in analyzing various datasets although in the rainfall analysis section 3 1 the merra2 rainfall dataset was found to perform reasonably over the region the downstream part of the up ugb region showed heavy rainfall in the range 250 300 mm causing high nss e rainfall value the unsatisfactory performance of the merra 2 dataset is shown through its low rfss value of 0 82 along with high b positive rmse and nss e discharge in the flood discharge such an observation indicates that although a rainfall dataset may generally well represent rainfall over the region it might not always yield reasonable flood discharge estimates at the outlet due to significant errors in the critical grids the cfsr dataset despite having less nss e rainfall value over the up ugb region showed a rfss value of 0 5 in association with high positive b rmse and nss e discharge in the flood discharge probably due to inability of the model to accurately simulate discharge for this case through this it can be inferred that the rfss measure can also help in examining the model performance the fnl and jra datasets similar to the other two events did not perform well in simulating flood discharges due to ill representation of rainfall considering the rfss obtained for each event overall rfss value for each dataset is computed sum of all the rfss values divided by the number of events and is presented in the last column of table 4 from this it is inferred that the wrf domains and the tmpa dataset perform reasonably in simulating floods across the three events on ranking the datasets based on the overall rfss values wrf d02 is found to have the highest score of 0 97 and therefore occupy the first place followed by wrf d01 wrf d03 and tmpa in the rainfall analysis although the cfsr dataset was found to perform moderately over the region the same was not concluded from the flood discharge simulations this further emphasizes the overall objective of this work to evaluate the errors in the flood discharge with respect to the rainfall datasets 4 summary and conclusions the overarching aim of this paper is to enable researchers to appropriately use the available rainfall datasets to accurately model floods in the data sparse himalayan region the detailed investigation is carried out over the mountainous terrain of the upstream part of the upper ganga basin up ugb for the three events that caused flooding in the region to identify the dataset that can best represent the rainfall over the up ugb region the rainfall obtained from the wrf simulations reanalysis datasets cfsr fnl jra and merra2 and tmpa satellite product are compared with the in situ rain gauge data the topography of the region is found to significantly influence the rainfall and causing large spatial variability the tmpa product is inferred to perform fairly accurately over the flat terrains in the foothills of the himalayas due to its ability to accurately receive the hydrometeor information in this region however it is unable to capture heavy rainfall in the valley areas of high altitude mountains probably due to inaccuracy in the cloud top temperature the reanalysis datasets are concluded to perform unsatisfactorily over the entire study region which is in line with the conclusions drawn in other studies such as ghodichore et al 2019 ghodichore et al 2018 kishore et al 2016 misra et al 2012 rana et al 2015 and shah and mishra 2014 the unsuitability of the reanalysis datasets over the himalayan terrain could be due to two reasons first ill simulation of cloud structure by the climate models used in the reanalysis leading to either wet or dry bias in the rainfall second the reanalysis datasets are generated by assimilating observations into the climate model the unavailability of reliable observations over the himalayan terrain could have contributed to errors in the reanalysis datasets from this it can be implied that although reanalysis datasets might be useful in simulating large scale weather conditions care must be taken while using them for regional studies especially over the mountainous areas quantitative evaluation of rainfall datasets showed that among all the datasets the wrf simulated rainfall has less errors in terms of bias rmse and scale over both valley and the flat terrain regions therefore through this work the importance of employing a nwp model the wrf model for simulating the heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in the data sparse himalayan region is established further wrf d01 and wrf d02 which are at a moderate spatial resolution of 27 km and 9 km respectively gave less errors bias and rmse compared to the fine resolution wrf d03 this inference highlights that fine resolution does not always yield best results rainfall simulations especially in convectively unstable regions such as the himalayas to obtain flood discharges for the up ugb region the calibrated vic hydrologic model is forced with all the rainfall datasets the variability in the rainfall is manifested in the flood discharges a rainfall flood skill score rfss is developed in this work to quantify the errors in simulated discharge with respect to the errors in the rainfall datasets the rfss is used to rank different datasets in the order of their ability to simulate floods in the up ugb region among all the datasets the three wrf domains are noticed to have high rfss values of 0 95 the wrf d02 is found to have maximum rfss value of 0 97 and therefore concluded to perform best and occupy the top place apart from wrf domains the tmpa dataset also yielded a reasonable rfss value of 0 94 and therefore inferred to successfully simulate floods in the region based on the analysis presented in this paper it is concluded that a vic model forced with the output from the wrf model set up over the up ugb or tmpa dataset can be used in future to perform flood forecasts in lead time for early detection and warning of floods in the up ugb region the analysis further suggests that the rainfall datasets which might overall perform good in representing rainfall over the region may not be able to well simulate the flood discharges due to significant errors in the critical grids locations the analysis presented in this work is subjected to a few limitations a the rain gauge density in the high mountainous terrain is very less and inclusion of additional data might cause slight variations in the results b for comparison against the station data the nearest grid point to the gauge is considered and selection of some other grid point might slightly alter the results c four reanalysis datasets and one satellite product are considered for the analysis and d comprehensive assessment of the systematic and random errors associated with the gauge data is not carried out nevertheless the conclusions of this study contribute towards understanding the performance of different datasets in the data sparse up ugb region and will benefit the hydrologic and climate community in selecting the appropriate rainfall dataset which will have critical implications on the flood modelling although the inferences made in this work are based on the case study area of up ugb but the work can be extended to any region in the himalayan terrain credit

5353,conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water requires integration of the entire system components into a single management model with a long term outlook this paper defines a cyclic storage system css of groundwater and surface water as a physically interconnected and operationally integrated surface water and groundwater subsystems with direct interactions this paper presents a generalized full scale modelling approach for reliability based optimum design of a multi objective surface water and groundwater management system in a multi period operation horizon with a cyclic storage perspective the approach employs an active long term intra annual distributed unsteady and multi objective simulation optimization scheme in a river reservoir aquifer setting the proposed css implicitly minimizes spill from reservoir which may be regarded as water loss in local spatial scale to manage the computational burden a hybrid of multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and linear programming is used the resulted pareto fronts would help the water managers to decide between the desired level of reliability and the maximum seasonal deficit during failure periods keywords reliability conjunctive use cyclic storage optimization groundwater 1 introduction in a very simple and general statement conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater may be defined as the optimized utilization of the water sources over time when both surface water and groundwater are simultaneously available depending on length of operation conjunctive use may be referred to as long cycle or short cycle conjunctive use may also be classified as active or passive hereafter a special case of active and long cycle conjunctive use which will be described later is referred as cyclic storage system css based on the type of groundwater simulation model used conjunctive use management models and or csss may be classified as lumped or distributed systems in a lumped parameter model spatial variations of parameters are ignored and the aquifer is often represented by a single cell the lumped models have extensively been used for water allocation long term planning and water balance purposes afshar et al 2008 marques et al 2010 sepahvand et al 2019 uses genetic programming gp to estimate the interaction between surface and groundwater resources in a multi objective conjunctive use plan other approaches include use of surrogate based model wu et al 2015 system dynamic approach hoekema and sridhar 2013 and fuzzy inference system chang et al 2013 to simulate the interactions in conjunctive water management models distributed groundwater parameters could be incorporated in a management model as embedding method em or response matrix rm method ghordoyee milan et al 2018 applications of distributed parameter models in management of surface water and groundwater may be classified as 1 stream aquifer system fuchs et al 2018 barlow et al 2003 2 reservoir aquifer system ghordoyee milan et al 2018 mani et al 2016 watkins and mckinney 1998 and 3 river reservoir aquifer system bredehoeft 2011 alimohammadi et al 2009 afshar et al 2010 although many researchers have tackled the full scale conjunctive use problem encompassing river reservoir and aquifer they have either assumed steady state condition or restricted to simulation modeling safavi et al 2010 bredehoeft 2011 conjunctive use could follow different temporal patterns and strategies based on type and length of operation in an early definition a version of active long cycle conjunctive use system was referred to as cyclic storage system lettenmaier and burges 1982 alimohammadi et al 2009 expanded the concept and extended the definition to differentiate between conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and cyclic storage system css in their definition surface reservoir s and aquifer s are treated as physically interconnected and operationally joint parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated in a holistic it has been argued that the css as defined may outperform the traditionally practiced active long cycle conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water rule based exchange of regulated water between groundwater aquifer and surface reservoir is the key element of a css that differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater as usually referred to and practiced in a conjunctive use simulation study bredehoeft 2011 concluded that effective management of a conjunctive groundwater and surface water system requires integration of the entire system components into a single management model with a long term outlook in a thorough review paper singh 2014 presents an overview on issues methods advantages and disadvantages of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture in another comprehensive paper zhang 2015 reviews the applications performances challenges and perspectives in conjunctive water management under climate change efficient real time control policies and or long term design and operation of a conjunctive use system may be addressed using simulation optimization s o techniques if uncertainties in input parameters are disregarded one may employ deterministic version of s o approach schoups et al 2006 conjunctive management of surface and groundwater resources under projected climate change mani et al 2016 with inter basin transfer tabari and yazdi 2014 with an off stream artificial lake pan et al 2016 are few examples of various approaches to the subject afshar et al 2010 presented and tested a hybrid algorithm for the solution of single objective cyclic storage system although multi objective approach to conjunctive water use management has been addressed by some researchers rezaei et al 2017 sepahvand et al 2019 the multi objective design and operation of a css consisting of river reservoir and aquifer under distributed unsteady condition has remained untouched which is intended to be addressed in this research it has been claimed that by treating the surface and subsurface reservoirs aquifers as parallel and operationally and physically interconnected subsystems significant improvements in their management and performance can be achieved alimohammadi et al 2009 it has been argued that csss may significantly increase the system s reliability in any long term operational period although reliability based design is not a new concept its utilization in design of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water systems has not been touched yet afshar et al 2016 proposed a reliability based design methodology by embedding reliability constraints into a hybrid aco lp model for direct minimization of reservoir capacity with specified reliability the approach eliminated iterative procedures in reliability based reservoir design problem reliability based optimum design of csss is a much more complicated problem both from conceptual and computational perspectives this paper introduces a special formulation of a multi objective reliability based design of css and an efficient solution methodology the paper presents a generalized full scale modelling approach for optimal reliability based design of a multi objective surface water and groundwater management system in a multi period operation horizon with a cyclic storage perspective the approach employs an active long term intra annual distributed and unsteady multi objective simulation optimization scheme in a river reservoir aquifer setting a spatial and temporal solution to the model is both expensive and challenging demanding a highly efficient solution algorithm to manage the computational burden a hybrid of multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and linear programming is used results may help water managers to consider feasible and non dominated designs and policy evaluation under cyclic and non cyclic storage operation strategies 2 cyclic storage system modeling 2 1 conceptual model this paper defines a css as a physically interconnected and operationally integrated surface water and groundwater subsystems with direct interactions between the subsystems alimohammadi et al 2009 this definition treats surface and subsurface impoundment subsystems as competing and potentially interconnected parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated as a css in general the surface subsystem may include number of single purpose or multipurpose surface reservoirs in series or parallel the subsurface subsystem may consist of single or multiple aquifers along with their pumping wells and recharging wells or basins natural water courses as well as water conveyance and or diversion structures may form the water transfer subsystem the optimum development of css components consisting of the amount of water transfer between elements of the subsystems and their joint operating rules should be determined as css characteristics in fact the amount of water transfer between components of the system should be treated as decision variables along the periods of the planning horizon rule based artificial recharge of groundwater with regulated releases from surface reservoirs is the key element of a css which differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as a common practice the css as illustrated in fig 1 assumes that water may directly be transferred from the surface reservoir and or the downstream river to the demand site r d s d i v d r i v and artificial recharge basin or wells r a r s d i v a r r i v water released from the surface reservoir to the river r r i v s may contribute in interaction between the river and aquifer q ar riv irrigation demand may partially be satisfied through groundwater r d g as illustrated d e e p is deep percolation to the groundwater seep is the infiltration from precipitation p r c e s is evaporation s p i l l is spill from the reservoir and q r i v o u t is the surface water leaving the system s boundary 2 2 mathematical formulation 2 2 1 simulation model in a distributed css model the simulation model may be coupled with the optimization model either by embedding or by the unit response matrix method urm in the embedding approach the simulation model is directly used as a set of constraints in the management model in this method drawdowns must be calculated at many grid points where there is no economic interest despite recent advances in computation technology such as cloud computing and parallelization embedding scheme for multi period real world nonlinear and non convex csss may require extensive computational time the unit response matrix method urm on the other hand makes use of an external groundwater simulation model to develop unit responses of the aquifer system to perturbations in the pumping and or recharge at selected points lines or surfaces in the domain unit responses are then assembled to form a response matrix to be included in the management model as groundwater flow constraints this study uses modified unit response approach for unconfined aquifer response evaluation to external stresses excitations as proposed by alimohammadi et al 2009 1 s k n t 1 n j 1 j β k k j n t m k k j n t q j t in which m k k j n t is the correction coefficient for excited cell k for unit excitation in exciting cell j during time period t β k k j n t is the unit response coefficient for excited cell k at the end of time period n for unit excitation in exciting cell j during time period t in fact m k k j n t is a correction factor which partially adjusts the nonlinear response of the excited cell in an unconfined aquifer alimohammadi et al 2009 when geometry and or boundaries conditions are complex or if the aquifer is non homogenous detailed three dimensional numerical simulation models may be preferred 2 2 2 reliability based design deterministic design optimization problems are often bonded with the design constraints which leave little or no latitude for uncertainties and chance of failure to address the uncertainties robust and reliability based design optimization are often used to address the uncertainties in designs while robust designs intend to keep the variation in performance functions minimal the reliability based designs keep the chance of system failure within pre specified low values agarwal 2004 in reliability based optimum design rbod problems there is a trade off between obtaining higher reliability and lowering cost if justified rbod formulation replaces the critical failure modes in deterministic optimization with a single or set of constraints on probabilities of failures afshar et al 2016 the reliability constraints address the probability of failure corresponding to the failure modes of the system or a single constraint on the system probability of failure agarwal 2004 in water resources problems reliability of the water supply system is defined as the probability that the system will perform the required function by satisfying the demand during the planned horizon under stated conditions in a cyclic storage system the reliability should consider the joint operation of surface water and groundwater subsystems considering their physical interconnection and operational integration as addressed in fig 1 considering the random nature of reservoir inflows optimum sizing of the reservoir and water delivery subsystems for satisfying a given demand with an acceptable level of reliability lends itself to a reliability based design problem although the general concepts for planning design and or operation of such system remains the same the decision variables objective functions constraints and the structure of models may vary from one to another problem water demand reliability is the probability that the available water supply meets the water demand during the period of simulation for any period t the deficit is positive if the demand exceeds the water supplied for that period loucks 1997 2 d t x target t x supply t if x target t x supply t 0 otherwise where x target t a n d x supply t refer to the target demand and supplied water during period t respectively time based reliability is defined as the portion of time that water demand is fully supplied with respect to the total number of simulation time intervals mcmahon et al 2006 3 rel no o f t i m e s d t 0 total t i m e p e r i o d s reliability based design as addressed by eqs 2 3 may lead to very severe deficit while intending to limit the number of failures therefore it is often recommended to bond the deficits in one way or another in this study the shortage deficit may not exceed a pre specified fraction of the total demand in another word the release may never be smaller than a fraction of demand specified by γ afshar et al 2016 this study assumes that the municipal and industrial demands have higher priorities and must be fully satisfied the fraction γ only applies to the irrigation demand 2 2 3 optimization model as stated earlier the surface reservoir s may release the regulated water into the river water course subsystem with possibility of being used for water supply artificial recharge of the aquifer and downstream environmental water right the supervised release to the water course may be used for irrigation diversion for aquifer recharge downstream requirement or any combination of them in addition to the supervised flow the unsupervised flow reservoir spill may also be used for artificial recharge through diversion to the recharge cells and or interaction between river and aquifer demand in css may be fulfilled by combination of groundwater pumping river diversion and direct release from surface reservoir s other interactions between the subsystems are schematically defined in fig 1 in a css different objectives may be of interest the objectives may include but not limited to minimization of total cost total deficit groundwater drawdown energy consumption system s reliability and or maximization of total water supply food production agricultural profit and environmental enhancement realizing the importance of system s reliability and sustainable development this study focuses on a design that maximizes the reliability of system over the planning horizon and a measure of the total cost of the system in a multi objective setting employing the urm method the general structure of a multi objective multi period nonlinear cyclic storage system design which intends to minimize the present value of cost while maximizing the system s reliability for meeting the specified demand may be formulated as 4a minimizepvc m i n i m i z e xi c a p x i b xi 4b m a x i m i z e r e l t 1 t z t z t 1 if d e m a n d i s f u l l y s a t i s f i

the construction and operational cost t is the total simulation period and rel is the total reliability of the system over simulation period the total cost accounts for the capital investment cost and the operation cost over the entire horizon the model may be subject to the following constraints ostadrahimi 2015 a the first set of constraints defines the monthly mass balance in surface reservoir s and bonds on associated components capacities 5 f 1 t s t s q t s e t s r d t s r ar t s r riv t s c s c d s c ar s spill t 0 t where r d s r ar s and r riv s refer to release from surface reservoir to demand area artificial recharge sites and downstream river respectively spill from the reservoir is denoted by spill whereas s s q s c s c d s andc ar s define the reservoir storage inflow to the reservoir reservoir storage capacity and design capacities of elements conveying water from reservoir to demand area and artificial recharge site respectively here after the subscripts and or superscripts s g d ar w and riv refer to surface reservoir aquifer demand area artificial recharge site pumping wells and downstream river respectively b the second set of constraints defines the change in groundwater storage because of groundwater pumping natural and or artificial recharge as 6 f 2 t r ar t s div ar t riv q j t w q a q t riv q l t ar c ar riv deep t i seep t p δ s t g 0 j l t in which δ s g div ar riv c ar riv q a q riv deep t i and seep t p refer to change in groundwater storage diversion from the river to artificial recharge site design capacity of delivery subsystem

from well j q j w and artificial recharge rate to recharge unit l q l t ar are bonded with their maximum and minimum design capacities the total amount of flow leaving the aquifer to the demand area r d g will be equal to the summation of pumping from all active wells 7 r d g j 1 m q j w c the third set of constraints addresses the spatial changes in groundwater level at different discharge and recharge units wells 8 f 3 t h k t g q j t ar q j t w s w t k s ar t l q aq t riv 0 j k l t in which h k t g s w t k s ar t l q aq t riv refer to the depth to groundwater level in discharge or recharge unit k drawdown in pumping unit k groundwater rise in recharging unit l during time period and flow from river to the aquifer through their interactions d the fourth set of constraints deals with the demand and possible deficit to the pre specified irrigation demand as 9 f 4 t r d t s r d t g div d t riv d t def t 0 t in which d t and def t refer to the pre specified demand and deficit during period t respectively e the fifth set of constraints addresses the physical interaction between the aquifer and river as a linear source or sink 10 f 5 t q aq t riv h t g h t riv z riv c riv 0

hydraulic conductivity length of river reach width and thickness in each river reach f spatial and temporal variation of river water level must be defined by a set of equations describing inflow to and outflow from the river reaches lateral flows and changes in river storage as 11 f 6 t q r t in q r t out ql t in δ h r t riv δ s r t riv 0 t where q r t in q r t out ql t in δ h r t riv δ s r t riv refer to inflow to and outflow from lateral flow change in water level and change in storage at the rth reach of the river g a set of constraints has been defined which determines and bonds the reliability of the system in satisfying the specified demand over the planning horizon 12 f 4 t r d t s r d t g div d t riv d t α γ 0 t 13 rel t 1 n z t n 14 z t 1 if d e m a n d i s f u l l y s a t i s f i e d 0 otherwise t h the last set of constraints may present a set of generic rules to govern the operation of the components of the system the state variables which have pronounced impact on the system operation are used to define parameterized rule curves these rules may be embedded into the design and operation model to generalize the operation of the subsystems during the entire planning horizon the following linear regression structure for the rules is proposed 15 r y t x a y τ x s t s q t s b y τ x k 1 nw s w t 1 k nw c y τ x d t t τ 1 2 3 4 where a y τ x b y τ x and c y τ x are the rule coefficients for season τ decision variables in operation model and r y t x stands for release from subsystem x to y during period t and nw refers to the number of wells this study proposes five specific rules to define the releases or diversions from 1 surface reservoir to demand area and downstream river 2 diversion from river to demand site and artificial recharge sites and 3 withdraw from groundwater to be used at the demand area this study disregards the generic operational rules which is more pertinent to real time operation of the system the proposed reliability based design of css is highly nonlinear non convex non continuous non differentiable and probably multimodal with very small feasible zone use of available gradient based optimization solvers may present profound difficulties hence a more robust optimization technique may be required recent developments in hybrid algorithms presents promising approaches to solving complex optimization problems afshar et al 2010 2 2 4 solution methodology evolutionary and meta heuristic algorithms have extensively been used to solve complex engineering and water resources management problems labadie 2004 afshar et al 2016 besides genetic algorithm nicklow et al 2010 ant colony optimization algorithm afshar et al 2015 honey bees mating optimization bozorg haddad et al 2006 particle swarm optimization pso has successfully been used in various water resources management problem afshar et al 2018 ostadrahimi et al 2012 in this study the css simulation optimization model is solved using an efficient decomposition approach and a specially tailored pso algorithm the complex css design model is decomposed into two sub models for computational affordability the first sub model is an unconstrained multi objective model with multi objective pso mopso formulation which aims at optimizing the original objective functions of the problem addressed by present value of total cost pvtc and system reliability penalized with the value of total constraints violation in the original set of constraints eqs 5 14 this sub model benefits from multi swarm version of mopso tailored for this setting the second sub model aims at minimizing the infeasibilities as addressed by the constraints violations to handle the constraints trial values of selected complicating variables as optimized in the mopso sub model are imported into the original nonlinear set of constraints to form a virtual lp model the resulted virtual lp model may fail to satisfy the constraints hence it is formulated to minimize the total constraints violations afshar et al 2010 thus the proposed two stage hybrid multi swarm mopso lp algorithm is adapted to optimize the operation of the proposed conjunctive use model in a cyclic storage system representation for the rule based operation model the rule coefficients eq 15 may equally be considered as complicating variables which have to be determined by particles in the swarm at each iteration for the design problem operational rules have been relaxed and the capacity of the facilities are considered as complicating variables defining tcv as the vector of total constraints violations minimized in the virtual lp model the original management model may be reformulated as 16a minimize p v c w t c v 16b maximize r e l w t c v where w refers to the vector of penalty values assigned to constraints violations the virtual lp model minimizes a measure of total non feasibilities total constraints violations for any given set of trial values for complicating variable received from the mopso model 17 minimize t c v i 1 m inf i inf i 0 subject to 18 g i x inf i 0 inf i 0 where m total number of the constraints and inf i infeasibility in the ith constraint the two sub models i e mopso and virtual lp will keep running until the best particle solution in the swarm gets zero non feasibility and values of the associated decision variables result in a non dominated optimal solution for further information on the solution methodology one may refer to ostadrahimi 2015 3 model application and results 3 1 3 1 basic data to illustrate the application and performance of the proposed multi objective approach to a highly complex reliability based cyclic storage system design the kinevars dam and its downstream basin on abhar river in iran originally introduced by alimohammadi et al 2009 is used in brief the system is composed of a local aquifer and kinevars surface reservoir which intended to regulate the natural flow of the abhar river for municipal water supply and agricultural irrigation realizing the complexity and the time scale of the problem huge amount of reliable data is needed to successfully run the model these data are classified as hydrological hydrogeological hydraulic demand and economic data to appreciate the performance of the proposed modeling scheme a 40 season problem has been used to generate the optimum design parameters under varying reliabilities smaller scale problems have been solved for model validation and set up and a 120 period problem is also solved to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution algorithm average seasonal inflow to the reservoir has been estimated as 7 6 million cubic meters mcm with standard deviation of 7 7 mcm fig 2 the distribution of average seasonal inflow shows relatively high seasonal variation while 53 and 29 of the inflow occurs in spring and winter only 15 and 3 occurs in fall and summer respectively realizing the longer response time of the aquifer compared to the surface reservoir the seasonal model has been preferred to the monthly operation model the hydrogeological data may present hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer and the underlying geological formation of the riverbed as well as the pumping and recharge sites it also may include unit response coefficients for different excitations as derived from simulation and or existing operational data it should also include an estimation of the inflow and outflow from the boundaries if any as well as the possible deep percolation from the rainfall and irrigation to the groundwater body for modeling purpose the 8 by 10 km aquifer has been divided into cells of 1000 500 m in vertical and horizontal directions respectively the hydrodynamic properties are assumed constant within each cell spatial variation of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients may be found in ostadrahimi 2015 river reach is approximated as a 20 m wide and 10 m deep rectangle with manning s coefficient and longitudinal slope of 0 02 and 0 0001 respectively seasonal water demand for different sectors is presented in table 1 while the environmental flow receives the highest priority the urban water demand has been given higher priority compared to the agricultural water demand 3 2 model setup and validation to start the application it is assumed that the system is initially at rest with groundwater and stream stage at the same level in the absence of reliable field data it is assumed that 5 of seasonal precipitation and 10 of supplied water both for irrigation and domestic use percolate into the aquifer it is further assumed that 10 of the seasonal supplied water for irrigation returns to the second reach of the river during the same season the maximum variation of the groundwater level from its normal condition is restricted between 10 10 m it is also assumed that maximum pumping from or recharge to each well may not exceed 3 mcm per season for more details on the study area one may refer to alimohammadi et al 2009 to validate the performance of the proposed hybrid multi start mopso lp model in a single objective setting the results for a single objective small scale 8 periods version of the proposed model are compared with the results of a well established gradient based nonlinear solver lingo lindo systems inc 2004 with 80 particles and after 16 000 function evaluations the best solution of the proposed model from 10 independent runs was the same as the previously reported optimal solutions alimohammadi et al 2009 performance of the proposed mopso algorithm in a bi objective setting was verified through its application to well established continuous function zdt1 and discontinuous function zdt3 although not presented here almost perfect match between the results of the proposed model and real optimal pareto front was observed ostadrahimi 2015 the concept and definition of crowding distance and diversity is used to check the distribution of the solutions on the pareto front more specific data and results are available from the second author 3 3 results and discussion solution to the problem defined by eqs 1 14 is obtained by applying the proposed hybrid algorithm for the design model the capacities of different subsystems and their components are taken as complicating variables looking for the optimum values of releases from each subsystem and their components assumed values for the complicating variables design capacities are imported into the original nlp model to transfer it to a linear programming lp structure since these values are randomly generated they may not address a feasible solution failing to satisfy the constraints in order to solve the problem with lp algorithms each constraint is free to generate as much as non feasibility as it needs to find a general solution for the problem therefore at any iteration decision and state variables plus constraint violations are determined for each particle trial solution to find a feasible solution a big penalty is applied to constraints violation for each particle the proposed hybrid algorithm finds the non dominated solutions for all particles at each iteration by simultaneously minimizing equations 16 a and 16 b which are penalized by total non feasibilities this process is continued until the non feasibilities approaches zero and the nominated solutions are non dominated and satisfy the stopping criteria for the 120 period css 100 particles with 1800 iteration was used for obtaining satisfactory pareto front it took approximately 36 h of cpu time on a computer with 16 gb memory and intel corei7 3 4 ghz of cpu therefore in this study each iteration for a single trial solution takes 0 72 s of cpu time on the computer with the named specifications fig 3 presents the pareto front resulted from solution to the proposed multi objective problem for maximum seasonal deficit of 20 and 30 percent over the entire simulation period if failure occurs i e β 0 2 and 0 3 for reliability restricted between 1 and 0 5 the problem as defined is expected to have 61 non dominated solutions in a 120 period problem the computation is terminated when the stopping criteria i e diversity and scattering are met for partial verification of the results the specification of the solution with 100 percent reliability was compared with those derived from the solution of single objective model they happened to address the same design and operational results in all simulation runs it is assumed that the environmental and municipal demands must be fully satisfied and the deficit is assigned to agricultural demand if failure occurs in specific for β 0 2 the deficit in agricultural demand may not exceed 20 percent of the demand of that period in other words for β 0 2 agricultural water supply may not fall below 80 percent of the target demand at each season over the entire simulation period the general shape of the fronts shows that for reliability smaller than 0 97 the rate of increase in cost for any increase in reliability level is almost constant fig 3 however as the reliability level approaches to one the marginal cost of additional reliability significantly increases for both β 0 2 and 0 3 as observed for all range of reliabilities the total cost follows approximately the same trend for β 0 2 and 0 3 as expected the total cost 1028 2 thousand dollars remains unchanged for 100 percent reliability regardless of changing β from 0 2 to 0 3 for all other reliability levels the present value of total cost pvtc decreases as β increases from 0 2 to 0 3 as an example for reliability level of 0 7 the pvtc decreases by more than four percent from 845 8 to 809 5 dollars when β is increased from 0 2 to 0 3 for deep observations some of the solutions on the fronts are selected for detail analysis one may argue that the reliability level of one for agricultural demand may not be justified in regions with significantly high inter and intra year variation in inflows thus relatively lower reliability may be agreed upon when capital budget is of concern to observe this condition three solutions from the set of optimal non dominated solutions are selected for detail observation and analysis these solutions are identified as solutions a b and c referring to the reliability levels of 1 0 8 and 0 5 respectively the two end points of the pareto fronts fig 3 describe the situations where either the reliability is at its highest level rel 1 or the cost is at its minimum for the lowest allowed reliability level rel 0 5 the first solution on the right side of the pareto front solution a has minimized the total present value of cost without any deficit during the entire planning horizon i e rel 1 this solution with 1028 2 of pvtc demands more than 406 mcm of groundwater pumping where 240 mcm is replenished through artificial recharge on the other side of the pareto front fig 3 relaxing the reliability level to 0 5 pvtc may be reduced by 20 percent from 1028 2 to 821 9 solution c or 26 percent from 1028 2 to 761 2 for β 0 2 and β 0 3 respectively solution b or any solution close to this one may receive attention from the practitioners in which relatively small number of failures with tolerable vulnerability may occur in this case solution b relaxes the reliability level by 20 percent for β 0 3 for detail observations some of the results for solution b is presented in fig 4 a 4d variation in groundwater storage during the simulation period for 80 percent reliability and β 0 2 and 0 3 is presented in fig 4a as illustrated for all seasons the groundwater storage for a more flexible strategy i e β 0 3 is lower than that of more restricted strategy with β 0 2 in other words for more restricted strategy requires higher groundwater storage to fulfill the future demand under prescribed strategy the variation in groundwater storage clearly illustrates the capability of the proposed css modeling in storing and releasing groundwater in a cyclic pattern it is worth to mention that for a perfect water balance the end of period groundwater storage is forced to be equal to the initial storage temporal variation of water leaving the system s boundary is presented in fig 4b as illustrated for a more relaxed strategy with β 0 3 higher volume of water leaves the system s boundary toward the downstream although this water may be used to partially satisfy the demands in the downstream it may be categorized as lost water for those within the system s boundary it is interesting to note that for reliability of 80 percent the total water leaving the system boundary during the entire simulation period for β 0 3 and β 0 2 are determined as 200 and 185 mcm respectively the total volume of water leaving the system under 100 percent reliability approaches to 155 mcm in other words the results show that with the proposed cyclic storage approach the system may use the water leaving the system s boundary to support more than 30 percent increase in annual demand if economically justified variation of groundwater level in well number 3 for reliability level of 80 percent is presented in fig 4c as illustrated for a more relaxed strategy β 0 3 number of periods that water level in the well approaches to its upper bond far exceeds those of the more sever strategy with β 0 2 on the other side more sever strategy with β 0 2 causes the water level to drop to its allowed minimum value of 35 m more frequently fig 4d presents the temporal variation of deficit for reliability level of 80 percent results show that for reliability level of 80 percent the total deficit during the planning horizon for β 0 3 and β 0 2 ranges from 39 to 28 mcm which account for 6 4 and 4 6 percent of the total demand although a 20 percent deficit in each failure period is permitted the deficit in failure seasons ranges from zero to 30 and 20 percent for β 0 3 and β 0 2 respectively fig 4d it is also clearly shown that the number of unsatisfactory periods over the entire 120 periods is exactly equal to 24 periods addressing the restricted reliability level of 80 percent to be more specific for β 0 2 number of small deficits under 0 8 mcm per season has been observed with 0 34 and 2 12 mcm as the smallest and larger deficits respectively for β 0 3 however deficits are in higher orders compared to the more severe strategy with β 0 2 3 4 discussion of the results as stated earlier this study aims at developing a reliability based optimum design of css for managing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater system with physically interconnected and operationally integrated subsystems due to the uncertainties in different sources of water system failure may occur during the lifetime of the project although reliability of the system performance is of great concern the severity of those failures if any can be of greater concern in fact small failures vulnerability may often be accepted by the operators and the stakeholders if the system s resiliency is high enough this study addresses the tradeoff between system reliability and present value of total cost for different values of vulnerability measure this specification differentiates the present work with all previous conjunctive use and css modellings efforts it was shown that the design and operation of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater subsystems with css approach may significantly outperform the classical conjunctive use models with non cyclic operation strategy the proposed approach allows groundwater recharge with regulated surface water for reducing the future uncontrolled spill from the reservoir in other words the css model treats the surface and groundwater resources as parallel reservoirs and behaves as an intelligent system in reducing water leaving the system s boundary although spill minimization is not explicitly included in the objectives it reduces the uncontrolled spill from the reservoir through releasing some regulated water for artificial groundwater recharge hence providing some extra space for possible high inflow to the reservoir in upcoming seasons one may argue about the possible additional energy required to pump back water from the groundwater aquifer our analysis however shows that for any given reliability level the css requires smaller pumping energy over the planning horizon this is mainly because the css does not overuse the groundwater storage to satisfy demand during dry periods as often is the case in classic conjunctive use plan implementation of the proposed css approach can increase decrease system reliability vulnerability through rule based joint operation of surface and groundwater resources under uncertain circumstances such as climate change it makes the system operation more robust in facing extreme conditions the proposed css approach may effectively be used to regulate the inflows with very low frequencies for future use with significantly reduced cost in the present study implementation of the proposed cyclic storage approach can support approximately 30 percent increase in annual demand if required 4 conclusions this paper presented a special structure for managing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as an integrated approach the proposed structure treats surface and subsurface impoundment subsystems as competing and potentially interconnected parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated as a cyclic storage system css although this paper tackled a single purpose single reservoir aquifer stream case the approach may be expanded for multipurpose multiple reservoirs and multi aquifer systems rule based artificial recharge of groundwater with regulated releases from surface reservoirs is the key element of a css which differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as a common practice it was shown that the proposed solution methodology may efficiently overcome the computational burden of the large scale bi objective and reliability based css it was shown that the proposed css can deliver additional water with higher reliability if 30 percent increase in demand is foreseen in the future it was shown that the cost of regulating the inflows with very low frequencies are significantly reduced if css is used this result shows that with the proposed cyclic storage approach the system may support approximately 30 percent increase in annual demand if required the decision makers may use the derived set of optimal non dominated solutions to tradeoff between the desired reliability level maximum seasonal deficits and the pvtc the specifications of all solutions displayed on the pareto fronts are available each solution on the front including the first and the last one is defined by their optimum values on the objective functions and the vector of decision variables the provided pareto fronts would help the water managers to decide between the desired level of reliability and the maximum seasonal deficit during failure periods the model may further be improved by using a semi distributed groundwater model to simulate groundwater flow and its interaction with the surface water body the stochasticity and uncertainties may partially be addressed by using a parameterized simulation

generalized full scale modelling approach for reliability based optimum design of a multi objective surface water and groundwater management system in a multi period operation horizon with a cyclic storage perspective the approach employs an active long term intra annual distributed unsteady and multi objective simulation optimization scheme in a river reservoir aquifer setting the proposed css implicitly minimizes spill from reservoir which may be regarded as water loss in local spatial scale to manage the computational burden a hybrid of multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and linear programming is used the resulted pareto fronts would help the water managers to decide between the desired level of reliability and the maximum seasonal deficit during failure periods keywords reliability conjunctive use cyclic storage optimization groundwater 1 introduction in a very simple and general statement conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater may be defined as the optimized utilization of the water sources over time when both surface water and groundwater are simultaneously available depending on length of operation conjunctive use may be referred to as long cycle or short cycle conjunctive use may also be classified as active or passive hereafter a special case of active and long cycle conjunctive use which will be described later is referred as cyclic storage system css based on the type of groundwater simulation model used conjunctive use management models and or csss may be classified as lumped or distributed systems in a lumped parameter model spatial variations of parameters are ignored and the aquifer is often represented by a single cell the lumped models have extensively been used for water allocation long term planning and water balance purposes afshar et al 2008 marques et al 2010 sepahvand et al 2019 uses genetic programming gp to estimate the interaction between surface and groundwater resources in a multi objective conjunctive use plan other approaches include use of surrogate based model wu et al 2015 system dynamic approach hoekema and sridhar 2013 and fuzzy inference system chang et al 2013 to simulate the interactions in conjunctive water management models distributed groundwater parameters could be incorporated in a management model as embedding method em or response matrix rm method ghordoyee milan et al 2018 applications of distributed parameter models in management of surface water and groundwater may be classified as 1 stream aquifer system fuchs et al 2018 barlow et al 2003 2 reservoir aquifer system ghordoyee milan et al 2018 mani et al 2016 watkins and mckinney 1998 and 3 river reservoir aquifer system bredehoeft 2011 alimohammadi et al 2009 afshar et al 2010 although many researchers have tackled the full scale conjunctive use problem encompassing river reservoir and aquifer they have either assumed steady state condition or restricted to simulation modeling safavi et al 2010 bredehoeft 2011 conjunctive use could follow different temporal patterns and strategies based on type and length of operation in an early definition a version of active long cycle conjunctive use system was referred to as cyclic storage system lettenmaier and burges 1982 alimohammadi et al 2009 expanded the concept and extended the definition to differentiate between conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and cyclic storage system css in their definition surface reservoir s and aquifer s are treated as physically interconnected and operationally joint parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated in a holistic it has been argued that the css as defined may outperform the traditionally practiced active long cycle conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water rule based exchange of regulated water between groundwater aquifer and surface reservoir is the key element of a css that differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater as usually referred to and practiced in a conjunctive use simulation study bredehoeft 2011 concluded that effective management of a conjunctive groundwater and surface water system requires integration of the entire system components into a single management model with a long term outlook in a thorough review paper singh 2014 presents an overview on issues methods advantages and disadvantages of the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater resources for sustainable irrigated agriculture in another comprehensive paper zhang 2015 reviews the applications performances challenges and perspectives in conjunctive water management under climate change efficient real time control policies and or long term design and operation of a conjunctive use system may be addressed using simulation optimization s o techniques if uncertainties in input parameters are disregarded one may employ deterministic version of s o approach schoups et al 2006 conjunctive management of surface and groundwater resources under projected climate change mani et al 2016 with inter basin transfer tabari and yazdi 2014 with an off stream artificial lake pan et al 2016 are few examples of various approaches to the subject afshar et al 2010 presented and tested a hybrid algorithm for the solution of single objective cyclic storage system although multi objective approach to conjunctive water use management has been addressed by some researchers rezaei et al 2017 sepahvand et al 2019 the multi objective design and operation of a css consisting of river reservoir and aquifer under distributed unsteady condition has remained untouched which is intended to be addressed in this research it has been claimed that by treating the surface and subsurface reservoirs aquifers as parallel and operationally and physically interconnected subsystems significant improvements in their management and performance can be achieved alimohammadi et al 2009 it has been argued that csss may significantly increase the system s reliability in any long term operational period although reliability based design is not a new concept its utilization in design of conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water systems has not been touched yet afshar et al 2016 proposed a reliability based design methodology by embedding reliability constraints into a hybrid aco lp model for direct minimization of reservoir capacity with specified reliability the approach eliminated iterative procedures in reliability based reservoir design problem reliability based optimum design of csss is a much more complicated problem both from conceptual and computational perspectives this paper introduces a special formulation of a multi objective reliability based design of css and an efficient solution methodology the paper presents a generalized full scale modelling approach for optimal reliability based design of a multi objective surface water and groundwater management system in a multi period operation horizon with a cyclic storage perspective the approach employs an active long term intra annual distributed and unsteady multi objective simulation optimization scheme in a river reservoir aquifer setting a spatial and temporal solution to the model is both expensive and challenging demanding a highly efficient solution algorithm to manage the computational burden a hybrid of multi objective particle swarm optimization algorithm and linear programming is used results may help water managers to consider feasible and non dominated designs and policy evaluation under cyclic and non cyclic storage operation strategies 2 cyclic storage system modeling 2 1 conceptual model this paper defines a css as a physically interconnected and operationally integrated surface water and groundwater subsystems with direct interactions between the subsystems alimohammadi et al 2009 this definition treats surface and subsurface impoundment subsystems as competing and potentially interconnected parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated as a css in general the surface subsystem may include number of single purpose or multipurpose surface reservoirs in series or parallel the subsurface subsystem may consist of single or multiple aquifers along with their pumping wells and recharging wells or basins natural water courses as well as water conveyance and or diversion structures may form the water transfer subsystem the optimum development of css components consisting of the amount of water transfer between elements of the subsystems and their joint operating rules should be determined as css characteristics in fact the amount of water transfer between components of the system should be treated as decision variables along the periods of the planning horizon rule based artificial recharge of groundwater with regulated releases from surface reservoirs is the key element of a css which differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as a common practice the css as illustrated in fig 1 assumes that water may directly be transferred from the surface reservoir and or the downstream river to the demand site r d s d i v d r i v and artificial recharge basin or wells r a r s d i v a r r i v water released from the surface reservoir to the river r r i v s may contribute in interaction between the river and aquifer q ar riv irrigation demand may partially be satisfied through groundwater r d g as illustrated d e e p is deep percolation to the groundwater seep is the infiltration from precipitation p r c e s is evaporation s p i l l is spill from the reservoir and q r i v o u t is the surface water leaving the system s boundary 2 2 mathematical formulation 2 2 1 simulation model in a distributed css model the simulation model may be coupled with the optimization model either by embedding or by the unit response matrix method urm in the embedding approach the simulation model is directly used as a set of constraints in the management model in this method drawdowns must be calculated at many grid points where there is no economic interest despite recent advances in computation technology such as cloud computing and parallelization embedding scheme for multi period real world nonlinear and non convex csss may require extensive computational time the unit response matrix method urm on the other hand makes use of an external groundwater simulation model to develop unit responses of the aquifer system to perturbations in the pumping and or recharge at selected points lines or surfaces in the domain unit responses are then assembled to form a response matrix to be included in the management model as groundwater flow constraints this study uses modified unit response approach for unconfined aquifer response evaluation to external stresses excitations as proposed by alimohammadi et al 2009 1 s k n t 1 n j 1 j β k k j n t m k k j n t q j t in which m k k j n t is the correction coefficient for excited cell k for unit excitation in exciting cell j during time period t β k k j n t is the unit response coefficient for excited cell k at the end of time period n for unit excitation in exciting cell j during time period t in fact m k k j n t is a correction factor which partially adjusts the nonlinear response of the excited cell in an unconfined aquifer alimohammadi et al 2009 when geometry and or boundaries conditions are complex or if the aquifer is non homogenous detailed three dimensional numerical simulation models may be preferred 2 2 2 reliability based design deterministic design optimization problems are often bonded with the design constraints which leave little or no latitude for uncertainties and chance of failure to address the uncertainties robust and reliability based design optimization are often used to address the uncertainties in designs while robust designs intend to keep the variation in performance functions minimal the reliability based designs keep the chance of system failure within pre specified low values agarwal 2004 in reliability based optimum design rbod problems there is a trade off between obtaining higher reliability and lowering cost if justified rbod formulation replaces the critical failure modes in deterministic optimization with a single or set of constraints on probabilities of failures afshar et al 2016 the reliability constraints address the probability of failure corresponding to the failure modes of the system or a single constraint on the system probability of failure agarwal 2004 in water resources problems reliability of the water supply system is defined as the probability that the system will perform the required function by satisfying the demand during the planned horizon under stated conditions in a cyclic storage system the reliability should consider the joint operation of surface water and groundwater subsystems considering their physical interconnection and operational integration as addressed in fig 1 considering the random nature of reservoir inflows optimum sizing of the reservoir and water delivery subsystems for satisfying a given demand with an acceptable level of reliability lends itself to a reliability based design problem although the general concepts for planning design and or operation of such system remains the same the decision variables objective functions constraints and the structure of models may vary from one to another problem water demand reliability is the probability that the available water supply meets the water demand during the period of simulation for any period t the deficit is positive if the demand exceeds the water supplied for that period loucks 1997 2 d t x target t x supply t if x target t x supply t 0 otherwise where x target t a n d x supply t refer to the target demand and supplied water during period t respectively time based reliability is defined as the portion of time that water demand is fully supplied with respect to the total number of simulation time intervals mcmahon et al 2006 3 rel no o f t i m e s d t 0 total t i m e p e r i o d s reliability based design as addressed by eqs 2 3 may lead to very severe deficit while intending to limit the number of failures therefore it is often recommended to bond the deficits in one way or another in this study the shortage deficit may not exceed a pre specified fraction of the total demand in another word the release may never be smaller than a fraction of demand specified by γ afshar et al 2016 this study assumes that the municipal and industrial demands have higher priorities and must be fully satisfied the fraction γ only applies to the irrigation demand 2 2 3 optimization model as stated earlier the surface reservoir s may release the regulated water into the river water course subsystem with possibility of being used for water supply artificial recharge of the aquifer and downstream environmental water right the supervised release to the water course may be used for irrigation diversion for aquifer recharge downstream requirement or any combination of them in addition to the supervised flow the unsupervised flow reservoir spill may also be used for artificial recharge through diversion to the recharge cells and or interaction between river and aquifer demand in css may be fulfilled by combination of groundwater pumping river diversion and direct release from surface reservoir s other interactions between the subsystems are schematically defined in fig 1 in a css different objectives may be of interest the objectives may include but not limited to minimization of total cost total deficit groundwater drawdown energy consumption system s reliability and or maximization of total water supply food production agricultural profit and environmental enhancement realizing the importance of system s reliability and sustainable development this study focuses on a design that maximizes the reliability of system over the planning horizon and a measure of the total cost of the system in a multi objective setting employing the urm method the general structure of a multi objective multi period nonlinear cyclic storage system design which intends to minimize the present value of cost while maximizing the system s reliability for meeting the specified demand may be formulated as 4a minimizepvc m i n i m i z e xi c a p x i b xi 4b m a x i m i z e r e l t 1 t z t z t 1 if d e m a n d i s f u l l y s a t i s f i

the construction and operational cost t is the total simulation period and rel is the total reliability of the system over simulation period the total cost accounts for the capital investment cost and the operation cost over the entire horizon the model may be subject to the following constraints ostadrahimi 2015 a the first set of constraints defines the monthly mass balance in surface reservoir s and bonds on associated components capacities 5 f 1 t s t s q t s e t s r d t s r ar t s r riv t s c s c d s c ar s spill t 0 t where r d s r ar s and r riv s refer to release from surface reservoir to demand area artificial recharge sites and downstream river respectively spill from the reservoir is denoted by spill whereas s s q s c s c d s andc ar s define the reservoir storage inflow to the reservoir reservoir storage capacity and design capacities of elements conveying water from reservoir to demand area and artificial recharge site respectively here after the subscripts and or superscripts s g d ar w and riv refer to surface reservoir aquifer demand area artificial recharge site pumping wells and downstream river respectively b the second set of constraints defines the change in groundwater storage because of groundwater pumping natural and or artificial recharge as 6 f 2 t r ar t s div ar t riv q j t w q a q t riv q l t ar c ar riv deep t i seep t p δ s t g 0 j l t in which δ s g div ar riv c ar riv q a q riv deep t i and seep t p refer to change in groundwater storage diversion from the river to artificial recharge site design capacity of delivery subsystem

recharge units wells 8 f 3 t h k t g q j t ar q j t w s w t k s ar t l q aq t riv 0 j k l t in which h k t g s w t k s ar t l q aq t riv refer to the depth to groundwater level in discharge or recharge unit k drawdown in pumping unit k groundwater rise in recharging unit l during time period and flow from river to the aquifer through their interactions d the fourth set of constraints deals with the demand and possible deficit to the pre specified irrigation demand as 9 f 4 t r d t s r d t g div d t riv d t def t 0 t in which d t and def t refer to the pre specified demand and deficit during period t respectively e the fifth set of constraints addresses the physical interaction between the aquifer and river as a linear source or sink 10 f 5 t q aq t riv h t g h t riv z riv c riv 0

hydraulic conductivity length of river reach width and thickness in each river reach f spatial and temporal variation of river water level must be defined by a set of equations describing inflow to

riv refer to inflow to and outflow from lateral flow change in water level and change in storage at the rth reach of the river g a set of constraints has been defined which determines and bonds the reliability of the system in satisfying the specified demand over the planning horizon 12 f 4 t r d t s r d t g div d t riv d t α γ 0 t 13 rel t 1 n z t n 14 z t 1 if d e m a n d i s f u l l y s a t i s f i e d 0 otherwise t h the last set of constraints may present a set of generic rules to govern the operation of the components of the system the state variables which have pronounced impact on the system operation are used to define parameterized rule curves these rules may be embedded into the design and operation model to generalize the operation of the subsystems during the entire planning horizon the following linear regression structure for the rules is proposed 15 r y t x a y τ x s t s q t s b y τ x k 1 nw s w t 1 k nw c y τ x d t t τ 1 2 3 4 where a y τ x b y τ x and c y τ x are the rule coefficients for season τ decision variables in operation model and r y t x stands for release from subsystem x to y during period t and nw refers to the number of wells this study proposes five specific rules to define the releases or diversions from 1 surface reservoir to demand area and downstream river 2 diversion from river to demand site and artificial recharge sites and 3 withdraw from groundwater to be used at the demand area this study disregards the generic operational rules which is more pertinent to real time operation of the system the proposed reliability based design of css is highly nonlinear non convex non continuous non differentiable and probably multimodal with very small feasible zone use of available gradient based optimization solvers may present profound difficulties hence a more robust optimization technique may be required recent developments in hybrid algorithms presents promising approaches to solving complex optimization problems afshar et al 2010 2 2 4 solution methodology evolutionary and meta heuristic algorithms have extensively been used to solve complex engineering and water resources management problems labadie 2004 afshar et al 2016 besides genetic algorithm nicklow et al 2010 ant colony optimization algorithm afshar et al 2015 honey bees mating optimization bozorg haddad et al 2006 particle swarm optimization pso has successfully been used in various water resources management problem afshar et al 2018 ostadrahimi et al 2012 in this study the css simulation optimization model is solved using an efficient decomposition approach and a specially tailored pso algorithm the complex css design model is decomposed into two sub models for computational affordability the first sub model is an unconstrained multi objective model with multi objective pso mopso formulation which aims at optimizing the original objective functions of the problem addressed by present value of total cost pvtc and system reliability penalized with the value of total constraints violation in the original set of constraints eqs 5 14 this sub model benefits from multi swarm version of mopso tailored for this setting the second sub model aims at minimizing the infeasibilities as addressed by the constraints violations to handle the constraints trial values of selected complicating variables as optimized in the mopso sub model are imported into the original nonlinear set of constraints to form a virtual lp model the resulted virtual lp model may fail to satisfy the constraints hence it is formulated to minimize the total constraints violations afshar et al 2010 thus the proposed two stage hybrid multi swarm mopso lp algorithm is adapted to optimize the operation of the proposed conjunctive use model in a cyclic storage system representation for the rule based operation model the rule coefficients eq 15 may equally be considered as complicating variables which have to be determined by particles in the swarm at each iteration for the design problem operational rules have been relaxed and the capacity of the facilities are considered as complicating variables defining tcv as the vector of total constraints violations minimized in the virtual lp model the original management model may be reformulated as 16a minimize p v c w t c v 16b maximize r e l w t c v where w refers to the vector of penalty values assigned to constraints violations the virtual lp model minimizes a measure of total non feasibilities total constraints violations for any given set of trial values for complicating variable received from the mopso model 17 minimize t c v i 1 m inf i inf i 0 subject to 18 g i x inf i 0 inf i 0 where m total number of the constraints and inf i infeasibility in the ith constraint the two sub models i e mopso and virtual lp will keep running until the best particle solution in the swarm gets zero non feasibility and values of the associated decision variables result in a non dominated optimal solution for further information on the solution methodology one may refer to ostadrahimi 2015 3 model application and results 3 1 3 1 basic data to illustrate the application and performance of the proposed multi objective approach to a highly complex reliability based cyclic storage system design the kinevars dam and its downstream basin on abhar river in iran originally introduced by alimohammadi et al 2009 is used in brief the system is composed of a local aquifer and kinevars surface reservoir which intended to regulate the natural flow of the abhar river for municipal water supply and agricultural irrigation realizing the complexity and the time scale of the problem huge amount of reliable data is needed to successfully run the model these data are classified as hydrological hydrogeological hydraulic demand and economic data to appreciate the performance of the proposed modeling scheme a 40 season problem has been used to generate the optimum design parameters under varying reliabilities smaller scale problems have been solved for model validation and set up and a 120 period problem is also solved to illustrate the performance of the proposed solution algorithm average seasonal inflow to the reservoir has been estimated as 7 6 million cubic meters mcm with standard deviation of 7 7 mcm fig 2 the distribution of average seasonal inflow shows relatively high seasonal variation while 53 and 29 of the inflow occurs in spring and winter only 15 and 3 occurs in fall and summer respectively realizing the longer response time of the aquifer compared to the surface reservoir the seasonal model has been preferred to the monthly operation model the hydrogeological data may present hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer and the underlying geological formation of the riverbed as well as the pumping and recharge sites it also may include unit response coefficients for different excitations as derived from simulation and or existing operational data it should also include an estimation of the inflow and outflow from the boundaries if any as well as the possible deep percolation from the rainfall and irrigation to the groundwater body for modeling purpose the 8 by 10 km aquifer has been divided into cells of 1000 500 m in vertical and horizontal directions respectively the hydrodynamic properties are assumed constant within each cell spatial variation of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity k and storage coefficients may be found in ostadrahimi 2015 river reach is approximated as a 20 m wide and 10 m deep rectangle with manning s coefficient and longitudinal slope of 0 02 and 0 0001 respectively seasonal water demand for different sectors is presented in table 1 while the environmental flow receives the highest priority the urban water demand has been given higher priority compared to the agricultural water demand 3 2 model setup and validation to start the application it is assumed that the system is initially at rest with groundwater and stream stage at the same level in the absence of reliable field data it is assumed that 5 of seasonal precipitation and 10 of supplied water both for irrigation and domestic use percolate into the aquifer it is further assumed that 10 of the seasonal supplied water for irrigation returns to the second reach of the river during the same season the maximum variation of the groundwater level from its normal condition is restricted between 10 10 m it is also assumed that maximum pumping from or recharge to each well may not exceed 3 mcm per season for more details on the study area one may refer to alimohammadi et al 2009 to validate the performance of the proposed hybrid multi start mopso lp model in a single objective setting the results for a single objective small scale 8 periods version of the proposed model are compared with the results of a well established gradient based nonlinear solver lingo lindo systems inc 2004 with 80 particles and after 16 000 function evaluations the best solution of the proposed model from 10 independent runs was the same as the previously reported optimal solutions alimohammadi et al 2009 performance of the proposed mopso algorithm in a bi objective setting was verified through its application to well established continuous function zdt1 and discontinuous function zdt3 although not presented here almost perfect match between the results of the proposed model and real optimal pareto front was observed ostadrahimi 2015 the concept and definition of crowding distance and diversity is used to check the distribution of the solutions on the pareto front more specific data and results are available from the second author 3 3 results and discussion solution to the problem defined by eqs 1 14 is obtained by applying the proposed hybrid algorithm for the design model the capacities of different subsystems and their components are taken as complicating variables looking for the optimum values of releases from each subsystem and their components assumed values for the complicating variables design capacities are imported into the original nlp model to transfer it to a linear programming lp structure since these values are randomly generated they may not address a feasible solution failing to satisfy the constraints in order to solve the problem with lp algorithms each constraint is free to generate as much as non feasibility as it needs to find a general solution for the problem therefore at any iteration decision and state variables plus constraint violations are determined for each particle trial solution to find a feasible solution a big penalty is applied to constraints violation for each particle the proposed hybrid algorithm finds the non dominated solutions for all particles at each iteration by simultaneously minimizing equations 16 a and 16 b which are penalized by total non feasibilities this process is continued until the non feasibilities approaches zero and the nominated solutions are non dominated and satisfy the stopping criteria for the 120 period css 100 particles with 1800 iteration was used for obtaining satisfactory pareto front it took approximately 36 h of cpu time on a computer with 16 gb memory and intel corei7 3 4 ghz of cpu therefore in this study each iteration for a single trial solution takes 0 72 s of cpu time on the computer with the named specifications fig 3 presents the pareto front resulted from solution to the proposed multi objective problem for maximum seasonal deficit of 20 and 30 percent over the entire simulation period if failure occurs i e β 0 2 and 0 3 for reliability restricted between 1 and 0 5 the problem as defined is expected to have 61 non dominated solutions in a 120 period problem the computation is terminated when the stopping criteria i e diversity and scattering are met for partial verification of the results the specification of the solution with 100 percent reliability was compared with those derived from the solution of single objective model they happened to address the same design and operational results in all simulation runs it is assumed that the environmental and municipal demands must be fully satisfied and the deficit is assigned to agricultural demand if failure occurs in specific for β 0 2 the deficit in agricultural demand may not exceed 20 percent of the demand of that period in other words for β 0 2 agricultural water supply may not fall below 80 percent of the target demand at each season over the entire simulation period the general shape of the fronts shows that for reliability smaller than 0 97 the rate of increase in cost for any increase in reliability level is almost constant fig 3 however as the reliability level approaches to one the marginal cost of additional reliability significantly increases for both β 0 2 and 0 3 as observed for all range of reliabilities the total cost follows approximately the same trend for β 0 2 and 0 3 as expected the total cost 1028 2 thousand dollars remains unchanged for 100 percent reliability regardless of changing β from 0 2 to 0 3 for all other reliability levels the present value of total cost pvtc decreases as β increases from 0 2 to 0 3 as an example for reliability level of 0 7 the pvtc decreases by more than four percent from 845 8 to 809 5 dollars when β is increased from 0 2 to 0 3 for deep observations some of the solutions on the fronts are selected for detail analysis one may argue that the reliability level of one for agricultural demand may not be justified in regions with significantly high inter and intra year variation in inflows thus relatively lower reliability may be agreed upon when capital budget is of concern to observe this condition three solutions from the set of optimal non dominated solutions are selected for detail observation and analysis these solutions are identified as solutions a b and c referring to the reliability levels of 1 0 8 and 0 5 respectively the two end points of the pareto fronts fig 3 describe the situations where either the reliability is at its highest level rel 1 or the cost is at its minimum for the lowest allowed reliability level rel 0 5 the first solution on the right side of the pareto front solution a has minimized the total present value of cost without any deficit during the entire planning horizon i e rel 1 this solution with 1028 2 of pvtc demands more than 406 mcm of groundwater pumping where 240 mcm is replenished through artificial recharge on the other side of the pareto front fig 3 relaxing the reliability level to 0 5 pvtc may be reduced by 20 percent from 1028 2 to 821 9 solution c or 26 percent from 1028 2 to 761 2 for β 0 2 and β 0 3 respectively solution b or any solution close to this one may receive attention from the practitioners in which relatively small number of failures with tolerable vulnerability may occur in this case solution b relaxes the reliability level by 20 percent for β 0 3 for detail observations some of the results for solution b is presented in fig 4 a 4d variation in groundwater storage during the simulation period for 80 percent reliability and β 0 2 and 0 3 is presented in fig 4a as illustrated for all seasons the groundwater storage for a more flexible strategy i e β 0 3 is lower than that of more restricted strategy with β 0 2 in other words for more restricted strategy requires higher groundwater storage to fulfill the future demand under prescribed strategy the variation in groundwater storage clearly illustrates the capability of the proposed css modeling in storing and releasing groundwater in a cyclic pattern it is worth to mention that for a perfect water balance the end of period groundwater storage is forced to be equal to the initial storage temporal variation of water leaving the system s boundary is presented in fig 4b as illustrated for a more relaxed strategy with β 0 3 higher volume of water leaves the system s boundary toward the downstream although this water may be used to partially satisfy the demands in the downstream it may be categorized as lost water for those within the system s boundary it is interesting to note that for reliability of 80 percent the total water leaving the system boundary during the entire simulation period for β 0 3 and β 0 2 are determined as 200 and 185 mcm respectively the total volume of water leaving the system under 100 percent reliability approaches to 155 mcm in other words the results show that with the proposed cyclic storage approach the system may use the water leaving the system s boundary to support more than 30 percent increase in annual demand if economically justified variation of groundwater level in well number 3 for reliability level of 80 percent is presented in fig 4c as illustrated for a more relaxed strategy β 0 3 number of periods that water level in the well approaches to its upper bond far exceeds those of the more sever strategy with β 0 2 on the other side more sever strategy with β 0 2 causes the water level to drop to its allowed minimum value of 35 m more frequently fig 4d presents the temporal variation of deficit for reliability level of 80 percent results show that for reliability level of 80 percent the total deficit during the planning horizon for β 0 3 and β 0 2 ranges from 39 to 28 mcm which account for 6 4 and 4 6 percent of the total demand although a 20 percent deficit in each failure period is permitted the deficit in failure seasons ranges from zero to 30 and 20 percent for β 0 3 and β 0 2 respectively fig 4d it is also clearly shown that the number of unsatisfactory periods over the entire 120 periods is exactly equal to 24 periods addressing the restricted reliability level of 80 percent to be more specific for β 0 2 number of small deficits under 0 8 mcm per season has been observed with 0 34 and 2 12 mcm as the smallest and larger deficits respectively for β 0 3 however deficits are in higher orders compared to the more severe strategy with β 0 2 3 4 discussion of the results as stated earlier this study aims at developing a reliability based optimum design of css for managing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater system with physically interconnected and operationally integrated subsystems due to the uncertainties in different sources of water system failure may occur during the lifetime of the project although reliability of the system performance is of great concern the severity of those failures if any can be of greater concern in fact small failures vulnerability may often be accepted by the operators and the stakeholders if the system s resiliency is high enough this study addresses the tradeoff between system reliability and present value of total cost for different values of vulnerability measure this specification differentiates the present work with all previous conjunctive use and css modellings efforts it was shown that the design and operation of conjunctive use of surface and groundwater subsystems with css approach may significantly outperform the classical conjunctive use models with non cyclic operation strategy the proposed approach allows groundwater recharge with regulated surface water for reducing the future uncontrolled spill from the reservoir in other words the css model treats the surface and groundwater resources as parallel reservoirs and behaves as an intelligent system in reducing water leaving the system s boundary although spill minimization is not explicitly included in the objectives it reduces the uncontrolled spill from the reservoir through releasing some regulated water for artificial groundwater recharge hence providing some extra space for possible high inflow to the reservoir in upcoming seasons one may argue about the possible additional energy required to pump back water from the groundwater aquifer our analysis however shows that for any given reliability level the css requires smaller pumping energy over the planning horizon this is mainly because the css does not overuse the groundwater storage to satisfy demand during dry periods as often is the case in classic conjunctive use plan implementation of the proposed css approach can increase decrease system reliability vulnerability through rule based joint operation of surface and groundwater resources under uncertain circumstances such as climate change it makes the system operation more robust in facing extreme conditions the proposed css approach may effectively be used to regulate the inflows with very low frequencies for future use with significantly reduced cost in the present study implementation of the proposed cyclic storage approach can support approximately 30 percent increase in annual demand if required 4 conclusions this paper presented a special structure for managing conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as an integrated approach the proposed structure treats surface and subsurface impoundment subsystems as competing and potentially interconnected parallel storage facilities that may be planned scaled and operated as a cyclic storage system css although this paper tackled a single purpose single reservoir aquifer stream case the approach may be expanded for multipurpose multiple reservoirs and multi aquifer systems rule based artificial recharge of groundwater with regulated releases from surface reservoirs is the key element of a css which differentiates it from the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as a common practice it was shown that the proposed solution methodology may efficiently overcome the computational burden of the large scale bi objective and reliability based css it was shown that the proposed css can deliver additional water with higher reliability if 30 percent increase in demand is foreseen in the future it was shown that the cost of regulating the inflows with very low frequencies are significantly reduced if css is used this result shows that with the proposed cyclic storage approach the system may support approximately 30 percent increase in annual demand if required the decision makers may use the derived set of optimal non dominated solutions to tradeoff between the desired reliability level maximum seasonal deficits and the pvtc the specifications of all solutions displayed on the pareto fronts are available each solution on the front including the first and the last one is defined by their optimum values on the objective functions and the vector of decision variables the provided pareto fronts would help the water managers to decide between the desired level of reliability and the maximum seasonal deficit during failure periods the model may further be improved by using a semi distributed groundwater model to simulate groundwater flow and its interaction with the surface water body the stochasticity and uncertainties may partially be addressed by using a parameterized simulation

5354,due to the great difficulty of monitoring surface and underground runoff and sediment yield directly the surface and underground hydrological processes associated with soil leakage loss in karst trough valleys remain unknown the objective of this study was to analyse the role of the rock dip angle in the water and soil leakage loss processes to assess the characteristics of surface and underground runoff and soil erosion and to investigate their conversion relationships using rainfall experiments the results showed the following i at a steep rock dip angle 60 the underground runoff yield had a shorter stabilization time than the surface runoff yield and that the underground runoff coefficient of the dip slope exceeded 0 5 ii the surface sediment yield could be divided into the suspended load and the bed load and the underground sediment yield included only the suspended load on the anti dip slope the surface erosion modulus was 0 83 2 50 times the underground erosion modulus iii the surface and underground cumulative runoff was linearly correlated with the cumulative sediment yield the rock dip angle had a significant quadratic relationship with the surface and underground runoff and sediment yield these results improve the understanding of the surface underground runoff and soil erosion processes and have significance for preventing water and soil leakage loss on the slopes of karst trough valleys keywords karst trough valley runoff soil erosion process rock dip angle sediment transport mechanism 1 introduction soil erosion is not only a social issue but also a severe environmental problem worldwide bai et al 2010 chittenden et al 2014 karst rocky desertification occurs in fragile economic ecological regions and has impacted an area of approximately 22 107 km2 the area of karst rocky desertified land covers approximately 12 of the total global land area and is concentrated in the world s three major areas of carbonate rocks yan et al 2018 under the interaction of human activities and natural factors karst rocky desertified land is characterized by special underground hydrogeology and complex double layer geologic structures which result in complex and unique runoff and soil erosion processes fu et al 2016 the issue of karst rock desertification has threatened the lives of residents in impacted regions and restricted social development consequently karst rocky desertification has received widespread attention from scholars worldwide kobza et al 2004 feng et al 2016 karst rock desertification is one of the major ecological issues in the southwestern china which represents the largest continuous karst landscapes in the world the landscape impacted by karst rock desertification can be divided into karst trough valleys graben basins karst plateaus peak cluster depressions peak forest plains soluble high depressions karst canyons and high or low mountains in addition the karst trough valleys in southwest china especially in chongqing municipality play a leading role in the karst landscapes in such valleys the area of bare carbonate has reached 29 61 103 km2 accounting for 28 1 of the land area in karst landscapes in chongqing gan et al 2019 karst trough valleys are characterized by severe environmental and ecological problems such as serious drought and flood disasters water and soil leakage losses severe desertification and a large impoverished population auler and smart 2003 feng et al 2016 karst trough valleys have a compact box like shape with slopes that are parallel and perpendicular to the dip of the underlying strata and feature especially complex runoff and soil erosion processes fábio et al 2016 the runoff and soil erosion processes influenced by the dip of the strata in karst trough valleys are significantly different from those in other karst regions wang et al 2014 and should be studied further chen et al 2011 peng et al 2017 preventing runoff and sediment leakage at the surface and underground is of primary importance for maintaining the ecological security in karst trough valleys karst trough valleys form in regions of soluble carbonate bedrock exposed at the axis of an anticline such areas are subjected to long term rainfall dissolution and geology processes that form a u shaped fault plane dominated by longitudinal water movement korup and schlunegger 2007 you et al 2019 in other words the unique u fault plane of a karst trough valley which forms the special karst hydrogeomorphologic phenomenon retains the original geomorphic structure on ridge mountains located on both sides of the groove like valley with longitudinal extensions sweeting 1993 tang et al 2016 depending on the dip of the strata the karst trough valley slopes can be divided into a dip slopes and anti dip slopes chittenden et al 2014 the bedding surfaces of the strata in the dip slopes follow are oriented in the same direction as the slope while those in the anti dip slope are oriented in the opposite direction korup and schlunegger 2009 under the general influence of natural and artificial factors the surface earth of dip and anti dip slopes presents severe karst rocky desertification with discontinuous regolith large bare bedrock areas and a shallow soil layer consequently the rock dip is an important factor affecting the runoff and soil erosion process safran et al 2005 ouimet et al 2009 moreover long term karst rocky desertification forms a double layer surface and underground geological structure in karst trough valley slopes and the underground features caves subterranean drainage fissures sinking streams and closed depressions thus most of the runoff and sediment yield are lost into underground rivers along at the rock soil interface auler and smart 2003 wang et al 2014 overall the leakage of water and soil in karst trough valleys is a very complex and unique process as the surface and underground soil erosion processes are influenced not only by underground pore fissures but also by bare bedrock wang 2003 yang et al 2011 the dip of bare bedrock is known to be an important factor in karst rocky desertification especially on dip and anti dip slopes relevant studies have indicated that the rock dip angle is strongly linked to the stability of dip and anti dip slopes dai 2004 fan et al 2015 chen et al 2007 demonstrated that the lower the rock dip angle is the more stable a dip slope is you et al 2019 compared the soil moisture variations in a karst trough valley and found that the dip of the bedrock had a certain impact on the rainfall distribution and that the soil moisture levels of a anti dip slope were lower than those of a dip slope because of the difficulty of determining the impact of rock dip angle on the underground runoff and sediment yield the underground soil erosion process on dip and anti dip slopes remains poorly understood what are the distributions and rates of underground runoff and soil erosion due to the double layer nature of the surface and underground hydrologic system and the large exposedrock outcrops existing in karst trough valleys constraining the amount of soil erosion could be used to constrain the amount of underground runoff and sediment loss revealing the role of the rock dip angle on runoff and soil erosion at the surface and underground layer is the critical in solving the above problem currently some studies have begun to consider the ecosystem vulnerability jiang et al 2016 hydrologic processes fu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 geomorphological process chen et al 2011 and ecological reconstruction oliver and fritz 2009 feng et al 2016 of karst trough valleys moreover studies on karst trough valleys mainly focus on surface water and soil loss as one of the major landform types in karst regions karst trough valleys have attracted the attention of many scholars and researchers for example jiang et al 2016 has visited chongqing several times to study and observe karst trough valleys and analyse the development of comprehensive rehabilitation measures to address karst rocky desertification on karst trough valley slopes however due to the lack of good technical methods for monitoring underground water and soil leakage directly few researchers have considered the underground soil erosion process and have ignored the role of rock dip on the processes of surface and underground runoff and sediment yield under the rainfall dissolution process the development of rock fractures and vertical joints can form caves sinkholes and underground fissures which provide underground migration channels for sediment leakage loss auler and smart 2003 wang et al 2010 concluded that sediment generation decreased with increasing bare bedrock area on different slopes and the same slopes in the southwest karst area most studies have reported that bare bedrock has an important effect on the process of surface and underground sediment yield in karst regions wang et al 2010 chen and lian 2016 but they did not account for the impact of rock dip angle on soil leakage loss oliver and fritz 2009 posited that high soil erosion rates are driven by the widespread exposures of bedrock and induce isostatic adjustment of the crust thereby resulting in further rock desertification and soil leakage loss fábio et al 2015 explored the effects of the structural architecture on the soil erosion rate and erosin process by using a 10be based sediment budget and suggested that the dip of the bedrock was a major factor causing soil leakage loss meanwhile others have conducted some studies proposing that because the topographic slope is parallel to the schistosity and bedding of the underlying bedrock the water and soil loss on the dip slope mainly occurs through landsliding in karst trough valleys however anti dip slopes are located on the opposite site of the trough valley and soil leakage occurs through soil rock channels on these hillslopes akcar et al 2012 fu et al 2016 peng et al 2018 in short the runoff and soil erosion processes on karst trough valley slopes especially those in the surface and underground layers on dip and anti dip slopes remain unclear but they are important to rocky desertification and water deficiency on these geologic structures the complex and unique runoff and soil erosion processes in fragile karst trough valleys which are important environmental regions restrict their ecological reconstruction and restoration thus taking the dip and anti dip slopes as experimental subjects this paper makes initial efforts to reveal the mechanisms of the runoff and soil erosion processes under the conditions of rainfall simulation experiments incorporating the rock dip and double layer geological structure hence the primary objective of this study is to reveal the output characteristics of surface and underground runoff and soil erosion processes on dip and anti dip slopes the results from this study have practical important theoretical significance for controlling runoff and sediment leakage loss and helping ecological reconstruction in karst trough valleys 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 2 1 1 study area and test soil the experimental soil was collected on a typical karst trough valley slope of youyang district chongqing municipality china 28 49 38 n 108 28 46 e this region has a warm humid monsoon climate characterized by seasonal changes and significant winds the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1200 mm and the annual average temperature is approximately 14 6 c the longtan karst trough valley is located on the southeastern flank of the tongmaling anticline in youyang county and is oriented northeast southeast both sides of the trough valley have similar rock compositions but opposite slope aspects forming dip and anti dip slopes from northeast to southwest the dip slope has the same orientation as the bedrock in the syncline of inclined axial plane on the west side while the anti dip slope has the opposite orientation as the bedrock on the east side the dominant rock dip angles range from 9 to 65 in the dip and anti dip slopes fig 1 the soil thickness on the dip and anti dip slopes is between 15 and 40 cm for the experiment soil was collected from 0 to 30 cm depth on sloping farmland the experimental soil developed from shale granite and limestone and the soil particle distributions were as follows 9 73 sand 0 02 2 00 mm 41 72 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 48 55 clay 0 002 mm 2 1 2 rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was a portable automatic rainfall maker model norton which was similar to that described by gan et al 2018 and 2019 the rainfall simulator devices were 3 m in height and had a 6 0 m long 6 0 m wide effective rainfall area corresponding to the characteristics of natural rainfall the rainfall terminal velocity was 0 5 m s and the raindrop diameter was between 0 36 and 6 mm the rainfall intensity was adjusted manually from 10 to 150 mm h 1 and the rainfall distribution uniformity was greater than or equal to 90 the rainfall adjustment time was less than or equal to 40 s and the rainfall measurement error was 2 the kinematic energy of raindrops was greater than 90 of natural raindrops between 1 25 and 8 14 j m 2 h 1 according to the practical measurement of 20 typical karst trough valley slopes with a gps device and gradiometer in chongqing municipality table 1 the double layer geologic structure and the rock dip of karst trough valley slopes were simulated in the laboratory gan et al 2019 first limestone bedrock with a height of 36 53 cm was positioned in a new homemade steel experimental tank 5 0 m long 1 0 m wide 0 3 m deep based on the field limestone bedrock sizes from the dip and anti dip slopes in karst trough valleys second based on the field investigation of the soil density and rock dip angle the rock spaces were backfilled and layered homogenously with experimental soil to simulate the rock dip angle the surface soil in the experimental tank was levelled with a special plate and the total test soil depth was set to 0 3 m finally a steel tank wall was used for the zones of contact between the rocks and the compacted soil fig 2 2 2 experimental designs according to the literature analysis and field surveys several influential factors such as rainfall intensity underground pore fissures slope soil layer rock dip rock dip angle and bare bedrock ratio were selected as the simulation factors in this experiment table 2 a because the 90 mm h rainfall intensity is the extreme erosive rainfall intensity that triggers surface soil erosion in karst trough valleys dai et al 2017a the rainfall intensity studied was set as 90 mm h b underground pore fissures refer to the ratio of underground pore fissures to the total floor horizontal projection area two movable plates were installed to adjust the underground pore fissures at the bottom of the experimental steel tank the first plate layer was installed for water infiltrating through spaced drainage spaced holes 5 cm and the second plate layer was used to collect the underground runoff and sediment yield as a baseplate the dimensions of the underground pore fissures can be adjusted by moving the movable steel plate to change the overlap of the drainage holes between the first steel plate and the baseplate the dimensions of the underground pore fissures could be altered within a range from 0 to 6 the wide range of underground pore fissure represents the typical wide range of underground pore fissures in the karst trough valley which is influenced by rock weathering therefore the underground pore fissures were set to 1 c changes in the soil erosion process occur on karst trough valley slopes with a critical slope of 25 peng et al 2017 thus the experimental slope angle was set to 25 d based on the field measured soil thickness in cultivated land in the karst trough valley the soil depth was set to 30 cm and the soil layers could be classified as a plough layer 10 cm and tillage layer 20 cm from the upper to lower parts in addition differing degrees of soil compaction were applied to three sublayers i e the upper sublayer 453 kpa middle sublayer 801 kpa and lower sublayer 1172 kpa e the slopes in the karst trough valley were divided into dip slopes and anti dip slopes which were simulated with the bedrock in the test tank according to the field observations of typical karst valleys the dominant rock dip angles were between 9 and 65 on the dip and anti dip slopes therefore three different types of rock dip angles were simulated by changing the angle of the bedrock underlying the slope fig 3 flat rock dip angle 10 gentle rock dip angle 20 and 30 and steep rock dip angle 40 and 60 f the bare bedrock ratio ranged from approximately 7 20 based on the field survey of the actual bare bedrock area in cultivated land on karst trough valley slopes dai et al 2017b therefore the studied bare bedrock ratio was set to 15 representing the potential rocky desertification in a karst trough valley of chongqing province and it was simulated by arranging 11 pieces of limestone with diameters of 36 53 cm in the test tank for each rainfall experiment the rainfall duration was designed to last for 60 min based on testing with a stopwatch each rainfall experiment was repeated three times for a total of 30 experiments the post test soil was replaced with fresh new soil for the next rainfall experiment after each experiment 2 3 rainfall tests rainfall experiments were conducted in the artificial simulation rainfall hall of southwest university beibei district china before each artificial rainfall test light rain 10 mm h was used to accelerate the test soil to saturation moisture the rainfall experimental test timing began when surface and underground runoff was produced the surface and underground runoff and sediment yields were collected at the upper and lower ends of the experimental tank respectively the surface and underground runoff and sediment samples were collected at 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then at 10 min intervals during the 30 60 min period in each rainfall experiment the surface and underground sediment samples were dried in an oven 105 c for 24 h and weighed the sediment size ranges of the bed load and suspended load were measured the sediment size distribution was measured by wet sieving with 3 replicates asadi et al 2007 2 4 measurements and data analyses 1 unit width discharge q the unit width discharge q is applied to intuitively observe the surface runoff produced per unit width per unit time q is estimated by eq 1 1 q q s b where q is the unit width discharge l

load transported through a flow section within one minute asadi et al 2007 suggested that sediment transport mechanisms could be classified as suspended load and bed load each associated with a bimodal distribution of sediment particle sizes fig 4 the boundary for suspension and bed load transport mechanisms is related to flow hydraulics and the soil type in this study the boundaries for bed load transport were between 0 064 and 0 162 mm st is estimated by eq 2 2 s t r t s where st is the sediment transport rate of the suspended load and bed load g min 1 rt is the runoff intensity l min 1 s is the average sediment concentration g l 1 the experimental data in the tables and figures represent the mean values of each site the differences among each experimental treatment were calculated with a standardized beta regression coefficient and analysis of variance anova all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics 18 0 software 3 results 3 1 runoff loss characteristics under different rock dip angle conditions the rock dip angle is one of the most important factors influencing water loss and leakage zhou et al 2012 to reveal the runoff yield mechanisms under different rock dip angles on karst trough valley slopes the surface and underground runoff yield processes are shown in fig 5 the variation characteristics are presented in tables 3 and 4 the surface runoff rate increased during the first 30 min of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize and the underground runoff rate increased during the first 20 min of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize this indicated that the underground runoff yield had a shorter stabilization time than the surface runoff yield for the dip slope the critical rock dip angle for changing the curvature trend of surface unit width discharge surface runoff depth and surface cumulative runoff volume was 40 and that for the underground unit width discharge runoff depth and cumulative runoff was 20 moreover the underground runoff coefficient exceeded 0 5 at a steep rock dip angle of 60 which indicated that surface runoff loss was mostly occurred at flat and gentle rock dip angles on the dip slope on the anti dip slope there is a critical rock dip angle for the runoff distribution rate on anti dip slope that fluctuates between 30 and 40 overall the rock dip condition influences the surface and underground runoff distribution the surface runoff rate changes followed the order dip slope anti dip slope in terms of rock dip while the underground runoff rate changes exhibited the opposite trend a higher rock dip angle is advantageous for underground runoff production with the increase in the rock dip angle the underground runoff leakage depth increased under the same experimental conditions however the increase in the rock dip angle is disadvantageous to the surface runoff loss the higher the rock dip angle the lower the surface runoff loss on the dip and anti dip slopes 3 2 sediment loss characteristics under different rock dip angle conditions tables 5 and 6 and fig 6 show the characteristics of sediment yield on karst trough valley slopes for six rock dip angles with rainfall intensity and underground pore fissures the total surface and underground sediment yields were significantly different under the experimental designs of the rock dip angle on the karst trough valley slopes the surface sediment yield was grouped into two categories i e suspended load and bed load whereas the underground sediment yield only included suspended load under the dip slope conditions the soil erosion modulus and bed load transport rate reached the maximum value at the rock dip angle of 20 for the surface and 60 for the underground layer additionally the maximum surface suspended load transport rate appeared at 30 and was higher than the surface bed load transport in most experimental conditions the sediment eroded by surface runoff on the dip slope was most affected by the gentle rock dip angle in addition the anti dip slope was dominated by underground sediment yield under flat and steep rock dip angle conditions the rock dip angle affects the surface and underground sediment production to a certain extent the surface cumulative sediment yield and sediment coefficient of the anti dip slope were significantly less than those of the dip slope however the sediment yield characteristics of underground leakage exhibited the opposite trend in addition the greater the rock dip angle is the more conducive the conditions are for underground soil erosion 3 3 consistency between runoff and sediment yield surface runoff is one of the important factors that can increase surface and underground sediment leakage loss in other words the interaction between the surface runoff erosion capacity and the erosion resistance controls the soil leakage loss process in karst trough valleys the formation of runoff during the whole rainfall process can be regarded as the process by which rain drops affect material on karst trough valley slopes according to the special geological structure of the dip and anti dip slopes and double layers nature of karst trough valley slopes fig 7 shows that the rock dip angle plays a key role in the relationship between the surface underground runoff and the sediment yield on dip and anti dip slopes on the dip slope surface runoff loss was always accompanied by surface and underground suspended loads and the change in surface runoff intensity was largely consistent with the change in surface suspended load under the different rock dip angles the slope of the sediment runoff curve followed the order of surface runoff intensity surface suspended load surface bed load however under anti dip slope conditions the maximum surface runoff intensity surface suspended load and surface bed load were found at 30 in total the surface and underground cumulative runoff was remarkably linearly correlated with the cumulative sediment yield compared with the surface and underground fitting determination coefficients r2 under the experimental design of rock dip angles the values of the anti dip slope were significantly greater than those of the dip slope this shows that the surface and underground runoff of the anti dip slope contained more information about sediment yield 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of rock dip angle of runoff leakage loss compared with the other karst landforms the karst trough valleys have the largest karst distribution area in the karst area characterized as old young mountainous and poor in south china in addition to high bare bedrock ratios and double layer hydrogeological structures a karst trough valley features a compact box like anticline syncline structure high rock dip angles carbonate rocks interbedded with non carbonate rocks and other features as we know many studies have mainly focused on the effect of the bare bedrock area underground pore fissures and rainfall intensity on the underground runoff leakage in karst regions jiang et al 2014 revealed the quantitative differences in the water and soil loss at different geomorphologic positions in karst peak cluster depressions and found that the surface soil erosion exhibited the following order in terms of position steep slope gentle slope peak slope valley foot slope depression dai et al 2018 found that the area of bare bedrock had a significant effect on underground soil erosion and that the underground soil erosion rate reached a maximum at 30 bare bedrock however few studies have focused on the rock dip angle which is relevant for karst trough valleys due to the rainfall induced dissolution and erosion of the anticlinal axes composed of carbonate bedrock in karst trough valleys karst slopes have a special geological structure with a u shaped fault plane you et al 2019 this u shaped fault plane can be divided into dip and anti dip slopes leading to a spatial distribution of runoff that differs from those in other topographic types of karst regions norton et al 2010 meanwhile runoff leakage loss on the dip and anti dip slopes are also affected by the hillslope channel vegetation coverage underground rivers and other parameters wei et al 2016 thus the surface and underground runoff yields have differ greatly between the dip slope and anti dip slope field measurement results of the karst trough valley area have indicated that the underground runoff leakage is the major form of water loss on anti dip slopes and is more serious than surface runoff loss on dip slopes yang et al 2011 she et al 2014 schwab et al 2009 also proposed that the surface runoff rate on the dip slopes was significantly greater than that on anti dip slopes these results were similar to the results in our study this difference may occur because the stratified rock in dip slope has the same orientation as the direction of flow and the water flows downstream to the base of dip slopes resulting in the confluence of surface runoff therefore the spatial distribution of water flow on the dip slope is dominated by surface flow in addition on the dip slope each raised rock trapped rainwater leakage loss along with rock joint fissure leading to the surface runoff coefficient decreasing with increasing rock dip angle however under the anti dip slope conditions the inclination direction of the rock dip angle is contrary to the rain runoff direction preventing the rainfall water from moving forward such that most of the surface runoff leakage loss occurs through the soil as a result the underground runoff distribution ratio was always greater than the surface runoff distribution ratio on the anti dip slope additionally an increase in rock dip angle was beneficial for forming runoff induced surface erosion whereas when the rock dip angle increased to a certain degree the runoff loss was mainly due to underground leakage in other words lower rock dip angles on the anti dip slope reduce the surface rainfall runoff resistance resulting in increased surface runoff moreover the runoff resistance increases with increasing rock dip angle leading to a decreased in surface runoff thus surface runoff decreases under the steeper rock dip angle conditions however there is an increasing trend in underground runoff to calculate the surface and underground runoff on karst trough valley slopes a quadratic function can be established to express the role of the rock dip angle on the surface and underground runoff and sediment yield as indicated in fig 8 and table 7 when the rock dip angle is controlled that is the rock dip angle is 0 the average surface runoff rates are 1 1201 and 0 412 l min 1 m 2 for the dip and anti dip slopes respectively this means that the average surface runoff rates of 1 1201 and 0 412 l min 1 m 2 are a result of the interaction between underground pore fissures and rainfall intensity additionally the average underground runoff rates are 0 4472 and 0 9791 l min 1 m 2 for a rock dip angle of 0 in addition the lowest correlation coefficient r 2 was 0 80 with an average value of 0 90 for dip and anti dip slopes indicating that the relationship between the surface underground runoff rate and rock dip angle approximately obeys a quadratic function and the rock dip angle exerts a great impact on the surface underground runoff rate in general the rock dip angle represented the dip of the bedrock on the dip and anti dip slope resulting in different distributions ratios of surface underground runoff in karst trough valleys most studies have demonstrated that the rainfall runoff loss is from exposed rock along at the rock soil interface and the underground runoff leakage in anti dip slopes is significantly greater than that in dip slopes bekaddour et al 2013 chittenden et al 2014 therefore the total rainfall runoff leakage loss was influenced by underground pore fissures and the rock dip angle forming a special type of runoff loss type on karst trough valley slopes hence controlling the rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes is a major factor for reducing runoff leakage loss 4 2 analysis of rock dip angle of soil leakage loss the rock dip angle exerted an important impact on the spatial distribution ratio of the sediment yield niemi et al 2005 gan et al 2019 and the reasons for this phenomenon are listed as follows 1 the dip of the outcropping bedrocks can disperse or gather a large amount of rainwater 2 bare bedrock with fissures joints pores etc can intercept and absorb some rainwater and 3 the dip of outcropping bedrock can change the water flow direction which influences the surface and underground soil erosion rate oliver and fritz 2009 fábio et al 2015 for a dip slope the rock dip can affect the direction of surface runoff and accelerate the soil dispersion and suspension ability caused by surface rainfall runoff indicating that the surface sediment loss is dominant however unlike a dip slope on a anti dip slope the rock dip hinders the surface runoff and velocity and increases the infiltration capacity of rainwater thus the underground soil leakage is greater than that of the surface loss in our study the dip slope was dominated by the surface suspended load the increasing rock dip angle decreased the surface suspended load and bed load and increased the underground suspended load however the underground suspended load is an important part of sediment leakage loss on anti dip slopes the surface suspended load first decreased and then increased with the increasing rock dip angle while the underground suspended load showed a contrary trend the soil leakage loss into the earth along with the underground runoff was always very small thus there was no underground bed load generation this was because the bare bedrock embedded in the surface on the one hand decreased the surface soil erodible area and increased the surface rainfall runoff which was beneficial to the deposited sediment and surface soil erosion decreased fayou et al 2014 on the other hand the bedrock formed an impermeable scaly interface which increased the surface flow velocity and sediment loss in other words the rock dip angle not only impacts the flow direction but also changes the soil transport mechanisms gan et al 2019 demonstrated that the increased rock dip angle of the dip slope leads to a reduced soil detachment rate and a steeper rock dip angle can result in greater surface soil detachment rates in this study fig 9 and table 8 show the relationship between the rock dip angle and average surface underground sediment yield the rock dip angle of the dip slope was significantly correlated with the average surface sediment yield and the maximum average underground sediment yield 0 2823 g min 1 m 2 was found at a rock dip angle of 155 56 in the experiment however under the anti dip slope conditions the maximum average surface sediment yield was 0 4404 g min 1 m 2 when the rock dip angle was 36 and the average underground sediment yield was 0 4019 g min 1 m 2 when the rock dip angle was the control this indicated a critical rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes that influences the spatial distribution of sediment yield controlling the rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes can be an efficient way to control surface loss and underground leakage indeed relevant studies have proven that the soil erosion in karst landscapes is significantly affected by the rainfall intensity bare bedrock ratio underground pore fissures and geometry and connectivity of the bedrock fissures and these factors directly determine the soil leakage loss pattern of dip and anti dip slopes chittenden et al 2014 you et al 2019 as we know there is no effective means to determine the underground runoff and sediment leakage thus the spatial distributions of runoff and sediment yield on dip and anti dip slopes remain poorly constrained hence the experimental setup in this field simulation study differed from the actual field geological conditions of the karst trough valley for example underground pore fissures are usually filled with soil in the field and often have complex structures whereas the simulated underground pore fissures in this study had drainage holes with complete voids in addition the bedrock fragments in the experiment were smaller than those in the field for further study and discussion the field runoff and sediment yield should also be researched to establish a soil erosion model for karst trough valley slopes 5 conclusions based on the double layer structure of surface and underground geologic characteristics the generation mechanisms of runoff and sediment transport on karst trough valley slopes were investigated with plot scale rainfall simulation tests the results show that the rock dip angle exhibited significant effects on surface and underground soil erosion on karst trough valley slopes in the experiments in response to changes in the rock dip angles the surface runoff and sediment yield coefficients were higher on the dip slope than on the anti dip slope however the underground runoff and sediment yield coefficient exhibited the opposite trend under the dip slope conditions surface rainfall runoff loss mostly occurred at the flat and gentle rock dip angle the surface bed load was larger than the surface suspended load at 20 the underground suspended load appeared at 60 and the minimum underground suspended load was generated at 30 under the anti dip slope conditions the surface runoff loss rate was significantly greater than the underground in runoff leakage cases under the gentle and steep rock dip angles 30 and 40 and the maximum surface runoff intensity surface suspended load and surface bed load were found at 30 rock dip angle overall the rock dip angle had a significant quadratic function relationship with the surface and underground runoff and sediment which is conducive to establishing a prediction model of soil erosion on karst trough valley slopes together the findings in this paper are helpful not only for providing reliable data on surface and underground soil erosion on dip and anti dip slopes but also for establishing a prediction model of runoff and soil leakage under conditions of rock dip angles in karst trough valleys credit authorship contribution

5354,due to the great difficulty of monitoring surface and underground runoff and sediment yield directly the surface and underground hydrological processes associated with soil leakage loss in karst trough valleys remain unknown the objective of this study was to analyse the role of the rock dip angle in the water and soil leakage loss processes to assess the characteristics of surface and underground runoff and soil erosion and to investigate their conversion relationships using rainfall experiments the results showed the following i at a steep rock dip angle 60 the underground runoff yield had a shorter stabilization time than the surface runoff yield and that the underground runoff coefficient of the dip slope exceeded 0 5 ii the surface sediment yield could be divided into the suspended load and the bed load and the underground sediment yield included only the suspended load on the anti dip slope the surface erosion modulus was 0 83 2 50 times the underground erosion modulus iii the surface and underground cumulative runoff was linearly correlated with the cumulative sediment yield the rock dip angle had a significant quadratic relationship with the surface and underground runoff and sediment yield these results improve the understanding of the surface underground runoff and soil erosion processes and have significance for preventing water and soil leakage loss on the slopes of karst trough valleys keywords karst trough valley runoff soil erosion process rock dip angle sediment transport mechanism 1 introduction soil erosion is not only a social issue but also a severe environmental problem worldwide bai et al 2010 chittenden et al 2014 karst rocky desertification occurs in fragile economic ecological regions and has impacted an area of approximately 22 107 km2 the area of karst rocky desertified land covers approximately 12 of the total global land area and is concentrated in the world s three major areas of carbonate rocks yan et al 2018 under the interaction of human activities and natural factors karst rocky desertified land is characterized by special underground hydrogeology and complex double layer geologic structures which result in complex and unique runoff and soil erosion processes fu et al 2016 the issue of karst rock desertification has threatened the lives of residents in impacted regions and restricted social development consequently karst rocky desertification has received widespread attention from scholars worldwide kobza et al 2004 feng et al 2016 karst rock desertification is one of the major ecological issues in the southwestern china which represents the largest continuous karst landscapes in the world the landscape impacted by karst rock desertification can be divided into karst trough valleys graben basins karst plateaus peak cluster depressions peak forest plains soluble high depressions karst canyons and high or low mountains in addition the karst trough valleys in southwest china especially in chongqing municipality play a leading role in the karst landscapes in such valleys the area of bare carbonate has reached 29 61 103 km2 accounting for 28 1 of the land area in karst landscapes in chongqing gan et al 2019 karst trough valleys are characterized by severe environmental and ecological problems such as serious drought and flood disasters water and soil leakage losses severe desertification and a large impoverished population auler and smart 2003 feng et al 2016 karst trough valleys have a compact box like shape with slopes that are parallel and perpendicular to the dip of the underlying strata and feature especially complex runoff and soil erosion processes fábio et al 2016 the runoff and soil erosion processes influenced by the dip of the strata in karst trough valleys are significantly different from those in other karst regions wang et al 2014 and should be studied further chen et al 2011 peng et al 2017 preventing runoff and sediment leakage at the surface and underground is of primary importance for maintaining the ecological security in karst trough valleys karst trough valleys form in regions of soluble carbonate bedrock exposed at the axis of an anticline such areas are subjected to long term rainfall dissolution and geology processes that form a u shaped fault plane dominated by longitudinal water movement korup and schlunegger 2007 you et al 2019 in other words the unique u fault plane of a karst trough valley which forms the special karst hydrogeomorphologic phenomenon retains the original geomorphic structure on ridge mountains located on both sides of the groove like valley with longitudinal extensions sweeting 1993 tang et al 2016 depending on the dip of the strata the karst trough valley slopes can be divided into a dip slopes and anti dip slopes chittenden et al 2014 the bedding surfaces of the strata in the dip slopes follow are oriented in the same direction as the slope while those in the anti dip slope are oriented in the opposite direction korup and schlunegger 2009 under the general influence of natural and artificial factors the surface earth of dip and anti dip slopes presents severe karst rocky desertification with discontinuous regolith large bare bedrock areas and a shallow soil layer consequently the rock dip is an important factor affecting the runoff and soil erosion process safran et al 2005 ouimet et al 2009 moreover long term karst rocky desertification forms a double layer surface and underground geological structure in karst trough valley slopes and the underground features caves subterranean drainage fissures sinking streams and closed depressions thus most of the runoff and sediment yield are lost into underground rivers along at the rock soil interface auler and smart 2003 wang et al 2014 overall the leakage of water and soil in karst trough valleys is a very complex and unique process as the surface and underground soil erosion processes are influenced not only by underground pore fissures but also by bare bedrock wang 2003 yang et al 2011 the dip of bare bedrock is known to be an important factor in karst rocky desertification especially on dip and anti dip slopes relevant studies have indicated that the rock dip angle is strongly linked to the stability of dip and anti dip slopes dai 2004 fan et al 2015 chen et al 2007 demonstrated that the lower the rock dip angle is the more stable a dip slope is you et al 2019 compared the soil moisture variations in a karst trough valley and found that the dip of the bedrock had a certain impact on the rainfall distribution and that the soil moisture levels of a anti dip slope were lower than those of a dip slope because of the difficulty of determining the impact of rock dip angle on the underground runoff and sediment yield the underground soil erosion process on dip and anti dip slopes remains poorly understood what are the distributions and rates of underground runoff and soil erosion due to the double layer nature of the surface and underground hydrologic system and the large exposedrock outcrops existing in karst trough valleys constraining the amount of soil erosion could be used to constrain the amount of underground runoff and sediment loss revealing the role of the rock dip angle on runoff and soil erosion at the surface and underground layer is the critical in solving the above problem currently some studies have begun to consider the ecosystem vulnerability jiang et al 2016 hydrologic processes fu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 geomorphological process chen et al 2011 and ecological reconstruction oliver and fritz 2009 feng et al 2016 of karst trough valleys moreover studies on karst trough valleys mainly focus on surface water and soil loss as one of the major landform types in karst regions karst trough valleys have attracted the attention of many scholars and researchers for example jiang et al 2016 has visited chongqing several times to study and observe karst trough valleys and analyse the development of comprehensive rehabilitation measures to address karst rocky desertification on karst trough valley slopes however due to the lack of good technical methods for monitoring underground water and soil leakage directly few researchers have considered the underground soil erosion process and have ignored the role of rock dip on the processes of surface and underground runoff and sediment yield under the rainfall dissolution process the development of rock fractures and vertical joints can form caves sinkholes and underground fissures which provide underground migration channels for sediment leakage loss auler and smart 2003 wang et al 2010 concluded that sediment generation decreased with increasing bare bedrock area on different slopes and the same slopes in the southwest karst area most studies have reported that bare bedrock has an important effect on the process of surface and underground sediment yield in karst regions wang et al 2010 chen and lian 2016 but they did not account for the impact of rock dip angle on soil leakage loss oliver and fritz 2009 posited that high soil erosion rates are driven by the widespread exposures of bedrock and induce isostatic adjustment of the crust thereby resulting in further rock desertification and soil leakage loss fábio et al 2015 explored the effects of the structural architecture on the soil erosion rate and erosin process by using a 10be based sediment budget and suggested that the dip of the bedrock was a major factor causing soil leakage loss meanwhile others have conducted some studies proposing that because the topographic slope is parallel to the schistosity and bedding of the underlying bedrock the water and soil loss on the dip slope mainly occurs through landsliding in karst trough valleys however anti dip slopes are located on the opposite site of the trough valley and soil leakage occurs through soil rock channels on these hillslopes akcar et al 2012 fu et al 2016 peng et al 2018 in short the runoff and soil erosion processes on karst trough valley slopes especially those in the surface and underground layers on dip and anti dip slopes remain unclear but they are important to rocky desertification and water deficiency on these geologic structures the complex and unique runoff and soil erosion processes in fragile karst trough valleys which are important environmental regions restrict their ecological reconstruction and restoration thus taking the dip and anti dip slopes as experimental subjects this paper makes initial efforts to reveal the mechanisms of the runoff and soil erosion processes under the conditions of rainfall simulation experiments incorporating the rock dip and double layer geological structure hence the primary objective of this study is to reveal the output characteristics of surface and underground runoff and soil erosion processes on dip and anti dip slopes the results from this study have practical important theoretical significance for controlling runoff and sediment leakage loss and helping ecological reconstruction in karst trough valleys 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials 2 1 1 study area and test soil the experimental soil was collected on a typical karst trough valley slope of youyang district chongqing municipality china 28 49 38 n 108 28 46 e this region has a warm humid monsoon climate characterized by seasonal changes and significant winds the mean annual precipitation is approximately 1200 mm and the annual average temperature is approximately 14 6 c the longtan karst trough valley is located on the southeastern flank of the tongmaling anticline in youyang county and is oriented northeast southeast both sides of the trough valley have similar rock compositions but opposite slope aspects forming dip and anti dip slopes from northeast to southwest the dip slope has the same orientation as the bedrock in the syncline of inclined axial plane on the west side while the anti dip slope has the opposite orientation as the bedrock on the east side the dominant rock dip angles range from 9 to 65 in the dip and anti dip slopes fig 1 the soil thickness on the dip and anti dip slopes is between 15 and 40 cm for the experiment soil was collected from 0 to 30 cm depth on sloping farmland the experimental soil developed from shale granite and limestone and the soil particle distributions were as follows 9 73 sand 0 02 2 00 mm 41 72 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 48 55 clay 0 002 mm 2 1 2 rainfall simulation the rainfall simulator was a portable automatic rainfall maker model norton which was similar to that described by gan et al 2018 and 2019 the rainfall simulator devices were 3 m in height and had a 6 0 m long 6 0 m wide effective rainfall area corresponding to the characteristics of natural rainfall the rainfall terminal velocity was 0 5 m s and the raindrop diameter was between 0 36 and 6 mm the rainfall intensity was adjusted manually from 10 to 150 mm h 1 and the rainfall distribution uniformity was greater than or equal to 90 the rainfall adjustment time was less than or equal to 40 s and the rainfall measurement error was 2 the kinematic energy of raindrops was greater than 90 of natural raindrops between 1 25 and 8 14 j m 2 h 1 according to the practical measurement of 20 typical karst trough valley slopes with a gps device and gradiometer in chongqing municipality table 1 the double layer geologic structure and the rock dip of karst trough valley slopes were simulated in the laboratory gan et al 2019 first limestone bedrock with a height of 36 53 cm was positioned in a new homemade steel experimental tank 5 0 m long 1 0 m wide 0 3 m deep based on the field limestone bedrock sizes from the dip and anti dip slopes in karst trough valleys second based on the field investigation of the soil density and rock dip angle the rock spaces were backfilled and layered homogenously with experimental soil to simulate the rock dip angle the surface soil in the experimental tank was levelled with a special plate and the total test soil depth was set to 0 3 m finally a steel tank wall was used for the zones of contact between the rocks and the compacted soil fig 2 2 2 experimental designs according to the literature analysis and field surveys several influential factors such as rainfall intensity underground pore fissures slope soil layer rock dip rock dip angle and bare bedrock ratio were selected as the simulation factors in this experiment table 2 a because the 90 mm h rainfall intensity is the extreme erosive rainfall intensity that triggers surface soil erosion in karst trough valleys dai et al 2017a the rainfall intensity studied was set as 90 mm h b underground pore fissures refer to the ratio of underground pore fissures to the total floor horizontal projection area two movable plates were installed to adjust the underground pore fissures at the bottom of the experimental steel tank the first plate layer was installed for water infiltrating through spaced drainage spaced holes 5 cm and the second plate layer was used to collect the underground runoff and sediment yield as a baseplate the dimensions of the underground pore fissures can be adjusted by moving the movable steel plate to change the overlap of the drainage holes between the first steel plate and the baseplate the dimensions of the underground pore fissures could be altered within a range from 0 to 6 the wide range of underground pore fissure represents the typical wide range of underground pore fissures in the karst trough valley which is influenced by rock weathering therefore the underground pore fissures were set to 1 c changes in the soil erosion process occur on karst trough valley slopes with a critical slope of 25 peng et al 2017 thus the experimental slope angle was set to 25 d based on the field measured soil thickness in cultivated land in the karst trough valley the soil depth was set to 30 cm and the soil layers could be classified as a plough layer 10 cm and tillage layer 20 cm from the upper to lower parts in addition differing degrees of soil compaction were applied to three sublayers i e the upper sublayer 453 kpa middle sublayer 801 kpa and lower sublayer 1172 kpa e the slopes in the karst trough valley were divided into dip slopes and anti dip slopes which were simulated with the bedrock in the test tank according to the field observations of typical karst valleys the dominant rock dip angles were between 9 and 65 on the dip and anti dip slopes therefore three different types of rock dip angles were simulated by changing the angle of the bedrock underlying the slope fig 3 flat rock dip angle 10 gentle rock dip angle 20 and 30 and steep rock dip angle 40 and 60 f the bare bedrock ratio ranged from approximately 7 20 based on the field survey of the actual bare bedrock area in cultivated land on karst trough valley slopes dai et al 2017b therefore the studied bare bedrock ratio was set to 15 representing the potential rocky desertification in a karst trough valley of chongqing province and it was simulated by arranging 11 pieces of limestone with diameters of 36 53 cm in the test tank for each rainfall experiment the rainfall duration was designed to last for 60 min based on testing with a stopwatch each rainfall experiment was repeated three times for a total of 30 experiments the post test soil was replaced with fresh new soil for the next rainfall experiment after each experiment 2 3 rainfall tests rainfall experiments were conducted in the artificial simulation rainfall hall of southwest university beibei district china before each artificial rainfall test light rain 10 mm h was used to accelerate the test soil to saturation moisture the rainfall experimental test timing began when surface and underground runoff was produced the surface and underground runoff and sediment yields were collected at the upper and lower ends of the experimental tank respectively the surface and underground runoff and sediment samples were collected at 5 min intervals during the first 30 min and then at 10 min intervals during the 30 60 min period in each rainfall experiment the surface and underground sediment samples were dried in an oven 105 c for 24 h and weighed the sediment size ranges of the bed load and suspended load were measured the sediment size distribution was measured by wet sieving with 3 replicates asadi et al 2007 2 4 measurements and data analyses 1 unit width discharge q the unit width discharge q is applied to intuitively observe the surface runoff produced per unit width per unit time q is estimated by eq 1 1 q q s b where q is the unit width discharge l

load transported through a flow section within one minute asadi et al 2007 suggested that sediment transport mechanisms could be classified as suspended load and bed load each associated with a bimodal distribution of sediment particle sizes fig 4 the boundary for suspension and bed load transport mechanisms is related to flow hydraulics and the soil type in this study the boundaries for bed load transport were between 0 064 and 0 162 mm st is estimated by eq 2 2 s t r t s where st is the sediment transport rate of the suspended load and bed load g min 1 rt is the runoff intensity l min 1 s is the average sediment concentration g l 1 the experimental data in the tables and figures represent the mean values of each site the differences among each experimental treatment were calculated with a standardized beta regression coefficient and analysis of variance anova all statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics 18 0 software 3 results 3 1 runoff loss characteristics under different rock dip angle conditions the rock dip angle is one of the most important factors influencing water loss and leakage zhou et al 2012 to reveal the runoff yield mechanisms under different rock dip angles on karst trough valley slopes the surface and underground runoff yield processes are shown in fig 5 the variation characteristics are presented in tables 3 and 4 the surface runoff rate increased during the first 30 min of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize and the underground runoff rate increased during the first 20 min of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize this indicated that the underground runoff yield had a shorter stabilization time than the surface runoff yield for the dip slope the critical rock dip angle for changing the curvature trend of surface unit width discharge surface runoff depth and surface cumulative runoff volume was 40 and that for the underground unit width discharge runoff depth and cumulative runoff was 20 moreover the underground runoff coefficient exceeded 0 5 at a steep rock dip angle of 60 which indicated that surface runoff loss was mostly occurred at flat and gentle rock dip angles on the dip slope on the anti dip slope there is a critical rock dip angle for the runoff distribution rate on anti dip slope that fluctuates between 30 and 40 overall the rock dip condition influences the surface and underground runoff distribution the surface runoff rate changes followed the order dip slope anti dip slope in terms of rock dip while the underground runoff rate changes exhibited the opposite trend a higher rock dip angle is advantageous for underground runoff production with the increase in the rock dip angle the underground runoff leakage depth increased under the same experimental conditions however the increase in the rock dip angle is disadvantageous to the surface runoff loss the higher the rock dip angle the lower the surface runoff loss on the dip and anti dip slopes 3 2 sediment loss characteristics under different rock dip angle conditions tables 5 and 6 and fig 6 show the characteristics of sediment yield on karst trough valley slopes for six rock dip angles with rainfall intensity and underground pore fissures the total surface and underground sediment yields were significantly different under the experimental designs of the rock dip angle on the karst trough valley slopes the surface sediment yield was grouped into two categories i e suspended load and bed load whereas the underground sediment yield only included suspended load under the dip slope conditions the soil erosion modulus and bed load transport rate reached the maximum value at the rock dip angle of 20 for the surface and 60 for the underground layer additionally the maximum surface suspended load transport rate appeared at 30 and was higher than the surface bed load transport in most experimental conditions the sediment eroded by surface runoff on the dip slope was most affected by the gentle rock dip angle in addition the anti dip slope was dominated by underground sediment yield under flat and steep rock dip angle conditions the rock dip angle affects the surface and underground sediment production to a certain extent the surface cumulative sediment yield and sediment coefficient of the anti dip slope were significantly less than those of the dip slope however the sediment yield characteristics of underground leakage exhibited the opposite trend in addition the greater the rock dip angle is the more conducive the conditions are for underground soil erosion 3 3 consistency between runoff and sediment yield surface runoff is one of the important factors that can increase surface and underground sediment leakage loss in other words the interaction between the surface runoff erosion capacity and the erosion resistance controls the soil leakage loss process in karst trough valleys the formation of runoff during the whole rainfall process can be regarded as the process by which rain drops affect material on karst trough valley slopes according to the special geological structure of the dip and anti dip slopes and double layers nature of karst trough valley slopes fig 7 shows that the rock dip angle plays a key role in the relationship between the surface underground runoff and the sediment yield on dip and anti dip slopes on the dip slope surface runoff loss was always accompanied by surface and underground suspended loads and the change in surface runoff intensity was largely consistent with the change in surface suspended load under the different rock dip angles the slope of the sediment runoff curve followed the order of surface runoff intensity surface suspended load surface bed load however under anti dip slope conditions the maximum surface runoff intensity surface suspended load and surface bed load were found at 30 in total the surface and underground cumulative runoff was remarkably linearly correlated with the cumulative sediment yield compared with the surface and underground fitting determination coefficients r2 under the experimental design of rock dip angles the values of the anti dip slope were significantly greater than those of the dip slope this shows that the surface and underground runoff of the anti dip slope contained more information about sediment yield 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of rock dip angle of runoff leakage loss compared with the other karst landforms the karst trough valleys have the largest karst distribution area in the karst area characterized as old young mountainous and poor in south china in addition to high bare bedrock ratios and double layer hydrogeological structures a karst trough valley features a compact box like anticline syncline structure high rock dip angles carbonate rocks interbedded with non carbonate rocks and other features as we know many studies have mainly focused on the effect of the bare bedrock area underground pore fissures and rainfall intensity on the underground runoff leakage in karst regions jiang et al 2014 revealed the quantitative differences in the water and soil loss at different geomorphologic positions in karst peak cluster depressions and found that the surface soil erosion exhibited the following order in terms of position steep slope gentle slope peak slope valley foot slope depression dai et al 2018 found that the area of bare bedrock had a significant effect on underground soil erosion and that the underground soil erosion rate reached a maximum at 30 bare bedrock however few studies have focused on the rock dip angle which is relevant for karst trough valleys due to the rainfall induced dissolution and erosion of the anticlinal axes composed of carbonate bedrock in karst trough valleys karst slopes have a special geological structure with a u shaped fault plane you et al 2019 this u shaped fault plane can be divided into dip and anti dip slopes leading to a spatial distribution of runoff that differs from those in other topographic types of karst regions norton et al 2010 meanwhile runoff leakage loss on the dip and anti dip slopes are also affected by the hillslope channel vegetation coverage underground rivers and other parameters wei et al 2016 thus the surface and underground runoff yields have differ greatly between the dip slope and anti dip slope field measurement results of the karst trough valley area have indicated that the underground runoff leakage is the major form of water loss on anti dip slopes and is more serious than surface runoff loss on dip slopes yang et al 2011 she et al 2014 schwab et al 2009 also proposed that the surface runoff rate on the dip slopes was significantly greater than that on anti dip slopes these results were similar to the results in our study this difference may occur because the stratified rock in dip slope has the same orientation as the direction of flow and the water flows downstream to the base of dip slopes resulting in the confluence of surface runoff therefore the spatial distribution of water flow on the dip slope is dominated by surface flow in addition on the dip slope each raised rock trapped rainwater leakage loss along with rock joint fissure leading to the surface runoff coefficient decreasing with increasing rock dip angle however under the anti dip slope conditions the inclination direction of the rock dip angle is contrary to the rain runoff direction preventing the rainfall water from moving forward such that most of the surface runoff leakage loss occurs through the soil as a result the underground runoff distribution ratio was always greater than the surface runoff distribution ratio on the anti dip slope additionally an increase in rock dip angle was beneficial for forming runoff induced surface erosion whereas when the rock dip angle increased to a certain degree the runoff loss was mainly due to underground leakage in other words lower rock dip angles on the anti dip slope reduce the surface rainfall runoff resistance resulting in increased surface runoff moreover the runoff resistance increases with increasing rock dip angle leading to a decreased in surface runoff thus surface runoff decreases under the steeper rock dip angle conditions however there is an increasing trend in underground runoff to calculate the surface and underground runoff on karst trough valley slopes a quadratic function can be established to express the role of the rock dip angle on the surface and underground runoff and sediment yield as indicated in fig 8 and table 7 when the rock dip angle is controlled that is the rock dip angle is 0 the average surface runoff rates are 1 1201 and 0 412 l min 1 m 2 for the dip and anti dip slopes respectively this means that the average surface runoff rates of 1 1201 and 0 412 l min 1 m 2 are a result of the interaction between underground pore fissures and rainfall intensity additionally the average underground runoff rates are 0 4472 and 0 9791 l min 1 m 2 for a rock dip angle of 0 in addition the lowest correlation coefficient r 2 was 0 80 with an average value of 0 90 for dip and anti dip slopes indicating that the relationship between the surface underground runoff rate and rock dip angle approximately obeys a quadratic function and the rock dip angle exerts a great impact on the surface underground runoff rate in general the rock dip angle represented the dip of the bedrock on the dip and anti dip slope resulting in different distributions ratios of surface underground runoff in karst trough valleys most studies have demonstrated that the rainfall runoff loss is from exposed rock along at the rock soil interface and the underground runoff leakage in anti dip slopes is significantly greater than that in dip slopes bekaddour et al 2013 chittenden et al 2014 therefore the total rainfall runoff leakage loss was influenced by underground pore fissures and the rock dip angle forming a special type of runoff loss type on karst trough valley slopes hence controlling the rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes is a major factor for reducing runoff leakage loss 4 2 analysis of rock dip angle of soil leakage loss the rock dip angle exerted an important impact on the spatial distribution ratio of the sediment yield niemi et al 2005 gan et al 2019 and the reasons for this phenomenon are listed as follows 1 the dip of the outcropping bedrocks can disperse or gather a large amount of rainwater 2 bare bedrock with fissures joints pores etc can intercept and absorb some rainwater and 3 the dip of outcropping bedrock can change the water flow direction which influences the surface and underground soil erosion rate oliver and fritz 2009 fábio et al 2015 for a dip slope the rock dip can affect the direction of surface runoff and accelerate the soil dispersion and suspension ability caused by surface rainfall runoff indicating that the surface sediment loss is dominant however unlike a dip slope on a anti dip slope the rock dip hinders the surface runoff and velocity and increases the infiltration capacity of rainwater thus the underground soil leakage is greater than that of the surface loss in our study the dip slope was dominated by the surface suspended load the increasing rock dip angle decreased the surface suspended load and bed load and increased the underground suspended load however the underground suspended load is an important part of sediment leakage loss on anti dip slopes the surface suspended load first decreased and then increased with the increasing rock dip angle while the underground suspended load showed a contrary trend the soil leakage loss into the earth along with the underground runoff was always very small thus there was no underground bed load generation this was because the bare bedrock embedded in the surface on the one hand decreased the surface soil erodible area and increased the surface rainfall runoff which was beneficial to the deposited sediment and surface soil erosion decreased fayou et al 2014 on the other hand the bedrock formed an impermeable scaly interface which increased the surface flow velocity and sediment loss in other words the rock dip angle not only impacts the flow direction but also changes the soil transport mechanisms gan et al 2019 demonstrated that the increased rock dip angle of the dip slope leads to a reduced soil detachment rate and a steeper rock dip angle can result in greater surface soil detachment rates in this study fig 9 and table 8 show the relationship between the rock dip angle and average surface underground sediment yield the rock dip angle of the dip slope was significantly correlated with the average surface sediment yield and the maximum average underground sediment yield 0 2823 g min 1 m 2 was found at a rock dip angle of 155 56 in the experiment however under the anti dip slope conditions the maximum average surface sediment yield was 0 4404 g min 1 m 2 when the rock dip angle was 36 and the average underground sediment yield was 0 4019 g min 1 m 2 when the rock dip angle was the control this indicated a critical rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes that influences the spatial distribution of sediment yield controlling the rock dip angle on karst trough valley slopes can be an efficient way to control surface loss and underground leakage indeed relevant studies have proven that the soil erosion in karst landscapes is significantly affected by the rainfall intensity bare bedrock ratio underground pore fissures and geometry and connectivity of the bedrock fissures and these factors directly determine the soil leakage loss pattern of dip and anti dip slopes chittenden et al 2014 you et al 2019 as we know there is no effective means to determine the underground runoff and sediment leakage thus the spatial distributions of runoff and sediment yield on dip and anti dip slopes remain poorly constrained hence the experimental setup in this field simulation study differed from the actual field geological conditions of the karst trough valley for example underground pore fissures are usually filled with soil in the field and often have complex structures whereas the simulated underground pore fissures in this study had drainage holes with complete voids in addition the bedrock fragments in the experiment were smaller than those in the field for further study and discussion the field runoff and sediment yield should also be researched to establish a soil erosion model for karst trough valley slopes 5 conclusions based on the double layer structure of surface and underground geologic characteristics the generation mechanisms of runoff and sediment transport on karst trough valley slopes were investigated with plot scale rainfall simulation tests the results show that the rock dip angle exhibited significant effects on surface and underground soil erosion on karst trough valley slopes in the experiments in response to changes in the rock dip angles the surface runoff and sediment yield coefficients were higher on the dip slope than on the anti dip slope however the underground runoff and sediment yield coefficient exhibited the opposite trend under the dip slope conditions surface rainfall runoff loss mostly occurred at the flat and gentle rock dip angle the surface bed load was larger than the surface suspended load at 20 the underground suspended load appeared at 60 and the minimum underground suspended load was generated at 30 under the anti dip slope conditions the surface runoff loss rate was significantly greater than the underground in runoff leakage cases under the gentle and steep rock dip angles 30 and 40 and the maximum surface runoff intensity surface suspended load and surface bed load were found at 30 rock dip angle overall the rock dip angle had a significant quadratic function relationship with the surface and underground runoff and sediment which is conducive to establishing a prediction model of soil erosion on karst trough valley slopes together the findings in this paper are helpful not only for providing reliable data on surface and underground soil erosion on dip and anti dip slopes but also for establishing a prediction model of runoff and soil leakage under conditions of rock dip angles in karst trough valleys credit authorship contribution
