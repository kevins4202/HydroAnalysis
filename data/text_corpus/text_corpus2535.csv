12675,organic phosphorous wastewater is very hard to be purified which need to remove both cod and phosphorous the treatment process of organic phosphorous wastewater is commonly complicated in this work cao has been used as the catalyst and precipitant for the treatment of organophosphorus wastewater by catalytic ozonation compared with ceo2 mno2 and mgo cao shows excellent catalytic performance for the removal of cod additionally the generated po3 3 can be removed by ca2 ca2 can catalyze the reaction between o3 and h2o to generate active oxygen species such as oh o2 1o2 besides various conditions namely amount of catalyst o3 flow rate substrate concentration and ph for the degradation of tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate thps wastewater by catalytic ozonation over cao have been optimized to determine the optimal parameter conditions finally the excess ca2 in the solution can be removed by the addition of co2 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic ozonation cao organophosphorus reactive radicals cod and total phosphorous removal data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction phosphorus is one of the key substances that causes water eutrophication large amount of phosphorus containing wastewater was discharged into the water body which causes the crazy growth of algae decrease of dissolved oxygen in the water and lead to the deterioration of the water quality 1 2 it will not only bring inestimable economic losses to agriculture tourism aquaculture and other related industries but also endanger the ecological environment and human health 3 the world health organization stipulates that the phosphorus content in water should not exceed 10 mg l 4 actually when the phosphorus content in water exceeds 0 02 mg l it will lead to the eruption of eutrophication 5 therefore it is necessary to find an economical and efficient method for phosphorus removal which is of great significance for the factories which need discharge organophosphorus wastewater phosphorus mainly exists in form of inorganic and organic phosphorate in water including po4 3 hpo4 2 h2po4 and organic phosphorous compounds 2 methods were generally used to treat inorganic phosphorus mainly include adsorption chemical precipitation biological membrane separation and ion exchange method 1 6 8 these methods all showed good phosphorus removal effect however organic phosphorus wastewater in which phosphorus exists in organic matter molecules has complex composition high cod concentration high toxicity and difficult degradation of organic matters thps is a typical phosphorus containing organic material which is commonly used as a fungicide and permanent flame retardant for pure cotton and polyester cotton fabrics it is widely used in oil papermaking dyeing and printing industry 9 although it can be degraded into harmless substances after usage it will increase the cod and total phosphorus tp of the water it is difficult to achieve the purpose of degrading organic matter and removing cod and phosphorus synchronously by the above methods at present catalytic ozonation has been widely used to enhance the treatment of refractory organics in wastewater 10 in this method a large number of active free radicals oh 1o2 o2 are generated from ozone to attack organic matter and promote the decomposition of organic matter into small molecular substances 11 most organics such as antibiotics pesticides organic dyes phenols and other refractory organics can be oxidized into h2o co2 and inorganic salts 12 15 many previous studies have shown that catalytic ozonation is effective for treatment of wastewater for example p asaithambi et al 16 used o3 uv fe2 h2o2 combined process to treat industrial wastewater and the removal of chroma and cod reached 100 and 95 5 respectively after process optimization p asaithambi et al 17 adopted the ozone fenton process o3 fe2 h2o2 to treat industrial wastewater the chroma and cod removal reached 100 and 96 875 for thps wastewater it needs to be completely mineralized by catalytic ozone oxidation firstly to convert the organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus and then the phosphorus is removed by the above mentioned inorganic phosphorus removal method the key to catalytic ozonation degradation of thps is the choice of catalysts so far different kinds of metals metal oxides metals or metal oxides supported on other solids carbon materials and minerals behave been used to catalyze ozone oxidation however commonly reported catalysts surfer the low catalytic activity which needs hours to mineralize all the organics for organophosphorus containing wastewater the generated h2po4 hpo3 2 and po3 2 also can consume the active oxygen species which lead to the low cod removal rate our previous studies have shown that ca oh 2 and cao catalyzed ozonation can rapidly and efficiently degrade organic matter in water 18 19 which indicates that calcium catalysts have good catalytic activity moreover there will be a large amount of ca2 in the reaction system after adding the catalyst which can combine with the phosphate to form calcium phosphate precipitation kspca3 po4 2 10 28 10 33 therefore cao catalyzed ozone oxidation degradation of thps wastewater is expected to achieve the purpose of removing both cod and phosphorus synchronously subsequent operations requiring removal of inorganic phosphorus are avoided in this study cao was used as catalysts and precipitant for treatment of thps simulated wastewater by catalytic ozonation firstly compared with several metal oxides the catalytic effect of cao is obviously better than that of others subsequently the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 in the cao o3 system and the effects of various reactive oxygen species were studied the single variable method was used in the experiment to explore the process conditions of the reaction including catalyst dosage ozone flow rate substrate concentration and initial ph cao and the precipitated solid products were analyzed by xrd eds and ftir finally an appropriate amount of co2 was injected into the reaction solution to remove excess ca2 this study provides a new idea for purification of organophosphorus wastewater 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents cao k2s2o8 nh4moo4 bacl2 mno2 mgo khâ‚‚po4 formic acid ascorbic acid

571 shanghai mine magnetic field measures the concentration of cod in wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of different oxides on catalytic ozonation for thps wastewater in order to find out the best catalyst for the degradation of thps wastewater by ozonation several metal oxides mgo mno2 ceo2 and cao were tested as shown in fig 2a the cod removal rate of ozone oxidation alone is 25 while the cod removal rate of cao o3 mgo o3 ceo2 o3 and mno2 o3 reaction systems were 98 9 53 7 31 6 and 31 4 respectively the adsorption capacities of all catalysts are so small that their contribution to cod removal is almost negligible the adsorption data for cao are shown in section 3 5 the experimental results show that the cod removal effect of cao catalyzed ozonation is much better than other catalysts it is nearly 78 higher than that of a single ozone system the reason may be that cao dissolves in water to form ca oh 2 which making the solution strongly alkaline the presence of oh promotes catalytic ozonation and generation of hydroxyl radicals oh oh is non selective and can oxidize most organic pollutants in water the ph of solution with cao mgo mno2 ceo2 and catalyst free solutions were 12 44 10 2 3 23 2 88 and 3 01 respectively moreover the ph of the system was always maintained above 12 during the whole process of catalytic ozonation fig 2 c therefore cao can promotes the degradation of cod more effectively the tp content in the cao o3 reaction system at the end of the reaction is 5 84 mg l and the removal rate is 99 15 fig 2b it suggests that the organic phosphorus was converted into po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 which might combine with ca2 in the solution to form calcium salt precipitation and achieved the purpose of phosphorus removal similarly mg2 can also combine with po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 to form precipitates however the catalytic activity of mgo is weak and only a small amount of organic phosphorus is converted into inorganic phosphorus so the final tp removal rate is only 31 98 for ceo2 and mno2 the cod removal rate is much lower than cao which have almost no effect on phosphorus removal the hpo4 2 and h2po4 generated by the reaction can quench the oh eqs 1 and 2 20 21 which may be one of the reasons for the poor effect of ceo2 and mno2 catalysts on thps wastewater degradation 1 oh h 2 po 4 oh h 2 po 4 2 oh hpo 4 2 oh hpo 4 3 2 changes of o3 and h2o2 concentrations in the cao o3 system active radicals are the key for the degradation of organic matter by catalytic ozonation therefore the change of dissolved o3 concentration in deionized water with and without catalyst with the continuous introduction of ozone fig 3a was investigated in the solution without cao the dissolved o3 concentration increased to 1 82 mg l in the first 40 min and then decreased slightly the o3 concentration remained stable after adding the cao solution for 10 min and the maximum content was 0 78 mg l the o3 concentration of the former is more than twice of the latter while the latter is always lower than the former there are two reasons for this phenomenon on one hand the solution is strongly alkaline with the addition of cao which is conducive to the reaction between o3 and h2o to form active oxygen species such as oh ho2 o2 1o2 22 o3 is easily adsorbed on the surface of strongly alkaline substances ca oh 2 accelerating its decomposition 23 more importantly ca2 also can catalyze the reaction between o3 and h2o to form active species firstly cao generates ca oh 2 in water and the adsorption energy of o3 molecules on its surface is 4 5 times of h2o according to the previous research 4 s 3p and 3d orbitals of ca atoms form hybrid orbitals and then one of the empty hybrid orbitals is use to interact with the 2p orbitals of o atoms in o3 molecules to form cao o3 molecule was adsorbed onto the ca atom on the surface of ca oh 2 101 to form the ozonide of calcium by a terminal atom 24 then h2o will accelerate the decomposition of calcium ozonide to form o atoms and o2 and h2o will decompose to form oh during the reaction h2o2 will be generated in the reaction system due to the reaction of ho2 with itself eq 3 and the reaction between o3 and organics 25 26 as can be seen from fig 3b the h2o2 content in the single ozone oxidation system rapidly increased to 2 2 mg l in the first 20 min and then began to decrease but remained above 1 25 mg l for cao o3 system almost no h2o2 was detected in the whole reaction process it may be because a large amount of oh exists in the cao o3 system which can react with h2o2 to generate o2 eq 4 27 it also shows that cao can promote o3 to generate oh in addition the presence of ca2 also facilitates the decomposition of h2o2 to generate other reactive oxygen species eq 5 24 therefore the h2o2 produced in the cao o3 system is rapidly decomposed 3 ho 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 4 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 5 2 h 2 o 2 ca ii 2 h 2 o Î± 1 o 2 1 Î± 3 o 2 3 3 influence of different active oxygen species on cod removal rate cao catalyzed ozonation degradation of thps may generate various reactive radicals such as oh o2 and 1o2 in order to determine which free radical plays a major role in the reaction tert butanol tba benzoquinone bq and l histidine were used as quenchers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively to investigate theirs influences on cod removal rate 28 30 compared with the one without any quenchers the removal rate of cod in the system with bq decreased by 23 it indicates that o2 can promote the degradation of thps but it does not play a major role for the system with tba added the cod removal rate decreased by 49 which indicated that oh played a major role in the degradation of thps compared with o2 although l histidine can be used as a quencher for 1o2 the cod in the system with l histidine is also significantly reduced however some studies have shown that 1o2 can react with water kwater 2 5 105 s 1 and l histidine can also react with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 therefore the decrease of cod in the system with l histidine addition cannot be attributed to the effect of 1o2 only it demonstrates that 1o2 also play an assistant role for the cod removal therefore the degradation of thps can be attributed to the combined action of three free radicals eq 6 6 oh o 2 1 o 2 thps intermediate co 2 h 2 o 3 4 effect of initial substrate concentration and kinetics to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of thps on the final removal rates of cod and tp the initial concentration of thps was gradually increased from 790 to 1830 mg l the experimental results show fig 4ab that when the initial concentration of thps was 790 mg l the final removal rates of cod and tp reached 99 68 and 98 respectively when the concentration was greater than or equal to 1050 mg l the reaction rate decreased significantly and the removal rates of cod and tp also decreased gradually with the increase of the initial concentration when the concentration was 1830 mg l the removal rates of cod and tp were the lowest 87 1 and 85 3 respectively the reason for the decrease of the reaction rate and final removal rate with the increase of the initial concentration of thps may be that there was not enough dissolved ozone in the solution which leads to the fewer active radicals than pollutants too much intermediates generates from the degradation of thps in the system with high concentration of thps such as carboxylates can consume the active oxygen species which is also one of the reasons for the decrease of cod removal rate and reaction rate the kinetic models of thps simulated wastewater cod and tp removal rates were fitted based on the above data fig 4cd the results showed that both of them are fitted to the primary kinetic model from the kinetic equations it can be concluded that the reaction rate constants of both cod and tp decreased as the initial concentration of thps in wastewater increased from 0 79 g l to 1 83 g l the reaction rate constants for cod were 0 09703 0 06146 0 05403 0 04183 and 0 03765 respectively the reaction rate constants for tp were 0 0779 0 05325 0 04848 0 04217 and 0 0339 respectively this also indicates that the degradation rate decreases as the initial concentration of thps increases it is due to the higher the concentration of thps which lead to the generation of more inorganic phosphorus after degradation and the ca2 in the solution cannot precipitate it completely in time the concentration of po4 3 and hpo4 2 also increases with the increase of thps concentration which can quench the oh produced in the cao o3 system and slow down the reaction rate 3 5 the effect of cao addition on the removal rate of cod and tp the amount of cao will affect the removal effect of cod in addition the inorganic phosphorus produced after thps mineralization needs to be precipitated by ca2 in the solution therefore the effect of cao dosage on the removal of cod and tp was studied it can be seen from fig 5ab that when the cao amount is changed from 0 5 to 1 5 g the final removal of tp and cod can be maintained above 98 and 96 respectively when only cao was added without o3 the removal rates of tp and cod were 1 2 and 3 2 respectively it indicates that the adsorption effect of cao on thps was almost negligible when the amount of cao is 0 5 g with a significant decrease in the reaction rate could be seen the removal rate of tp to 98 takes 120 min but the others only take 75 min the same trend was observed for the cod removal rate in addition when the catalyst dosage was 1 5 g the reaction rate was the fastest in the first 20 min it indicates that adding more cao to the reaction system can provide more catalytic active sites to accelerates the degradation rate of thps and the removal rate of tp the determination of tp in the solution after the reaction fig 5c showed that when the amount of cao was greater than 1 g the tp content in the solution was between 5 and 6 5 mg l when the amount of cao was less than or equal to 1 g the tp content in the solution increased significantly about twice as much as the former the reason may be that less reactive oxygen species are produced in the system with low the amount of cao therefore thps are not completely mineralized and some small molecules of phospho containing organic matters still exist in the solution in addition cao acted as not only a catalyst but also the precipitant for phosphate when the cao dosage was 0 5 g the remaining p content in the solution was 1 13 mg l while in the reaction system with cao dosage greater than 0 5 g the p content was less than 0 05 mg l this indicates that the ca2 in the solution was not sufficient to precipitate the inorganic phosphorus produced by the reaction when the cao dosage was too less so the cao dosage for all experiments in this study was 1 g 3 6 effect of o3 flux on catalytic ozonation in this study the final removal rates of tp and cod increased with the increase of ozone flow rate but not significant as can be seen from fig 6 when the ozone flow rate increased from 0 2 to 1 0 l min the tp removal rate increased from 97 8 to 99 2 and the cod removal rate increased from 97 5 to 98 9 however the slope of the curves in the fig 6 shows that the lower the o3 flow rate the slower the removal rate of cod and tp it may be due to that with the increase of the ozone flow rate the amount of ozone dissolved in the solution increases thus producing more reactive radicals and increasing the reaction rate when the ozone concentration in the solution reaches a maximum at a certain temperature it does not increase with further increases of ozone flow rate which limits the increase of the reaction rate in the reaction system with an ozone flow rate of 1 0 l min the reaction rate was obviously fast in the first 45 min and the removal at 75 min was close to the final tp and cod removal rates the reaction rate slowed down between 45 min and 75 min due to that the thps in the solution was almost completely degraded or extremely difficult to be degraded intermediates were formed at this time resulting in a slower reaction rate in addition the reaction of o3 with oh may be also the reason for the decrease of the reaction rate ultimately the concentration of o3 in the inlet and outlet gases was measured by iodimetry and the results are shown in the table 1 the concentration of o3 in the inlet and outlet were 48 624 and 20 676 mg l respectively the utilization of o3 is 57 48 3 7 effect of initial ph on catalytic ozonation in general changing the initial ph of the reaction system affects the surface properties of catalyst when the ph of the solution is less than equal to or greater than the zero point charge phpzc of the catalyst the catalyst exhibits protonation neutrality and deprotonation respectively resulting in catalysts with different charges phpzc of cao is 11 9 which undergoes protonation ca oh2 neutrality ca oh and deprotonation cao therefore to investigate the effect of initial ph on the catalyst activity the ph of the solution was adjusted by nitric acid the removal of cod in the cao o3 system was investigated with initial ph of 3 5 7 9 11 and 12 38 fig 7 a at ph of 3 and 5 the cod removal efficiency was poor which were close to the effect of ozone alone it suggests that the lower ph is not conducive to the production of reactive oxygen species by o3 on soluble calcium salts generated from cao reacted with hno3 when the ph was increased to 7 the cod removal rate was significantly higher than that under acidic conditions with the increase of ph the cod removal rate increased obviously it suggests that oh is critical for the generation of reactive radicals from o3 it was also confirmed by measuring the ph change of the solution before and after the reaction from fig 7b it can be seen that the ph after the reaction is always lower than the initial ph indicating that oh is consumed by the catalytic reaction for the reaction system with ph 12 38 unadjusted ph the cod removal rate and reaction rate were significantly higher than other systems it is due to the deprotonation of the catalyst at ph 12 38 phpzc which makes the surface negatively charged and it will adsorb c4h12o4p in thps wastewater in addition the electrophilic nature of o3 makes it easier to adsorb on negatively charged ionic surfaces 31 therefore cao exhibits high catalytic activity at higher ph conditions which greatly improves the degradation rate of cod 3 8 changes of cao before and after the catalytic ozonation to understand the changes of cao before and after the reaction x ray diffraction xrd was performed from the xrd patterns of catalyst before the reaction it can be seen that the strong peaks appeared at 32 17 37 39 53 83 and the weak peaks emerged at 64 17 67 42 79 72 88 58 91 44 can be responded to cao fig 8 a weak peaks emerged at 18 0 28 63 34 14 47 14 50 78 62 59 can be responded to ca oh 2 it suggests that some water was drawn into the cao prior to the reaction but it did not affect the experiments after catalytic ozonation the characteristic peaks of cao were found to be disappeared the characteristic peaks in the xrd spectrum are mainly caco3 among which the peaks located at 23 01 29 42 31 38 35 91 39 36 43 1 47 43 48 51 and 57 37 can be corresponded to the 012 104 006 110 113 202 018 116 and 122 planes of calcium carbonate respectively it shows that the co2 finally generated after the reaction is converted into co3 2 in water and then combined with ca2 in water to form calcium carbonate precipitation moreover the presence of ca oh 2 can be detected in the used catalysts the peak at 47 14 can be attributed to ca oh 2 the solubility product of caco3 ksp 2 8 10 6 is much smaller than ca oh 2 ksp 5 02 10 6 which indicates that the organic matter in the water is almost completely degraded thps wastewater contains so4 2 so caso4 will be detected in solid products by xrd after the reaction the concentration of so4 2 remaining in the solution was 128 16 mg l higher than the standard for drinking water according to gb5749 2006 the content of so4 2 in drinking water should not be higher than 160 mg l the corresponding peaks at 20 54 32 84 and 41 78 represent ca h2po4 2 h2o which indicates that the organophosphorus in thps were oxidized to inorganic phosphorus and combined with ca2 in the solution to precipitate besides the reacted sample was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds it was found by eds that the main elements are c o p s and ca which indicates that the organic phosphorus in the solution was converted into orthophosphate and precipitated in order to further investigate the changes of cao after catalytic ozonation ftir was performed in the spectrum before the reaction the peak at 3639 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of the hydroxyl group which is due to the absorption of a small amount of water in the cao after the reaction more peaks appeared in the infrared spectrum the peak at 1408 cm 1 is the vibration of the co bond in co3 2 32 the peaks at 614 cm 1 and 1076 cm 1 represent the characteristic peaks of po4 3 indicating the presence of ca3 po4 2 in the used catalysts 33 but there are also literatures showing that the peak at 1076 cm 1 is the symmetric stretching vibration peak of co3 2 34 the two characteristic peaks are close to each other so they may be overlapped in addition the peak at 872 cm 1 is oo of cao2 indicating that cao2 was generated during the reaction 35 3 9 removal of ca2 from the solution after the reaction finally with calcium carboxylate and edta 2na as indicator and standard solution respectively the concentration of ca2 in the reacted wastewater was measured after the solution being adjusted to the ph 12 13 with naoh solution in this process the free ca2 formed a complex with edta 2na and then the solution changed from purplish red to bright blue which was the end point of the reaction the test results are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the ca2 concentration the lowest is 252 5 mg l and the highest is 565 9 mg l in the wastewater exceeded the standard according to gb5749 2006 drinking water quality indicators ca2 shall not exceed 180 mg l the calcium ion concentration in the water increased with the increase of cao dosage the inlet of co2 in treated wastewater was used to reduce the ca2 concentration in the wastewater the introduced co2 may be discharged due to incomplete reaction or too much co2 may be introduced resulting in the formation of ca hco3 2 therefore the co2 flow rate was adjusted to 0 2 l min the introduction time increased with the measured ca2 concentration increasing for every 50 mg l increase in ca2 concentration the co2 introduction time increased by 1 min after the introduction of co2 the ca2 concentration in the solution decreased to less than 30 mg l with the lowest being 18 9 mg l at the same time the ph of the solution dropped from 12 05 to 12 22 to 6 7 5 during this process it suggests that the introduction of co2 can remove most of ca2 in water to meet the discharge standards 4 conclusions different metal oxides ceo2 mno2 mgo and cao were used for treatment of thps wastewater by catalytic ozonation the final treatment effect of the wastewater after the addition of these metal oxides was cao mgo mno2 ceo2 in order which is consistent with the initial ph in the solution after the addition of metal oxides in this study we also found that cao can catalyze ozonation to degrade phosphorus containing organic matter in wastewater and remove phosphorus element by forming precipitation with phosphate the reason is that the addition of cao can increase the ph of the reaction system which is conducive to the generation of reactive oxygen species from ozone and ca2 can catalyze the reaction between ozone and water to generate reactive oxygen species the kinetic study of the reaction shows that it is a quasi first order reaction the high substrate concentration is not conducive to the reaction because of the formation of free radical quencher through the passage of co2 the ca2 in the wastewater can be effectively removed so that it can meet the recycling or discharge standards this study provides a new idea and method for the efficient treatment of organophosphorus wastewater declaration of competing interest this manuscript has not been published or considered in other journals all the authors have agreed to publish this

12675,organic phosphorous wastewater is very hard to be purified which need to remove both cod and phosphorous the treatment process of organic phosphorous wastewater is commonly complicated in this work cao has been used as the catalyst and precipitant for the treatment of organophosphorus wastewater by catalytic ozonation compared with ceo2 mno2 and mgo cao shows excellent catalytic performance for the removal of cod additionally the generated po3 3 can be removed by ca2 ca2 can catalyze the reaction between o3 and h2o to generate active oxygen species such as oh o2 1o2 besides various conditions namely amount of catalyst o3 flow rate substrate concentration and ph for the degradation of tetrakis hydroxymethyl phosphonium sulfate thps wastewater by catalytic ozonation over cao have been optimized to determine the optimal parameter conditions finally the excess ca2 in the solution can be removed by the addition of co2 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords catalytic ozonation cao organophosphorus reactive radicals cod and total phosphorous removal data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction phosphorus is one of the key substances that causes water eutrophication large amount of phosphorus containing wastewater was discharged into the water body which causes the crazy growth of algae decrease of dissolved oxygen in the water and lead to the deterioration of the water quality 1 2 it will not only bring inestimable economic losses to agriculture tourism aquaculture and other related industries but also endanger the ecological environment and human health 3 the world health organization stipulates that the phosphorus content in water should not exceed 10 mg l 4 actually when the phosphorus content in water exceeds 0 02 mg l it will lead to the eruption of eutrophication 5 therefore it is necessary to find an economical and efficient method for phosphorus removal which is of great significance for the factories which need discharge organophosphorus wastewater phosphorus mainly exists in form of inorganic and organic phosphorate in water including po4 3 hpo4 2 h2po4 and organic phosphorous compounds 2 methods were generally used to treat inorganic phosphorus mainly include adsorption chemical precipitation biological membrane separation and ion exchange method 1 6 8 these methods all showed good phosphorus removal effect however organic phosphorus wastewater in which phosphorus exists in organic matter molecules has complex composition high cod concentration high toxicity and difficult degradation of organic matters thps is a typical phosphorus containing organic material which is commonly used as a fungicide and permanent flame retardant for pure cotton and polyester cotton fabrics it is widely used in oil papermaking dyeing and printing industry 9 although it can be degraded into harmless substances after usage it will increase the cod and total phosphorus tp of the water it is difficult to achieve the purpose of degrading organic matter and removing cod and phosphorus synchronously by the above methods at present catalytic ozonation has been widely used to enhance the treatment of refractory organics in wastewater 10 in this method a large number of active free radicals oh 1o2 o2 are generated from ozone to attack organic matter and promote the decomposition of organic matter into small molecular substances 11 most organics such as antibiotics pesticides organic dyes phenols and other refractory organics can be oxidized into h2o co2 and inorganic salts 12 15 many previous studies have shown that catalytic ozonation is effective for treatment of wastewater for example p asaithambi et al 16 used o3 uv fe2 h2o2 combined process to treat industrial wastewater and the removal of chroma and cod reached 100 and 95 5 respectively after process optimization p asaithambi et al 17 adopted the ozone fenton process o3 fe2 h2o2 to treat industrial wastewater the chroma and cod removal reached 100 and 96 875 for thps wastewater it needs to be completely mineralized by catalytic ozone oxidation firstly to convert the organic phosphorus into inorganic phosphorus and then the phosphorus is removed by the above mentioned inorganic phosphorus removal method the key to catalytic ozonation degradation of thps is the choice of catalysts so far different kinds of metals metal oxides metals or metal oxides supported on other solids carbon materials and minerals behave been used to catalyze ozone oxidation however commonly reported catalysts surfer the low catalytic activity which needs hours to mineralize all the organics for organophosphorus containing wastewater the generated h2po4 hpo3 2 and po3 2 also can consume the active oxygen species which lead to the low cod removal rate our previous studies have shown that ca oh 2 and cao catalyzed ozonation can rapidly and efficiently degrade organic matter in water 18 19 which indicates that calcium catalysts have good catalytic activity moreover there will be a large amount of ca2 in the reaction system after adding the catalyst which can combine with the phosphate to form calcium phosphate precipitation kspca3 po4 2 10 28 10 33 therefore cao catalyzed ozone oxidation degradation of thps wastewater is expected to achieve the purpose of removing both cod and phosphorus synchronously subsequent operations requiring removal of inorganic phosphorus are avoided in this study cao was used as catalysts and precipitant for treatment of thps simulated wastewater by catalytic ozonation firstly compared with several metal oxides the catalytic effect of cao is obviously better than that of others subsequently the concentrations of o3 and h2o2 in the cao o3 system and the effects of various reactive oxygen species were studied the single variable method was used in the experiment to explore the process conditions of the reaction including catalyst dosage ozone flow rate substrate concentration and initial ph cao and the precipitated solid products were analyzed by xrd eds and ftir finally an appropriate amount of co2 was injected into the reaction solution to remove excess ca2 this study provides a new idea for purification of organophosphorus wastewater 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and reagents cao k2s2o8 nh4moo4 bacl2 mno2 mgo khâ‚‚po4 formic acid ascorbic acid

571 shanghai mine magnetic field measures the concentration of cod in wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic performance of different oxides on catalytic ozonation for thps wastewater in order to find out the best catalyst for the degradation of thps wastewater by ozonation several metal oxides mgo mno2 ceo2 and cao were tested as shown in fig 2a the cod removal rate of ozone oxidation alone is 25 while the cod removal rate of cao o3 mgo o3 ceo2 o3 and mno2 o3 reaction systems were 98 9 53 7 31 6 and 31 4 respectively the adsorption capacities of all catalysts are so small that their contribution to cod removal is almost negligible the adsorption data for cao are shown in section 3 5 the experimental results show that the cod removal effect of cao catalyzed ozonation is much better than other catalysts it is nearly 78 higher than that of a single ozone system the reason may be that cao dissolves in water to form ca oh 2 which making the solution strongly alkaline the presence of oh promotes catalytic ozonation and generation of hydroxyl radicals oh oh is non selective and can oxidize most organic pollutants in water the ph of solution with cao mgo mno2 ceo2 and catalyst free solutions were 12 44 10 2 3 23 2 88 and 3 01 respectively moreover the ph of the system was always maintained above 12 during the whole process of catalytic ozonation fig 2 c therefore cao can promotes the degradation of cod more effectively the tp content in the cao o3 reaction system at the end of the reaction is 5 84 mg l and the removal rate is 99 15 fig 2b it suggests that the organic phosphorus was converted into po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 which might combine with ca2 in the solution to form calcium salt precipitation and achieved the purpose of phosphorus removal similarly mg2 can also combine with po4 3 hpo4 2 and h2po4 to form precipitates however the catalytic activity of mgo is weak and only a small amount of organic phosphorus is converted into inorganic phosphorus so the final tp removal rate is only 31 98 for ceo2 and mno2 the cod removal rate is much lower than cao which have almost no effect on phosphorus removal the hpo4 2 and h2po4 generated by the reaction can quench the oh eqs 1 and 2 20 21 which may be one of the reasons for the poor effect of ceo2 and mno2 catalysts on thps wastewater degradation 1 oh h 2 po 4 oh h 2 po 4 2 oh hpo 4 2 oh hpo 4 3 2 changes of o3 and h2o2 concentrations in the cao o3 system active radicals are the key for the degradation of organic matter by catalytic ozonation therefore the change of dissolved o3 concentration in deionized water with and without catalyst with the continuous introduction of ozone fig 3a was investigated in the solution without cao the dissolved o3 concentration increased to 1 82 mg l in the first 40 min and then decreased slightly the o3 concentration remained stable after adding the cao solution for 10 min and the maximum content was 0 78 mg l the o3 concentration of the former is more than twice of the latter while the latter is always lower than the former there are two reasons for this phenomenon on one hand the solution is strongly alkaline with the addition of cao which is conducive to the reaction between o3 and h2o to form active oxygen species such as oh ho2 o2 1o2 22 o3 is easily adsorbed on the surface of strongly alkaline substances ca oh 2 accelerating its decomposition 23 more importantly ca2 also can catalyze the reaction between o3 and h2o to form active species firstly cao generates ca oh 2 in water and the adsorption energy of o3 molecules on its surface is 4 5 times of h2o according to the previous research 4 s 3p and 3d orbitals of ca atoms form hybrid orbitals and then one of the empty hybrid orbitals is use to interact with the 2p orbitals of o atoms in o3 molecules to form cao o3 molecule was adsorbed onto the ca atom on the surface of ca oh 2 101 to form the ozonide of calcium by a terminal atom 24 then h2o will accelerate the decomposition of calcium ozonide to form o atoms and o2 and h2o will decompose to form oh during the reaction h2o2 will be generated in the reaction system due to the reaction of ho2 with itself eq 3 and the reaction between o3 and organics 25 26 as can be seen from fig 3b the h2o2 content in the single ozone oxidation system rapidly increased to 2 2 mg l in the first 20 min and then began to decrease but remained above 1 25 mg l for cao o3 system almost no h2o2 was detected in the whole reaction process it may be because a large amount of oh exists in the cao o3 system which can react with h2o2 to generate o2 eq 4 27 it also shows that cao can promote o3 to generate oh in addition the presence of ca2 also facilitates the decomposition of h2o2 to generate other reactive oxygen species eq 5 24 therefore the h2o2 produced in the cao o3 system is rapidly decomposed 3 ho 2 ho 2 o 2 h 2 o 2 4 oh h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h 5 2 h 2 o 2 ca ii 2 h 2 o Î± 1 o 2 1 Î± 3 o 2 3 3 influence of different active oxygen species on cod removal rate cao catalyzed ozonation degradation of thps may generate various reactive radicals such as oh o2 and 1o2 in order to determine which free radical plays a major role in the reaction tert butanol tba benzoquinone bq and l histidine were used as quenchers for oh o2 and 1o2 respectively to investigate theirs influences on cod removal rate 28 30 compared with the one without any quenchers the removal rate of cod in the system with bq decreased by 23 it indicates that o2 can promote the degradation of thps but it does not play a major role for the system with tba added the cod removal rate decreased by 49 which indicated that oh played a major role in the degradation of thps compared with o2 although l histidine can be used as a quencher for 1o2 the cod in the system with l histidine is also significantly reduced however some studies have shown that 1o2 can react with water kwater 2 5 105 s 1 and l histidine can also react with oh 5 109 m 1 s 1 therefore the decrease of cod in the system with l histidine addition cannot be attributed to the effect of 1o2 only it demonstrates that 1o2 also play an assistant role for the cod removal therefore the degradation of thps can be attributed to the combined action of three free radicals eq 6 6 oh o 2 1 o 2 thps intermediate co 2 h 2 o 3 4 effect of initial substrate concentration and kinetics to investigate the effect of the initial concentration of thps on the final removal rates of cod and tp the initial concentration of thps was gradually increased from 790 to 1830 mg l the experimental results show fig 4ab that when the initial concentration of thps was 790 mg l the final removal rates of cod and tp reached 99 68 and 98 respectively when the concentration was greater than or equal to 1050 mg l the reaction rate decreased significantly and the removal rates of cod and tp also decreased gradually with the increase of the initial concentration when the concentration was 1830 mg l the removal rates of cod and tp were the lowest 87 1 and 85 3 respectively the reason for the decrease of the reaction rate and final removal rate with the increase of the initial concentration of thps may be that there was not enough dissolved ozone in the solution which leads to the fewer active radicals than pollutants too much intermediates generates from the degradation of thps in the system with high concentration of thps such as carboxylates can consume the active oxygen species which is also one of the reasons for the decrease of cod removal rate and reaction rate the kinetic models of thps simulated wastewater cod and tp removal rates were fitted based on the above data fig 4cd the results showed that both of them are fitted to the primary kinetic model from the kinetic equations it can be concluded that the reaction rate constants of both cod and tp decreased as the initial concentration of thps in wastewater increased from 0 79 g l to 1 83 g l the reaction rate constants for cod were 0 09703 0 06146 0 05403 0 04183 and 0 03765 respectively the reaction rate constants for tp were 0 0779 0 05325 0 04848 0 04217 and 0 0339 respectively this also indicates that the degradation rate decreases as the initial concentration of thps increases it is due to the higher the concentration of thps which lead to the generation of more inorganic phosphorus after degradation and the ca2 in the solution cannot precipitate it completely in time the concentration of po4 3 and hpo4 2 also increases with the increase of thps concentration which can quench the oh produced in the cao o3 system and slow down the reaction rate 3 5 the effect of cao addition on the removal rate of cod and tp the amount of cao will affect the removal effect of cod in addition the inorganic phosphorus produced after thps mineralization needs to be precipitated by ca2 in the solution therefore the effect of cao dosage on the removal of cod and tp was studied it can be seen from fig 5ab that when the cao amount is changed from 0 5 to 1 5 g the final removal of tp and cod can be maintained above 98 and 96 respectively when only cao was added without o3 the removal rates of tp and cod were 1 2 and 3 2 respectively it indicates that the adsorption effect of cao on thps was almost negligible when the amount of cao is 0 5 g with a significant decrease in the reaction rate could be seen the removal rate of tp to 98 takes 120 min but the others only take 75 min the same trend was observed for the cod removal rate in addition when the catalyst dosage was 1 5 g the reaction rate was the fastest in the first 20 min it indicates that adding more cao to the reaction system can provide more catalytic active sites to accelerates the degradation rate of thps and the removal rate of tp the determination of tp in the solution after the reaction fig 5c showed that when the amount of cao was greater than 1 g the tp content in the solution was between 5 and 6 5 mg l when the amount of cao was less than or equal to 1 g the tp content in the solution increased significantly about twice as much as the former the reason may be that less reactive oxygen species are produced in the system with low the amount of cao therefore thps are not completely mineralized and some small molecules of phospho containing organic matters still exist in the solution in addition cao acted as not only a catalyst but also the precipitant for phosphate when the cao dosage was 0 5 g the remaining p content in the solution was 1 13 mg l while in the reaction system with cao dosage greater than 0 5 g the p content was less than 0 05 mg l this indicates that the ca2 in the solution was not sufficient to precipitate the inorganic phosphorus produced by the reaction when the cao dosage was too less so the cao dosage for all experiments in this study was 1 g 3 6 effect of o3 flux on catalytic ozonation in this study the final removal rates of tp and cod increased with the increase of ozone flow rate but not significant as can be seen from fig 6 when the ozone flow rate increased from 0 2 to 1 0 l min the tp removal rate increased from 97 8 to 99 2 and the cod removal rate increased from 97 5 to 98 9 however the slope of the curves in the fig 6 shows that the lower the o3 flow rate the slower the removal rate of cod and tp it may be due to that with the increase of the ozone flow rate the amount of ozone dissolved in the solution increases thus producing more reactive radicals and increasing the reaction rate when the ozone concentration in the solution reaches a maximum at a certain temperature it does not increase with further increases of ozone flow rate which limits the increase of the reaction rate in the reaction system with an ozone flow rate of 1 0 l min the reaction rate was obviously fast in the first 45 min and the removal at 75 min was close to the final tp and cod removal rates the reaction rate slowed down between 45 min and 75 min due to that the thps in the solution was almost completely degraded or extremely difficult to be degraded intermediates were formed at this time resulting in a slower reaction rate in addition the reaction of o3 with oh may be also the reason for the decrease of the reaction rate ultimately the concentration of o3 in the inlet and outlet gases was measured by iodimetry and the results are shown in the table 1 the concentration of o3 in the inlet and outlet were 48 624 and 20 676 mg l respectively the utilization of o3 is 57 48 3 7 effect of initial ph on catalytic ozonation in general changing the initial ph of the reaction system affects the surface properties of catalyst when the ph of the solution is less than equal to or greater than the zero point charge phpzc of the catalyst the catalyst exhibits protonation neutrality and deprotonation respectively resulting in catalysts with different charges phpzc of cao is 11 9 which undergoes protonation ca oh2 neutrality ca oh and deprotonation cao therefore to investigate the effect of initial ph on the catalyst activity the ph of the solution was adjusted by nitric acid the removal of cod in the cao o3 system was investigated with initial ph of 3 5 7 9 11 and 12 38 fig 7 a at ph of 3 and 5 the cod removal efficiency was poor which were close to the effect of ozone alone it suggests that the lower ph is not conducive to the production of reactive oxygen species by o3 on soluble calcium salts generated from cao reacted with hno3 when the ph was increased to 7 the cod removal rate was significantly higher than that under acidic conditions with the increase of ph the cod removal rate increased obviously it suggests that oh is critical for the generation of reactive radicals from o3 it was also confirmed by measuring the ph change of the solution before and after the reaction from fig 7b it can be seen that the ph after the reaction is always lower than the initial ph indicating that oh is consumed by the catalytic reaction for the reaction system with ph 12 38 unadjusted ph the cod removal rate and reaction rate were significantly higher than other systems it is due to the deprotonation of the catalyst at ph 12 38 phpzc which makes the surface negatively charged and it will adsorb c4h12o4p in thps wastewater in addition the electrophilic nature of o3 makes it easier to adsorb on negatively charged ionic surfaces 31 therefore cao exhibits high catalytic activity at higher ph conditions which greatly improves the degradation rate of cod 3 8 changes of cao before and after the catalytic ozonation to understand the changes of cao before and after the reaction x ray diffraction xrd was performed from the xrd patterns of catalyst before the reaction it can be seen that the strong peaks appeared at 32 17 37 39 53 83 and the weak peaks emerged at 64 17 67 42 79 72 88 58 91 44 can be responded to cao fig 8 a weak peaks emerged at 18 0 28 63 34 14 47 14 50 78 62 59 can be responded to ca oh 2 it suggests that some water was drawn into the cao prior to the reaction but it did not affect the experiments after catalytic ozonation the characteristic peaks of cao were found to be disappeared the characteristic peaks in the xrd spectrum are mainly caco3 among which the peaks located at 23 01 29 42 31 38 35 91 39 36 43 1 47 43 48 51 and 57 37 can be corresponded to the 012 104 006 110 113 202 018 116 and 122 planes of calcium carbonate respectively it shows that the co2 finally generated after the reaction is converted into co3 2 in water and then combined with ca2 in water to form calcium carbonate precipitation moreover the presence of ca oh 2 can be detected in the used catalysts the peak at 47 14 can be attributed to ca oh 2 the solubility product of caco3 ksp 2 8 10 6 is much smaller than ca oh 2 ksp 5 02 10 6 which indicates that the organic matter in the water is almost completely degraded thps wastewater contains so4 2 so caso4 will be detected in solid products by xrd after the reaction the concentration of so4 2 remaining in the solution was 128 16 mg l higher than the standard for drinking water according to gb5749 2006 the content of so4 2 in drinking water should not be higher than 160 mg l the corresponding peaks at 20 54 32 84 and 41 78 represent ca h2po4 2 h2o which indicates that the organophosphorus in thps were oxidized to inorganic phosphorus and combined with ca2 in the solution to precipitate besides the reacted sample was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds it was found by eds that the main elements are c o p s and ca which indicates that the organic phosphorus in the solution was converted into orthophosphate and precipitated in order to further investigate the changes of cao after catalytic ozonation ftir was performed in the spectrum before the reaction the peak at 3639 cm 1 is the stretching vibration peak of the hydroxyl group which is due to the absorption of a small amount of water in the cao after the reaction more peaks appeared in the infrared spectrum the peak at 1408 cm 1 is the vibration of the co bond in co3 2 32 the peaks at 614 cm 1 and 1076 cm 1 represent the characteristic peaks of po4 3 indicating the presence of ca3 po4 2 in the used catalysts 33 but there are also literatures showing that the peak at 1076 cm 1 is the symmetric stretching vibration peak of co3 2 34 the two characteristic peaks are close to each other so they may be overlapped in addition the peak at 872 cm 1 is oo of cao2 indicating that cao2 was generated during the reaction 35 3 9 removal of ca2 from the solution after the reaction finally with calcium carboxylate and edta 2na as indicator and standard solution respectively the concentration of ca2 in the reacted wastewater was measured after the solution being adjusted to the ph 12 13 with naoh solution in this process the free ca2 formed a complex with edta 2na and then the solution changed from purplish red to bright blue which was the end point of the reaction the test results are shown in table 2 it can be seen that the ca2 concentration the lowest is 252 5 mg l and the highest is 565 9 mg l in the wastewater exceeded the standard according to gb5749 2006 drinking water quality indicators ca2 shall not exceed 180 mg l the calcium ion concentration in the water increased with the increase of cao dosage the inlet of co2 in treated wastewater was used to reduce the ca2 concentration in the wastewater the introduced co2 may be discharged due to incomplete reaction or too much co2 may be introduced resulting in the formation of ca hco3 2 therefore the co2 flow rate was adjusted to 0 2 l min the introduction time increased with the measured ca2 concentration increasing for every 50 mg l increase in ca2 concentration the co2 introduction time increased by 1 min after the introduction of co2 the ca2 concentration in the solution decreased to less than 30 mg l with the lowest being 18 9 mg l at the same time the ph of the solution dropped from 12 05 to 12 22 to 6 7 5 during this process it suggests that the introduction of co2 can remove most of ca2 in water to meet the discharge standards 4 conclusions different metal oxides ceo2 mno2 mgo and cao were used for treatment of thps wastewater by catalytic ozonation the final treatment effect of the wastewater after the addition of these metal oxides was cao mgo mno2 ceo2 in order which is consistent with the initial ph in the solution after the addition of metal oxides in this study we also found that cao can catalyze ozonation to degrade phosphorus containing organic matter in wastewater and remove phosphorus element by forming precipitation with phosphate the reason is that the addition of cao can increase the ph of the reaction system which is conducive to the generation of reactive oxygen species from ozone and ca2 can catalyze the reaction between ozone and water to generate reactive oxygen species the kinetic study of the reaction shows that it is a quasi first order reaction the high substrate concentration is not conducive to the reaction because of the formation of free radical quencher through the passage of co2 the ca2 in the wastewater can be effectively removed so that it can meet the recycling or discharge standards this study provides a new idea and method for the

12676,flocs produced during drinking water treatment play a key role in particle separation and removal floc characteristics affect both sedimentation and filtration efficiency however the methods used to optimise the coagulant dose during treatment do not usually take these into account this study investigated the feasibility of using the flocculation index fi obtained from a photometric dispersion analyser pda during flocculation as a control parameter to optimise turbidity removal five waters natural and synthetic with different turbidity levels from 6 to 120 ntu and low doc i e 5 mg l were used to study the effects of various alum doses on floc characteristics i e initial floc aggregation ifa plateau p and variance var no correlation was found between the ifa and var values and the alum dose achieving the greatest turbidity removal and relative settling factor rsf however p followed a similar pattern to the rsf and was negatively correlated with the residual turbidity an optimisation model was developed using response surface methodology and the effects of two independent variables i e raw turbidity and alum dose on p values were investigated the model achieved a high correlation r2 of 98 p value 0 05 and was validated using waters with different turbidity levels it predicted the alum dose within 8 error the results indicate that the fi can be used as an alternative parameter for optimising the coagulation process graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords drinking water treatment photometric dispersion analyser turbidity coagulation optimisation floc characteristics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction floodplain runoff during heavy rainfall events can cause rapid and extreme variations in surface water quality and sediment load 1 2 this poses a challenge for drinking water supply as the frequency and severity of extreme water quality events caused by droughts and catastrophic rains are forecast to increase 3 4 technologies used for drinking water treatment include conventional treatment coagulation flocculation sedimentation filtration ion exchange resins advanced oxidation processes and membrane filtration 5 7 of these the conventional process is reported to be the most cost effective and efficient process and is widely used for surface water treatment 1 8 9 during extreme weather events high raw water turbidity affects the drinking water treatment process e g by increasing the required coagulant dose and increasing filter head loss 10 during such events rapid variation in water quality may result in plant operators who use conventional methods to determine the appropriate coagulant dose inadvertently over dosing or under dosing the coagulant 11 over dosing increases the cost of the treatment process 12 13 while under dosing can negatively impact drinking water quality as poor floc characteristics may lead to numerous operating issues such as decreased sedimentation and filtration efficiency 12 14 adapting a responsive optimisation approach to manage rapid changes in raw water quality can help maintain safe water quality production 15 16 the current methods used for optimising the coagulation process for drinking water treatment include i jar tests conventional method ii feedforward control models using raw water quality and iii the application of feedback control strategy to adjust the targeted coagulant dose by using treated water quality as a control parameter or by monitoring the coagulation process using streaming current 14 17 the jar test is widely used in the water industry but it is a time consuming technique this prevents its application for detecting and responding to rapid changes in surface water quality 17 18 feedback control strategies using treated water quality decrease in effectiveness during rapid change events and streaming current detectors also reportedly have limitations when water quality varies rapidly 17 optimal coagulant dose can be predicted using models but these are currently based on removal efficiency and do not consider floc properties that may affect settling and filtration performance 19 20 it is likely that an optimisation technique that accounts for floc characteristics may better predict the coagulant dose required to achieve a desired particle removal efficiency and could be used to optimise particle removal in dynamic water treatment events the photometric dispersion analyser pda a light scattering technique developed by gregory and nelson 21 has been used in many research studies for monitoring floc characteristics growth breakages and regrowth in the coagulation process 22 25 the flocculation index fi is the output signal of the pda it can be used to determine a range of other parameters and it also provides an indirect measure of floc character during the flocculation process 26 rossi et al 27 employed the pda to evaluate how well the coagulation process removed turbidity and observed a strong correlation between turbidity removal efficiency and fi parameters they also reported that using the pda significantly reduced the time needed to determine the optimum coagulant dose when compared to the conventional jar test 27 staaks et al 28 used the pda to monitor the coagulation process for natural organic matter nom removal and found the fi measured by the pda was useful for assessing and understanding the coagulation process 28 another study conducted by cruz et al 29 used fi measured by continuous flocculation monitoring equipment cfme an analyser similar to the pda to evaluate floc aggregation in water undergoing treatment to remove colour and turbidity they also reported that the fi is a useful parameter for monitoring the coagulation process and can be applied to optimise treatment conditions staaks et al 28 and ramphal and sibiya 30 also reported that the pda was a promising tool for online monitoring of coagulation 28 despite many studies investigating its use for floc monitoring 22 24 28 30 to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of research using the fi from the pda to optimise the coagulation process or to predict the optimum coagulant dose this study used floc characteristics indicated by fi parameters to optimise the coagulation process for turbidity removal and particle separation while avoiding negative impacts on sedimentation and filtration efficiencies several fi parameters determined from the fi curve obtained by the pda were used to monitor floc characteristics during jar tests with relatively low dissolved organic carbon doc river water of varying turbidity an initial experiment identified a key fi parameter that could potentially be used to optimise the coagulation process for turbidity removal with improved floc characteristics for settling response surface methodology rsm was then used to develop a model using this fi parameter to predict the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal with faster floc settling the experimental design included a variety of raw waters with relatively low organic content and varying turbidity levels for model validation and the results were compared with wtc coag software 31 33 a model for coagulant dose prediction which uses raw water quality characteristics i e uv absorbance turbidity and colour as inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water source the river murray is the primary source of water supply for south australia it is part of australia s largest river basin the murray darling basin mdb which contains over 80 of the land used for agricultural production in australia 8 34 raw water from the river murray s1 was selected for this study as it generally has low organic content but also has a history of high variability during extreme water quality events 8 35 s1 was collected from the inlet to the summit storage drinking water treatment plant a pipeline from the river murray supplies the summit storage reservoir and this raw water is then pumped to summit storage water treatment plant wtp other surface waters were collected from the river murray at the inlet to tailem bend wtp s2 s3 and from the torrens river s5 the raw water sampling locations are shown in table 2 raw water samples were transported directly to the laboratory within 2 h at ambient temperature and stored at 4 c until analysed in addition synthetic raw water with high turbidity s4 120 ntu was prepared by dispersion of 10 g of kaolin powder kaolin light lr chem supply in 1 l of raw water collected from tailem bend wtp the suspension was stirred slowly for 5 h followed by 24 h of settling then the supernatant was collected and diluted to prepare synthetic water s4 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 floc monitoring a photometric dispersion analyser pda 3000 rank brothers uk was used to monitor floc characteristics during the treatment process as shown in fig 1 a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 25 ml min was used to pump the water through the pda cell in a transparent tube with 3 mm inner diameter to avoid floc breakage the peristaltic pump was connected downstream of the pda three fi parameters i e initial floc aggregation ifa plateau p and variance var were determined from the fi curve fig 2 obtained from the pda as per staaks et al 28 the ifa was calculated from the gradient of the first minute during rapid mixing to indicate the floc growth rate while p indicated the average floc size at the end of the flocculation and was calculated by the average fi values during the last minute of slow mixing 28 36 var indicates the floc size distribution and was determined from the variance of the fi data during the last minute of slow mixing the relative settling factor rsf was calculated using eq 1 and was used to indicate floc settling performance as flocs with higher rsf have faster settling rates 28 36 1 rsf p is p where is is the initial settling and is taken as the minimum value of the fi curve during the first 7 5 min of settling 2 2 2 experimental setup a jar test using a 2 l gator jar and a flat paddle impeller with a diameter of 7 5 cm was used to simulate the water treatment process liquid aluminium sulphate 8 as al2o3 used by the local wtps was mixed with ultrapure water to prepare an alum stock solution with a concentration of 20 000 mg l as al2 so4 3 18h2o this was used as the coagulant and the desired dose was added during rapid mixing at a speed of 220 rpm after 1 min of coagulant addition the mixing speed was reduced to 25 rpm for a further 14 min after this slow mixing water samples were left for 15 min without mixing to allow settling the settled water was then filtered through a paper filter with pore size 11 Î¼m whatman no 1 all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 2 c fig 3 summarizes the experimental work conducted for this study a four step experimental design was used to develop a coagulation optimisation model based on floc characteristics step 1 was conducted to understand the floc characteristics during the treatment process and to identify a key fi parameter that could be used to develop the treatment optimisation model five water samples s1 s5 were used as raw water for this set of experiments and the wtc coag software 33 was used to select five coagulant dosages between 20 and 150 of the alum dose identified by wtc coag software the optimum alum dose was identified as the point where the residual filtered turbidity curve levelled off at a value 1 ntu as this is compatible with the maximum turbidity guideline value for drinking water quality 37 the optimum dose required for better floc settling was identified from the rsf curve selecting the value above which no further improvement occurred with increasing alum dose the three fi parameters i e ifa p and var were then correlated with the optimum doses for turbidity removal and better floc settling to identify the key parameter for the optimisation process step 2 was conducted to develop a model using the key fi parameter obtained from step 1 to optimise the treatment process synthetic water samples were prepared for this set of experiments using s1 with different turbidity levels both higher and lower than the original turbidity of s1 range 30 160 ntu s1 filtered through 11 Î¼m paper filter whatman no 1 was used to dilute the raw s1 water to achieve lower turbidity levels while collected filtered materials from the same source i e s1 was added to the raw water to achieve high turbidity waters the 1st derivative of the regression model was then calibrated using the optimum dose for s1 obtained from step 1 to determine the set point required for the optimum dose prediction step 3 step 4 used the jar testing data for the four other raw waters s2 s5 to validate the model these other waters have relatively low organic levels and varying turbidity for validation the optimum doses for turbidity removal and better floc settling determined for each raw water sample in step 1 were compared with the predicted alum dose in addition alum doses identified by the wtc coag software for turbidity removal were used for comparison with the model 2 3 water quality analyses a 2100n turbidimeter hach australia was used to measure turbidity in the raw and treated waters and sample ph was measured using a wtw inolab multi 9630 ids water samples filtered through 0 45 Î¼m pre rinsed sterile membranes were used to measure the organics content i e doc uv absorbance and colour in raw and treated waters doc concentration was determined using a total organic carbon toc analyser model 900 sievers instruments uv absorbance at wavelength 254 nm uv254nm was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 120 miostech instruments using a quartz cuvette with 1 cm pathlength the colour was measured at wavelength 456 nm in hazen units hu using a glass cuvette with 5 cm pathlength and a platinum cobalt standard 50 hu was used for calibration according to the method of bennett and drikas 38 2 4 model development response surface methodology rsm was used to model the effect of two independent variables raw water turbidity x1 and coagulant dose x2 on the key fi parameter response y a set of 13 experiments was conducted using a central composite design ccd method the ccd was employed as it is reported to be a suitable design method to obtain appropriate data for lack of fit testing using a small number of experiments 39 40 the x1 values selected for modelling ranged from 30 to 160 ntu these were chosen on the basis of turbidity levels recorded in the river murray in south australia during previous extreme water quality events 11 for x2 values ranging from 20 to 120 mg l as al2 so4 3 18h2o were used the experimental levels of the independent variables including real and coded values are presented in table 1 and the experimental design matrix is listed in table s 1 the experimental results were modelled using a quadratic equation eq 2 2 y b 0 i 1 k b i x i i 1 k b ii x i 2 i j k b ij x i x j É› where y is the response fi parameter x i and x j are the intended independent variables b 0 is the intercept b i is the linear effect b ii is the quadratic effect of the model b ij is the interaction effect and É› is the random error minitab 18 software was used for regression statistical analysis and graphical analysis the relative standard error rse between real and predicted values was calculated using eq 3 to indicate the criteria for reliability evaluation of the model as the average rse was recommended to be 10 39 3 rse i 1 i n y exp y pre y exp 100 n where y exp is the value from the experiment y pre is the model response and n is the number of experimental results the analysis of variance anova was checked by fisher s test f test to find the significant terms of the model the quality of fit for the model was checked by the coefficient of determination r2 adjusted r2 r2 adj and coefficient of variation cv then the regression equation was used in a logic model to obtain the optimum dose for turbidity removal 3 results and discussion in this study various natural and synthetic waters with different water quality were used the water quality parameters for all water samples were measured and are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 the water samples were characterised by different turbidity levels from 6 to 120 ntu and low organic level doc 5 mg l s1 was used for the model development and was found to have high turbidity 95 ntu and relatively low organic contents uv245nm 0 11 cm and doc 3 6 mg l additional water samples s2 s5 with turbidity levels ranging from 6 to 120 ntu and low doc level 5 mg l were used for the model validation s1 s4 were used for model validation within the turbidity range used to develop the model 30 160 ntu while s5 6 ntu was used to test the model response for the turbidity level lower than 30 ntu 3 1 the fi parameters and turbidity removal the residual turbidity was measured for the treated water and the p and ifa were determined at various alum doses and presented in fig 4a var and rsf values were also calculated and presented in fig 4b as shown in fig 4a the residual turbidity decreased significantly from 18 to 0 5 ntu with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively but the curve showed no significant change when alum doses 50 mg l were used the rsf increased from 0 37 to 0 80 with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively at high alum doses i e 50 mg l the rsf increased to 0 93 at alum dose 70 mg l with no significant change with the further increase in alum dose fig 4b the results showed that the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal was 50 mg l however at least 60 mg l alum dose was required to improve floc settling the ifa and var values followed a similar pattern with increasing alum dose fig 4a and b a significant increase from 12 to 112 for ifa fig 4a and from 253 to 1029 for var fig 4b occurred with the increase in alum dose from 20 mg l to 50 mg l respectively despite no change in the turbidity level at alum doses higher than 50 mg l the ifa and var still increased with the increase in alum dose to reach around 274 and 2772 respectively at alum dose 120 mg l fig 4a and b p was observed to follow the same trend as rsf increasing significantly from 81 to 305 with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively fig 4a at alum doses higher than 50 mg l p still increased with the increase in alum dose until reaching a peak of 381 at 70 mg l of added alum above which the further increase in alum dose resulted in a slight decrease in p value to 345 at alum dose 120 mg l fig 4a the results revealed that the optimum alum dose obtained from rsf for better floc settleability was higher than that required for the best turbidity removal this is consistent with the findings reported by jiao et al 26 the ifa and var results indicated that the increase in alum dose resulted in a faster growth rate of the flocs and a wider range of floc size distribution even at doses higher than the optimum dose 36 41 importantly the optimum dose required to obtain higher rsf closely coincided with the results of p this was mainly attributed to the relatively large size of the flocs that have a higher p resulting in heavier flocs that can be settled easier and consequently higher rsf value 26 28 additional jar tests were conducted using water samples s2 s3 s4 and s5 to confirm that p was the best fi parameter to be used for the model development the effects of the coagulant dose variation on the residual turbidity in the treated water and on the p and rsf values were determined for each water sample and are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 p has a similar figure with the rsf curve for all water samples which confirm that the p value can be used to indicate the optimum coagulant dose required for better floc settling which is similar to the finding from the jar test conducted using s1 in addition alum doses required for turbidity removal were determined for each water sample and were found to be 35 20 50 15 mg l for s2 fig 5a s3 fig 5b s4 fig 5c and s5 fig 5d respectively the optimum doses required for better floc settling determined from the rsf curve fig 5 for each water sample were 50 35 60 and 20 mg l for s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively these results revealed that the alum doses required for better floc settling were greater than those required for turbidity removal for all water samples with low organic content by around 38 on average based on the above results p was selected as the key fi parameter to be investigated for further optimising the coagulation process by taking into consideration floc characteristics 3 2 response surface methodology rsm modelling of the coagulation process the full quadratic model eq 4 was obtained by applying regression analysis to the results from 13 experiments to express the relationship between the response p and the independent variables 4 y 3 57 x 1 7 87 x 2 0 01636 x 1 2 0 06224 x 2 2 0 0377 x 1 x 2 311 where y is the model response p x 1 is the initial water turbidity ntu and x 2 is the alum dose mg l table s 1 represents the experimental data for the actual and predicted plateau and the rse between them for each experiment the interaction between the p obtained from the experiments and the values from the model response is shown in fig 6 the actual and predicted values were aligned along the line of equality with r2 around 98 fig 6 indicating a high agreement between the actual and modelled values 42 43 the rse was 10 for all the experiments with an average value of 4 4 table s 1 indicating good accuracy of the model 39 44 an anova of the regression model is shown in table s 2 and was used to examine the significance of the terms the corresponding r2 was determined in addition to r2 adj and the coefficient of variation cv and presented in table s 2 to check the model adequacy the results showed good agreement between the model response and the experimental data with a high r2 of 98 4 table s 2 45 46 moreover the high value of r2 adj 97 3 confirms the significance of the model 47 the results also showed a cv of 7 table s 2 representing good precision and reliability of the experiments a cv 10 is desirable 46 48 the significance of the quadratic model for the experimental data was also confirmed by the relatively high f value 87 and low p value 0 0001 table s 2 furthermore the lack of fit term was insignificant with p value 0 05 table s 2 indicating the significance of the model to be used in the dependent variable p prediction 43 46 the turbidity x1 alum dose x2 and x1 2 were found to have a significant influence on the model response p with p values 0 0001 table s 2 in addition the p values for x2 2 and x1 x2 were 0 008 and 0 034 p value 0 05 respectively indicating that they were significant at a 95 confidence level 42 45 3 2 1 effect of significant factors and their interactions the surface plot fig 7a and the two dimensional contour fig 7b illustrate the interaction between the two independent variables of raw water turbidity x1 and alum dose x2 and their effect on the model response p at low initial turbidity i e 100 ntu and low alum doses i e less than the optimum dose the p values were found to increase with the increase in alum dose x2 fig 7a and b whereas at low initial turbidity with high alum doses i e more than the optimum dose no further improvement occurred in the p values and the increase in alum dose x2 resulted in a lower value of p fig 7a and b at high initial turbidity i e 100 ntu the p values increased with the increase in alum dose at low alum doses i e less than the optimum dose and showed no significant change with the increase in alum dose more than the optimum dose fig 7a and b the effect of the turbidity x1 on the model response p was similar for all alum dose levels showing an increase in p with the increase in initial turbidity x1 as shown in fig 7a and b the increase in the model response p with the increase in alum dose was attributed to the increase in positively charged al species neutralizing the negatively charged particles as the destabilized particles then aggregate and form larger flocs 49 50 the reduction in the model response at high alum dosages for waters with low turbidity was presumably cause by floc breakage due to charge reversal and dispersion 45 51 no reduction was noticed for waters with high turbidity levels as the concentration of the suspended particles was adequate to produce larger flocs as the alum dose increased across the dose range used in this study 51 52 the increase in the p value with the increase in turbidity was found to be compatible with ho and newcombe 52 study which found that flocs formed under conditions of high turbidity were larger than those formed during low turbidity this can be explained by the increase in turbidity increasing the number of particles that can act as floc condensation nuclei 10 53 54 3 3 optimisation of the coagulation process using the fi parameter the set point for the optimum alum dose selection using the developed rsm model was identified in this stage the 1st derivative of eq 4 was employed for this purpose after being calibrated using the optimum dose for s1 determined in step 1 to achieve turbidity removal with good floc settling i e high rsf the optimum dose was found when the 1st derivative was between 4 and 5 so a set point was selected for the optimisation model to give a rate of increase 4 5 the flow chart of the optimisation model is illustrated in fig 8 using the raw water turbidity as the model input parameter and the optimum alum dose to the nearest 5 mg l as the model output 3 3 1 model validation to validate the model step 4 alum doses giving better turbidity removal and floc settling for s2 s3 s4 and s5 during jar testing were compared with the predicted dose obtained from the model in addition the alum doses predicted using the wtc coag software were used for a comparative study with the new model fig 9 presents the alum doses determined from the jar testing for turbidity removal and for better floc settling the predicted doses using the model and the wtc coag software and the initial turbidity for various water samples as shown in fig 9 the wtc coag software was observed to give an alum dose adequate for turbidity removal but not sufficient to obtain good floc settling in comparison the new model provides an optimum dose more compatible with the dose obtained from the rsf curve which is required for a better floc settleability than the conventional jar test or the wtc coag software fig 9 it was observed that the doses predicted using the model were directly influenced by the raw water turbidity fig 9 moreover the predicted doses were higher than the alum dose required for turbidity removal for all raw waters hence making it safer for water quality the error between the actual and predicted alum dose by the model for each water sample was calculated and it was found to be 10 14 8 and 50 for s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively table s 3 although the error was high for s5 the model predicted the optimum alum dose required for floc properties enhancement for all other water samples with an average rse of 8 revealing a good accuracy of the model 39 the high error value for s5 was mainly attributed to the relatively low raw turbidity of s5 6 ntu which is outside the study range the results revealed that the fi measured by pda may be useful for optimising the coagulation process based on floc characteristics furthermore the model shows promise for predicting the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal with high rsf during events with rapid surface water quality variation achieving a high rsf value not only indicates better floc settling 28 36 jiao et al 26 reported that high rsf also resulted in high floc filterability and minimized the filter head loss therefore optimisation of the coagulation process based on the fi could be beneficial for surface water treatment although this lab scale study showed pda to be a promising technique for monitoring treatment performance and optimising coagulant dose pilot scale and full scale research is needed to investigate the feasibility of its field application for in situ floc measurement and to monitor real time process performance in addition more investigations are needed to confirm this using waters of varying quality from additional surface water sources 4 conclusion the optimisation of the coagulation process based on floc characteristics was investigated for turbidity removal using three fi parameters i e ifa p var measured by the pda jar testing of five water samples natural and synthetic water with relatively low organic content i e doc 5 mg l and various turbidity levels were used to identify the key fi parameter for optimising the coagulation process based on the floc characteristics the results showed that the optimum alum dose for floc settling was higher than that required for turbidity removal for all raw waters by at least 20 and p was found to be the key parameter for the optimisation purpose the rsm was employed to develop a quadratic regression model to describe the relationship between two independent variables i e raw water turbidity and coagulant dose and p value used to indicate the floc size rse 4 4 r2 98 4 p value 0 05 the results showed that the calibrated model could be used to predict the optimum alum dose for raw waters that have a relatively low organic content doc 5 mg l and turbidity levels between 30 and 160 ntu with an average error of 8 the predicted dose was not only suitable for improving floc settling but was also higher than the dose required for turbidity removal hence resulting in better treated water quality this study indicated that the fi measured by the pda is a promising optimisation technique for the coagulation process considering the floc characteristics and the model has the potential to be used during times of surface water quality variation however further investigations are required using raw waters collected

removal with improved floc characteristics for settling response surface methodology rsm was then used to develop a model using this fi parameter to predict the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal with faster floc settling the experimental design included a variety of raw waters with relatively low organic content and varying turbidity levels for model validation and the results were compared with wtc coag software 31 33 a model for coagulant dose prediction which uses raw water quality characteristics i e uv absorbance turbidity and colour as inputs 2 materials and methods 2 1 surface water source the river murray is the primary source of water supply for south australia it is part of australia s largest river basin the murray darling basin mdb which contains over 80 of the land used for agricultural production in australia 8 34 raw water from the river murray s1 was selected for this study as it generally has low organic content but also has a history of high variability during extreme water quality events 8 35 s1 was collected from the inlet to the summit storage drinking water treatment plant a pipeline from the river murray supplies the summit storage reservoir and this raw water is then pumped to summit storage water treatment plant wtp other surface waters were collected from the river murray at the inlet to tailem bend wtp s2 s3 and from the torrens river s5 the raw water sampling locations are shown in table 2 raw water samples were transported directly to the laboratory within 2 h at ambient temperature and stored at 4 c until analysed in addition synthetic raw water with high turbidity s4 120 ntu was prepared by dispersion of 10 g of kaolin powder kaolin light lr chem supply in 1 l of raw water collected from tailem bend wtp the suspension was stirred slowly for 5 h followed by 24 h of settling then the supernatant was collected and diluted to prepare synthetic water s4 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 floc monitoring a photometric dispersion analyser pda 3000 rank brothers uk was used to monitor floc characteristics during the treatment process as shown in fig 1 a peristaltic pump with a flow rate of 25 ml min was used to pump the water through the pda cell in a transparent tube with 3 mm inner diameter to avoid floc breakage the peristaltic pump was connected downstream of the pda three fi parameters i e initial floc aggregation ifa plateau p and variance var were determined from the fi curve fig 2 obtained from the pda as per staaks et al 28 the ifa was calculated from the gradient of the first minute during rapid mixing to indicate the floc growth rate while p indicated the average floc size at the end of the flocculation and was calculated by the average fi values during the last minute of slow mixing 28 36 var indicates the floc size distribution and was determined from the variance of the fi data during the last minute of slow mixing the relative settling factor rsf was calculated using eq 1 and was used to indicate floc settling performance as flocs with higher rsf have faster settling rates 28 36 1 rsf p is p where is is the initial settling and is taken as the minimum value of the fi curve during the first 7 5 min of settling 2 2 2 experimental setup a jar test using a 2 l gator jar and a flat paddle impeller with a diameter of 7 5 cm was used to simulate the water treatment process liquid aluminium sulphate 8 as al2o3 used by the local wtps was mixed with ultrapure water to prepare an alum stock solution with a concentration of 20 000 mg l as al2 so4 3 18h2o this was used as the coagulant and the desired dose was added during rapid mixing at a speed of 220 rpm after 1 min of coagulant addition the mixing speed was reduced to 25 rpm for a further 14 min after this slow mixing water samples were left for 15 min without mixing to allow settling the settled water was then filtered through a paper filter with pore size 11 Î¼m whatman no 1 all experiments were performed at room temperature 20 2 c fig 3 summarizes the experimental work conducted for this study a four step experimental design was used to develop a coagulation optimisation model based on floc characteristics step 1 was conducted to understand the floc characteristics during the treatment process and to identify a key fi parameter that could be used to develop the treatment optimisation model five water samples s1 s5 were used as raw water for this set of experiments and the wtc coag software 33 was used to select five coagulant dosages between 20 and 150 of the alum dose identified by wtc coag software the optimum alum dose was identified as the point where the residual filtered turbidity curve levelled off at a value 1 ntu as this is compatible with the maximum turbidity guideline value for drinking water quality 37 the optimum dose required for better floc settling was identified from the rsf curve selecting the value above which no further improvement occurred with increasing alum dose the three fi parameters i e ifa p and var were then correlated with the optimum doses for turbidity removal and better floc settling to identify the key parameter for the optimisation process step 2 was conducted to develop a model using the key fi parameter obtained from step 1 to optimise the treatment process synthetic water samples were prepared for this set of experiments using s1 with different turbidity levels both higher and lower than the original turbidity of s1 range 30 160 ntu s1 filtered through 11 Î¼m paper filter whatman no 1 was used to dilute the raw s1 water to achieve lower turbidity levels while collected filtered materials from the same source i e s1 was added to the raw water to achieve high turbidity waters the 1st derivative of the regression model was then calibrated using the optimum dose for s1 obtained from step 1 to determine the set point required for the optimum dose prediction step 3 step 4 used the jar testing data for the four other raw waters s2 s5 to validate the model these other waters have relatively low organic levels and varying turbidity for validation the optimum doses for turbidity removal and better floc settling determined for each raw water sample in step 1 were compared with the predicted alum dose in addition alum doses identified by the wtc coag software for turbidity removal were used for comparison with the model 2 3 water quality analyses a 2100n turbidimeter hach australia was used to measure turbidity in the raw and treated waters and sample ph was measured using a wtw inolab multi 9630 ids water samples filtered through 0 45 Î¼m pre rinsed sterile membranes were used to measure the organics content i e doc uv absorbance and colour in raw and treated waters doc concentration was determined using a total organic carbon toc analyser model 900 sievers instruments uv absorbance at wavelength 254 nm uv254nm was measured by a uv vis spectrophotometer uv 120 miostech instruments using a quartz cuvette with 1 cm pathlength the colour was measured at wavelength 456 nm in hazen units hu using a glass cuvette with 5 cm pathlength and a platinum cobalt standard 50 hu was used for calibration according to the method of bennett and drikas 38 2 4 model development response surface methodology rsm was used to model the effect of two independent variables raw water turbidity x1 and coagulant dose x2 on the key fi parameter response y a set of 13 experiments was conducted using a central composite design ccd method the ccd was employed as it is reported to be a suitable design method to obtain appropriate data for lack of fit testing using a small number of experiments 39 40 the x1 values selected for modelling ranged from 30 to 160 ntu these were chosen on the basis of turbidity levels recorded in the river murray in south australia during previous extreme water quality events 11 for x2 values ranging from 20 to 120 mg l as al2 so4 3 18h2o were used the experimental levels of the independent variables including real and coded values are presented in table 1 and the experimental design matrix is listed in table s 1 the experimental results were modelled using a quadratic equation eq 2 2 y b 0 i 1 k b i x i i 1 k b ii x i 2 i j k b ij x i x j É› where y is the response fi parameter x i and x j are the intended independent variables b 0 is the intercept b i is the linear effect b ii is the quadratic effect of the model b ij is the interaction effect and É› is the random error minitab 18 software was used for regression statistical analysis and graphical analysis the relative standard error rse between real and predicted values was calculated using eq 3 to indicate the criteria for reliability evaluation of the model as the average rse was recommended to be 10 39 3 rse i 1 i n y exp y pre y exp 100 n where y exp is the value from the experiment y pre is the model response and n is the number of experimental results the analysis of variance anova was checked by fisher s test f test to find the significant terms of the model the quality of fit for the model was checked by the coefficient of determination r2 adjusted r2 r2 adj and coefficient of variation cv then the regression equation was used in a logic model to obtain the optimum dose for turbidity removal 3 results and discussion in this study various natural and synthetic waters with different water quality were used the water quality parameters for all water samples were measured and are presented in table 2 as shown in table 2 the water samples were characterised by different turbidity levels from 6 to 120 ntu and low organic level doc 5 mg l s1 was used for the model development and was found to have high turbidity 95 ntu and relatively low organic contents uv245nm 0 11 cm and doc 3 6 mg l additional water samples s2 s5 with turbidity levels ranging from 6 to 120 ntu and low doc level 5 mg l were used for the model validation s1 s4 were used for model validation within the turbidity range used to develop the model 30 160 ntu while s5 6 ntu was used to test the model response for the turbidity level lower than 30 ntu 3 1 the fi parameters and turbidity removal the residual turbidity was measured for the treated water and the p and ifa were determined at various alum doses and presented in fig 4a var and rsf values were also calculated and presented in fig 4b as shown in fig 4a the residual turbidity decreased significantly from 18 to 0 5 ntu with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively but the curve showed no significant change when alum doses 50 mg l were used the rsf increased from 0 37 to 0 80 with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively at high alum doses i e 50 mg l the rsf increased to 0 93 at alum dose 70 mg l with no significant change with the further increase in alum dose fig 4b the results showed that the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal was 50 mg l however at least 60 mg l alum dose was required to improve floc settling the ifa and var values followed a similar pattern with increasing alum dose fig 4a and b a significant increase from 12 to 112 for ifa fig 4a and from 253 to 1029 for var fig 4b occurred with the increase in alum dose from 20 mg l to 50 mg l respectively despite no change in the turbidity level at alum doses higher than 50 mg l the ifa and var still increased with the increase in alum dose to reach around 274 and 2772 respectively at alum dose 120 mg l fig 4a and b p was observed to follow the same trend as rsf increasing significantly from 81 to 305 with the increase in alum dose from 20 to 50 mg l respectively fig 4a at alum doses higher than 50 mg l p still increased with the increase in alum dose until reaching a peak of 381 at 70 mg l of added alum above which the further increase in alum dose resulted in a slight decrease in p value to 345 at alum dose 120 mg l fig 4a the results revealed that the optimum alum dose obtained from rsf for better floc settleability was higher than that required for the best turbidity removal this is consistent with the findings reported by jiao et al 26 the ifa and var results indicated that the increase in alum dose resulted in a faster growth rate of the flocs and a wider range of floc size distribution even at doses higher than the optimum dose 36 41 importantly the optimum dose required to obtain higher rsf closely coincided with the results of p this was mainly attributed to the relatively large size of the flocs that have a higher p resulting in heavier flocs that can be settled easier and consequently higher rsf value 26 28 additional jar tests were conducted using water samples s2 s3 s4 and s5 to confirm that p was the best fi parameter to be used for the model development the effects of the coagulant dose variation on the residual turbidity in the treated water and on the p and rsf values were determined for each water sample and are presented in fig 5 as shown in fig 5 p has a similar figure with the rsf curve for all water samples which confirm that the p value can be used to indicate the optimum coagulant dose required for better floc settling which is similar to the finding from the jar test conducted using s1 in addition alum doses required for turbidity removal were determined for each water sample and were found to be 35 20 50 15 mg l for s2 fig 5a s3 fig 5b s4 fig 5c and s5 fig 5d respectively the optimum doses required for better floc settling determined from the rsf curve fig 5 for each water sample were 50 35 60 and 20 mg l for s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively these results revealed that the alum doses required for better floc settling were greater than those required for turbidity removal for all water samples with low organic content by around 38 on average based on the above results p was selected as the key fi parameter to be investigated for further optimising the coagulation process by taking into consideration floc characteristics 3 2 response surface methodology rsm modelling of the coagulation process the full quadratic model eq 4 was obtained by applying regression analysis to the results from 13 experiments to express the relationship between the response p and the independent variables 4 y 3 57 x 1 7 87 x 2 0 01636 x 1 2 0 06224 x 2 2 0 0377 x 1 x 2 311 where y is the model response p x 1 is the initial water turbidity ntu and x 2 is the alum dose mg l table s 1 represents the experimental data for the actual and predicted plateau and the rse between them for each experiment the interaction between the p obtained from the experiments and the values from the model response is shown in fig 6 the actual and predicted values were aligned along the line of equality with r2 around 98 fig 6 indicating a high agreement between the actual and modelled values 42 43 the rse was 10 for all the experiments with an average value of 4 4 table s 1 indicating good accuracy of the model 39 44 an anova of the regression model is shown in table s 2 and was used to examine the significance of the terms the corresponding r2 was determined in addition to r2 adj and the coefficient of variation cv and presented in table s 2 to check the model adequacy the results showed good agreement between the model response and the experimental data with a high r2 of 98 4 table s 2 45 46 moreover the high value of r2 adj 97 3 confirms the significance of the model 47 the results also showed a cv of 7 table s 2 representing good precision and reliability of the experiments a cv 10 is desirable 46 48 the significance of the quadratic model for the experimental data was also confirmed by the relatively high f value 87 and low p value 0 0001 table s 2 furthermore the lack of fit term was insignificant with p value 0 05 table s 2 indicating the significance of the model to be used in the dependent variable p prediction 43 46 the turbidity x1 alum dose x2 and x1 2 were found to have a significant influence on the model response p with p values 0 0001 table s 2 in addition the p values for x2 2 and x1 x2 were 0 008 and 0 034 p value 0 05 respectively indicating that they were significant at a 95 confidence level 42 45 3 2 1 effect of significant factors and their interactions the surface plot fig 7a and the two dimensional contour fig 7b illustrate the interaction between the two independent variables of raw water turbidity x1 and alum dose x2 and their effect on the model response p at low initial turbidity i e 100 ntu and low alum doses i e less than the optimum dose the p values were found to increase with the increase in alum dose x2 fig 7a and b whereas at low initial turbidity with high alum doses i e more than the optimum dose no further improvement occurred in the p values and the increase in alum dose x2 resulted in a lower value of p fig 7a and b at high initial turbidity i e 100 ntu the p values increased with the increase in alum dose at low alum doses i e less than the optimum dose and showed no significant change with the increase in alum dose more than the optimum dose fig 7a and b the effect of the turbidity x1 on the model response p was similar for all alum dose levels showing an increase in p with the increase in initial turbidity x1 as shown in fig 7a and b the increase in the model response p with the increase in alum dose was attributed to the increase in positively charged al species neutralizing the negatively charged particles as the destabilized particles then aggregate and form larger flocs 49 50 the reduction in the model response at high alum dosages for waters with low turbidity was presumably cause by floc breakage due to charge reversal and dispersion 45 51 no reduction was noticed for waters with high turbidity levels as the concentration of the suspended particles was adequate to produce larger flocs as the alum dose increased across the dose range used in this study 51 52 the increase in the p value with the increase in turbidity was found to be compatible with ho and newcombe 52 study which found that flocs formed under conditions of high turbidity were larger than those formed during low turbidity this can be explained by the increase in turbidity increasing the number of particles that can act as floc condensation nuclei 10 53 54 3 3 optimisation of the coagulation process using the fi parameter the set point for the optimum alum dose selection using the developed rsm model was identified in this stage the 1st derivative of eq 4 was employed for this purpose after being calibrated using the optimum dose for s1 determined in step 1 to achieve turbidity removal with good floc settling i e high rsf the optimum dose was found when the 1st derivative was between 4 and 5 so a set point was selected for the optimisation model to give a rate of increase 4 5 the flow chart of the optimisation model is illustrated in fig 8 using the raw water turbidity as the model input parameter and the optimum alum dose to the nearest 5 mg l as the model output 3 3 1 model validation to validate the model step 4 alum doses giving better turbidity removal and floc settling for s2 s3 s4 and s5 during jar testing were compared with the predicted dose obtained from the model in addition the alum doses predicted using the wtc coag software were used for a comparative study with the new model fig 9 presents the alum doses determined from the jar testing for turbidity removal and for better floc settling the predicted doses using the model and the wtc coag software and the initial turbidity for various water samples as shown in fig 9 the wtc coag software was observed to give an alum dose adequate for turbidity removal but not sufficient to obtain good floc settling in comparison the new model provides an optimum dose more compatible with the dose obtained from the rsf curve which is required for a better floc settleability than the conventional jar test or the wtc coag software fig 9 it was observed that the doses predicted using the model were directly influenced by the raw water turbidity fig 9 moreover the predicted doses were higher than the alum dose required for turbidity removal for all raw waters hence making it safer for water quality the error between the actual and predicted alum dose by the model for each water sample was calculated and it was found to be 10 14 8 and 50 for s2 s3 s4 and s5 respectively table s 3 although the error was high for s5 the model predicted the optimum alum dose required for floc properties enhancement for all other water samples with an average rse of 8 revealing a good accuracy of the model 39 the high error value for s5 was mainly attributed to the relatively low raw turbidity of s5 6 ntu which is outside the study range the results revealed that the fi measured by pda may be useful for optimising the coagulation process based on floc characteristics furthermore the model shows promise for predicting the optimum alum dose required for turbidity removal with high rsf during events with rapid surface water quality variation achieving a high rsf value not only indicates better floc settling 28 36 jiao et al 26 reported that high rsf also resulted in high floc filterability and minimized the filter head loss therefore optimisation of the coagulation process based on the fi could be beneficial for surface water treatment although this lab scale study showed pda to be a promising technique for monitoring treatment performance and optimising coagulant dose pilot scale and full scale research is needed to investigate the feasibility of its field application for in situ floc measurement and to monitor real time process performance in addition more investigations are needed to confirm this using waters of varying quality from additional surface water sources 4 conclusion the optimisation of the coagulation process based on floc characteristics was investigated for turbidity removal using three fi parameters i e ifa p var measured by the pda jar testing of five water samples natural and synthetic water with relatively low organic content i e doc 5 mg l and various turbidity levels were used to identify the key fi parameter for optimising the coagulation process based on the floc characteristics the results showed that the optimum alum dose for floc settling was higher than that required for turbidity removal for all raw waters by at least 20 and p was found to be the key parameter for the optimisation purpose the rsm was employed to develop a quadratic regression model to describe the relationship between two independent variables i e raw water turbidity and coagulant dose and p value used to indicate the floc size rse 4 4 r2 98 4 p value 0 05 the results showed that the calibrated model could be used to predict the optimum alum dose for raw waters that have a relatively low organic content doc 5 mg l and turbidity levels between 30 and 160 ntu with an average error of 8 the predicted dose was not only suitable for improving floc settling but was also higher than the dose required for turbidity removal hence resulting in better treated water quality this study indicated that the fi measured by the pda is a promising optimisation technique for the coagulation process

12677,novel mo mo2c coal ldh coal layered double hydroxide photocatalysts were fabricated through a hydrothermal route and applied for efficient pms activation and typical pollutants tetracycline tc ciprofloxacin cip methylene blue mb congo red cr and rhodamine b rhb degradation specifically tetracycline removal efficiency of 99 tc 20 mg l with a toc mineralization efficiency of 65 was achieved by the mo mo2c coal ldh pms vis system within 4 min reaction and the obtained reaction rate constant was 5 5 and 41 5 times greater than that of coal ldh pms vis and mo mo2c pms vis system respectively the exceptional performance over this joint system was mainly attributed to the synergism of the moco dual active components and the involved photocatalysis the quenching esr investigations clearly demonstrated that all of the generated species contributed to tc degradation and among them the singlet oxygen showed the greatest impact the toxicity assessment suggested that most of degraded intermediates become more eco friendly to the environment moreover the involved reaction mechanism and degradation pathways of tc were proposed and discussed in detail this work provides a promising strategy for pms activation and environmental purification through an integrated photo chemical catalysis graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mo mo2c coal ldh peroxymonosulfate activation photo chemical catalysis pollutants removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a class of broad spectrum drug tetracycline is widely utilized in the fields of medical care and animal husbandry however the large scale use and discharge of tc leads to the massive accumulation of antibiotic in aquatic medium which ultimately induces catastrophic threats to animals and plants 1 2 for efficient water purification semiconductor driven photocatalysis is regarded as an appealing route and broadly used in environmental protection due to its high efficacy and eco friendliness 3 4 however the limited activity caused by the rapid recombination of photo carriers still restricts its practical applications 5 recently an integrated photocatalysis sulfate based system has been proven to realize an effective charge separation 6 as a good electron acceptor the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms could consume the photo generated electrons which not only stimulates the charge kinetics but also promotes the generation of strong oxidative radical so4 and contributes to a cooperative removal of contaminants 7 bearing these features in mind the construction of integrated photo pms systems would be a promising platform for water remediation with enhanced photocatalytic activity layered double hydroxides ldhs show the advantages of multiple metal components tunable band gap 1 5 3 0 ev and strong redox ability 8 specifically the abundant co ii sites in coal ldh could chemically activate pms to produce oxidative so4 species 9 however the catalytic activity of solo coal ldh is easily inhibited because of the deactivation of co sites and the leaching of metal ions during the catalytic reactions needs further attention 10 to conquer these shortcomings great efforts involving the structural design 11 heterostructure construction 12 and morphology control 13 have been made to date assembly of closely associated heterojunctions among coal ldh and other band matched semiconductors has been taken into account the tactic can promote activity meanwhile close heterojunction contact suppresses the leaching of metal ions according to the literature findings 14 15 both ceo2 coal ldh and coal ldh biobr z scheme heterojunctions exhibited superior performance in photo sulfate based systems mos2 and mo2c have exhibited extraordinary prospects in sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops due to the features of cost effectiveness and high efficiency 16 17 generally the active mo sites with variable valence state is favorable for pms activation generating more radicals for pollutants removal however the utilization of mos2 will cause secondary pollution owing to the formation of h2s in the catalytic reactions 18 in contrast mo2c has the characteristics of robust stability large surface area and pt like electronic structure highly favorable for sr aops the latest study demonstrated that mo2c with mo2 mo4 mo6 redox cycles is beneficial for the rapid activation of pms 19 most importantly benefiting from its extensive light absorption and conductivity mo2c can function as an excellent co catalyst in photocatalysis greatly improving the utilization efficiency of sunlight and photocatalytic performance 20 based on these characters integration of mo2c with coal ldh to form the heterojunction could unite the advantages of individual component and boost overall performance of integrated system in this study mo2c was assembled with sheet like coal ldh through a hydrothermal method to yield mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure subsequently the structural morphological optical and electrochemical features of the prepared heterostructures were investigated by various characterizations the developed heterojunction exhibited exceptional efficiency for photo chemical activation of pms and pollutants removal moreover the underlying reaction mechanism of the joint system together with the toxicity assessment of the degraded tc intermediates was explored in detail 2 experimental 2 1 materials and characterizations all the raw materials and characterizations are provided in the supporting information 2 2 fabrication of mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure preparation of mo mo2c coal ldh heterojunction is schematically illustrated in fig 1 firstly pristine mo2c powder was added in ethanol and sonicated for 3 h to obtain the dispersed mo2c nanoparticles nps subsequently certain amount of mo2c nps 1 5 mmol co no3 2 6h2o 0 5 mmol al no3 3 9h2o and 10 mmol urea were added into ethanol of 40 ml followed by sonication for 1 5 h then the resulting suspension was transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and subjected to a hydrothermal treatment at 120 c for 12 h after that the gray sample was collected washed with deionized water ethanol several times and dried at 60 c overnight to obtain the heterostructure besides some reference samples were synthesized by changing the mass ratio of mo2c to coal ldh being 8 16 24 and 32 and the as prepared samples were denoted as mo co 1 mo co 2 mo co 3 and mo co 4 respectively pure coal ldh without mo2c was also obtained under the identical conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the xrd patterns of mo2c coal ldh and mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructures are depicted in fig 2a notably the characteristic peaks at 2Î¸ 34 4 37 8 39 4 52 1 and 61 5 belong to the 100 002 101 102 and 110 plane of mo2c respectively jcpds 35 0787 while the additional peaks at 40 5 58 6 and 73 7 are ascribed to the 110 200 and 211 planes of mo jcpds 42 1120 for coal ldh all the diffraction peaks at 11 5 23 3 34 5 39 2 and 46 6 match well with those of the standard card jcpds 51 45 corresponding to the 003 006 009 012 and 018 planes of coal ldh 21 after hybridization the peaks corresponding to mo2c and coal ldh can be clearly identified in all of the heterostructures with negligible peak shift indicating that the assembly of mo2c and coal ldh does not affect the crystal structure of each component with increasing mo2c content the characteristic peaks attributable to coal ldh in the composites gradually decrease furthermore the samples were measured by means of ft ir spectroscopy fig 2b the broad bands in the 3600 3000 cm 1 region are assigned to the vibration mode of oh group for coal ldh a weak band at 1633 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the interlayer h2o and the peaks at 1346 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 are ascribed to the co3 2 additionally the weak peaks at 554 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 belong to the alo and coo stretching vibration respectively 22 23 compared to coal ldh the mo mo2c coal ldh composites show similar bands indicating that as prepared heterojunctions largely retain the structure of coal ldh the typical morphology and structure of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 was measured by sem tem and hr tem as depicted in fig 3a the pristine mo2c shows the morphology of nanoparticles and rather uniform particle size distribution coal ldh shows the hexagoal platelet morphology with a radial dimension of ca 1 Î¼m fig 3b the mo co 2 heterojunction exhibits the co presence of mo2c and coal ldh and the mo2c nps are anchored to the surface of flower like coal ldh nanosheets the tem and hr tem images of the resulting heterostruture are shown in fig 3d e the mo2c nps and the sheet like coal ldh co exist in mo co 2 specifically the 110 and 101 interplanar spacing of mo2c 0 15 nm and 0 23 nm respectively can be identified 24 25 whereas the 012 interplanar spacing of coal ldh 0 26 nm can also be figured out coincident with the reported values 26 the elemental mapping results indicate the homogeneous distribution of the constitutional elements mo c co al in the composite therefore the observations confirm the presence of mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure in which mo2c is highly dispersed on the surface of coal ldh sheets as depicted in fig 4 both coal ldh and mo co 2 display obvious iv isotherms with the h3 type hysteresis loops indicative of mesoporous features of the two materials the sbet of mo co 2 62 6 m2 g is 1 5 times bigger than that of coal ldh 41 7 m2 g the increment in sbet is likely due to the unique architecture of coal ldh in mo co 2 when assembling mo2c and coal ldh fig 3c the pore size of mo co 2 and coal ldh is 5 38 nm and 3 28 nm respectively whereas the corresponding pore volume is 0 084 and 0 034 cm3 g respectively clearly the textural properties of coal ldh and mo co 2 become different owing to the assembly of the two constitutes which in turn could have an impact on the final degradation performance 27 the surface properties of moc coal ldh and mo co 2 were examined by xps as depicted in the survey spectra fig s2 the main elements mo c co al associated with mo2c and coal ldh are detected in the mo co 2 composite the al 2p spectrum of coal ldh exhibits a broad peak at 74 1 ev corresponding to the al3 species 28 the al 2p peak of mo co 2 shifts to 73 8 ev the c1s spectrum of mo2c could be fitted with three peaks at 283 3 ev 285 6 ev and 287 5 ev ascribed to the cc co and co species 29 respectively notably the peak position of cc co and co species in mo co 2 shifts toward the higher binding energies the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 peaks of coal ldh appear at 781 2 ev and 797 5 ev while the two satellite peaks appear at 786 4 ev and 802 4 ev corresponding to the high spin co2 species in coal ldh 30 the co 2p peaks of mo co 2 slightly shift as compared to those of coal ldh the mo 3d high resolution spectra fig 5d can be deconvoluted into four components at 230 6 ev 231 3 ev 233 2 ev and 234 6 ev and corresponding to the mo0 mo2 mo4 and mo6 species 31 respectively the binding energies of mo 3d in mo co 2 show a positive shift in terms of the xps results there is an obvious conjunction between mo2c and coal ldh which is beneficial for charge transfer among the two entities the optical properties of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 were determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in fig 6a coal ldh presents an obvious absorption in the visible light region and the absorption edge is at around 656 nm mo2c exhibits a strong absorption band in the 300 800 nm range obviously the light harvesting ability of mo co 2 is significantly boosted after assembly of mo2c and coal ldh indicating the dominant contribution of mo2c in improving the photo absorption of the composite 32 the band gaps of mo2c and coal ldh are calculated using the following equation 2 Î±hv 1 n a hv e g where Î± hv a e g correspond to the absorption coefficient photon energy constant a 1 and band gap respectively and n equals to 1 2 since both mo2c and ldh are direct gap semiconductors 15 33 the corresponding band gap for mo2c and coal ldh is thus estimated to be 1 22 and 2 10 ev respectively the mott schottky m s plots are made to determine the band structure of mo2c and coal ldh as depicted in fig 6c the positive slopes of the curves demonstrate that both mo2c and coal ldh are n type semiconductors the flat band potentials e fb of mo2c and coal ldh are 0 67 and 0 55 v vs ag agcl corresponding to 0 47 and 0 35 ev respectively vs nhe according to the equation of enhe eag agcl 0 197 the conduction band cb of n type semiconductor is usually 0 2 ev negative than efb 34 35 therefore the ecb potentials of mo2c and coal ldh are estimated to be 0 67 and 0 55 ev according to the equation of evb ecb eg the valence band potentials evb can be obtained the detailed band positions of mo2c and coal ldh are displayed in fig 6d and summarized in table s4 the photo generated charge kinetics of the heterostructure was systematically investigated the pl steady spectra of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 are presented in fig 7a both mo2c and coal ldh show the intensive pl emission peaks suggesting a rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs once mo2c and coal ldh are integrated together a significantly reduced peak can be observed over mo co 2 indicating rapider charge kinetics 36 the time resolved pl spectra are recorded to evaluate the separation efficiency of photo generated carriers and the fluorescence decay curves are analyzed in terms of the biexponential mode 3 r t b 1 exp t Ï„ 1 b 2 exp t Ï„ 2 herein Ï„1 Ï„2 and b are the short fluorescence lifetime long fluorescence lifetime and the pre exponential factor respectively the average lifetime Ï„ is calculated by the following equation 4 Ï„ b 1 Ï„ 1 2 b 2 Ï„ 2 2 b 1 Ï„ 1 b 2 Ï„ 2 the corresponding parameters and lifetime profiles of different samples are shown in fig 7b notably the average lifetime of mo co 2 8 614 ns is much longer than that of mo2c 3 766 ns and coal ldh 4 833 ns indicating an prolonged separation of e h pairs in the mo co 2 heterostructure clearly the establishment of mo co 2 heterostructure benefits for carrier kinetics and the presence of mo2c in the heterojunction enhances charge separation due to its outstanding conductivity 37 the electrochemical impedance spectra eis and photocurrent curves pc are also recorded to give additional information about charge generation and transfer process as shown in fig 7c mo2c has a smaller arc radius compared to coal ldh interestingly mo co 2 exhibits the smallest arc radius indicating the lowest transfer impedance in the composite 38 the pc curves verify faster separation rate of photo carriers in the mo co 2 heterojunction and the photocurrent of mo co 2 is much intensive than that of pure mo2c and ldh 3 2 activity evaluation the catalytic activity was evaluated by degrading tc under pms and light conditions notably the visible light or pms alone has little effect on tc removal coal ldh alone already shows a considerable degradation toward tc in the photo pms system and 58 tc is degraded with 4 min irradiation mo2c alone shows a limited activity toward tc degradation over mo mo2c coal ldh heterojunctions however tc degradation can be greatly enhanced in addition the tc degradation efficiency can be obviously affected by the mo2c content in the heterojunctions the resulting mo co 2 exhibits the best degradation performance nearly complete tc degradation can be achieved over mo co 2 pms vis system within 4 min significantly faster than the mo2c pms vis and coal ldh pms vis systems mo co 2 has the highest rate constant 1 0081 min 1 41 5 and 5 5 times higher than that of pure mo2c 0 0243 min 1 and coal ldh 0 1823 min 1 the leaching of co ion in the current catalytic system was also checked and it was found that leaching of co in the mo co 2 pms vis system is very low 0 67 mg l fig s6 meeting the standard regulation limit 1 mg l of the chinese national standard gb 25467 2010 5 meanwhile the leaching level of cobalt in the current system is also found to be lower than that of other ldh based systems 6 8 10 15 the light irradiation could have an effect on the activity and the results are displayed in fig 8c mo2c or coal ldh alone exhibits certain activity for pms activation toward tc elimination without light irradiation but the removal efficiency was found to be only 5 and 40 respectively the mo co 2 heterojunction shows enhanced activity for tc degradation 75 even without light irradiation and the existing mo co dual active components are thought to help pms activation notably the presence of pms together with light irradiation over mo co 2 can further significantly improve tc degradation a synergistic effect involving photocatalysis and pms activation encountered over mo co 2 pms vis highly efficient for tc degradation 39 to evaluate the universality of mo co 2 catalyst different organic pollutants consisting of cip mb cr and rhb were employed for degradation comparison as shown in fig s3 the current mo co 2 pms vis system showed effective removal for these pollutants and the corresponding degradation efficiency toward cip rhb cr and mb is 99 10 min 99 4 min 99 4 min and 99 3 min respectively table s3 summarized performance comparison over mo co 2 heterostructure and other reported systems for tc degradation obviously the current heterostructure has the highest tc removal efficiency and largest rate constant outperforming most of sulfate mediated pms pds oxidation systems 3 3 influence of key experimental factors on tc degradation the effects of catalyst pms concentration on tc elimination were explored obviously the degradation activity of mo co 2 increases significantly as the catalyst amount increases from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l causing tc removal from 85 to 99 in first 2 min the pseudo first order rate constant from 1 0080 min 1 to 2 1740 min 1 however as the catalyst dosage continues to increase from 0 5 g l to 1 0 g l the overall tc removal efficacy increases little although the pseudo first order rate constant still increases from 2 1740 min 1 to 4 6051 min 1 a high catalyst concentration 1 0 g l may cause light scattering or lower efficiency of light absorption whereas the fixed dose of pms 0 2 g l can hinder the corporation between pms and extra amount of catalyst hence an optimal catalyst dosage is 0 5 g l in relation to fig 9b the tc removal efficiency is increased from 85 to 99 when the pms concentration is increased from 0 2 g l to 0 4 g l and the rate constant changes from 1 0080 min 1 to 2 3003 min 1 however further increasing pms concentration from 0 6 g l to 0 8 g l in turn inhibits the degradation efficiency and the corresponding rate constant declines from 1 4581 min 1 to 1 4100 min 1 pms in excess amount may block the active sites or reduce the light absorption while extra pms can function as radical scavenger to react with the active species thus eroding the degradation performance fig 9c shows the influence of medium ph on activity a neutral environment ph 7 is more favorable for the degradation process while highly acidic or basic condition inhibits tc degradation the decrease in activity mainly originates from the quenching effect between the generated radicals in particular so4 oh and h oh leading to the reduction of active species and likewise suppression of tc degradation 39 as indicated in fig s7 the mo co 2 pms vis system could generate stronger epr signal at neutral condition as compared with acidic or basic medium on the other hand recent studies demonstrated that metal hydroxides are not stable under acidic condition and easy to collapse 40 while in a strong alkaline solution co oh 2 could be deposited on the surface of co based material leading to the deactivation of the catalyst 41 it is worth noting that the influence of reaction medium on catalyst performance is rather system specific and dependent and the circumstances including passivation of metals dissociation coefficient of materials oxidants and pollutants are likely happened the interference of different inorganic anions on pollutant removal cannot be ignored as manifested by fig 9d the presence of anions decreases the degradation efficiency of tc and the inhibitory effect follows the order of cl hco3 no3 h2po4 notably addition of cl has the greatest impact on contaminant removal reducing the tc removal efficiency from 99 to 72 both so4 and oh could be quenched by cl generating the cl and cl2 species of lower activity eqs 8 10 moreover cl may react with hso5 to consume pms eq 11 hence decreasing catalyst performance 12 8 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl 9 cl oh oh cl 10 cl cl cl 2 11 cl hso 5 so 4 2 hclo the existence of hco3 also declines the reactivity of mo co 2 pms vis system and the rate constant drops from 1 0080 min 1 to 0 3329 min 1 hco3 could quench so4 oh radicals to form hco3 co3 with low oxidative potential eqs 12 13 moreover excessive hco3 will cause the reaction medium weakly alkaline 3 which may induce a slight negative effect on the tc degradation similar to hco3 the quenching effect between no3 and so4 oh accounts for the declined performance eqs 14 15 12 hco 3 so 4 so 4 2 hco 3 13 hco 3 oh h 2 o co 3 14 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 15 no 3 oh oh no 3 h2po4 displays a minor influence on tc elimination and the overall performance decreases from 99 to 86 after h2po4 was introduced according to the literature findings 42 the ionization of h2po4 causes the reaction medium weakly acidic un conducive to the degradation reaction and a decline in the performance as confirmed in fig 9c the recyclability of the mo co 2 heterostructure coupled with the pms vis system was examined the fresh catalyst was used repeatedly up to six consecutive cycles as displayed in fig 10a an overall decay from 99 to 89 in tc degradation efficiency was observed after six consecutive cycles the mineralization degree of tc with mo co 2 pms vis system was assessed by a toc analyzer fig s4 the toc removal efficiency reaches 65 within 4 min and remains 60 after four cycles the high mineralization efficiency proved that the current system is able to decompose tc into non toxic substances more straightforwardly some actual water bodies including tap water river water rain water were sampled from our surrounding areas and used for degradation experiments as depicted in fig s8 the tc degradation efficiency of the mo co 2 pms vis system slightly decreased when tap water river water and rain water were applied inorganic organic matters of different content coexist in actual water bodies which could deactivate the chemically generated and or light driven active species and thus decrease the final activity such observations are coincident with a previous report 10 besides the xrd pattern of the used sample fig 10b demonstrates the reservation of the original crystal structure of sample however the peak intensity associated with coal ldh slightly decreased likely due to the loss of co species in the degradation process 15 in addition the variation in the oxidation state of mo and co after the cyclic reactions was checked by xps as shown in fig 10c the co existence of co2 and co3 is confirmed and the relative content of co2 decreases from 61 to 48 the co2 could be generated by pms reduction while the emergence of mo2c may promote the transformation of co3 to co2 43 besides the mo 3d spectra of mo co 2 showed four deconvolved peaks belonging to the mo0 mo2 mo4 and mo6 species respectively after reaction the relative content of mo4 and mo6 increases to some extent whereas the proportion of mo2 decreases it is recognized that the pms activation facilitates the generation of molybdenum cations of higher oxidation state 17 in addition the content of mo0 reduces from 24 to 6 8 on one hand a fraction of mo0 could reduce co3 to co2 on the other hand mo0 can react with mo6 to mo4 3 4 mechanism of tc degradation over the mo co 2 pms vis system 3 4 1 identification of active species to identify the predominant active radicals and their contributions to tc degradation the quenching experiment along with esr investigation were conducted as shown in fig 11a when ffa is introduced to scavenge 1o2 the tc removal efficiency is significantly reduced to 32 considering that addition of ffa can consume pms and result in a decreased performance nan3 was then used to quench 1o2 the inhibitory effect of nan3 from 99 to 38 is rather close to that of ffa from 99 to 32 confirming the critical role of 1o2 fig s5 41 tc was degraded after adding meoh to capture so4 oh when oh is scavenged by ipa a decrease from 99 to 80 in degradation performance is observed reflecting an insignificant role of oh and a more important contribution of so4 furthermore introduction of edta 2na and p bq also reduce the tc degradation efficiency to 55 and 70 respectively and the suppression effect of edta 2na is stronger than that of p bq indicating a bigger contribution of h than o2 therefore these results verify the relative importance of 1o2 so4 h o2 and oh radicals 1o2 h so4 o2 oh the esr measurement was conducted to identify the produced active species using dmpo and temp as trapping agents as depicted in fig 11b a weak signal of so4 oh is detected in the mo co 2 pms dark system suggesting that pms is chemically activated by the mo co dual active components in the mo co 2 heterostructure with visible light irradiation the peak intensity of so4 oh increases with increasing illumination time implying the production of more sulfate hydroxyl radicals in the mo co 2 pms vis system besides a series of characteristic peaks attributable to o2 can be observed in fig 11c confirming that o2 is formed in the photocatalytic process the signal of 1o2 is detected under visible light irradiation and the signal intensity increases in the pms vis system verifying a synergistic effect between photocatalysis and pms activation 44 there are three ways to generate the 1o2 non radical species 1 the reactions between o2 and oh oh to form 1o2 eqs 20 21 in section 3 4 3 2 the photo activation of pms by free electrons leads to the formation of 1o2 eqs 18 and 33 in section 3 4 3 and 3 the chemical activation of pms by mo co dual active components generates 1o2 eq 32 33 in section 3 4 3 more 1o2 species are produced through the multiple pathways which dominates the tc degradation 3 4 2 proposed tc degradation pathways and toxicity assessment according to the results of lc ms investigation fig s2 and the literature results previously reported the tc degradation intermediates dtcs were identified and summarized in table s5a the proposed degradation pathways were presented in fig 12 there are two main pathways for catalytic decomposition of target pollutant in route i tc m z 445 is firstly attacked by the oh radical and converted into dtc1 m z 461 via hydroxylation reaction 45 followed by demethylation to form dtc2 m z 433 after the loss of acetamide group dtc2 is transformed to dtc3 m z 388 besides dtc3 could be directly generated through the tc demethylation deamidation under the assailment of active species 1o2 so4 oh 46 47 then the cleavage of nh2 and ring structure produces dtc4 m z 338 for route ii the conversion of tc m z 445 to dtc5 m z 405 is achieved by deamidation reaction due to the attack of 1o2 o2 dtc6 m z 358 is obtained by n methyl group removal 48 afterward dehydroxylation and ring cleavage lead to dtc7 m z 301 deeper oxidation processes involving cc bond cleavage and aromatic ring opening lead to the conversion of dtc7 to dtc8 m z 301 small intermediates dtc9 dtc10 and dtc11 with the m z value of 136 200 and 88 respectively are generated and further decomposed into non toxic products co2 h2o etc with the help of the dominated 1o2 and other species the acute toxicity and developmental toxicity of the involved intermediates were evaluated using toxicity estimation software test 5 1 1 through the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method 49 as illustrated in fig 13a the fathead minnow lc50 value of tc 0 9 mg l was classified as toxic after the degradation all the intermediates exhibited lower toxicity than tc specifically the generated dtc1 dtc2 dtc3 dtc4 dtc5 dtc6 dtc7 and dtc8 are defined as harmful due to their relatively higher lc50 values in the range of 1 0 20 mg l 50 while dtc9 dtc10 dtc11 were classified to be not harmful because the corresponding lc50 values are greater than 50 mg l 51 fig 13b c show the acute toxicity of tc intermediates toward daphnia magna and rats respectively it was found that the toxicity of the most products decreases to different degrees and dtc11 is categorized as not harmful suggesting that the current mo co 2 pms vis system could effectively reduce or eliminate the toxicity of tc in term of fig 13d tc was developmental toxicant whereas most of the intermediates present a reduced developmental toxicity except for dtc7 and dtc8 dtc4 and dtc11 are classified to be developmental non toxicant therefore these toxicity predictions verified that the currently designed mo co 2 pms vis system would effectively alleviate the tc toxicity and the most intermediates are more eco friendly to the environment 3 4 3 the involved reaction mechanism a possible catalytic mechanism of mo mo2c coal ldh heterosturcture coupled with the pms vis system was then proposed and shown in fig 14 notably both mo2c and coal ldh could be separately excited by visible light because of their narrow band gaps for the mo co 2 composite a typical type ii heterojunction was constructed between mo2c and coal ldh in view of the band structure of the two components as a result the photo generated e s on the cb of mo2c easily migrate to that of coal ldh due to the presence of mo bridge while h transfers from the vb of coal ldh to that of mo2c resulting in effective carriers separation the photo induced e on the cb of coal ldh can not only react with adsorbed o2 e0 o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe to produce o2 radicals eq 17 but also initialize the pms activation process eq 21 however the accumulated h on the vb of mo2c cannot oxidize oh to produce oh e0 oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe but will directly decompose tc clearly the oh radicals can be generated through the o2 h2o2 oh route 52 then the reaction between o2 and oh will produce 1o2 eq 20 these assertions are consistent with the results of esr and quenching experiment 16 mo mo 2 c coal ldh hv e h 17 o 2 e o 2 18 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 19 h 2 o 2 e oh oh 20 o 2 oh 1 o 2 oh 21 2 o 2 2 oh 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 22 e hso 5 so 4 oh the mo co dual active components in the heterojunction involved in the chemical pms activation the co ii is able to activate pms eqs 23 along with the generation of co iii 53 the reduction of co iii occurs through pms activation eq 24 while the emergence of mo2c facilitates the transformation of co iii to co ii eqs 25 26 54 55 resulting in cycle between the co iii co ii pair the mo ii and mo iv participate in pms activation yielding mo iv and mo vi respectively eqs 27 28 mo iv and mo vi can turn into mo ii and mo iv upon pms activation eqs 29 30 while mo vi can also react with mo 0 to produce mo iv eq 31 56 hence the circulations among mo 0 mo ii mo iv and mo vi promote pms activation to yield greater amount of so4 so5 according to the xps spectra of the fresh and used mo co 2 fig 11c d the ratios of co ii co iii mo 0 mo ii mo ii mo iv and mo iv mo vi change obviously verifying their functions of the co mo components in pms activation subsequently the formed so4 and so5 species further react with h2o to generate 1o2 eqs 32 33 enhancing the overall tc degradation process eq 34 23 co ii hso 5 so

heterojunction has been constructed via a simple hydrothermal approach for efficient pollutants degradation coupled with the pms vis system nearly 100 tc will be degraded within 4 min over the mo co 2 pms vis system and the corresponding rate constant 1 0081 min 1 is greater than that of the mo2c pms vis 0 0243 min 1 and the coal ldh pms vis 0 1823 min 1 system respectively the quenching experiments together with the esr investigation demonstrate the co existence of multiple active species involved in pollutant removal and further confirm their relevant contributions more importantly the involved catalytic mechanism the tc degradation pathways and the toxicity assessment of the intermediates has been explored the current study provides a facile approach to constructing a highly

12677,novel mo mo2c coal ldh coal layered double hydroxide photocatalysts were fabricated through a hydrothermal route and applied for efficient pms activation and typical pollutants tetracycline tc ciprofloxacin cip methylene blue mb congo red cr and rhodamine b rhb degradation specifically tetracycline removal efficiency of 99 tc 20 mg l with a toc mineralization efficiency of 65 was achieved by the mo mo2c coal ldh pms vis system within 4 min reaction and the obtained reaction rate constant was 5 5 and 41 5 times greater than that of coal ldh pms vis and mo mo2c pms vis system respectively the exceptional performance over this joint system was mainly attributed to the synergism of the moco dual active components and the involved photocatalysis the quenching esr investigations clearly demonstrated that all of the generated species contributed to tc degradation and among them the singlet oxygen showed the greatest impact the toxicity assessment suggested that most of degraded intermediates become more eco friendly to the environment moreover the involved reaction mechanism and degradation pathways of tc were proposed and discussed in detail this work provides a promising strategy for pms activation and environmental purification through an integrated photo chemical catalysis graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mo mo2c coal ldh peroxymonosulfate activation photo chemical catalysis pollutants removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction as a class of broad spectrum drug tetracycline is widely utilized in the fields of medical care and animal husbandry however the large scale use and discharge of tc leads to the massive accumulation of antibiotic in aquatic medium which ultimately induces catastrophic threats to animals and plants 1 2 for efficient water purification semiconductor driven photocatalysis is regarded as an appealing route and broadly used in environmental protection due to its high efficacy and eco friendliness 3 4 however the limited activity caused by the rapid recombination of photo carriers still restricts its practical applications 5 recently an integrated photocatalysis sulfate based system has been proven to realize an effective charge separation 6 as a good electron acceptor the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms could consume the photo generated electrons which not only stimulates the charge kinetics but also promotes the generation of strong oxidative radical so4 and contributes to a cooperative removal of contaminants 7 bearing these features in mind the construction of integrated photo pms systems would be a promising platform for water remediation with enhanced photocatalytic activity layered double hydroxides ldhs show the advantages of multiple metal components tunable band gap 1 5 3 0 ev and strong redox ability 8 specifically the abundant co ii sites in coal ldh could chemically activate pms to produce oxidative so4 species 9 however the catalytic activity of solo coal ldh is easily inhibited because of the deactivation of co sites and the leaching of metal ions during the catalytic reactions needs further attention 10 to conquer these shortcomings great efforts involving the structural design 11 heterostructure construction 12 and morphology control 13 have been made to date assembly of closely associated heterojunctions among coal ldh and other band matched semiconductors has been taken into account the tactic can promote activity meanwhile close heterojunction contact suppresses the leaching of metal ions according to the literature findings 14 15 both ceo2 coal ldh and coal ldh biobr z scheme heterojunctions exhibited superior performance in photo sulfate based systems mos2 and mo2c have exhibited extraordinary prospects in sulfate radical based advanced oxidation processes sr aops due to the features of cost effectiveness and high efficiency 16 17 generally the active mo sites with variable valence state is favorable for pms activation generating more radicals for pollutants removal however the utilization of mos2 will cause secondary pollution owing to the formation of h2s in the catalytic reactions 18 in contrast mo2c has the characteristics of robust stability large surface area and pt like electronic structure highly favorable for sr aops the latest study demonstrated that mo2c with mo2 mo4 mo6 redox cycles is beneficial for the rapid activation of pms 19 most importantly benefiting from its extensive light absorption and conductivity mo2c can function as an excellent co catalyst in photocatalysis greatly improving the utilization efficiency of sunlight and photocatalytic performance 20 based on these characters integration of mo2c with coal ldh to form the heterojunction could unite the advantages of individual component and boost overall performance of integrated system in this study mo2c was assembled with sheet like coal ldh through a hydrothermal method to yield mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure subsequently the structural morphological optical and electrochemical features of the prepared heterostructures were investigated by various characterizations the developed heterojunction exhibited exceptional efficiency for photo chemical activation of pms and pollutants removal moreover the underlying reaction mechanism of the joint system together with the toxicity assessment of the degraded tc intermediates was explored in detail 2 experimental 2 1 materials and characterizations all the raw materials and characterizations are provided in the supporting information 2 2 fabrication of mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure preparation of mo mo2c coal ldh heterojunction is schematically illustrated in fig 1 firstly pristine mo2c powder was added in ethanol and sonicated for 3 h to obtain the dispersed mo2c nanoparticles nps subsequently certain amount of mo2c nps 1 5 mmol co no3 2 6h2o 0 5 mmol al no3 3 9h2o and 10 mmol urea were added into ethanol of 40 ml followed by sonication for 1 5 h then the resulting suspension was transferred into a teflon lined autoclave and subjected to a hydrothermal treatment at 120 c for 12 h after that the gray sample was collected washed with deionized water ethanol several times and dried at 60 c overnight to obtain the heterostructure besides some reference samples were synthesized by changing the mass ratio of mo2c to coal ldh being 8 16 24 and 32 and the as prepared samples were denoted as mo co 1 mo co 2 mo co 3 and mo co 4 respectively pure coal ldh without mo2c was also obtained under the identical conditions 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalyst characterization the xrd patterns of mo2c coal ldh and mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructures are depicted in fig 2a notably the characteristic peaks at 2Î¸ 34 4 37 8 39 4 52 1 and 61 5 belong to the 100 002 101 102 and 110 plane of mo2c respectively jcpds 35 0787 while the additional peaks at 40 5 58 6 and 73 7 are ascribed to the 110 200 and 211 planes of mo jcpds 42 1120 for coal ldh all the diffraction peaks at 11 5 23 3 34 5 39 2 and 46 6 match well with those of the standard card jcpds 51 45 corresponding to the 003 006 009 012 and 018 planes of coal ldh 21 after hybridization the peaks corresponding to mo2c and coal ldh can be clearly identified in all of the heterostructures with negligible peak shift indicating that the assembly of mo2c and coal ldh does not affect the crystal structure of each component with increasing mo2c content the characteristic peaks attributable to coal ldh in the composites gradually decrease furthermore the samples were measured by means of ft ir spectroscopy fig 2b the broad bands in the 3600 3000 cm 1 region are assigned to the vibration mode of oh group for coal ldh a weak band at 1633 cm 1 is due to the stretching vibration of the interlayer h2o and the peaks at 1346 cm 1 and 820 cm 1 are ascribed to the co3 2 additionally the weak peaks at 554 cm 1 and 610 cm 1 belong to the alo and coo stretching vibration respectively 22 23 compared to coal ldh the mo mo2c coal ldh composites show similar bands indicating that as prepared heterojunctions largely retain the structure of coal ldh the typical morphology and structure of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 was measured by sem tem and hr tem as depicted in fig 3a the pristine mo2c shows the morphology of nanoparticles and rather uniform particle size distribution coal ldh shows the hexagoal platelet morphology with a radial dimension of ca 1 Î¼m fig 3b the mo co 2 heterojunction exhibits the co presence of mo2c and coal ldh and the mo2c nps are anchored to the surface of flower like coal ldh nanosheets the tem and hr tem images of the resulting heterostruture are shown in fig 3d e the mo2c nps and the sheet like coal ldh co exist in mo co 2 specifically the 110 and 101 interplanar spacing of mo2c 0 15 nm and 0 23 nm respectively can be identified 24 25 whereas the 012 interplanar spacing of coal ldh 0 26 nm can also be figured out coincident with the reported values 26 the elemental mapping results indicate the homogeneous distribution of the constitutional elements mo c co al in the composite therefore the observations confirm the presence of mo mo2c coal ldh heterostructure in which mo2c is highly dispersed on the surface of coal ldh sheets as depicted in fig 4 both coal ldh and mo co 2 display obvious iv isotherms with the h3 type hysteresis loops indicative of mesoporous features of the two materials the sbet of mo co 2 62 6 m2 g is 1 5 times bigger than that of coal ldh 41 7 m2 g the increment in sbet is likely due to the unique architecture of coal ldh in mo co 2 when assembling mo2c and coal ldh fig 3c the pore size of mo co 2 and coal ldh is 5 38 nm and 3 28 nm respectively whereas the corresponding pore volume is 0 084 and 0 034 cm3 g respectively clearly the textural properties of coal ldh and mo co 2 become different owing to the assembly of the two constitutes which in turn could have an impact on the final degradation performance 27 the surface properties of moc coal ldh and mo co 2 were examined by xps as depicted in the survey spectra fig s2 the main elements mo c co al associated with mo2c and coal ldh are detected in the mo co 2 composite the al 2p spectrum of coal ldh exhibits a broad peak at 74 1 ev corresponding to the al3 species 28 the al 2p peak of mo co 2 shifts to 73 8 ev the c1s spectrum of mo2c could be fitted with three peaks at 283 3 ev 285 6 ev and 287 5 ev ascribed to the cc co and co species 29 respectively notably the peak position of cc co and co species in mo co 2 shifts toward the higher binding energies the co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 peaks of coal ldh appear at 781 2 ev and 797 5 ev while the two satellite peaks appear at 786 4 ev and 802 4 ev corresponding to the high spin co2 species in coal ldh 30 the co 2p peaks of mo co 2 slightly shift as compared to those of coal ldh the mo 3d high resolution spectra fig 5d can be deconvoluted into four components at 230 6 ev 231 3 ev 233 2 ev and 234 6 ev and corresponding to the mo0 mo2 mo4 and mo6 species 31 respectively the binding energies of mo 3d in mo co 2 show a positive shift in terms of the xps results there is an obvious conjunction between mo2c and coal ldh which is beneficial for charge transfer among the two entities the optical properties of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 were determined by uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra as shown in fig 6a coal ldh presents an obvious absorption in the visible light region and the absorption edge is at around 656 nm mo2c exhibits a strong absorption band in the 300 800 nm range obviously the light harvesting ability of mo co 2 is significantly boosted after assembly of mo2c and coal ldh indicating the dominant contribution of mo2c in improving the photo absorption of the composite 32 the band gaps of mo2c and coal ldh are calculated using the following equation 2 Î±hv 1 n a hv e g where Î± hv a e g correspond to the absorption coefficient photon energy constant a 1 and band gap respectively and n equals to 1 2 since both mo2c and ldh are direct gap semiconductors 15 33 the corresponding band gap for mo2c and coal ldh is thus estimated to be 1 22 and 2 10 ev respectively the mott schottky m s plots are made to determine the band structure of mo2c and coal ldh as depicted in fig 6c the positive slopes of the curves demonstrate that both mo2c and coal ldh are n type semiconductors the flat band potentials e fb of mo2c and coal ldh are 0 67 and 0 55 v vs ag agcl corresponding to 0 47 and 0 35 ev respectively vs nhe according to the equation of enhe eag agcl 0 197 the conduction band cb of n type semiconductor is usually 0 2 ev negative than efb 34 35 therefore the ecb potentials of mo2c and coal ldh are estimated to be 0 67 and 0 55 ev according to the equation of evb ecb eg the valence band potentials evb can be obtained the detailed band positions of mo2c and coal ldh are displayed in fig 6d and summarized in table s4 the photo generated charge kinetics of the heterostructure was systematically investigated the pl steady spectra of mo2c coal ldh and mo co 2 are presented in fig 7a both mo2c and coal ldh show the intensive pl emission peaks suggesting a rapid recombination of photo generated electron hole pairs once mo2c and coal ldh are integrated together a significantly reduced peak can be observed over mo co 2 indicating rapider charge kinetics 36 the time resolved pl spectra are recorded to evaluate the separation efficiency of photo generated carriers and the fluorescence decay curves are analyzed in terms of the biexponential mode 3 r t b 1 exp t Ï„ 1 b 2 exp t Ï„ 2 herein Ï„1 Ï„2 and b are the short fluorescence lifetime long fluorescence lifetime and the pre exponential factor respectively the average lifetime Ï„ is calculated by the following equation 4 Ï„ b 1 Ï„ 1 2 b 2 Ï„ 2 2 b 1 Ï„ 1 b 2 Ï„ 2 the corresponding parameters and lifetime profiles of different samples are shown in fig 7b notably the average lifetime of mo co 2 8 614 ns is much longer than that of mo2c 3 766 ns and coal ldh 4 833 ns indicating an prolonged separation of e h pairs in the mo co 2 heterostructure clearly the establishment of mo co 2 heterostructure benefits for carrier kinetics and the presence of mo2c in the heterojunction enhances charge separation due to its outstanding conductivity 37 the electrochemical impedance spectra eis and photocurrent curves pc are also recorded to give additional information about charge generation and transfer process as shown in fig 7c mo2c has a smaller arc radius compared to coal ldh interestingly mo co 2 exhibits the smallest arc radius indicating the lowest transfer impedance in the composite 38 the pc curves verify faster separation rate of photo carriers in the mo co 2 heterojunction and the photocurrent of mo co 2 is much intensive than that of pure mo2c and ldh 3 2 activity evaluation the catalytic activity was evaluated by degrading tc under pms and light conditions notably the visible light or pms alone has little effect on tc removal coal ldh alone already shows a considerable degradation toward tc in the photo pms system and 58 tc is degraded with 4 min irradiation mo2c alone shows a limited activity toward tc degradation over mo mo2c coal ldh heterojunctions however tc degradation can be greatly enhanced in addition the tc degradation efficiency can be obviously affected by the mo2c content in the heterojunctions the resulting mo co 2 exhibits the best degradation performance nearly complete tc degradation can be achieved over mo co 2 pms vis system within 4 min significantly faster than the mo2c pms vis and coal ldh pms vis systems mo co 2 has the highest rate constant 1 0081 min 1 41 5 and 5 5 times higher than that of pure mo2c 0 0243 min 1 and coal ldh 0 1823 min 1 the leaching of co ion in the current catalytic system was also checked and it was found that leaching of co in the mo co 2 pms vis system is very low 0 67 mg l fig s6 meeting the standard regulation limit 1 mg l of the chinese national standard gb 25467 2010 5 meanwhile the leaching level of cobalt in the current system is also found to be lower than that of other ldh based systems 6 8 10 15 the light irradiation could have an effect on the activity and the results are displayed in fig 8c mo2c or coal ldh alone exhibits certain activity for pms activation toward tc elimination without light irradiation but the removal efficiency was found to be only 5 and 40 respectively the mo co 2 heterojunction shows enhanced activity for tc degradation 75 even without light irradiation and the existing mo co dual active components are thought to help pms activation notably the presence of pms together with light irradiation over mo co 2 can further significantly improve tc degradation a synergistic effect involving photocatalysis and pms activation encountered over mo co 2 pms vis highly efficient for tc degradation 39 to evaluate the universality of mo co 2 catalyst different organic pollutants consisting of cip mb cr and rhb were employed for degradation comparison as shown in fig s3 the current mo co 2 pms vis system showed effective removal for these pollutants and the corresponding degradation efficiency toward cip rhb cr and mb is 99 10 min 99 4 min 99 4 min and 99 3 min respectively table s3 summarized performance comparison over mo co 2 heterostructure and other reported systems for tc degradation obviously the current heterostructure has the highest tc removal efficiency and largest rate constant outperforming most of sulfate mediated pms pds oxidation systems 3 3 influence of key experimental factors on tc degradation the effects of catalyst pms concentration on tc elimination were explored obviously the degradation activity of mo co 2 increases significantly as the catalyst amount increases from 0 1 g l to 0 5 g l causing tc removal from 85 to 99 in first 2 min the pseudo first order rate constant from 1 0080 min 1 to 2 1740 min 1 however as the catalyst dosage continues to increase from 0 5 g l to 1 0 g l the overall tc removal efficacy increases little although the pseudo first order rate constant still increases from 2 1740 min 1 to 4 6051 min 1 a high catalyst concentration 1 0 g l may cause light scattering or lower efficiency of light absorption whereas the fixed dose of pms 0 2 g l can hinder the corporation between pms and extra amount of catalyst hence an optimal catalyst dosage is 0 5 g l in relation to fig 9b the tc removal efficiency is increased from 85 to 99 when the pms concentration is increased from 0 2 g l to 0 4 g l and the rate constant changes from 1 0080 min 1 to 2 3003 min 1 however further increasing pms concentration from 0 6 g l to 0 8 g l in turn inhibits the degradation efficiency and the corresponding rate constant declines from 1 4581 min 1 to 1 4100 min 1 pms in excess amount may block the active sites or reduce the light absorption while extra pms can function as radical scavenger to react with the active species thus eroding the degradation performance fig 9c shows the influence of medium ph on activity a neutral environment ph 7 is more favorable for the degradation process while highly acidic or basic condition inhibits tc degradation the decrease in activity mainly originates from the quenching effect between the generated radicals in particular so4 oh and h oh leading to the reduction of active species and likewise suppression of tc degradation 39 as indicated in fig s7 the mo co 2 pms vis system could generate stronger epr signal at neutral condition as compared with acidic or basic medium on the other hand recent studies demonstrated that metal hydroxides are not stable under acidic condition and easy to collapse 40 while in a strong alkaline solution co oh 2 could be deposited on the surface of co based material leading to the deactivation of the catalyst 41 it is worth noting that the influence of reaction medium on catalyst performance is rather system specific and dependent and the circumstances including passivation of metals dissociation coefficient of materials oxidants and pollutants are likely happened the interference of different inorganic anions on pollutant removal cannot be ignored as manifested by fig 9d the presence of anions decreases the degradation efficiency of tc and the inhibitory effect follows the order of cl hco3 no3 h2po4 notably addition of cl has the greatest impact on contaminant removal reducing the tc removal efficiency from 99 to 72 both so4 and oh could be quenched by cl generating the cl and cl2 species of lower activity eqs 8 10 moreover cl may react with hso5 to consume pms eq 11 hence decreasing catalyst performance 12 8 cl so 4 so 4 2 cl 9 cl oh oh cl 10 cl cl cl 2 11 cl hso 5 so 4 2 hclo the existence of hco3 also declines the reactivity of mo co 2 pms vis system and the rate constant drops from 1 0080 min 1 to 0 3329 min 1 hco3 could quench so4 oh radicals to form hco3 co3 with low oxidative potential eqs 12 13 moreover excessive hco3 will cause the reaction medium weakly alkaline 3 which may induce a slight negative effect on the tc degradation similar to hco3 the quenching effect between no3 and so4 oh accounts for the declined performance eqs 14 15 12 hco 3 so 4 so 4 2 hco 3 13 hco 3 oh h 2 o co 3 14 no 3 so 4 so 4 2 no 3 15 no 3 oh oh no 3 h2po4 displays a minor influence on tc elimination and the overall performance decreases from 99 to 86 after h2po4 was introduced according to the literature findings 42 the ionization of h2po4 causes the reaction medium weakly acidic un conducive to the degradation reaction and a decline in the performance as confirmed in fig 9c the recyclability of the mo co 2 heterostructure coupled with the pms vis system was examined the fresh catalyst was used repeatedly up to six consecutive cycles as displayed in fig 10a an overall decay from 99 to 89 in tc degradation efficiency was observed after six consecutive cycles the mineralization degree of tc with mo co 2 pms vis system was assessed by a toc analyzer fig s4 the toc removal efficiency reaches 65 within 4 min and remains 60 after four cycles the high mineralization efficiency proved that the current system is able to decompose tc into non toxic substances more straightforwardly some actual water bodies including tap water river water rain water were sampled from our surrounding areas and used for degradation experiments as depicted in fig s8 the tc degradation efficiency of the mo co 2 pms vis system slightly decreased when tap water river water and rain water were applied inorganic organic matters of different content coexist in actual water bodies which could deactivate the chemically generated and or light driven active species and thus decrease the final activity such observations are coincident with a previous report 10 besides the xrd pattern of the used sample fig 10b demonstrates the reservation of the original crystal structure of sample however the peak intensity associated with coal ldh slightly decreased likely due to the loss of co species in the degradation process 15 in addition the variation in the oxidation state of mo and co after the cyclic reactions was checked by xps as shown in fig 10c the co existence of co2 and co3 is confirmed and the relative content of co2 decreases from 61 to 48 the co2 could be generated by pms reduction while the emergence of mo2c may promote the transformation of co3 to co2 43 besides the mo 3d spectra of mo co 2 showed four deconvolved peaks belonging to the mo0 mo2 mo4 and mo6 species respectively after reaction the relative content of mo4 and mo6 increases to some extent whereas the proportion of mo2 decreases it is recognized that the pms activation facilitates the generation of molybdenum cations of higher oxidation state 17 in addition the content of mo0 reduces from 24 to 6 8 on one hand a fraction of mo0 could reduce co3 to co2 on the other hand mo0 can react with mo6 to mo4 3 4 mechanism of tc degradation over the mo co 2 pms vis system 3 4 1 identification of active species to identify the predominant active radicals and their contributions to tc degradation the quenching experiment along with esr investigation were conducted as shown in fig 11a when ffa is introduced to scavenge 1o2 the tc removal efficiency is significantly reduced to 32 considering that addition of ffa can consume pms and result in a decreased performance nan3 was then used to quench 1o2 the inhibitory effect of nan3 from 99 to 38 is rather close to that of ffa from 99 to 32 confirming the critical role of 1o2 fig s5 41 tc was degraded after adding meoh to capture so4 oh when oh is scavenged by ipa a decrease from 99 to 80 in degradation performance is observed reflecting an insignificant role of oh and a more important contribution of so4 furthermore introduction of edta 2na and p bq also reduce the tc degradation efficiency to 55 and 70 respectively and the suppression effect of edta 2na is stronger than that of p bq indicating a bigger contribution of h than o2 therefore these results verify the relative importance of 1o2 so4 h o2 and oh radicals 1o2 h so4 o2 oh the esr measurement was conducted to identify the produced active species using dmpo and temp as trapping agents as depicted in fig 11b a weak signal of so4 oh is detected in the mo co 2 pms dark system suggesting that pms is chemically activated by the mo co dual active components in the mo co 2 heterostructure with visible light irradiation the peak intensity of so4 oh increases with increasing illumination time implying the production of more sulfate hydroxyl radicals in the mo co 2 pms vis system besides a series of characteristic peaks attributable to o2 can be observed in fig 11c confirming that o2 is formed in the photocatalytic process the signal of 1o2 is detected under visible light irradiation and the signal intensity increases in the pms vis system verifying a synergistic effect between photocatalysis and pms activation 44 there are three ways to generate the 1o2 non radical species 1 the reactions between o2 and oh oh to form 1o2 eqs 20 21 in section 3 4 3 2 the photo activation of pms by free electrons leads to the formation of 1o2 eqs 18 and 33 in section 3 4 3 and 3 the chemical activation of pms by mo co dual active components generates 1o2 eq 32 33 in section 3 4 3 more 1o2 species are produced through the multiple pathways which dominates the tc degradation 3 4 2 proposed tc degradation pathways and toxicity assessment according to the results of lc ms investigation fig s2 and the literature results previously reported the tc degradation intermediates dtcs were identified and summarized in table s5a the proposed degradation pathways were presented in fig 12 there are two main pathways for catalytic decomposition of target pollutant in route i tc m z 445 is firstly attacked by the oh radical and converted into dtc1 m z 461 via hydroxylation reaction 45 followed by demethylation to form dtc2 m z 433 after the loss of acetamide group dtc2 is transformed to dtc3 m z 388 besides dtc3 could be directly generated through the tc demethylation deamidation under the assailment of active species 1o2 so4 oh 46 47 then the cleavage of nh2 and ring structure produces dtc4 m z 338 for route ii the conversion of tc m z 445 to dtc5 m z 405 is achieved by deamidation reaction due to the attack of 1o2 o2 dtc6 m z 358 is obtained by n methyl group removal 48 afterward dehydroxylation and ring cleavage lead to dtc7 m z 301 deeper oxidation processes involving cc bond cleavage and aromatic ring opening lead to the conversion of dtc7 to dtc8 m z 301 small intermediates dtc9 dtc10 and dtc11 with the m z value of 136 200 and 88 respectively are generated and further decomposed into non toxic products co2 h2o etc with the help of the dominated 1o2 and other species the acute toxicity and developmental toxicity of the involved intermediates were evaluated using toxicity estimation software test 5 1 1 through the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar method 49 as illustrated in fig 13a the fathead minnow lc50 value of tc 0 9 mg l was classified as toxic after the degradation all the intermediates exhibited lower toxicity than tc specifically the generated dtc1 dtc2 dtc3 dtc4 dtc5 dtc6 dtc7 and dtc8 are defined as harmful due to their relatively higher lc50 values in the range of 1 0 20 mg l 50 while dtc9 dtc10 dtc11 were classified to be not harmful because the corresponding lc50 values are greater than 50 mg l 51 fig 13b c show the acute toxicity of tc intermediates toward daphnia magna and rats respectively it was found that the toxicity of the most products decreases to different degrees and dtc11 is categorized as not harmful suggesting that the current mo co 2 pms vis system could effectively reduce or eliminate the toxicity of tc in term of fig 13d tc was developmental toxicant whereas most of the intermediates present a reduced developmental toxicity except for dtc7 and dtc8 dtc4 and dtc11 are classified to be developmental non toxicant therefore these toxicity predictions verified that the currently designed mo co 2 pms vis system would effectively alleviate the tc toxicity and the most intermediates are more eco friendly to the environment 3 4 3 the involved reaction mechanism a possible catalytic mechanism of mo mo2c coal ldh heterosturcture coupled with the pms vis system was then proposed and shown in fig 14 notably both mo2c and coal ldh could be separately excited by visible light because of their narrow band gaps for the mo co 2 composite a typical type ii heterojunction was constructed between mo2c and coal ldh in view of the band structure of the two components as a result the photo generated e s on the cb of mo2c easily migrate to that of coal ldh due to the presence of mo bridge while h transfers from the vb of coal ldh to that of mo2c resulting in effective carriers separation the photo induced e on the cb of coal ldh can not only react with adsorbed o2 e0 o2 o2 0 33 ev vs nhe to produce o2 radicals eq 17 but also initialize the pms activation process eq 21 however the accumulated h on the vb of mo2c cannot oxidize oh to produce oh e0 oh oh 1 99 ev vs nhe but will directly decompose tc clearly the oh radicals can be generated through the o2 h2o2 oh route 52 then the reaction between o2 and oh will produce 1o2 eq 20 these assertions are consistent with the results of esr and quenching experiment 16 mo mo 2 c coal ldh hv e h 17 o 2 e o 2 18 o 2 e 2 h h 2 o 2 19 h 2 o 2 e oh oh 20 o 2 oh 1 o 2 oh 21 2 o 2 2 oh 1 o 2 h 2 o 2 22 e hso 5 so 4 oh the mo co dual active components in the heterojunction involved in the chemical pms activation the co ii is able to activate pms eqs 23 along with the generation of co iii 53 the reduction of co iii occurs through pms activation eq 24 while the emergence of mo2c facilitates the transformation of co iii to co ii eqs 25 26 54 55 resulting in cycle between the co iii co ii pair the mo ii and mo iv participate in pms activation yielding mo iv and mo vi respectively eqs 27 28 mo iv and mo vi can turn into mo ii and mo iv upon pms activation eqs 29 30 while mo vi can also react with mo 0 to produce mo iv eq 31 56 hence the circulations among mo 0 mo ii mo iv and mo vi promote pms activation to yield greater amount of so4 so5 according to the xps spectra of the fresh and used mo co 2 fig 11c d the ratios of co ii co iii mo 0 mo ii mo ii mo iv and mo iv mo vi change obviously verifying their functions of the co mo components in pms activation subsequently the formed so4 and so5 species further react with h2o to generate 1o2 eqs 32 33 enhancing the overall tc degradation process eq 34 23 co ii hso 5 so

heterojunction has been constructed via a simple hydrothermal approach for efficient pollutants degradation coupled with the pms vis system nearly 100 tc will be degraded within 4 min over the mo co 2 pms vis system and the corresponding rate constant 1 0081 min 1 is greater than that of the mo2c pms vis 0 0243 min 1 and the coal ldh pms vis 0 1823 min 1 system respectively the quenching experiments together with the esr investigation demonstrate the co existence of multiple active species involved in pollutant removal and further confirm their relevant contributions more importantly the involved catalytic mechanism the tc degradation pathways and the toxicity assessment of the intermediates has been explored the current study provides a facile approach to constructing a highly

12678,access to clean water is a fundamental problem that has been emphasized by the united nations and world health organization water is one of the vital necessities for humans to stay alive and prevent disease however due to the increasing world population and climate change it is predicted water resources will be stressed and limited due to poor quality various water treatment processes have been developed based on the presence of contaminants in water to solve the urgent issue due to the outstanding ability to meet the demands of commercial applications the newest methods of combining additive manufacturing am and surface functionalization have attracted a lot of attention in recent years with the rapid advancement of this field more advanced flexible and efficient surface functionalization strategies for additively manufactured materials have been discussed the strategy and methods including etching deposition processing surface grafting and biofilm growth are summarized concisely alongside with the surface enhancement property such as antifouling mechanical and chemical stability and other unique features in this work recent advances in functionalized 3d printed materials used in various water research as mesh membrane photocatalyst scaffold and biocarrier are reviewed furthermore the fundamental issue associated with 3d functional materials is assessed along with the proposed process optimization strategies lastly the challenges and future perspectives of functionalized 3d printed materials are discussed to develop a novel and versatile

printing optimization surface functionalization water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing and providing affordable technology for the community to adopt recently there has been a significant advancement in additive manufacturing for water treatment as shown in fig 1 1 a due to its inherent advantages of high printing resolution rapid fabrication process with good control in pore structure and porosity better energy efficiency and excellent mechanical properties for regeneration and reusability of the device additionally the use of surface functionalization by chemical or physical means to enhance the surface properties of 3d printed parts has also recently garnered much attention 1 the combination of 3d printing and surface functionalization has been used on a large scale for industrial applicability to produce structures and components with unique physical and chemical properties one of the promising applications is in the area of environmental and water treatment research currently the number of publications associated to this area is relatively limited but its trend currently rising as shown in fig 1 1 b thus the combination of 3d printing and surface functionalization will not only improve the performance of the technologies but also take a robust approach towards a sustainable environment and better water quality number of reviewed publications in this review paper based on the keywords have been summarized in table 1 1 to date most of the review papers have only reported on the latest advances of polymer based usage of biopolymer and different materials in water remediation 2 4 including the application of 3d printing for membrane separation desalination and water treatment 5 it is noted that a critical discussion has not yet been formally provided on the surface functionalized materials in the water treatment hence this paper presents assessment on optimization strategies used to enhance the existing performance functional materials and evaluate the role of promising surface functionalization methods apart from that criteria and feasible pathway was designed as a guidance for researcher intended to apply surface functionalized 3d printing in water treatment 2 challenges and opportunities of 3d printed functional materials this section provides review associated with 3d printed functional materials for water application based on material properties mechanical strength and stability as well as chemical stability lastly surface wettability i e adhesion surface roughness and hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties were discussed 2 1 material compatibility material structure printing technique and process parameters are all essential factors in determining the final properties of the 3d printed parts 6 equipment manufacturers often do not reveal the material data such as the chemical compositions of the printing materials and only limited mechanical properties are disclosed to protect the company s commercial interests the comparison between the material data needs to be improved and a technical data sheet with engineering control becomes more complicated when different 3d printing techniques are used however some manufacturers provide the material data for printed parts from their 3d printer or bulk testing of the source materials nevertheless all the information is still helpful in understanding the fundamental knowledge of mechanical properties like hardness elastic modulus and tensile strength 7 it is crucial to consider the design material properties compatibility and am system with the desired engineering products as it will hinder the mechanical strength characteristics and functionality for instance agglomeration could occur due to the materials incompatibility increasing the nozzle s viscosity and clogging especially for extruded based am technology such as the fdm to overcome this adding additives such as plasticizers surfactants and or reinforcements i e carbon fibre and filler can reduce the viscosity however the process will become more challenging as it will cause improper adhesion during the printing procedure in contrast spoerk et al 8 proved in their research work that the addition of carbon fibre cf in polypropylene pp printed samples by 10 volume fraction can enhance surface and printing quality good extrudability strong adhesion with the matrix and less agglomeration of materials a similar result was also reported by liao et al 9 that the addition of cf by 10 into polyamide 12 significantly improved tensile and flexure properties without compromising the impact properties based on the research done it can be concluded that the addition of reinforcement i e carbon fibre can solve the issue of viscosity and significantly enhance the mechanical properties of 3d printed parts in water technologies especially in 3d printed membrane fabrication there is an issue between material compatibility printing techniques and desired functions for instance wax is used as a supporting material in the material jetting system and can be printed to produce a porous membrane however due to the smaller gaps between printed pores wax removal is more complicated and complete washing is impossible fee et al 10 has developed a method to remove the wax using warm water and cyclohexane alternatingly for several hours it was found that if the pore size is below 250 Î¼m the successiveness of washing using both solvents will be a challenging task several papers have widely discussed a few methods for removal of wax as supporting materials and numerous patents have been granted for the material development typically mild heating was applied to remove the supporting material 11 levy has proposed and patented another strategy for removing support materials using a thermal reversible gel based on poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam the gel solidified above its gelation temperature and exhibited appropriate toughness to support the model then once the building process was completed the gel cooled below its gel temperature and allowed the gel to flow lastly the gel can be easily rinse with water 12 however the proposed method was not suitable to be applied for membrane fabrication especially for polymer materials that are not stable in high temperature 150 c hence it was suggested to appropriately design the membrane especially if it requires porous and hollow structures to avoid the embedment of unused materials in the pores and matrix as these trapped materials are challenging to clean once the am process is completed 13 in addition using other 3d printing methods like dlp and sla printing could solve the problem because they do not require supporting materials it has also been reported that both printing techniques are more precise and require less fabrication time compared to other am fabrication methods which will be discussed in detail in section 3 1 2 2 mechanical strength mechanical properties are important parameters for 3d printed parts as it indicates their suitability for a particular application strength and stiffness related metrics such as elastic modulus tensile strength fatigue test impact strength yield strength and hardness are the key properties for selecting suitable materials in mechanical applications 14 in a study conducted by bardiya et al 15 the tensile strength of 3d printed pla parts was discovered to be significantly affected by process parameters such as fill density part orientation and layer thickness during fdm printing according to their findings the parameters of 0 3 mm layer height 0 orientation and 80 fill resulted in the highest tensile strength 14 4 mpa while the parameters of 0 2 mm layer height 30 orientation and 80 fill exhibited in the highest flexural strength 40 0 mpa moreover dhinesh et al 16 demonstrated that pure pla has higher tensile strength than pure abs and that specimens with equal concentrations of abs and pla 50 50 had significantly better tensile and flexural properties the sandwich method using pla and abs alternately showed the highest flexural strength indicating that this concept has good mechanical strength compared to a single material the present experimental study suggests that pla and abs are promising materials with good mechanical strength that can fabricate water technologies such as membranes and spacers yanar et al 17 investigated on forward osmosis membrane systems fabrication with different 3d printed spacers yanar et al compared different polymer materials i e abs pla and pp for fabricating 3d printed spacers using polyjet technology based on the mechanical behavior pla was found to have the highest yield strength of 0 433 mpa among all other materials abs exhibits high ultimate strength but small cracks occur due to low yield strain and stress although all materials have the potential to be developed there is very little information available that addresses in detail the properties of am fabrication and materials to determine a superior technique that has good mechanical properties and excellent performance in water application many studies have focused on fabricating membrane module parts such as membrane and spacers the research started with the development of spacers with different shapes such as multilayer spacers with twisted tapes multilayer spacers with standard filaments and modified filaments with twisted plates in all these studies only the effect of changing the shape on performance and efficiency was reported but not on mechanical strength further work is needed to develop current water technologies to meet the industry standard in addition critical mechanical strength studies should be conducted in detail especially for pressure driven processes to date numerous research have been published on enhancing the mechanical properties and stability specifically of 3d printed membranes and spacers for water treatment and desalination but very limited on other water technologies such as 3d printed adsorbents photocatalysts and biocarriers 2 3 mechanical stability many efforts have been directed to produce printed parts with high mechanical strength excellent topography and toughness however the weak mechanical stability is still remained as one of the major issues especially for water application due to the exposure to various challenging environments i e high pressure temperature and extreme ph level this also including mechanical stability for practical applicability as the 3d printed parts need to have cyclic use and can withstand certain pressure in water 18 firstly some polymers used in 3d printing such as photopolymers are not stable in solvent and under extensive heat exposure when soaked in the water the hydrophilic photopolymers may exhibit swelling behavior and undergo morphological changes which affect the structural stability and integrity of the printed parts robinson and berube discovered that after soaking in water for an extended period of time am spacers tend to break 19 the actual cause requires further investigation however it is believed the incompatibility of the polymer with water and instability of the photoinitiator in the resin formulation could be the possible reasons this is because the selection of suitable photoinitiator for particular monomer or oligomer system requires trial and error procedure 20 21 therefore the choice of an appropriate combination of polymer and photoinitiator when using sla dlp technology is crucial to produce stable and versatile 3d printed polymeric materials for water treatment secondly the swelling behavior of the printed materials were affected by film layer thickness ayrilmis et al 22 investigated the swelling behavior of pla wood composites including the different layer thickness it was found that swelling becomes more severe with increasing film thickness due to higher porosity resulting in greater water adsorption excessive swelling deteriorates structural integrity and leads to material deformation this phenomenon is undesirable for the production of membranes and spacers because it leads to more biofouling as this condition is suitable for bacteria to grow in the pores however for the adsorption process especially printed hydrogels swelling behavior is required to achieve excellent adsorption capacity but excessive swelling reduces the mechanical strength of the structure usually a crosslinker such as cacl2 and naoh solution is added or immersed to maintain mechanical stability post treatment such as the application of acrylic varnish can reduce porosity and as a result optimize the stiffness of 3d printed structures soo et al 23 believed that the fundamental problem of mechanical stability does not arise in 3d printing technologies because the layer thickness can be 50 Î¼m lower layer thickness and porosity result in increased material consumption and printing time which leads to increase the cost mechanical stability remains a challenging issue in water applications the currently proposed solution for a more robust model will trade off the performance efficiency favoring better swelling behavior and high porosity 2 4 chemical stability the ability of 3d printed materials to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as acid is critical to avoid leaching into the environment or drinking water supply through adverse reactions selecting materials that can withstand aggressive chemicals is critical before proceeding with the 3d printing process materials used in am systems have typically been tested for the effects of long exposure to organic solvents such as methylene chloride and rated according to their performance 24 there is evidence that certain polymer materials used in 3d printing form leachates and affect the environment and aquatic life when they come into contact with water 23 for example compared to other polymer materials such as pla the abs plastics used in fdm printing can release toxic particles at high melting temperatures which can adversely affect respiratory function and potentially lead to death under prolonged exposure 25 in contrast pla plastics have been reported to be safe as 3d printed materials as they are widely used in tissue engineering e g as a mold for cell growth 26 and as food packaging 27 pla has been classified as a biodegradable polymer that can be a good choice for developing chemically stable 3d printed parts in water applications currently pla is used as a functionalized material in the form of porous structures i e adsorbents freeze dried foam 177 and membranes 29 for the separation of oil and water according to erokhin et al 30 there are only general chemical resistance guide charts for selecting polymer types used in 3d printing to date there is no clear information on the limits of chlorine chemical resistance which leads to degradation and eventual reduction of performance especially in water treatment due to this limitation it was suggested that the chemical stability of 3d printed parts could be achieved while maintaining efficiency through chemical modification 31 32 and surface functionalization 33 for example kim et al 34 fabricated water filtration system using pla via 3d printing technology for arsenic removal in which hydrolysis process take place subsequently iron oxide coating was applied as surface treatment to improve chemical resistance and performance iron oxide is widely used for adsorption and photocatalytic activity due to its excellent chemical stability environmental friendliness ease of production and cost effectiveness 35 many studies have discussed on their performance efficiency in water and wastewater treatment 36 while their role in surface functionalization is still limited which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 2 5 surface wettability surface wettability is a physical parameter that characterizes the liquid droplet adhesion behavior to a surface hydrophobic or superhydrophobic is the key surface property for membrane distillation md systems as it affects the overall achievable separation efficiency the degree of surface wetting was highly dependent on the interfacial tension between the phases in contact surface wettability is influenced by nanofeatures or dual microfeatures as well as the surface s chemical composition water contact angle wca measurement is commonly used to characterize surface wetting based on the physical chemical properties of the phases several numerical models including the wenzel model cassie model and liquid model have been developed in recent years the sliding angle Î¸ can be calculated using the tilting plate method where Î¸max and Î¸min is the wca at the upper and lower edges of the drop at the stability limit respectively although the utilization of 3d printing could assist in the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces by decrease the quantity of steps in the printing process the need for subsequent coatings remains a key problem to address firstly increasing the durability of superhydrophobicity can be accomplished by reducing the surface roughness of the materials from the micron to the submicron level however it comes at the expense of increased printing costs time and the requirement for higher printer resolution particularly along the xy plane this problem can be solved by embedding bulk materials with nanomaterials during 3d printing surface roughness on microscale patterns can be 3d printed instead of spending extra time and money to directly print nanoscale asperities another issue is the limited supply of high precision 3d printer materials these materials generally do not have a low enough surface tension to prevent the coating from filling nanoscale asperities as a result a more advanced 3d printing technique is required to achieve robust anti wetting properties on top of that there is limited research on switchable properties i e between superhydrophobic and superoleophilic which are especially desirable for robust oil water separation using membrane technology most of the studies are still limited to the lab scale and further development is needed for validation of its effectiveness and performance based on the numerical model and recent research by shahrubudin et al 37 producing controllable 3d printed micro features with low cost remained a challenge among researchers and industries surface functionalization is currently a promising method for controlling the wettability of 3d printed structures which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 in summary extensive work is still required to develop novel and more versatile strategies including improving thermo responsive light responsive ph responsive or electrical potential responsive wettability to solve the surface wetting issue for specific applications overall the available literature that discussed the characteristics of 3d printing as well as the implication of printing techniques and material selection for water treatment applications are yet to be reported this is crucial in determining a suitable technique that is superior to develop materials with sufficient mechanical strength and chemical stability for practical application and further post modification treatment performance optimization strategies to address the aforementioned fundamental issues were evaluated in section 3 3 performance optimization strategies the promising potential of 3d printing technology is demonstrated by its ability to construct structures with integration of greater parts and desired geometry the performance and mechanical properties of 3d printed functional materials will vary depending on the printing method and material chosen which will be the fundamental optimization techniques for a variety of applications the performance measurements of 3d printed functional materials as well as optimization techniques are provided and addressed in this section 3 1 3d printing route consideration additive manufacturing system takes a fundamentally different approach to building 3d structures by deposition of material layer by layer in a horizontal cross section as shown in fig 3 1 there are established literatures that have been reported on the development for 3d printing techniques in general and based on materials 38 39 in water treatment it is important to select the suitable material with the right printing technique to produce a structure that can withstand aggressive environmental conditions while maintaining its function 18 there are several controlling parameters that must be met in order for 3d printing to be effective and produce the desired quality of printed parts these controlling parameters can be divided into two categories which are printing and material parameters as summarized in table 3 1 below is a brief description of each 3d printing technique with its advantages limitations and its potential to be explored powder bed fusion pbf powder bed fusion technology uses sintering and melting as a binding mechanism sintering is a process of partial melting while melting is a complete process the procedure involves using a heat source to melt or fuse a layer of spread powder into the desired object the fusion process continues to form the proposed design selective laser melting slm selective laser sintering sls electron beam melting ebm and direct metal laser sintering dmls are all common pbf techniques sls uses powdered plastics metals ceramics and glass whereas slm only uses metals such as alloys and stainless steel for this printing technique it has been found that both plastics and polymers offer pbf great design freedom with complex geometries as they do not require supporting material have very high strength and stiffness and excellent mechanical properties comparable to those of bulk materials the main limitations of pbf are shrinkage and distortion due to internal and surface porosity which make post processing challenging in handling and disposal of the powder 40 in addition the pbf printing process requires large amount of powder to ensure appropriate powder flow and uniformity during printing all published works focus only on in processing performance and post processing printing improvement however in pbf suitable powder flow and powder properties in the pre process play a key role that is often neglected this determination of the pre process requires the suitability of the selected powder for the am process the estimation of its in process behavior and the expected quality of the final product and in a next step the localization of the pre process parameter windows 41 in this way an optimal powder for a broader applications can be produced which has the potential to be explored and attract attention in a wider market for powder manufacturers while pbf manufacturers could offer wide applicability 41 binder jetting bj binder jetting is a process in which powder particles are bonded together by selectively depositing a liquid binder and subsequently produced 3d printed object in this printing technique a roller evenly distributes a layer of powder on a bed after a binder is deposited onto the powder layer the platform is then lowered to form a solid part by spreading another layer of powder typical materials used in this method are metals sand and ceramics the main advantages of this technique are the ease of operation no requirement of support is needed and low cost 42 the main disadvantages of binding jetting are the multi step post processing of the print i e curing and densification the high surface roughness and lower resolution of the printed parts and the fact that post processing strategies still need to be developed for most materials the inability to predict the large amount of distortion that occurs when individual alloys are sintered to full density to achieve the desired final geometry is one of the main drawbacks that limiting the potential of this process it also reduces the overall accuracy of the process when producing parts from a single alloy that are much larger than the size of the metal injection mold mim binding jetting is one of the oldest additive manufacturing processes that is useful for metal and can be further explored it requires extensive work to enhance the properties of binding jetting from raw material to finished product including correlation of densification kinetics with complex geometry powder characteristics morphology and qualification choice of binder compatibility with printing method of deposition interaction between powder and binder burnout and stability properties printing process parameters specification and necessary post processing procedures 43 this technique is currently used in the fabrication of injection moulding using stainless steel powder for industrial application 44 directed energy deposition ded direct energy deposition focuses the energy of a high powered laser on a small area to heat the substrate and melt the printing materials the amount of powders that are melted and the energy source e g laser electron beam arc due to heat input both affect the print resolution of the ded process while the deposition rate is affected by the production speed the advantages of the ded process are the ability to fabricate of complex geometries and deposit functional materials and reduction of material waste the disadvantages of the ded process are distortion porosity and inhomogeneities low quality and accuracy of parts and the need for expensive materials and longer production time to overcome the above challenges a hybrid manufacturing approach has been proposed 45 the traditional process in the am system is to produce printed parts and then require post processing steps the concept of hybridization goes beyond post processing to magnify the advantages and eliminate the disadvantages of each other the synergy between these techniques can lead to more efficient processes and cost savings and should be explored as it also fits well with industry 4 0 guidelines i e increasing manufacturing flexibility quality and customization at scale 45 material jetting mj material jetting or utilized the light curable resin and its printing principle is similar to common paper printing to create the desired design the photopolymer resin is dropped on various substrates layer by layer 46 this process is categorized into three types 1 nanoparticle jetting 2 polyjet and 3 drop on demand mj technique able to fabricate complex shapes with very fast manufacturing process high accuracy 14 Î¼m produce smooth surface and ability to combined different materials as ink formulation the only limitation is high manufacturing cost heat resistance for certain materials is limited and unable to produce functional prototypes material extrusion me material extrusion uses continual pressure to drive the material out of the print head and onto the printing platform once the material has been extruded and solidified the procedure is repeated until the desired output is obtained fused deposition modelling fdm uses this principle of material extrusion this technique is considered to be cost effective mechanically resistant and capable of producing durable components the disadvantages are low to moderate manufacturing accuracy the production of grooves slow manufacturing process and the need for support structures another significant limitation is that the addition of fibers or fillers to improve mechanical properties leads to clogging in the nozzle a physical adaptation to improve the full potential of the fdm technique was proposed by changing the geometry of the nozzle it has been reported that the extrusion nozzle can affect print resolution due to thermal radiation effect as it is the component of the printing system that comes into contact with the filament before it is extruded into the print bed 47 very little experimental work have been reported in the literature about changes to the printer components and their effects on the printing process it has been found that only adapted nozzle allows precise printing and avoids clogging 47 in water application microchannels such as microfluidic chip with a width of 100 Î¼m can be printed with a special nozzle geometry this approach can open up new possibilities to improve the resolution of printed parts for manufacturing microfluidic and other transparent devices for various applications sheet lamination sl laminated object manufacture lom ultrasonic additive manufacturing uam ultrasonic consolidation uc and plastic sheet lamination are the techniques utilized in the sheet lamination process psl the most often used manufacturing processes are ultrasonic additive manufacturing uam and ultrasonic consolidation uc 48 in this process the raw materials are cut through the use of digital guided user and the sheets are stacked layer by layer through bonding via diffusion to form the final product 49 various materials such as ceramics papers polymers and metals can be used in this process this process is integrated as a hybrid manufacturing system which does not require the support structures low operation cost and easy to handle however sheet lamination process causes a lot of wastage compared to other methods poor surface finish before post processing low dimensional accuracy poor bonding between the stacked layers and difficult to fabricate complex geometries 50 vat photopolymerization vp in the vp process photopolymerization of materials such as acrylate resin with high reactivity is used to produce solid parts the mixed photopolymer usually consisting of a polymer and photoinitiator is placed in the vat and sintered with a laser laser is used in stereolithography while light mask projector is used in digital light processing dlp for sintering the laser was exposed over the mixed resin which undergoes a photochemical process that bonds like a chain to cure and form solid material 51 this process produces high resolution and accuracy precise and capable of printing complex geometries and surface quality the printing process is relatively fast and can print large components the only limitation of this process is that the 3d printer is expensive material selection is limited and the post processing time is longer recent studies have shown that photopolymerization has found its place in the production of 3d nanoprinting tomographic printing and 4d printing 52 this is because there is an increasing industrial demand for smart composites and materials that enable better capabilities and safe human interaction in various fields such as robotics healthcare and water application 52 in the field of water treatment a potential pathway for 3d printing has been explored by integrating multiprocessing system e g a hybrid of traditional active layer fabrication and 3d printing to solve the membrane fabrication problem the current challenge is that it is difficult to achieve the desired resolution for printing the entire membrane hybrid fabrication is able to provide on demand fabrication with freedom geometry design and cost effective production this approach has the potential to be explored in the development of novel designs and functionalities the common 3d printing techniques under am technologies are illustrated in fig 3 2 there are various controlling parameters that also play an important role to ensure the effectiveness of 3d printing and desired quality of printed parts these controlling parameters can be divided into two categories which are printing parameters and material parameters as summarized in table 3 1 and 3 2 3 2 printing parameters the process or printing parameters are crucial in ensuring that 3d printing works as intended and that printed parts are of the desired quality the processing parameters must be carefully controlled to fit the printing material properties and the intended am technology process to achieve the printed parts best characteristics there are numerous papers that discussed on process parameters based on the material and 3d printing techniques the following papers have discussed in detailed about the influences of these parameters 39 54 59 for example manoj prabhakar et al 56 did a short review and briefly described process parameters and materials specifically for the fdm method based on their findings all the research works suggested optimizing the printing parameters such as filament diameter extruder temperature feed rate extruder temperature raster angle working material characteristics nozzle angle and separation between parallel faces furthermore patel et al 60 mentioned that the fdm process is complicated because many opposing parameters influence the component quality and material properties to determine optimal parameters the appropriate selection of process parameters determines the quality of the components and the mechanical characteristics of the produced part can be found in this review paper in the context of its application in water treatment 4 have extensively reviewed the influences of a process parameter specifically on polymeric materials 3 3 material consideration most commercial am materials available in the market lack good temperature resistance high mechanical strength and functionalities such as biocompatibility surface wetting electrical and thermal conductivity and shape memory behavior 52 multimaterials in am processes have attracted attention to overcome the limitations that cannot be achieved when using a single material typical printing techniques that can be used to produce functional materials include fdm sla dlp clp and polyjet due to their flexibility in adding and varying material type and composition the two primary design factors during the 3d printing process are the preparation of functional materials and the printing process in order to obtain the desired output and 3d architectures similarly for water treatment application the selection of material for ink formulation based on the two essential factors 1 mechanical stiffness and strength and 2 viscoelastic properties the surface wettability and tension are extremely important surface properties for water treatment because they determine how the surface of printed materials interacts with the environment in addition the rheological properties of the printed material affect the printed result and both surface properties are highly dependent on the viscosity of the ink materials with the lowest to highest flowability include filaments 100 10 000 pa s gels 10 1000 pa s vat monomers 0 1 100 pa s powders and inks 0 1 pa s 61 for powdered materials shear free viscosity was required because particles coalesced when shear flow did not occur during the sintering process the quality of the powder layers in the roller mechanism was influenced by the flowability of dry powder large particles can cause the surface of the layer to be coarse and contain voids while small particles can cause high interparticle frictions due to strong electrostatic attraction the viscoelastic properties of the ink can also be formulated to be suitable for different printing techniques for example a high shear thinning ink is beneficial for extruded printing 62 while a low viscosity ink is preferable for fdm printing because the liquid ink can flow easily through the printing nozzles 53 in addition sufficient mechanical stiffness and strength of the ink is required to support the entire structure during the solidification process after printing and ink deposition therefore it is crucial to prepare and control the ink formulation and its rheological properties to obtain a stable dispersion for the liquid to gel transition as reported by pagac et al 52 the common mechanical strength for photocurable resins are i ultimate tensile strength 23 mpa 65 mpa ii tensile modulus 0 9 gpa 2 8 gpa and iii elongation failure 7 17 while the mechanical performance of hydrogel can reach the elastic modulus 0 1 1 0 mpa tensile stress 1 10 mpa tensile elongation 10 20 times toughness 0 1 10 kj m2 and work of elongation 1 100 mj m3 63 recently functional materials made of bio based materials 2 nanocellulose 64 and polymers 65 have been intensively explored by researchers to develop robust materials for water application 64 which are briefly discussed below 3 3 1 bio based materials 3d printed bio based materials such as chitosan alginate based materials konjac glucomannan and cellulose acetate have gained popularity due to their potential application in the water treatment sector all of these materials have been shown to be highly reusable and provide tailored and scalable meshes membranes filtration system adsorbents and photocatalysts suitable for the removal of common water contaminants like dyes and heavy metals as well as oil water separation based on recent studies the use of additive manufacturing and functionalized materials such as cellulose acetate 66 chitosan 67 alginate 68 and pla 69 as well as other bio based materials offers great potential for more efficient and cost effective removal of water contaminants and represent a sustainable approach for a more environmentally friendly water treatment industry for instance liakos et al 68 used three different am techniques such as 3d pen fdm and growing robot to fabricate polycaprolactone pcl 3d printing composite filaments with varying weight percentages of sodium alginate sa ranging from 5 to 30 it was observed the adsorption capacity is proportional to the concentration of the sa after 30 days of immersion the maximum adsorption capacity for pcl filament containing 30 sa was reported to be around 90 mg g although the results showed that pcl sa filaments up to 15 sa were stable in water but at a higher sa concentration some loss of sa was observed this is because cu ions are crosslinked to sodium alginate as a crosslinking agent the heavy metal accumulation mechanism on these artificial pcl sa composites is very similar to the ion exchange mechanism and chelation found in marine plants and macroalgae this proved that the technology can acted biomimetic by accumulating heavy metals like other marine plant species which pave a way for its application in environment and water remediation however the drawbacks of this approach are the limited use of commercially available bio based resins requirement of post treatment the scalability issue time consuming and costly post treatment after printing effect the mechanical properties without proper tuning and the limitation of the rheological parameters of the printed parts 3d printing and bio based materials manufacturing is a relatively new approach in the water sector but its excellent performance for biomedical applications has been widely reported extensive research is required to meet the standard needs of the industry and has open door for more researchers to venture and explore 3 3 2 nanocellulose three different types of nanocellulose can be categorized as promising materials for advanced functional materials i nanocrystalline cellulose ncc ii cellulose nanofiber cnf or cellulose nanofibrils and iii bacterial cellulose bc or microbial cellulose 64 nanocellulose is commonly used as a reinforcement matrix for various formulations in additive manufacturing to achieve good mechanical strength and toughness however nanocellulose materials do not have sufficient functional properties for advanced applications and need to be modified to realize their full potential surface modifiers natural or synthetic polymers such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or carboxymethyl groups are commonly used to optimize their tailored functionality in the fabrication of functional composite structures nanocellulose is a promising sustainable material that has high adsorption capacity high surface area and high functionality to be used as a technology for heavy metal and organic dye removal and oil separation to date cellulose has been widely used as a composite polymer to strengthen the mechanical properties of 3d printed parts but its use as a water technology such as filtration and membrane system remains largely unexplored 3 3 3 polymer liquid polymer composites by mixing polymer and photoinitiator hydrogels and colloidal gels are the suitable materials of choice for printing complex and functional 3d structures due to their highly tailorable viscoelastic properties under external heat pressure and electromagnetic fields 70 bottom up approaches can be used to develop new polymers with intrinsic properties that are specifically tailored for am processes in order to design and synthesize molecular structures instead of using readily available commercial resin the polymers molecular structure can be designed at the molecular level to adapt the polymers to each of the am processes the optical thermal and rheological properties of the polymer materials can be tailored based on its desired application and functions by tuning their functional group molecular chain structure molecular weight distribution and degree of functionality a few research papers have been reported about the development of am technologies to the selection and consideration of polymeric materials for functional and specific applications in wastewater technology such as membranes and spacers adsorbents capsules catalysts microdevices and microfluidic chip along with limitations and future prospects there is no doubt that the am system is an efficient approach to develop water technologies for arbitrary geometries with excellent resolution and performance however the economic evaluation including the total cost of production for larger industrial applications still require much room for optimization apart from this the existing water technologies are designed for certain types of pollutants therefore further research is needed to ensure that wastewater treatment system development is focused on real wastewater treatments such as competitive adsorption of multiple water pollutants in short it can be concluded nanocellulose materials as a 3d printed water technology has shown potential growth to be explored while biopolymers and polymer based additive manufacturing are two main materials of interest for water applications due to their remarkable flexibility in design novel geometrically complex and lattice structures the printing parameters and control parameters of 3d printed bio based and polymeric functional materials and their implications for am techniques are summarized in tables 3 1 and 3 2 respectively as shown in table 3 2 tan et al 39 summarized the critical material requirements for am techniques they can be divided into chemical optical rheological thermal extrinsic and mechanical properties of all the surface properties listed in the table water or moisture absorption was not considered water absorption indicates the ability of the polymer to absorb moisture water from its environment high absorption has reversible effects on mechanical strength by reducing glass transition temperature and moduli and enlarge fracture strain and impact strength 71 since 3d printed polymeric functional materials will be exposed to water it is critical to consider the water peak and its absorption range which indicates the material stability in water this information is also crucial to see if further modification is required to change the surface property from hydrophilic to hydrophobic 3 4 application of surface functionalization in 3d functional materials several functionalization strategies have been developed to extend the capabilities of 3d printed material for practical applications there are three main strategies as shown in fig 3 3 consisting of developing functional materials bioinspired materials and surface functionalization strategy i focus on the identification and use of suitable high performance materials and nanomaterials to print 3d structures and components there has been many discussion in the literature about the development of additively manufactured functional materials made of ceramics 78 polymers 79 nanocomposites 80 and metals 81 for various applications various researchers have developed various 3d printed materials related to heavy metal removal 68 pharmaceutical waste removal 82 oil water separation 83 fouling reduction 84 water splitting 85 86 desalination 87 and organic matter removal in environmental and water applications 88 89 currently the development of advanced functional materials for 3d printing is quite straightforward but it is tailored to a specific system and requires a time consuming and costly process of trial and error the number of trials can be reduced by using a computational modelling optimization approach in the development phase however process modelling has high computational cost and may require high performance computing furthermore although the process of preparing the feedstock for printing ink is quite simple it must be adapted to the intended am technology which requires knowledge of the surface properties especially in terms of surface wettability and chemistry surface properties plays an important role in the adhesion of particles in the structure through binding or fusion another factor that must be considered in the development of the ink materials is the property that they must have strong and sufficient compaction and cohesion for the am product this is because minor changes in the ink materials have a large impact on the performance of the final printed product to date specific cost considerations for am technology have not been reported however cost has been identified as one of the major factors holding the industry back from adopting am technology machine costs are estimated to be between 50 and 75 of total production costs 20 to 40 of material costs and 5 to 30 of labour costs 90 nevertheless metrology can play an important role in optimizing the am system at low cost by minimizing the use of feedstock materials reducing part scrap and post processing requirements and increasing production yield and energy efficiency thus overall costs are reduced due to the flexibility offered by am technology 91 strategy ii produces bioinspired materials which are 1 lightweight structural materials of high mechanical toughness and strength 2 topological structures which focus on designing bioactivity super wettability and stimuli responsiveness 92 wang et al have reviewed bioinspired materials in terms of functional and structural categories from a wide range of fascinating biological materials detailed representative functions of paradigmatic biological and bioinspired were illustrated the fundamentals for the specific property followed by a discussion of insights into structure property mechanisms from biological materials and their corresponding bioinspired materials that exhibit special functions properties for relevant applications were discussed on the other hand yan et al 93 focused on reviewing recent development in biomimetic 3d printing materials with improved properties mainly on single material bioinspired reinforced structures inspired by creatures and multi materials inspired by the balsa wood structures bioligand structure nacre structures and shape changing structures based on the literature it was also noted that geometrically structured materials based on the number of species found in nature exhibit high performance with excellent mechanical properties such as toughness high stiffness strength and fatigue resistance in contrast functional structures exhibit exciting properties such as super wettability liquid repellence shape changed and memory although 3d printing can be used to design bioinspired materials and structures this approach has numerous challenges and limitations these include anticipating different interfacial materials to fabricate bioinspired structures with multi materials with different properties and functions another challenge is the fabrication of macroscale nanomaterials which has yet to be reported because of the trade off between high resolution fabrication speed and low cost future advancements in multi material fabrication with high efficiency and low cost are expected as well as a guide for fabricating 3d printing technology from nanoscale to macroscale strategy iii is an approach that combines the 3d printing process and post processing methods to develop surface functionalization for the desired application typically there are two main strategies top down and bottom up 94 the top down strategy mainly focuses on changing the surface microstructures without altering the chemical compositions 95 polishing and physical etching are the typical methods under this strategy on the other hand the bottom up strategy aims to form a layer of material with specific chemical compositions on the printed surface 96 example methods under this strategy are physical and chemical deposition i e atomic layer deposition vapor phase deposition coating surface grafting self assembly and sol gel technique surface functionalization or post treatment was preferred due to its advantages in achieving favorable surface properties and desired material performance which is more practical in industry practice than the fabrication of bulk functional materials or pure structural materials based on the research results published in the literature tailored surface functionalization can achieve unique properties such as surface wetting and morphology roughness biocompatibility catalytic properties and various mechanical properties like hardness wear friction residual stress and fatigue behavior to date only one review paper done by jiang et al 77 discussed surface functionalized 3d printing including robust methodologies outstanding properties and its potential application in different fields based on the advantaged and disadvantages of different strategies listed in table 3 3 of the three strategies surface functionalization highlighted in strategy iii such as deposition grafting and etching has been widely applied in water treatment applications particularly for post treatment to the authors knowledge there is no review has been reported for the synergistic approach of combining 3d printing and surface functionalization for water application considering the gap this review paper will be further discussed on strategy iii as the methods of surface functionalization on 3d printed materials are summarized in fig 3 4 and the surface enhancement properties in table 3 4 followed by a discussion of its application in the subsequent sections 3 4 1 deposition processing deposition processing is a versatile bottom up approach that functionalizes the surface by incorporating a nano and micro scale topography and polyelectrolyte 108 typically various deposition methods can be employed to functionalize the surface of 3d printed materials such as atomic layer deposition ald electroless plating and chemical deposition techniques i e sol gel dip and spin coating thermal deposition i e thermoset coating electrochemical deposition self assembly and induced adsorption ald is a common technique where a metal oxide protective layer is deposited on the targeted surface and recently extended to the membrane surface for wastewater treatment applications 109 and pollutant removal 28 ald processing has been used to deposit a layer of thin film on the carbon nanotubes 110 111 polymers and ceramics 112 113 it is generally used to tune the membrane surface properties membrane thickness and pore size as well as control the chemical composition this eventually helped to achieve advanced separation properties with high rejection efficiency 112 114 and structural stability 115 however this method has a notable drawback of sacrificing the water permeability 115 one of the advantages of the ald process is the flexibility to use moderate to low deposition temperatures which make it compatible with temperature and heat sensitive polymer substrates without affecting their surface properties 116 117 despite the flexibility in changing the temperature this leads to incomplete decomposition and mechanical stability of the printed materials this is due to the nature of self timing of ald which enables the deposition of uniform films with precisely controlled thickness and high conformality according to hu et al 118 self limiting is a property that occurs when all available reactive surface sites are occupied during the ald reaction when the precursors are fully adsorbed on the surface of the substrate a temperature window must be maintained within the constant growth rate to ensure self limiting fig 3 5a the constant growth per cycle and temperature window is required as it offers robustness for the deposition of the film as shown in fig 3 5b the temperature window is responsible for the consistency of growth per cycle however to some extent it might disrupt the proves of the deposition reaction 119 if the temperature is too low a heterogeneous reaction will occur as the precursor may condense and mix with the previous reactant resulting in a loss of self timing since the reaction follows the arrhenius relationship i e the growth rate increases exponentially with temperature a low temperature leads to a low reaction rate and may result in more time being required to reach the activation energy on the other hand too high a reaction temperature destroys the property of self timing because it causes the precursor to detach or even decompose before reacting with other precursors 118 it can be concluded that the precursors must be sufficiently thermal stable and must not decompose during film growth on the substrate in another study ji et al 120 utilized a bottom up approach to deposited polyoxometalate ionic liquids pom as heavy metal binding sites on the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs as shown in fig 3 5c the surface functionalization has improved the hydrophilicity and water adsorption due to the extensive hydrogen bond between both materials the surface hydrophilicity increases with increasing hydrolysis time as represented in fig 3 5d iv from abs 5 with 58 abs 10 37 and abs 15 21 compared to uncoated abs 81 abs x e g abs 5 represent the immersion time of abs for hydrolysis process in minutes in this case abs was immersed in the solution for 5 min based on fig 3 5d v pw9 abs 15 showed interesting dynamic effect where it took only 1 5 s to quickly spread out on the surface and subsequently absorbed into the composite this result showed that abs hydrolysis can enhance the hydrophilic properties as a result a facile route has successfully been developed for the 3d printed polymer porous device in water purification however this research is still at the proof of concept stage and extensive work needs to be done for converting the result into industry applications browne et al 85 applied the ald technique to deposit tio2 on the 3d printed stainless steel electrodes to optimize the photoanode activity a controllable thickness of the 3d printed electrode with arbitrary porosity can be achieved by combining 3d printing and ald fig 3 5e showed the fabrication of 3d printed stainless steel followed by deposition of tio2 at different thickness cycles e g 400 800 and 1200 in the images from sem fig 3 5f i to iv spherical structures can be seen on the 3d printed electrodes the amount of tio2 coating became clearly visible as the number of ald cycles increased this tuning affected the pec water oxidation activity and post processing such as annealing was not required simplifying the synthesis process and allowing direct use as a pec catalyst to date the approach of combining additive manufacturing techniques and ald has only been used in photoelectrochemical pec water oxidation and membrane fabrication this fabrication method can be further explored for other water technologies that require more development at the laboratory and prototype stages chemical deposition techniques such as polymerization spin coating and dip coating are favorable to be applied in large scale industrial operations because they are simple and inexpensive commonly surface coating is used for membranes thin films and meshes to enhance the surface properties such as hydrophilic and hydrophobic prevent wetting and improve antifouling in the long run it will provide mechanical and chemical stability for industrial applications spin coating is another method that deposits uniform and smooth thin films of organic materials on the surface which is typically performed in 4 steps deposition spin up spin off and evaporation 121 lyu et al 122 successfully fabricated a controlled ceramic surface patterned membrane by coating ink on the substrate layer by layer by dip coating for 10s for buffer later and 3 s for the top layer followed by spin coating for 1 min at 4000 rpm the printed membrane with a porous gradient structure showed better antifouling ability the key parameters of printed patterns such as distance and height have a significant impact on the fouling performance the best performance of antifouling ability was demonstrated with 3dp patterned lines perpendicular to the flow direction from the report steady flow is reduced by 53 45 and 50 for perpendicular parallel and angular flow respectively in addition porosimetry evaluation showed that the 3d printed surface patterned membrane was saturated at 0 07 and 0 09 Î¼m the small pores showed that the membrane is suitable for microfiltration and has great potential for wastewater application pore blockage cake filtration model was performed to further analyzed the fouling mechanism it was found that the fouling mechanism evolves from pore blockage n 0 8 1 6 to cake filtration n 0 indicating that the permeability of the membrane can be increased at a constant transmembrane pressure this new and effective approach with simple design structures using 3d printing offers a promising route for practical application in advanced ceramic membranes however the research is currently still in the design phase which requires prototyping and performance data collection before it can be used for larger scale water treatment applications dip coating is a versatile multi material method in coating a freestanding microscopic layer to the substrates the procedure involves submerging the substrate in the precursor solution followed by evaporation to create a layer of a unique thickness kim et al 34 successfully fabricated a 3d printed water filtration system and surface treatment via hydrolysis and iron oxide coating the treatment has increased the hydrophilicity of the channels that facilitates the water flow and improved the amount of fe oh 3 deposition in the internal surface area this results in decreasing the flowrate without external pumping which leads to better arsenic removal and serves as small scale water purification further to this yuan et al 123 coated polyamide 12 particles with a candle soot layer via selective laser sintering the printed functional membrane has shown superoleophobicity and hydrophobic properties with exceptional underwater superoleophobicity after wetting with water after the membrane coated with candle soot the water contact angles were above 120 the superhydrophobicity properties of these candle soot coated membranes improved as the contact angle increased over that of the pure polyamide 12 membrane 101 3 in addition the candle soot modified membrane also has better water permeability and gravity driven flux 3300 l m 2 h 1 to 6700 l m 2 h 1 alongside good mechanical strength and mechanical stability through sonification and sandpaper abrasion test the results showed that no obvious candle soot particles detached after 30 min of sonication and the water contact angle 140 3 remained unchanged after 10 cycles of the abrasion test the tensile strength results showed that the membrane had reasonable mechanical strength which increasing from 2 9 mpa to 4 1 mpa compared with the conventional membrane fabrication by phase inversion method 1 3 mpa 124 chemical stability tests were also carried out by immersing the samples into various solvents such as toluene n hexane dimethyl sulfoxide dmso n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp dimethylformamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf for 7 days it was found that the water contact angle remained at 140 and the candle soot particles did not detach in the solvent this demonstrated that the coated candle soot particles were firmly adhered to the membrane surface in another experiment yuan et al 125 used a similar approach to fabricate a superhydrophobic membrane with a switchable wettability on different types of polymers in this case psu via coating of candle soot it was observed that a similar result was reported which proved that the surface treatment is efficient and reliable in water oil separation application despite its tremendous advantages hydrophilic and water repellent properties can only be established if the fresh candle soot wax collected is high in non conductive elements and organic compounds 126 even if it was collected correctly at the middle flame region there is a high chance that the candle soot contains small pah molecules that are highly toxic despite these successes of surface treatment it is difficult or impossible to endow inert materials with surface functionality via individual deposition processes moreover according to zare and kargari 127 the trade off of the modified substrate is unstable due to weak interaction between the coated layer with the substrate surface additionally multi composition surfaces or fabricating micro or nanostructures are critical for further improving the tailored performance of 3d printed devices for practical applications to overcome this chemical treatments i e cross linking or sulfonation are needed to anchor the coating layer or by integrating with hydrothermal surface engineering 3 4 2 etching treatment etching treatment is a top down strategy based on different mechanisms such as surface hanging bonds and functional groups and phase transition to achieve the desired functionalization on a given surface in the wet chemical etching approach the sample is commonly immersed in an acidic or base solution to remove or dissolve material from the substrate 128 129 xing et al 130 successfully enhanced the superhydrophobicity of pla membrane through anisotropic wet chemical etching in acetone and decoration of ps nanospheres the customized and treated membrane provides superhydrophobicity and has excellent mechanical flexibility even after 100 rounds of bending test indicating it is suitable to be used for oil water separation and corrosive aqueous solution the water contact angle of the modified membrane increased significantly from 67 to 147 3 as shown in fig 3 6a it can be seen liquid jet reflection phenomenon appeared when preparing the superhydrophobic surface of pla it was notably observed the water droplet was pinned on the surface with ultra high adhesion force of 380 Î¼n fig 3 6b i and ii whereas in fig 3 6b iii no residue was observed when the liquid drop was pressed and pulled however chemical etching treatment is complex as it can cause chemical contamination depending on the crystal plane orientation and hard to control the etching rate briefly wet chemical etching can be divided into two types a anisotropic and b isotropic in anisotropic etching anisotropic etchants such as potassium hydroxide koh tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah and ethylenediamine pyrocatechol edp etch at different rates in different directions in isotropic etching isotropic etchants such as nitric acid acetic acid and hydrofluoric acid hf etch in the same direction edp is a type of etchant that is carcinogenic and corrosive which can rust any metal and difficult to remove as it leaves brown stains on the surface based on the literature tmah is the most preferred etchant to be used as it exhibits low toxicity and compatible with metal oxide it is capable to form perfect wafer squares but it requires longer processing time thus it is important to choose right etchant based on the materials and desired application wagner 131 reported that the etch rate of both types of etching varies depending on the plane of the crystalline material and the etchant concentration although isotropic etching is faster than anisotropic etching it is difficult to precisely control the etch rate 131 therefore isotropic etching is generally used to remove pre damaged surfaces round pre etched sharp corners produce large geometries and fabricate the structures on single crystal lattices anisotropic etching on the other hand is more precise but the etch rate depends on the orientation of the crystal plane if the orientation of the wafer does not meet the process requirements the formation of the cavity will not have the desired properties as a result it is critical to carefully select the type of etching because the etch rate is affected by the temperature and concentration of the solution which affects the final shape of the cavity with the desired depth 132 plasma etching is a material removal technique using the plasma generated from different gaseous media such as air 133 oxygen 134 ammonia and nitrogen 135 conventional wet chemical etching releases chemical wastes which require an adequate waste treatment process the advantages of plasma etching techniques include selective etching high and controllable etching rate precise etching at a small scale 10 nm and no contamination and hazardous issues plasma etching can be employed on polymeric materials to achieve desired surface chemistry morphology and structures 136 according to chu et al 137 o2 plasma treatment has been proved as an efficient and useful surface modification to form oxygen functionalities onto polymeric materials via ion implantation w jo 138 applied o2 plasma etching treatment to produce micro nanoscale structured rough surfaces on the 3d printed mesh filters the treated surface exhibited different surface wettability fig 3 6c d of superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties fig 3 6e f which increased oil water separation efficiency however in the paper the separation efficiency percentage was not reported in another work done by 84 direct recovery of spilled oil using hierarchically porous oil scoop with capillary induced anti oil fouling was developed via 3d printing and subsequently oxygen plasma etching was applied to fabricate nanopillars on the fibre surface it has been reported that over 95 of the spilled oil is recovered from the oil contaminated water outperforming the efficiency of commercial oil absorbents in terms of oil removal and recovery rates hence the 3d printed oil scoop has the potential to be a promising solution for oil spill response in the oceans and rivers overall the reported study proved that the combination of plasma treatment and 3d printing in improving the efficiency of oil removal and the filtration and recovery device can potentially be employed as a practical separation in the industry electron beam etching methods have been widely used to improve the biological properties and quality of the printed parts by a creating surface topography on the microstructures b reducing surface roughness and grain size 100 and c producing antifouling biocompatible 99 and corrosion resistant surface 101 shahbazi et al 139 used electron beam irradiation to crosslink acrylic acid graft copolymers into the structure of a high performance 3d network nanohydrogel the printed alginate clay g poly acrylic acid nanocomposite ink was irradiated at different doses in a static mode of the conveyor belt using a rhodotron type electron accelerator machine at room temperature the irradiated ink has shown improvement in structural strength due to the high extent of crosslinking density of the chains from the result the high density of the cross linked network at 45 kgy was reported to have great water resistance and low water solubility indicating the structure is stiff and capable to withstand mechanical deformation during printing including improvement in thermal stability and crystalline properties after printing this can conclude that the irradiation treatment significantly improves the quality of the printed superabsorbent hydrogel with a promising strategy to be applied in removing heavy metals in a short period in summary surface functionalization aided by etching offers great postprocessing techniques as its low cost requires a simple process with high feature resolution the problem with these approaches is the difficulty of efficiently and evenly etching complex 3d structures particularly hierarchical porous structures additionally it is hard to control the etching rate as it may affecting the mechanical properties of the printed parts and cause low feature resolution 3 4 3 surface grafting surface grafting as a bottom up approach has been used to perform interfacial modification by either adding onto or growing the polymer chain from the material surface to achieve a desired surface property such as anti fouling 140 chemical stability super wetting biocompatibility and antibacterial property 141 which find its applications in membrane technology 142 environmental remediation 143 adsorption and oil separation 138 silanization or silane treatment is a liquid or vapor phase chemical reaction for surface grafting 144 the technique has been widely used in surface functionalization due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness a broad range of chemical functionalities could be formed on the surface using different types of silane coupling agents different functional groups to enhance the mechanical properties 145 148 cross linked density 149 thermal stability improve wettability 99 and dispersion stability 146 147 150 the surface activation through hydrolysis of the alkoxy group is crucial to have the good formation of silanization piranha solution is commonly hydroxylation method utilized to remove unbound and adsorbed surface contamination before surface activation and after silane treatment 151 moreover silane coupling agent also can act as surface modifier to improve hydrophobic property of the materials 152 which is favorable characteristics in water treatment zhang d et al 67 used a hybrid silane solution which is 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane gptms and 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane aptms as coupling agents the silane coupling is to graft chitosan on the flat skew hexagonal monolithic structure for heavy metal adsorption application the deposited of the grafted chitosan were confirmed via characterization studies of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps zhang et al successfully fabricated an optimal design of a 3d porous structure with polymer chelation properties that exhibits high specific sorption capacity with fast reaction and superior diffusion resistance however the mechanical properties of the modified 3d printed monolithic structure were not reported in this research in another study figuerola et al 153 utilized the surface grafting method to immobilize polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf derived carbons that act as a binder on the 3d printed ceramic support and subsequent calcination the pvdf c coated 3d printed ceramic device has good thermal stability as it can withstand temperatures above 1273 k with no apparent weight loss based on the uv vis spectrophotometer reading the intensity of the signal is always zero indicating it is chemically stable and can be used in extraction applications this study demonstrates that surface grafting can be used on ceramic supports under optimal grafting conditions this method can overcome the limitation of functional porous solids becoming embedded in the binder which limits overall performance hydrogel is an example of a hydrophilic material that contains a crosslinked network that is full of water it is commonly applied to increase wettability to achieve better efficiency in oil water separation yan et al 154 exploits such an advantage to coat hydrogel on the 3d printed membrane in acrylic acid aa and acrylamide am solution the coating has enhanced the demulsification of oil in water emulsions and improved the underwater oil contact angle of superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic over 150 c with a low adhesion force 1 Î¼n and rolling angle of 15 there are also no oil drops on the superoleophobic mesh during the oil receding thus the results showed that the mesh has excellent underwater repellency and is easy to roll off from the surface which is a promising strategy for oil water separation although hydrogel has great performance several technical hurdles such as process design implications and optimizing conditions of the preparation process shall be examined further for wider adoption as new separation technology in conclusion surface grafting can be further utilized to achieve functional surfaces with tailored unique features however the drawback of this strategy is that it required compatible active materials such as modifier or crosslinker to graft with the 3d printed materials without compromising the intrinsic properties of 3d printed structure impacting the 3d printing process and resolution apart from that a lot of residuals of unreacted compounds could occur and need to be completely removed through the leaching process and cause chemical waste and pollution which is not practical for real application 3 4 4 biofilm formation biofilms is a multicellular stage of growth in the life cycle of bacteria it is commonly well attached to bio carriers surfaces in which many microorganisms form a microbial community with a specific function it generally serves as the main body to degrade organic pollutants and convert nutrients in natural and artificial bioprocesses after the inoculation period a biofilm layer will attach to the surface of the bio carrier commonly the 3d printed materials will be inoculated in a bacteria media i e activated sludge fisheries for biofilm growth before being used as a bio carrier tang et al 155 studied about the biofilm s characteristic on the carrier during its growing cycle which in turn affects the degradation of pollutant performance proano pena et al 156 fabricated different configurations of 3d printed bio carrier that were then inoculated with a nitrifying bacteria community in another work singh et al 157 introduced functional biofilm coating by immersing a 3d printed catalytic static mixer in bovine serum albumin bsa solution the bsa prepared printed csm was dipped into the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif 8 precursor solution for 1 min and dried under a flow of n2 gas the biomimetic mineralization mediated mof encapsulation is the key to this technology it physically protects the active enzyme while improving its ability to adhere to the device surface making it a simple robust and versatile fabrication technique that can be used in organic pollutant degradation applications overall surface functionalized 3d printing postprocessing methods like etching deposition surface grafting and others have been extensively used to produce a variety of structural materials with distinctive properties some of the techniques were used as first level modification techniques to preferentially change surface morphologies and physicochemical characteristics for ensuing functional postprocessing while others were used as second level postprocessing techniques to produce other flexible features furthermore in terms of surface properties different approaches have distinct functionalization capacities it is worth noting that combining surface functionalization methods can lead to synergistic mechanisms that improve the overall performance of devices and components as a result this effective approach will be a powerful route to further improve and meet industrial demand 4 recent advances of scientific and innovative functionalized 3d printed materials for water application functionalized 3d printing technology has emerged as an efficient fabrication technique in water treatment owing to its simplicity and novelty in designing geometrically complex parts in a single step as opposed to the time consuming traditional manufacturing methods most importantly additive manufacturing can help to reduce material waste because it uses only the material needed to print the object nonetheless it emits particulates such as volatile organic compound from the main material and ultra fine particle emission which must be addressed in order to reduce the environmental impact of the process 168 the recent advancements that take the approach of combining 3d printing and pre post treatment for performance enhancement in water treatment are summarized in table 4 1 alongside the pros and cons of the application based on the proposed system and the performance efficiency including its reusability and recyclability from fig 4 1 it can be concluded that sla fdm and sls are the most preferred printing techniques to be utilized for fabrication and the chemical modification method is widely utilized for the post treatment as shown in fig 4 1 various industries have shown an interest in serial production aided with fdm compared to other printing techniques although it has been proven that sla is most preferred due to its precision and better quality of printing as shown in figs 4 1 and 4 2 a detailed guideline was given from material selection recommended printing technique and lastly further post treatment to be applied based on 3 different routes chemical physical or biological functionalization from this guideline the researchers can further develop based on their research of interest and opportunities in utilizing additive manufacturing and surface functionalization for various applications specifically in water treatment the following section will be discussing on the emerging application of functionalized 3d printed materials in water application i e heavy metal removal dye removal oil water separation specifically on its performance efficiency maximum reusability and recyclability and characterization study 4 1 heavy metal removal industrial discharge contains a variety of organic and inorganic contaminants heavy metals which can be poisonous and or carcinogenic to humans and other living things 169 the heavy metals from various sectors that are most concerning are copper cu lead pb zinc zn cadmium cd arsenic as nickel ni chromium cr and mercury hg 170 these heavy metals need to be filtered to meet the legislation limits set by the department of environment hence various water treatment processes such as chemical oxidation and reduction ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis ultrafiltration and adsorption have been developed zhang d et al 67 investigated on copper cu removal by using highly porous and reusable 3d printed monolithic structure with silane coupling agent as a crosslinker followed by chitosan immobilization as shown in fig 4 3a based fig 4 3b skewed hexagonal holes has the highest adsorption capacity of 13 2 mg g within 60 min of contact time compared to other two different structures with round and square holes that can only achieve 9 3 mg g and 9 8 mg g respectively this is due to high surface area and porosity of the surface the outcome of the study was also reflected based on the characterization study of sem as shown in fig 4 3c where from fig 4 3c i to iii a cranky layer of chitosan can be clearly observed as compared to before grafting process showed in fig 4 3c iv further confirmation of chitosan deposition on monolithic structure and ascertain material composition were done using xps study based on all obtained evidence as represented by high resolution xps spectra of n 1s o 1s and c 1s it can firmly confirm that a dense and uniform layer of chitosan was deposited on the surface of the 3d printed sample on top of that it was also reported that the monolithic structure has excellent recyclability and reusability as the performance retained between 13 7 mg g to around 11 mg g after four filtration cycles due to strong bond formed between chitosan and epoxy group leading to a robust mechanism of adsorption performance fig 4 3d illustrated the adsorption desorption cycles of cu ii removal retained at above 90 indicating it is recyclable and stable kim et al 34 modified 3d printed potable and small scale water purification unit surface by using iron iii oxide as an adsorbent for arsenic removal as illustrated in fig 4 3e the 3d printed filter has a rust like color after adsorption of iron oxide iii indicating that the iron oxide was absorbed on the filter the morphology results showed that the roughness of the filter surface increases as arsenic elements are seen on the filter fig 4 3e i to ii the proposed system can achieve removal rate of 96 2 within a short period of time based on the results the removal percentage is highly affected by the channel width of the 3d printed filter fig 4 3f showed the adsorption equilibrium of the 3d printed filter with different channel widths from 0 8 to 4 0 mm it was found that the equilibrium was reached after 2 min for filters for adsorption of as iii with channel width of 0 8 mm and 1 0 mm the narrower the channel width the shorter the time required to reach equilibrium however as mentioned by kim et al a channel that is too narrow requires more time for the pretreatment process because the elution process requires several repeated processes therefore it is important to choose a channel width that can be fabricated and subjected to the functionalization treatment in this case 0 8 mm was chosen for efficient pretreatment on top of that sufficient elution time is required in the adsorptive filter system to allow the arsenic and contaminated water to interact with the iron oxide particles it was observed that when 500 ml containing 20 mg l arsenic in the contaminated water passed through the filter the filtration rate remained below 48 even with channel width of 0 8 mm as shown in fig 4 3g which was in contrast when the experiment was idle for 3 h when treating extremely polluted water it was suggested that a rate controller be used to maximize filtration power the residence time can be controlled by varying the mesh pattern in the rate controller s outlet resulting in better removal efficiency moreover the 3d printed filter system could maintain the adsorption capacities at 86 and 77 after the 2nd and 3rd repeated recycling processes respectively fig 4 3h the promising result is due to the narrow channels which increase the internal surface area allowing more iron oxide iii to be deposited on the internal filter in another study reported by ji et al 120 a functionalized 3d printed hierarchical porous device using lacunary polyoxometalate anions can remove transition metal pollutants co ni and cu from water at 44 2 40 5 and 67 respectively however the drawback is the proposed system required longer time over a period of 12 h to achieve higher removal percentage although the decentralized system can be another facile route to convert commercial 3d printed polymers into macroporous ones the current results are not promising for the use of the technology in industry and require extensive work to further develop the currently proposed approach material properties such as mechanical strength chemical stability as well as process parameters can be investigated first to identify the adsorption mechanism before scaling up shahbazi et al 139 fabricated a 3d printed crosslinked alginate nanoclay hydrogel using electron beam irradiation to adsorb pb ii from wastewater this novel 3d printed functional hydrogel showed a fast and higher adsorption capacity of 481 mg g at an irradiance of 5 kgy the adsorption equilibrium could be achieved within 10 min of contact time shahbazi et al also studied the effect of adsorption of pb ii in a high impurities synthetic wastewater containing other heavy metals the adsorption capacity of pb ii was reported to be half that of the original indicating that the printed hydrogel is not selective in the removal of heavy metals and thus can be a potential adsorbent for the removal of various metal ions however the test of reusability of this printed hydrogel has not been reported which may hinder its practical use in industry 4 2 oil water separation oil water separation has received a lot of attention in recent years due to significant water pollution caused by the frequent discharge of industrial oily effluent and risk of accidental oil spills into the marine environment 171 the water contains 10 of oil which is coming from the surfactants in the environment through emulsify process in the water phase and cannot be directly discharged directly to the environment mesh based materials spacers and membranes are some of the most promising approaches for oil water separation technology the porous membrane in particular will function as a filter capturing suspended materials while allowing water to pass through as a result substantial research is being conducted in order to establish a simple and effective fabrication approach for producing membranes with excellent selectivity and permeability all the aforementioned properties can be achieved by utilizing additive manufacturing technology and introduction of surface functionalization this approach can offer flexible design improve super wetting property i e hydrophilicity hydrophobicity enhance antifouling property that is crucial features for membrane lifetime and efficiency yan et al 143 customized 3d printing oil skimmer to collect and remove different types of oil as demonstrated in fig 4 4a surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to modify the surface of the 3d printed mesh to increase hydrophobicity based on sem images shown in fig 4 4a i and ii it can be observed that the solution deposited on the surface indicating that the modification process is successful an alternative oil collection test was used to demonstrate the durability of the oil skimmer as shown in fig 4 4b where all oils were successfully collected from the water without the need to clean the mesh in between it was claimed that the performance of oil removal could reach 97 6 fig 4 4c with great reusability as the oil separation stability retained after 10 cycles 90 as shown in fig 4 4d the collected oil was placed at the bottom of the vessel indicating that the vessel s dimensions determine the oil capacity besides that yan et al further investigated by preparing 3d printed meshes with further treatment via hydrogel coating for oil water separation 154 surface polymerization of fe ii mediated redox reaction was used in the treatment hydrogel was chosen as the crosslinked network to promote wettability properties due to its water holding capabilities yan et al also discovered that synchronizing the demulsification and separation processes resulted in more collisions between neighbouring emulsions with inorganic salts leading to better and efficient separation of oil in water mixtures fig 4 4e illustrated the synchronous demulsification and separation process with optical microscopy of water permeating through s usm mesh it was reported that the separation efficiency can be achieved up to 85 with great repeatability at approximately 90 after 15 cycles as stated in fig 4 4f and g respectively the main objective of this study is to prepare a simple s usm by in situ method and investigate its wettability and separation performance which can be further developed to be used in daily life in another study xing et al 130 used fused deposition modelling fdm to fabricate a lotus lead inspired superhydrophobic porous membrane the printed membrane was then chemically etched and subsequently decorated with polystyrene nanospheres fig 4 4h depicted a bright field optical microscope image of a 3d printed pla membrane before and after etching using acetone it was discovered that the porosity of the printed membrane decreases as the pore size decreases which contradict with the concept of membrane however the pore size of the printed membrane can be tuned via controlling printing infill setting and nozzle diameter parameters the pore size of the membrane is strongly influenced by the width of the actual filament and the distance between two adjacent filaments the results shown in fig 4 4i indicates that as the membrane pore size increases from 40 to 600 Î¼m the flux also increases due to lower flow resistance however the separation efficiency decreases with increasing pore size this can be explained by a decrease in the membrane ability to repel water which also responsible to the instability of the flux measurement the separation efficiency and flux were found to be maintained at 250 Î¼m resulting in an oil water separation efficiency of 99 4 and a high flux of 60 kl m 2 h 1 in addition the recyclability was tested with a hexane water mixture the result showed that the modified 3d printed pla membrane achieved a separation efficiency of about 95 after 10 cycles as shown in fig 4 4j although it was declared that the membrane has excellent chemical tolerance mechanical durability and relatively low cost further justification and scale up are needed to further develop for industrial scale application yuan et al 123 established a robust switchable wettability of the robust membrane functionalized with candle soot by selective laser sintering of a 3d printed membrane for the separation of multiphase liquid mixtures the modified 3d printed membrane showed a high separation efficiency of 99 1 and retained its performance after 10 cycles as shown in fig 4 4k based on fig 4 4l the separation of the oil water mixture can be observed when the water passed through the n hexane which was repelled above the vessels due to the immiscibility of the two solvents when the water has penetrated the candle soot layer it forms a water layer and subsequently repels the hexane the water layer also absorbs water when it interacts with the n hexane water mixtures this functional tuning membrane has a high solvent resistance and can be used to separate immiscible organic mixtures therefore this strategy of fusing polymers with functional nanoparticles in 3d printing is very promising and is expected to be further explored for various separations in water and environmental remediation as a conclusion the combination of 3d printing and post treatment has demonstrated that this synergistic approach can be explored for broader integration in the synthesis of functional 3d printed membranes and meshes for oil water separation due to the above excellent properties 4 3 dye removal a lot of extensive works done by researchers to synthesize 3d printed materials to offer the purpose in dye removal especially in textile industry for example wang et al 159 developed simple and complex coated 3d printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs frameworks the printed skewer was then coated with cu btc via in situ stepwise coating after that the cu btc abs was used as an absorbent to remove methylene blue from an aqueous solution wang et al found that the removal efficiency of mb solutions was high reaching 98 3 and 93 3 for the 5 and 10 mg l concentrations respectively within 10 min this work uses abs extensively in synthesizing the cu btc abs composites hence the ability of the abs polymer to be recycled is critical for its practical applications the mb removal efficiency remained over 58 10 mg l and 68 5 mg l after 5 cycles although the results for reusability and recyclability did not show a good value the adsorbent can be easily separated without requiring centrifugation filtration or magnetic separation this study demonstrates that the cu btc abs composite may be an effective adsorbent for environmental cleanup and that 3d printing may be a quick and environmentally friendly way to create new functional composites for uses other than adsorption in another study shi et al 69 developed similar approach by fabricating 3d printed metal organic frameworks mof with polylactic acid pla where cu mofs are coated on the surface via in situ step by step growth to remove malachite green mg from water in this study the printed pla skeleton were coated with different layers of mof fig 4 5a illustrated the sem images of cu mofs crystals after in situ stepwise coating it can clearly be seen that there are octahedral crystals on the pla surface indicating the cu mofs can growth efficiently on the pla surface after multilayer of coatings via in situ process the removal effectiveness of mg was determined to be 90 within 10 min fig 4 5b the coated pla sheet with cu mofs has high removal efficiency with spontaneous adsorption it was discovered that the color of the pla skeleton changed to pure white during recyclability test using hcl solution and sem imaging revealed a smooth surface as shown in fig 4 5c the film can also be washed in acetone and can be reused up to five times fig 4 5d although it has excellent capability of removal within short period of time however it needs to recoat again for regeneration process and the removal efficiency decrease from one cycle to another cycle or repetition apart from that photocatalysis for water and environmental remediation recently has gained attention among researchers due to rapid technical improvement cost effective and can be widely used for various application phang et al 161 studied on the 3d printed photoreactor with thermoset coating using g c3n4 homojunction for rhb dye degradation and total organic carbon toc removal the photoreactor was fabricated using digital light printing dlp technique followed by coating with a thin film of immobilized gcn based thermoset coating on the base of the photoreactor according to the structure of the surface morphology the surface of the hdt resin has a homogeneous fibrous texture as shown in fig 4 5e i and ii respectively the fibrous texture was indicative of a typical polymer resin sem images of the gcn based thermoset coating depicted dense and aggregated gcn4 structure fig 4 5e iii fig 4 4e iv clearly showed interconnected mesopores with laminar structure edx analysis was further investigated to scan the elemental composition the edx spectra revealed that the hdt resin contains only c and o whereas the 3d printed photocatalyst coated with a gcn based thermoset coating showed the presence of the additional element n furthermore under the irradiation of a 50 w led the modified photocatalytic system successfully degraded 95 62 of rhb dye and 78 56 of toc in 24 h fig 4 5f phang et al also found that the operating conditions can be made more time and cost efficient by eliminating the additional centrifugation step to recover the photocatalyst the photoactivity reusability test showed that the original photocatalytic efficiency was maintained at 98 5 with no significant decrease in photochemical degradation performance even after 5 consecutive cycles as illustrated in fig 4 5g fig 4 5h showed the comparison between the 3d printed reactor before and after the recyclability test although it has excellent photoactivity and photostability it needs longer photocatalytic time to achieve maximum degradation hence further investigation is required to optimize the performance through post treatment via surface functionalization selection of optimum operational parameters selection of materials and printing parameters the gcn based thermoset coating was found to be intact and securely adhered to the base of the 3d printed photoreactor another 3d printed photocatalytic activity was developed by kumbhakar et al 164 showed great photodegradation efficiency with 91 removal for mixed dye followed by rhb dye 88 mb dye 81 and mo dye 54 within 20min this work takes the approach of using different scaffold designs and surface grown nanomaterials via in situ growth of zno nanoflakes the various geometrical configurations offered by 3d printing that have a higher surface to volume ratio can further improve the process efficiency however in this work mechanical and chemical stability of the material were not reported in this study which is crucial for real application nevertheless this research work paves a way for introducing a sustainable approach by integrating 3d printing and photocatalysis for water application and environmental remediation 4 4 micropollutants degradation micropollutants such as biocides pharmaceuticals and personal care products commonly can be found in wastewater treatment plants and removed through biological treatment processes 172 173 according to analytical surveys based on previous studies many polar organic micropollutants are not or are only partially removed in conventional wastewater treatment which is then discharged into rivers and streams consequently this will have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems and human health hence a novel process configuration is much needed to increase the degradation capacity to improve micropollutants removal this could be achieved through additive manufacturing fabrication as specific size geometry and porosity can be tailored based on the function in bioreactor system bio carriers play a crucial role in controlling the effectiveness of water pollution removal through its specific surface area and topology proano pena et al 156 evaluated the performance of 3 d printed biofilter media bio carriers with various surface area design for the nitrification process in the wastewater treatment proano pena et al used material jetting technique to fabricate gyroid carrier there is a limited selection of materials that can be used which has an impact on the effectiveness of a bio carrier this technique only allows using photocurable resins which have the ideal viscosity for better printing in this research work three different experimental configurations were tested on the biocarriers for converting ammonia to nitrate in a series of batch reactors constant fill ratio biocarrier media count and total surface area the results showed that the best performing biocarrier design had ammonia nitrogen conversion rates of 99 33 for large ssa gyroid with constant fill ratio 94 74 for medium ssa gyroid with constant total surface area and 92 73 for large ssa gyroid with constant bio carrier media count at 8 h it is also demonstrated that the specific surface area of the bio carrier was correlated with the ammonia conversion performance with the highest rates of ammonia conversion 99 33 and nitrate production 2 7 mg l for manufactured gyroid bio carriers with a specific surface area that is 1980 5 m2 m3 however since these experiments were done within 8 h further study is required to determine the bio carriers performance over the long term using similar printing techniques and materials to fabricate different types of gyroid structures with different specific surface areas elliott et al compared the effectiveness of gyroid media to the conventional k1 kaldnes carrier in terms of nh3 removal rate preliminary results from a single run showed that the spherical gyroid removes twice as much nh3 as the k1 kaldnes at 1 620 ppm and 0 710 ppm respectively moreover it has also been reported that the surface roughness of the gyroid structure which has a bio multi sloped carrier s surface has increased resulting in increased biofilm adhesion the use of acrylate based resins to fabricate the biocarrier has also affected the biofilm adhesion the biocarrier with a negative surface charged inhibits microbial adhesion this outcome was similarly reported by zhang et al as it further confirmed that the increase in the biofilm attachment and shorter biofilm formation is promoted by the positive surface charged of the bio carrier biocarrier 174 hence based on the literature it can be concluded that when a small area is present microbial growth and functionality are stimulated which in turn increasing overall process yield on the other hand tang et al 155 designed a spindle shaped semi suspended bio carrier that had a unique impact on the traits of the attached biofilm throughout its entire growth cycle the biofilm formation can be observed as early as day 6 of its growing cycle as compared to a traditional suspended bio carrier after 12 days of continuous operation the biofilm in both zones thickened and the color of the biofilm deepened from white to light brown and light pink as depicted in fig after 30 days the biofilm on the bio carriers thickened and turned into dark brown based on its bioreactor performance in the first ten days cod removal increased to 80 then increased to 90 and finally decreased at the end of the life cycle of the microorganism total nitrogen tn removal was also reported to follow a similar pattern showing a mix of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the reactor tang et al also found that the composition of the microbial community also differs depending on the position of the biofilm structure and shape of the bio carriers tang et al reported that biofilm was easily attached to the media due to the carriers semi suspended state which prevents collision however these studies concentrated on biofilm formation rather than taking the consideration of surface roughness and wettability bernasconi et al 167 fabricated various multifunctional micro robotics using the sla process at a laser speed of 250 4300 mm s and a printing layer thickness of 10 25 mm and subsequently coated with nanocoating of silver titania for bacterial degradation in water based on photocatalytic activity the silver titania coated microrobot has sped up rhb degradation and demonstrated a potential application for gram negative bacterial population control with a cell viability of 94 this microdevice also can be used to control and purify water inside canalizations and small water reservoirs the 3d printed microdevice was successfully produced in 30 min and had excellent physical integrity and reproducibility under the sem and optical microscope the dimension deviation between the actual printed microdevices and the theoretical design is 20 Î¼m showing that the fabrication method is highly accurate singh et al 157 took a different approach by creating a precision engineered device that integrates a catalytic enzyme onto a 3d printed polymer matrix to optimize continuous fluid mixing the combination of both additive manufacturing and bio surface functionalization approaches has yielded a 3d catalytic static mixer csm coated in a mof enzyme complex the static mixer was explicitly developed for the flow process industry to improve solution mixing through intimate turbulent mixing increased flow rates and improved efficiency over multiple run cycles based on the research findings the substrate conversion rate increased rapidly over the first 4 h reaching nearly 90 conversion by the first 9 h it then increased gradually over the following 24 h equilibrating at 100 conversion this concept for practical continuous bioremediation and real time monitoring can be applied to any mof that can be anchored onto the 3d support structure and any bioactive molecule that can be encapsulated within the respective mof for large volumes of wastewater bioremediation such devices can be easily realized with the help of industrial scale 3d printers and stacked in series and parallel and packed into bed reactors the key to this research is using biomimetic mineralization mediated mof encapsulation that physically protects the active enzyme while improving its ability to adhere to the device surface making it a simple robust and versatile fabrication technique 4 5 other pollutants removal figuerola et al 153 fabricated ceramic 3d printed supports using the sla technique based on a matrix of interconnected small cubes as a proof of concept coated with a pvdf dmf mixture that simultaneously serves as a binder and source of carbon the coated media was heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain highly robust and functional carbon coated devices the prepared pvdf derived carbon coated ceramic 3d printed devices were tested to extract various organic pollutants such as bisphenol a some dyes and pharmaceuticals this coated device which can be easily retrieved by simply applying a magnetic field demonstrated high performance with a maximum adsorption capacity of 122 5 mg g 98 9 and fast kinetics for bisphenol a extraction it also showed excellent reusability with its adsorption capacity remained unchanged of above 90 after ten extraction cycles although it showed promising results it required a high maintenance procedure as the recovered supports needed to be recoated with carbon for another cycle of extraction of organic pollutants however this research has portrayed water technology s long term stability and durability moreover the developed coating method allows for the immobilization of a highly porous carbon on it in a quick simple and efficient manner in short 3d printing technologies for water treatment applications have a great potential for manufacturing usage and industrial application however the development is still at the infant stage which requires more work to be done some researchers have developed the technologies by integrating 3d printing and further improved by post treatment using surface functionalization for better performance surface roughness and mechanical properties but there is still a gap that requires room for improvement to produce a central system without compromising either its chemical and mechanical properties and production in the nanoscale field i e pore size this review has summarized the key development and current trend of the technologies for functionalized 3d printing for water treatment and can be a reference for other researchers to further develop 5 challenges and future perspectives the adoption of additive manufacturing for water treatment applications has shown significant growth in the industry including surface functionalization of 3d printed using physical and chemical modifications many current studies have investigated and demonstrated the potential of surface functionalized 3d printable materials as emerging and innovative water treatment methods of industrial standard despite the rapid development challenges such as materials selection additive manufacturing procedure and resolution require continuous improvements an important diagram representing the development of surface functionalized 3d printing materials systems or water treatment applications is shown in fig 5 1 firstly the mechanical stability and durability of 3d printed structures continue to be critical issues in creating robust and functional layers that promote interfacial adhesion between 3d structures further research is necessary to study and understand the mechanisms in enhancing interfacial bonding when a surface functionalized strategy is used previous studies have revealed the effective interfacial bonding for polymeric materials is via the chemical approach for example the adhesive mechanism in low surface energy polymeric materials is not adequately understood which could limit the wider applications of the material besides stability of the 3d printed materials in extreme conditions such as strong acidic and alkaline media is crucial as the substrates produced by 3d printing play a significant role in defining the functional and structural features of the water treatment device in addition the long term durability and safety measures also need to be considered when dealing with wastewater treatment applications 5 the second issue is the high production cost for larger scale applications the high cost is further complicated by the limitation of materials available for 3d printing as the conventional membrane or microfluidic technology usually used only polymeric materials such as pvdf ptfe pes and polyamide the recent advance in printing multiple materials with different properties and functions are much anticipated and may be adopted in 3d printing to improve the performance and mechanical strength 5 therefore the development of next generation 3d printed materials of low cost environmental friendly and scalable requires a detailed and careful consideration of different surface functionalization methods and suitable polymer materials thirdly it is challenging to meet multidimensional demands during practical implementation which typically requires a complex structure with high feature resolution however the current attempts in surface functionalized 3d printing were highly targeted to specific applications to this end developing a more universal surface functionalization method that suits a wider range of materials become increasingly important therefore the development of multifunctional 3d printed devices and components that utilize functional induced biomaterials combined with desirable surface modified functionality could be a promising approach a substantial effort in synthesis modification and post synthetic functionalization involving the attachment or incorporation of specific functional groups as adsorbents has been proven successfully in ionic pollutants removal in addition the surface modifying agents method like grafting can form cooperative and multi beneficial functional groups and could be an effective way of forming a chelating and strong bond to both polar and non polar surface character of the pollutants 176 therefore surface functionalized with the integration of 3d printing has shown an avenue that has promising direction in this field many studies that have been done in recent years are only at the lab and prototyping stage which will be the key development for further investigation to focus on developing a versatile commercial product the surface functionalization method of post 3d printing is also still limited to certain types of materials i e polymer metallic surface which need to be explored for industrial scale production two main aspects will be the key ultimate goals in the future manufacturing high resolution and cost effective advanced am technologies and constructing a robust and universal surface functionalization for functional and desirable surfaces that can easily be scaled up on top of that the current experimental work is still lab testing and using an aqueous solution as part of the performance analysis more research can be done to test with real effluent or wastewater as this is crucial to test the performance before scaling into the prototype stage this is because wastewater samples containing different concentrations of impurities may affect the mechanical strength of the printer parts especially for polymeric materials as they may experience inflammation when submerged in the water due to the hydrophilic behavior in the future high performance emerging surface functionalized 3d printed materials will be the cofactor in designing an innovative centralized system of functional devices and components to be employed in water treatment applications therefore an in depth study that focuses on surface functionalization that has unique features with similar surface chemistry and interactions needs to be explored in detail including developing a standard manufacturing principle as there is plenty of room for the development to be paved as the potential commercial products to meet the actual demand furthermore functionalized 3d water technology should be thoroughly explored for use in emerging applications focusing on surface features such as photoelectrochemical water splitting water harvesting desalination and water harvesting on top of that the evolution of am technologies to 4d and 5d printing can be done to overcome the limitations mentioned above under optimal printing conditions 4d printing can self assemble or change shape over time in response to the right stimuli i e light temperature pressure magnetic fields in the case of 5d printing it is the extension of 3d printing with a rotatable printing bed of x y and z axes to print complex and curvy surfaces hence the new responsiveness to stimuli via 4d and 5d printing with better structures and novel architectural designs with more functionalities can be employed in water treatment

12678,access to clean water is a fundamental problem that has been emphasized by the united nations and world health organization water is one of the vital necessities for humans to stay alive and prevent disease however due to the increasing world population and climate change it is predicted water resources will be stressed and limited due to poor quality various water treatment processes have been developed based on the presence of contaminants in water to solve the urgent issue due to the outstanding ability to meet the demands of commercial applications the newest methods of combining additive manufacturing am and surface functionalization have attracted a lot of attention in recent years with the rapid advancement of this field more advanced flexible and efficient surface functionalization strategies for additively manufactured materials have been discussed the strategy and methods including etching deposition processing surface grafting and biofilm growth are summarized concisely alongside with the surface enhancement property such as antifouling mechanical and chemical stability and other unique features in this work recent advances in functionalized 3d printed materials used in various water research as mesh membrane photocatalyst scaffold and biocarrier are reviewed furthermore the fundamental issue associated with 3d functional materials is assessed along with the proposed process optimization strategies lastly the challenges and future perspectives of functionalized 3d printed materials are discussed to develop a novel and versatile

printing optimization surface functionalization water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction advanced technologies such as additive manufacturing and providing affordable technology for the community to adopt recently there has been a significant advancement in additive manufacturing for water treatment as shown in fig 1 1 a due to its inherent advantages of high printing resolution rapid fabrication process with good control in pore structure and porosity better energy efficiency and excellent mechanical properties for regeneration and reusability of the device additionally the use of surface functionalization by chemical or physical means to enhance the surface properties of 3d printed parts has also recently garnered much attention 1 the combination of 3d printing and surface functionalization has been used on a large scale for industrial applicability to produce structures and components with unique physical and chemical properties one of the promising applications is in the area of environmental and water treatment research currently the number of publications associated to this area is relatively limited but its trend currently rising as shown in fig 1 1 b thus the combination of 3d printing and surface functionalization will not only improve the performance of the technologies but also take a robust approach towards a sustainable environment and better water quality number of reviewed publications in this review paper based on the keywords have been summarized in table 1 1 to date most of the review papers have only reported on the latest advances of polymer based usage of biopolymer and different materials in water remediation 2 4 including the application of 3d printing for membrane separation desalination and water treatment 5 it is noted that a critical discussion has not yet been formally provided on the surface functionalized materials in the water treatment hence this paper presents assessment on optimization strategies used to enhance the existing performance functional materials and evaluate the role of promising surface functionalization methods apart from that criteria and feasible pathway was designed as a guidance for researcher intended to apply surface functionalized 3d printing in water treatment 2 challenges and opportunities of 3d printed functional materials this section provides review associated with 3d printed functional materials for water application based on material properties mechanical strength and stability as well as chemical stability lastly surface wettability i e adhesion surface roughness and hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties were discussed 2 1 material compatibility material structure printing technique and process parameters are all essential factors in determining the final properties of the 3d printed parts 6 equipment manufacturers often do not reveal the material data such as the chemical compositions of the printing materials and only limited mechanical properties are disclosed to protect the company s commercial interests the comparison between the material data needs to be improved and a technical data sheet with engineering control becomes more complicated when different 3d printing techniques are used however some manufacturers provide the material data for printed parts from their 3d printer or bulk testing of the source materials nevertheless all the information is still helpful in understanding the fundamental knowledge of mechanical properties like hardness elastic modulus and tensile strength 7 it is crucial to consider the design material properties compatibility and am system with the desired engineering products as it will hinder the mechanical strength characteristics and functionality for instance agglomeration could occur due to the materials incompatibility increasing the nozzle s viscosity and clogging especially for extruded based am technology such as the fdm to overcome this adding additives such as plasticizers surfactants and or reinforcements i e carbon fibre and filler can reduce the viscosity however the process will become more challenging as it will cause improper adhesion during the printing procedure in contrast spoerk et al 8 proved in their research work that the addition of carbon fibre cf in polypropylene pp printed samples by 10 volume fraction can enhance surface and printing quality good extrudability strong adhesion with the matrix and less agglomeration of materials a similar result was also reported by liao et al 9 that the addition of cf by 10 into polyamide 12 significantly improved tensile and flexure properties without compromising the impact properties based on the research done it can be concluded that the addition of reinforcement i e carbon fibre can solve the issue of viscosity and significantly enhance the mechanical properties of 3d printed parts in water technologies especially in 3d printed membrane fabrication there is an issue between material compatibility printing techniques and desired functions for instance wax is used as a supporting material in the material jetting system and can be printed to produce a porous membrane however due to the smaller gaps between printed pores wax removal is more complicated and complete washing is impossible fee et al 10 has developed a method to remove the wax using warm water and cyclohexane alternatingly for several hours it was found that if the pore size is below 250 Î¼m the successiveness of washing using both solvents will be a challenging task several papers have widely discussed a few methods for removal of wax as supporting materials and numerous patents have been granted for the material development typically mild heating was applied to remove the supporting material 11 levy has proposed and patented another strategy for removing support materials using a thermal reversible gel based on poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam the gel solidified above its gelation temperature and exhibited appropriate toughness to support the model then once the building process was completed the gel cooled below its gel temperature and allowed the gel to flow lastly the gel can be easily rinse with water 12 however the proposed method was not suitable to be applied for membrane fabrication especially for polymer materials that are not stable in high temperature 150 c hence it was suggested to appropriately design the membrane especially if it requires porous and hollow structures to avoid the embedment of unused materials in the pores and matrix as these trapped materials are challenging to clean once the am process is completed 13 in addition using other 3d printing methods like dlp and sla printing could solve the problem because they do not require supporting materials it has also been reported that both printing techniques are more precise and require less fabrication time compared to other am fabrication methods which will be discussed in detail in section 3 1 2 2 mechanical strength mechanical properties are important parameters for 3d printed parts as it indicates their suitability for a particular application strength and stiffness related metrics such as elastic modulus tensile strength fatigue test impact strength yield strength and hardness are the key properties for selecting suitable materials in mechanical applications 14 in a study conducted by bardiya et al 15 the tensile strength of 3d printed pla parts was discovered to be significantly affected by process parameters such as fill density part orientation and layer thickness during fdm printing according to their findings the parameters of 0 3 mm layer height 0 orientation and 80 fill resulted in the highest tensile strength 14 4 mpa while the parameters of 0 2 mm layer height 30 orientation and 80 fill exhibited in the highest flexural strength 40 0 mpa moreover dhinesh et al 16 demonstrated that pure pla has higher tensile strength than pure abs and that specimens with equal concentrations of abs and pla 50 50 had significantly better tensile and flexural properties the sandwich method using pla and abs alternately showed the highest flexural strength indicating that this concept has good mechanical strength compared to a single material the present experimental study suggests that pla and abs are promising materials with good mechanical strength that can fabricate water technologies such as membranes and spacers yanar et al 17 investigated on forward osmosis membrane systems fabrication with different 3d printed spacers yanar et al compared different polymer materials i e abs pla and pp for fabricating 3d printed spacers using polyjet technology based on the mechanical behavior pla was found to have the highest yield strength of 0 433 mpa among all other materials abs exhibits high ultimate strength but small cracks occur due to low yield strain and stress although all materials have the potential to be developed there is very little information available that addresses in detail the properties of am fabrication and materials to determine a superior technique that has good mechanical properties and excellent performance in water application many studies have focused on fabricating membrane module parts such as membrane and spacers the research started with the development of spacers with different shapes such as multilayer spacers with twisted tapes multilayer spacers with standard filaments and modified filaments with twisted plates in all these studies only the effect of changing the shape on performance and efficiency was reported but not on mechanical strength further work is needed to develop current water technologies to meet the industry standard in addition critical mechanical strength studies should be conducted in detail especially for pressure driven processes to date numerous research have been published on enhancing the mechanical properties and stability specifically of 3d printed membranes and spacers for water treatment and desalination but very limited on other water technologies such as 3d printed adsorbents photocatalysts and biocarriers 2 3 mechanical stability many efforts have been directed to produce printed parts with high mechanical strength excellent topography and toughness however the weak mechanical stability is still remained as one of the major issues especially for water application due to the exposure to various challenging environments i e high pressure temperature and extreme ph level this also including mechanical stability for practical applicability as the 3d printed parts need to have cyclic use and can withstand certain pressure in water 18 firstly some polymers used in 3d printing such as photopolymers are not stable in solvent and under extensive heat exposure when soaked in the water the hydrophilic photopolymers may exhibit swelling behavior and undergo morphological changes which affect the structural stability and integrity of the printed parts robinson and berube discovered that after soaking in water for an extended period of time am spacers tend to break 19 the actual cause requires further investigation however it is believed the incompatibility of the polymer with water and instability of the photoinitiator in the resin formulation could be the possible reasons this is because the selection of suitable photoinitiator for particular monomer or oligomer system requires trial and error procedure 20 21 therefore the choice of an appropriate combination of polymer and photoinitiator when using sla dlp technology is crucial to produce stable and versatile 3d printed polymeric materials for water treatment secondly the swelling behavior of the printed materials were affected by film layer thickness ayrilmis et al 22 investigated the swelling behavior of pla wood composites including the different layer thickness it was found that swelling becomes more severe with increasing film thickness due to higher porosity resulting in greater water adsorption excessive swelling deteriorates structural integrity and leads to material deformation this phenomenon is undesirable for the production of membranes and spacers because it leads to more biofouling as this condition is suitable for bacteria to grow in the pores however for the adsorption process especially printed hydrogels swelling behavior is required to achieve excellent adsorption capacity but excessive swelling reduces the mechanical strength of the structure usually a crosslinker such as cacl2 and naoh solution is added or immersed to maintain mechanical stability post treatment such as the application of acrylic varnish can reduce porosity and as a result optimize the stiffness of 3d printed structures soo et al 23 believed that the fundamental problem of mechanical stability does not arise in 3d printing technologies because the layer thickness can be 50 Î¼m lower layer thickness and porosity result in increased material consumption and printing time which leads to increase the cost mechanical stability remains a challenging issue in water applications the currently proposed solution for a more robust model will trade off the performance efficiency favoring better swelling behavior and high porosity 2 4 chemical stability the ability of 3d printed materials to withstand extreme environmental conditions such as acid is critical to avoid leaching into the environment or drinking water supply through adverse reactions selecting materials that can withstand aggressive chemicals is critical before proceeding with the 3d printing process materials used in am systems have typically been tested for the effects of long exposure to organic solvents such as methylene chloride and rated according to their performance 24 there is evidence that certain polymer materials used in 3d printing form leachates and affect the environment and aquatic life when they come into contact with water 23 for example compared to other polymer materials such as pla the abs plastics used in fdm printing can release toxic particles at high melting temperatures which can adversely affect respiratory function and potentially lead to death under prolonged exposure 25 in contrast pla plastics have been reported to be safe as 3d printed materials as they are widely used in tissue engineering e g as a mold for cell growth 26 and as food packaging 27 pla has been classified as a biodegradable polymer that can be a good choice for developing chemically stable 3d printed parts in water applications currently pla is used as a functionalized material in the form of porous structures i e adsorbents freeze dried foam 177 and membranes 29 for the separation of oil and water according to erokhin et al 30 there are only general chemical resistance guide charts for selecting polymer types used in 3d printing to date there is no clear information on the limits of chlorine chemical resistance which leads to degradation and eventual reduction of performance especially in water treatment due to this limitation it was suggested that the chemical stability of 3d printed parts could be achieved while maintaining efficiency through chemical modification 31 32 and surface functionalization 33 for example kim et al 34 fabricated water filtration system using pla via 3d printing technology for arsenic removal in which hydrolysis process take place subsequently iron oxide coating was applied as surface treatment to improve chemical resistance and performance iron oxide is widely used for adsorption and photocatalytic activity due to its excellent chemical stability environmental friendliness ease of production and cost effectiveness 35 many studies have discussed on their performance efficiency in water and wastewater treatment 36 while their role in surface functionalization is still limited which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 2 5 surface wettability surface wettability is a physical parameter that characterizes the liquid droplet adhesion behavior to a surface hydrophobic or superhydrophobic is the key surface property for membrane distillation md systems as it affects the overall achievable separation efficiency the degree of surface wetting was highly dependent on the interfacial tension between the phases in contact surface wettability is influenced by nanofeatures or dual microfeatures as well as the surface s chemical composition water contact angle wca measurement is commonly used to characterize surface wetting based on the physical chemical properties of the phases several numerical models including the wenzel model cassie model and liquid model have been developed in recent years the sliding angle Î¸ can be calculated using the tilting plate method where Î¸max and Î¸min is the wca at the upper and lower edges of the drop at the stability limit respectively although the utilization of 3d printing could assist in the creation of superhydrophobic surfaces by decrease the quantity of steps in the printing process the need for subsequent coatings remains a key problem to address firstly increasing the durability of superhydrophobicity can be accomplished by reducing the surface roughness of the materials from the micron to the submicron level however it comes at the expense of increased printing costs time and the requirement for higher printer resolution particularly along the xy plane this problem can be solved by embedding bulk materials with nanomaterials during 3d printing surface roughness on microscale patterns can be 3d printed instead of spending extra time and money to directly print nanoscale asperities another issue is the limited supply of high precision 3d printer materials these materials generally do not have a low enough surface tension to prevent the coating from filling nanoscale asperities as a result a more advanced 3d printing technique is required to achieve robust anti wetting properties on top of that there is limited research on switchable properties i e between superhydrophobic and superoleophilic which are especially desirable for robust oil water separation using membrane technology most of the studies are still limited to the lab scale and further development is needed for validation of its effectiveness and performance based on the numerical model and recent research by shahrubudin et al 37 producing controllable 3d printed micro features with low cost remained a challenge among researchers and industries surface functionalization is currently a promising method for controlling the wettability of 3d printed structures which will be discussed in detail in section 3 4 in summary extensive work is still required to develop novel and more versatile strategies including improving thermo responsive light responsive ph responsive or electrical potential responsive wettability to solve the surface wetting issue for specific applications overall the available literature that discussed the characteristics of 3d printing as well as the implication of printing techniques and material selection for water treatment applications are yet to be reported this is crucial in determining a suitable technique that is superior to develop materials with sufficient mechanical strength and chemical stability for practical application and further post modification treatment performance optimization strategies to address the aforementioned fundamental issues were evaluated in section 3 3 performance optimization strategies the promising potential of 3d printing technology is demonstrated by its ability to construct structures with integration of greater parts and desired geometry the performance and mechanical properties of 3d printed functional materials will vary depending on the printing method and material chosen which will be the fundamental optimization techniques for a variety of applications the performance measurements of 3d printed functional materials as well as optimization techniques are provided and addressed in this section 3 1 3d printing route consideration additive manufacturing system takes a fundamentally different approach to building 3d structures by deposition of material layer by layer in a horizontal cross section as shown in fig 3 1 there are established literatures that have been reported on the development for 3d printing techniques in general and based on materials 38 39 in water treatment it is important to select the suitable material with the right printing technique to produce a structure that can withstand aggressive environmental conditions while maintaining its function 18 there are several controlling parameters that must be met in order for 3d printing to be effective and produce the desired quality of printed parts these controlling parameters can be divided into two categories which are printing and material parameters as summarized in table 3 1 below is a brief description of each 3d printing technique with its advantages limitations and its potential to be explored powder bed fusion pbf powder bed fusion technology uses sintering and melting as a binding mechanism sintering is a process of partial melting while melting is a complete process the procedure involves using a heat source to melt or fuse a layer of spread powder into the desired object the fusion process continues to form the proposed design selective laser melting slm selective laser sintering sls electron beam melting ebm and direct metal laser sintering dmls are all common pbf techniques sls uses powdered plastics metals ceramics and glass whereas slm only uses metals such as alloys and stainless steel for this printing technique it has been found that both plastics and polymers offer pbf great design freedom with complex geometries as they do not require supporting material have very high strength and stiffness and excellent mechanical properties comparable to those of bulk materials the main limitations of pbf are shrinkage and distortion due to internal and surface porosity which make post processing challenging in handling and disposal of the powder 40 in addition the pbf printing process requires large amount of powder to ensure appropriate powder flow and uniformity during printing all published works focus only on in processing performance and post processing printing improvement however in pbf suitable powder flow and powder properties in the pre process play a key role that is often neglected this determination of the pre process requires the suitability of the selected powder for the am process the estimation of its in process behavior and the expected quality of the final product and in a next step the localization of the pre process parameter windows 41 in this way an optimal powder for a broader applications can be produced which has the potential to be explored and attract attention in a wider market for powder manufacturers while pbf manufacturers could offer wide applicability 41 binder jetting bj binder jetting is a process in which powder particles are bonded together by selectively depositing a liquid binder and subsequently produced 3d printed object in this printing technique a roller evenly distributes a layer of powder on a bed after a binder is deposited onto the powder layer the platform is then lowered to form a solid part by spreading another layer of powder typical materials used in this method are metals sand and ceramics the main advantages of this technique are the ease of operation no requirement of support is needed and low cost 42 the main disadvantages of binding jetting are the multi step post processing of the print i e curing and densification the high surface roughness and lower resolution of the printed parts and the fact that post processing strategies still need to be developed for most materials the inability to predict the large amount of distortion that occurs when individual alloys are sintered to full density to achieve the desired final geometry is one of the main drawbacks that limiting the potential of this process it also reduces the overall accuracy of the process when producing parts from a single alloy that are much larger than the size of the metal injection mold mim binding jetting is one of the oldest additive manufacturing processes that is useful for metal and can be further explored it requires extensive work to enhance the properties of binding jetting from raw material to finished product including correlation of densification kinetics with complex geometry powder characteristics morphology and qualification choice of binder compatibility with printing method of deposition interaction between powder and binder burnout and stability properties printing process parameters specification and necessary post processing procedures 43 this technique is currently used in the fabrication of injection moulding using stainless steel powder for industrial application 44 directed energy deposition ded direct energy deposition focuses the energy of a high powered laser on a small area to heat the substrate and melt the printing materials the amount of powders that are melted and the energy source e g laser electron beam arc due to heat input both affect the print resolution of the ded process while the deposition rate is affected by the production speed the advantages of the ded process are the ability to fabricate of complex geometries and deposit functional materials and reduction of material waste the disadvantages of the ded process are distortion porosity and inhomogeneities low quality and accuracy of parts and the need for expensive materials and longer production time to overcome the above challenges a hybrid manufacturing approach has been proposed 45 the traditional process in the am system is to produce printed parts and then require post processing steps the concept of hybridization goes beyond post processing to magnify the advantages and eliminate the disadvantages of each other the synergy between these techniques can lead to more efficient processes and cost savings and should be explored as it also fits well with industry 4 0 guidelines i e increasing manufacturing flexibility quality and customization at scale 45 material jetting mj material jetting or utilized the light curable resin and its printing principle is similar to common paper printing to create the desired design the photopolymer resin is dropped on various substrates layer by layer 46 this process is categorized into three types 1 nanoparticle jetting 2 polyjet and 3 drop on demand mj technique able to fabricate complex shapes with very fast manufacturing process high accuracy 14 Î¼m produce smooth surface and ability to combined different materials as ink formulation the only limitation is high manufacturing cost heat resistance for certain materials is limited and unable to produce functional prototypes material extrusion me material extrusion uses continual pressure to drive the material out of the print head and onto the printing platform once the material has been extruded and solidified the procedure is repeated until the desired output is obtained fused deposition modelling fdm uses this principle of material extrusion this technique is considered to be cost effective mechanically resistant and capable of producing durable components the disadvantages are low to moderate manufacturing accuracy the production of grooves slow manufacturing process and the need for support structures another significant limitation is that the addition of fibers or fillers to improve mechanical properties leads to clogging in the nozzle a physical adaptation to improve the full potential of the fdm technique was proposed by changing the geometry of the nozzle it has been reported that the extrusion nozzle can affect print resolution due to thermal radiation effect as it is the component of the printing system that comes into contact with the filament before it is extruded into the print bed 47 very little experimental work have been reported in the literature about changes to the printer components and their effects on the printing process it has been found that only adapted nozzle allows precise printing and avoids clogging 47 in water application microchannels such as microfluidic chip with a width of 100 Î¼m can be printed with a special nozzle geometry this approach can open up new possibilities to improve the resolution of printed parts for manufacturing microfluidic and other transparent devices for various applications sheet lamination sl laminated object manufacture lom ultrasonic additive manufacturing uam ultrasonic consolidation uc and plastic sheet lamination are the techniques utilized in the sheet lamination process psl the most often used manufacturing processes are ultrasonic additive manufacturing uam and ultrasonic consolidation uc 48 in this process the raw materials are cut through the use of digital guided user and the sheets are stacked layer by layer through bonding via diffusion to form the final product 49 various materials such as ceramics papers polymers and metals can be used in this process this process is integrated as a hybrid manufacturing system which does not require the support structures low operation cost and easy to handle however sheet lamination process causes a lot of wastage compared to other methods poor surface finish before post processing low dimensional accuracy poor bonding between the stacked layers and difficult to fabricate complex geometries 50 vat photopolymerization vp in the vp process photopolymerization of materials such as acrylate resin with high reactivity is used to produce solid parts the mixed photopolymer usually consisting of a polymer and photoinitiator is placed in the vat and sintered with a laser laser is used in stereolithography while light mask projector is used in digital light processing dlp for sintering the laser was exposed over the mixed resin which undergoes a photochemical process that bonds like a chain to cure and form solid material 51 this process produces high resolution and accuracy precise and capable of printing complex geometries and surface quality the printing process is relatively fast and can print large components the only limitation of this process is that the 3d printer is expensive material selection is limited and the post processing time is longer recent studies have shown that photopolymerization has found its place in the production of 3d nanoprinting tomographic printing and 4d printing 52 this is because there is an increasing industrial demand for smart composites and materials that enable better capabilities and safe human interaction in various fields such as robotics healthcare and water application 52 in the field of water treatment a potential pathway for 3d printing has been explored by integrating multiprocessing system e g a hybrid of traditional active layer fabrication and 3d printing to solve the membrane fabrication problem the current challenge is that it is difficult to achieve the desired resolution for printing the entire membrane hybrid fabrication is able to provide on demand fabrication with freedom geometry design and cost effective production this approach has the potential to be explored in the development of novel designs and functionalities the common 3d printing techniques under am technologies are illustrated in fig 3 2 there are various controlling parameters that also play an important role to ensure the effectiveness of 3d printing and desired quality of printed parts these controlling parameters can be divided into two categories which are printing parameters and material parameters as summarized in table 3 1 and 3 2 3 2 printing parameters the process or printing parameters are crucial in ensuring that 3d printing works as intended and that printed parts are of the desired quality the processing parameters must be carefully controlled to fit the printing material properties and the intended am technology process to achieve the printed parts best characteristics there are numerous papers that discussed on process parameters based on the material and 3d printing techniques the following papers have discussed in detailed about the influences of these parameters 39 54 59 for example manoj prabhakar et al 56 did a short review and briefly described process parameters and materials specifically for the fdm method based on their findings all the research works suggested optimizing the printing parameters such as filament diameter extruder temperature feed rate extruder temperature raster angle working material characteristics nozzle angle and separation between parallel faces furthermore patel et al 60 mentioned that the fdm process is complicated because many opposing parameters influence the component quality and material properties to determine optimal parameters the appropriate selection of process parameters determines the quality of the components and the mechanical characteristics of the produced part can be found in this review paper in the context of its application in water treatment 4 have extensively reviewed the influences of a process parameter specifically on polymeric materials 3 3 material consideration most commercial am materials available in the market lack good temperature resistance high mechanical strength and functionalities such as biocompatibility surface wetting electrical and thermal conductivity and shape memory behavior 52 multimaterials in am processes have attracted attention to overcome the limitations that cannot be achieved when using a single material typical printing techniques that can be used to produce functional materials include fdm sla dlp clp and polyjet due to their flexibility in adding and varying material type and composition the two primary design factors during the 3d printing process are the preparation of functional materials and the printing process in order to obtain the desired output and 3d architectures similarly for water treatment application the selection of material for ink formulation based on the two essential factors 1 mechanical stiffness and strength and 2 viscoelastic properties the surface wettability and tension are extremely important surface properties for water treatment because they determine how the surface of printed materials interacts with the environment in addition the rheological properties of the printed material affect the printed result and both surface properties are highly dependent on the viscosity of the ink materials with the lowest to highest flowability include filaments 100 10 000 pa s gels 10 1000 pa s vat monomers 0 1 100 pa s powders and inks 0 1 pa s 61 for powdered materials shear free viscosity was required because particles coalesced when shear flow did not occur during the sintering process the quality of the powder layers in the roller mechanism was influenced by the flowability of dry powder large particles can cause the surface of the layer to be coarse and contain voids while small particles can cause high interparticle frictions due to strong electrostatic attraction the viscoelastic properties of the ink can also be formulated to be suitable for different printing techniques for example a high shear thinning ink is beneficial for extruded printing 62 while a low viscosity ink is preferable for fdm printing because the liquid ink can flow easily through the printing nozzles 53 in addition sufficient mechanical stiffness and strength of the ink is required to support the entire structure during the solidification process after printing and ink deposition therefore it is crucial to prepare and control the ink formulation and its rheological properties to obtain a stable dispersion for the liquid to gel transition as reported by pagac et al 52 the common mechanical strength for photocurable resins are i ultimate tensile strength 23 mpa 65 mpa ii tensile modulus 0 9 gpa 2 8 gpa and iii elongation failure 7 17 while the mechanical performance of hydrogel can reach the elastic modulus 0 1 1 0 mpa tensile stress 1 10 mpa tensile elongation 10 20 times toughness 0 1 10 kj m2 and work of elongation 1 100 mj m3 63 recently functional materials made of bio based materials 2 nanocellulose 64 and polymers 65 have been intensively explored by researchers to develop robust materials for water application 64 which are briefly discussed below 3 3 1 bio based materials 3d printed bio based materials such as chitosan alginate based materials konjac glucomannan and cellulose acetate have gained popularity due to their potential application in the water treatment sector all of these materials have been shown to be highly reusable and provide tailored and scalable meshes membranes filtration system adsorbents and photocatalysts suitable for the removal of common water contaminants like dyes and heavy metals as well as oil water separation based on recent studies the use of additive manufacturing and functionalized materials such as cellulose acetate 66 chitosan 67 alginate 68 and pla 69 as well as other bio based materials offers great potential for more efficient and cost effective removal of water contaminants and represent a sustainable approach for a more environmentally friendly water treatment industry for instance liakos et al 68 used three different am techniques such as 3d pen fdm and growing robot to fabricate polycaprolactone pcl 3d printing composite filaments with varying weight percentages of sodium alginate sa ranging from 5 to 30 it was observed the adsorption capacity is proportional to the concentration of the sa after 30 days of immersion the maximum adsorption capacity for pcl filament containing 30 sa was reported to be around 90 mg g although the results showed that pcl sa filaments up to 15 sa were stable in water but at a higher sa concentration some loss of sa was observed this is because cu ions are crosslinked to sodium alginate as a crosslinking agent the heavy metal accumulation mechanism on these artificial pcl sa composites is very similar to the ion exchange mechanism and chelation found in marine plants and macroalgae this proved that the technology can acted biomimetic by accumulating heavy metals like other marine plant species which pave a way for its application in environment and water remediation however the drawbacks of this approach are the limited use of commercially available bio based resins requirement of post treatment the scalability issue time consuming and costly post treatment after printing effect the mechanical properties without proper tuning and the limitation of the rheological parameters of the printed parts 3d printing and bio based materials manufacturing is a relatively new approach in the water sector but its excellent performance for biomedical applications has been widely reported extensive research is required to meet the standard needs of the industry and has open door for more researchers to venture and explore 3 3 2 nanocellulose three different types of nanocellulose can be categorized as promising materials for advanced functional materials i nanocrystalline cellulose ncc ii cellulose nanofiber cnf or cellulose nanofibrils and iii bacterial cellulose bc or microbial cellulose 64 nanocellulose is commonly used as a reinforcement matrix for various formulations in additive manufacturing to achieve good mechanical strength and toughness however nanocellulose materials do not have sufficient functional properties for advanced applications and need to be modified to realize their full potential surface modifiers natural or synthetic polymers such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta or carboxymethyl groups are commonly used to optimize their tailored functionality in the fabrication of functional composite structures nanocellulose is a promising sustainable material that has high adsorption capacity high surface area and high functionality to be used as a technology for heavy metal and organic dye removal and oil separation to date cellulose has been widely used as a composite polymer to strengthen the mechanical properties of 3d printed parts but its use as a water technology such as filtration and membrane system remains largely unexplored 3 3 3 polymer liquid polymer composites by mixing polymer and photoinitiator hydrogels and colloidal gels are the suitable materials of choice for printing complex and functional 3d structures due to their highly tailorable viscoelastic properties under external heat pressure and electromagnetic fields 70 bottom up approaches can be used to develop new polymers with intrinsic properties that are specifically tailored for am processes in order to design and synthesize molecular structures instead of using readily available commercial resin the polymers molecular structure can be designed at the molecular level to adapt the polymers to each of the am processes the optical thermal and rheological properties of the polymer materials can be tailored based on its desired application and functions by tuning their functional group molecular chain structure molecular weight distribution and degree of functionality a few research papers have been reported about the development of am technologies to the selection and consideration of polymeric materials for functional and specific applications in wastewater technology such as membranes and spacers adsorbents capsules catalysts microdevices and microfluidic chip along with limitations and future prospects there is no doubt that the am system is an efficient approach to develop water technologies for arbitrary geometries with excellent resolution and performance however the economic evaluation including the total cost of production for larger industrial applications still require much room for optimization apart from this the existing water technologies are designed for certain types of pollutants therefore further research is needed to ensure that wastewater treatment system development is focused on real wastewater treatments such as competitive adsorption of multiple water pollutants in short it can be concluded nanocellulose materials as a 3d printed water technology has shown potential growth to be explored while biopolymers and polymer based additive manufacturing are two main materials of interest for water applications due to their remarkable flexibility in design novel geometrically complex and lattice structures the printing parameters and control parameters of 3d printed bio based and polymeric functional materials and their implications for am techniques are summarized in tables 3 1 and 3 2 respectively as shown in table 3 2 tan et al 39 summarized the critical material requirements for am techniques they can be divided into chemical optical rheological thermal extrinsic and mechanical properties of all the surface properties listed in the table water or moisture absorption was not considered water absorption indicates the ability of the polymer to absorb moisture water from its environment high absorption has reversible effects on mechanical strength by reducing glass transition temperature and moduli and enlarge fracture strain and impact strength 71 since 3d printed polymeric functional materials will be exposed to water it is critical to consider the water peak and its absorption range which indicates the material stability in water this information is also crucial to see if further modification is required to change the surface property from hydrophilic to hydrophobic 3 4 application of surface functionalization in 3d functional materials several functionalization strategies have been developed to extend the capabilities of 3d printed material for practical applications there are three main strategies as shown in fig 3 3 consisting of developing functional materials bioinspired materials and surface functionalization strategy i focus on the identification and use of suitable high performance materials and nanomaterials to print 3d structures and components there has been many discussion in the literature about the development of additively manufactured functional materials made of ceramics 78 polymers 79 nanocomposites 80 and metals 81 for various applications various researchers have developed various 3d printed materials related to heavy metal removal 68 pharmaceutical waste removal 82 oil water separation 83 fouling reduction 84 water splitting 85 86 desalination 87 and organic matter removal in environmental and water applications 88 89 currently the development of advanced functional materials for 3d printing is quite straightforward but it is tailored to a specific system and requires a time consuming and costly process of trial and error the number of trials can be reduced by using a computational modelling optimization approach in the development phase however process modelling has high computational cost and may require high performance computing furthermore although the process of preparing the feedstock for printing ink is quite simple it must be adapted to the intended am technology which requires knowledge of the surface properties especially in terms of surface wettability and chemistry surface properties plays an important role in the adhesion of particles in the structure through binding or fusion another factor that must be considered in the development of the ink materials is the property that they must have strong and sufficient compaction and cohesion for the am product this is because minor changes in the ink materials have a large impact on the performance of the final printed product to date specific cost considerations for am technology have not been reported however cost has been identified as one of the major factors holding the industry back from adopting am technology machine costs are estimated to be between 50 and 75 of total production costs 20 to 40 of material costs and 5 to 30 of labour costs 90 nevertheless metrology can play an important role in optimizing the am system at low cost by minimizing the use of feedstock materials reducing part scrap and post processing requirements and increasing production yield and energy efficiency thus overall costs are reduced due to the flexibility offered by am technology 91 strategy ii produces bioinspired materials which are 1 lightweight structural materials of high mechanical toughness and strength 2 topological structures which focus on designing bioactivity super wettability and stimuli responsiveness 92 wang et al have reviewed bioinspired materials in terms of functional and structural categories from a wide range of fascinating biological materials detailed representative functions of paradigmatic biological and bioinspired were illustrated the fundamentals for the specific property followed by a discussion of insights into structure property mechanisms from biological materials and their corresponding bioinspired materials that exhibit special functions properties for relevant applications were discussed on the other hand yan et al 93 focused on reviewing recent development in biomimetic 3d printing materials with improved properties mainly on single material bioinspired reinforced structures inspired by creatures and multi materials inspired by the balsa wood structures bioligand structure nacre structures and shape changing structures based on the literature it was also noted that geometrically structured materials based on the number of species found in nature exhibit high performance with excellent mechanical properties such as toughness high stiffness strength and fatigue resistance in contrast functional structures exhibit exciting properties such as super wettability liquid repellence shape changed and memory although 3d printing can be used to design bioinspired materials and structures this approach has numerous challenges and limitations these include anticipating different interfacial materials to fabricate bioinspired structures with multi materials with different properties and functions another challenge is the fabrication of macroscale nanomaterials which has yet to be reported because of the trade off between high resolution fabrication speed and low cost future advancements in multi material fabrication with high efficiency and low cost are expected as well as a guide for fabricating 3d printing technology from nanoscale to macroscale strategy iii is an approach that combines the 3d printing process and post processing methods to develop surface functionalization for the desired application typically there are two main strategies top down and bottom up 94 the top down strategy mainly focuses on changing the surface microstructures without altering the chemical compositions 95 polishing and physical etching are the typical methods under this strategy on the other hand the bottom up strategy aims to form a layer of material with specific chemical compositions on the printed surface 96 example methods under this strategy are physical and chemical deposition i e atomic layer deposition vapor phase deposition coating surface grafting self assembly and sol gel technique surface functionalization or post treatment was preferred due to its advantages in achieving favorable surface properties and desired material performance which is more practical in industry practice than the fabrication of bulk functional materials or pure structural materials based on the research results published in the literature tailored surface functionalization can achieve unique properties such as surface wetting and morphology roughness biocompatibility catalytic properties and various mechanical properties like hardness wear friction residual stress and fatigue behavior to date only one review paper done by jiang et al 77 discussed surface functionalized 3d printing including robust methodologies outstanding properties and its potential application in different fields based on the advantaged and disadvantages of different strategies listed in table 3 3 of the three strategies surface functionalization highlighted in strategy iii such as deposition grafting and etching has been widely applied in water treatment applications particularly for post treatment to the authors knowledge there is no review has been reported for the synergistic approach of combining 3d printing and surface functionalization for water application considering the gap this review paper will be further discussed on strategy iii as the methods of surface functionalization on 3d printed materials are summarized in fig 3 4 and the surface enhancement properties in table 3 4 followed by a discussion of its application in the subsequent sections 3 4 1 deposition processing deposition processing is a versatile bottom up approach that functionalizes the surface by incorporating a nano and micro scale topography and polyelectrolyte 108 typically various deposition methods can be employed to functionalize the surface of 3d printed materials such as atomic layer deposition ald electroless plating and chemical deposition techniques i e sol gel dip and spin coating thermal deposition i e thermoset coating electrochemical deposition self assembly and induced adsorption ald is a common technique where a metal oxide protective layer is deposited on the targeted surface and recently extended to the membrane surface for wastewater treatment applications 109 and pollutant removal 28 ald processing has been used to deposit a layer of thin film on the carbon nanotubes 110 111 polymers and ceramics 112 113 it is generally used to tune the membrane surface properties membrane thickness and pore size as well as control the chemical composition this eventually helped to achieve advanced separation properties with high rejection efficiency 112 114 and structural stability 115 however this method has a notable drawback of sacrificing the water permeability 115 one of the advantages of the ald process is the flexibility to use moderate to low deposition temperatures which make it compatible with temperature and heat sensitive polymer substrates without affecting their surface properties 116 117 despite the flexibility in changing the temperature this leads to incomplete decomposition and mechanical stability of the printed materials this is due to the nature of self timing of ald which enables the deposition of uniform films with precisely controlled thickness and high conformality according to hu et al 118 self limiting is a property that occurs when all available reactive surface sites are occupied during the ald reaction when the precursors are fully adsorbed on the surface of the substrate a temperature window must be maintained within the constant growth rate to ensure self limiting fig 3 5a the constant growth per cycle and temperature window is required as it offers robustness for the deposition of the film as shown in fig 3 5b the temperature window is responsible for the consistency of growth per cycle however to some extent it might disrupt the proves of the deposition reaction 119 if the temperature is too low a heterogeneous reaction will occur as the precursor may condense and mix with the previous reactant resulting in a loss of self timing since the reaction follows the arrhenius relationship i e the growth rate increases exponentially with temperature a low temperature leads to a low reaction rate and may result in more time being required to reach the activation energy on the other hand too high a reaction temperature destroys the property of self timing because it causes the precursor to detach or even decompose before reacting with other precursors 118 it can be concluded that the precursors must be sufficiently thermal stable and must not decompose during film growth on the substrate in another study ji et al 120 utilized a bottom up approach to deposited polyoxometalate ionic liquids pom as heavy metal binding sites on the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs as shown in fig 3 5c the surface functionalization has improved the hydrophilicity and water adsorption due to the extensive hydrogen bond between both materials the surface hydrophilicity increases with increasing hydrolysis time as represented in fig 3 5d iv from abs 5 with 58 abs 10 37 and abs 15 21 compared to uncoated abs 81 abs x e g abs 5 represent the immersion time of abs for hydrolysis process in minutes in this case abs was immersed in the solution for 5 min based on fig 3 5d v pw9 abs 15 showed interesting dynamic effect where it took only 1 5 s to quickly spread out on the surface and subsequently absorbed into the composite this result showed that abs hydrolysis can enhance the hydrophilic properties as a result a facile route has successfully been developed for the 3d printed polymer porous device in water purification however this research is still at the proof of concept stage and extensive work needs to be done for converting the result into industry applications browne et al 85 applied the ald technique to deposit tio2 on the 3d printed stainless steel electrodes to optimize the photoanode activity a controllable thickness of the 3d printed electrode with arbitrary porosity can be achieved by combining 3d printing and ald fig 3 5e showed the fabrication of 3d printed stainless steel followed by deposition of tio2 at different thickness cycles e g 400 800 and 1200 in the images from sem fig 3 5f i to iv spherical structures can be seen on the 3d printed electrodes the amount of tio2 coating became clearly visible as the number of ald cycles increased this tuning affected the pec water oxidation activity and post processing such as annealing was not required simplifying the synthesis process and allowing direct use as a pec catalyst to date the approach of combining additive manufacturing techniques and ald has only been used in photoelectrochemical pec water oxidation and membrane fabrication this fabrication method can be further explored for other water technologies that require more development at the laboratory and prototype stages chemical deposition techniques such as polymerization spin coating and dip coating are favorable to be applied in large scale industrial operations because they are simple and inexpensive commonly surface coating is used for membranes thin films and meshes to enhance the surface properties such as hydrophilic and hydrophobic prevent wetting and improve antifouling in the long run it will provide mechanical and chemical stability for industrial applications spin coating is another method that deposits uniform and smooth thin films of organic materials on the surface which is typically performed in 4 steps deposition spin up spin off and evaporation 121 lyu et al 122 successfully fabricated a controlled ceramic surface patterned membrane by coating ink on the substrate layer by layer by dip coating for 10s for buffer later and 3 s for the top layer followed by spin coating for 1 min at 4000 rpm the printed membrane with a porous gradient structure showed better antifouling ability the key parameters of printed patterns such as distance and height have a significant impact on the fouling performance the best performance of antifouling ability was demonstrated with 3dp patterned lines perpendicular to the flow direction from the report steady flow is reduced by 53 45 and 50 for perpendicular parallel and angular flow respectively in addition porosimetry evaluation showed that the 3d printed surface patterned membrane was saturated at 0 07 and 0 09 Î¼m the small pores showed that the membrane is suitable for microfiltration and has great potential for wastewater application pore blockage cake filtration model was performed to further analyzed the fouling mechanism it was found that the fouling mechanism evolves from pore blockage n 0 8 1 6 to cake filtration n 0 indicating that the permeability of the membrane can be increased at a constant transmembrane pressure this new and effective approach with simple design structures using 3d printing offers a promising route for practical application in advanced ceramic membranes however the research is currently still in the design phase which requires prototyping and performance data collection before it can be used for larger scale water treatment applications dip coating is a versatile multi material method in coating a freestanding microscopic layer to the substrates the procedure involves submerging the substrate in the precursor solution followed by evaporation to create a layer of a unique thickness kim et al 34 successfully fabricated a 3d printed water filtration system and surface treatment via hydrolysis and iron oxide coating the treatment has increased the hydrophilicity of the channels that facilitates the water flow and improved the amount of fe oh 3 deposition in the internal surface area this results in decreasing the flowrate without external pumping which leads to better arsenic removal and serves as small scale water purification further to this yuan et al 123 coated polyamide 12 particles with a candle soot layer via selective laser sintering the printed functional membrane has shown superoleophobicity and hydrophobic properties with exceptional underwater superoleophobicity after wetting with water after the membrane coated with candle soot the water contact angles were above 120 the superhydrophobicity properties of these candle soot coated membranes improved as the contact angle increased over that of the pure polyamide 12 membrane 101 3 in addition the candle soot modified membrane also has better water permeability and gravity driven flux 3300 l m 2 h 1 to 6700 l m 2 h 1 alongside good mechanical strength and mechanical stability through sonification and sandpaper abrasion test the results showed that no obvious candle soot particles detached after 30 min of sonication and the water contact angle 140 3 remained unchanged after 10 cycles of the abrasion test the tensile strength results showed that the membrane had reasonable mechanical strength which increasing from 2 9 mpa to 4 1 mpa compared with the conventional membrane fabrication by phase inversion method 1 3 mpa 124 chemical stability tests were also carried out by immersing the samples into various solvents such as toluene n hexane dimethyl sulfoxide dmso n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp dimethylformamide dmf and tetrahydrofuran thf for 7 days it was found that the water contact angle remained at 140 and the candle soot particles did not detach in the solvent this demonstrated that the coated candle soot particles were firmly adhered to the membrane surface in another experiment yuan et al 125 used a similar approach to fabricate a superhydrophobic membrane with a switchable wettability on different types of polymers in this case psu via coating of candle soot it was observed that a similar result was reported which proved that the surface treatment is efficient and reliable in water oil separation application despite its tremendous advantages hydrophilic and water repellent properties can only be established if the fresh candle soot wax collected is high in non conductive elements and organic compounds 126 even if it was collected correctly at the middle flame region there is a high chance that the candle soot contains small pah molecules that are highly toxic despite these successes of surface treatment it is difficult or impossible to endow inert materials with surface functionality via individual deposition processes moreover according to zare and kargari 127 the trade off of the modified substrate is unstable due to weak interaction between the coated layer with the substrate surface additionally multi composition surfaces or fabricating micro or nanostructures are critical for further improving the tailored performance of 3d printed devices for practical applications to overcome this chemical treatments i e cross linking or sulfonation are needed to anchor the coating layer or by integrating with hydrothermal surface engineering 3 4 2 etching treatment etching treatment is a top down strategy based on different mechanisms such as surface hanging bonds and functional groups and phase transition to achieve the desired functionalization on a given surface in the wet chemical etching approach the sample is commonly immersed in an acidic or base solution to remove or dissolve material from the substrate 128 129 xing et al 130 successfully enhanced the superhydrophobicity of pla membrane through anisotropic wet chemical etching in acetone and decoration of ps nanospheres the customized and treated membrane provides superhydrophobicity and has excellent mechanical flexibility even after 100 rounds of bending test indicating it is suitable to be used for oil water separation and corrosive aqueous solution the water contact angle of the modified membrane increased significantly from 67 to 147 3 as shown in fig 3 6a it can be seen liquid jet reflection phenomenon appeared when preparing the superhydrophobic surface of pla it was notably observed the water droplet was pinned on the surface with ultra high adhesion force of 380 Î¼n fig 3 6b i and ii whereas in fig 3 6b iii no residue was observed when the liquid drop was pressed and pulled however chemical etching treatment is complex as it can cause chemical contamination depending on the crystal plane orientation and hard to control the etching rate briefly wet chemical etching can be divided into two types a anisotropic and b isotropic in anisotropic etching anisotropic etchants such as potassium hydroxide koh tetramethylammonium hydroxide tmah and ethylenediamine pyrocatechol edp etch at different rates in different directions in isotropic etching isotropic etchants such as nitric acid acetic acid and hydrofluoric acid hf etch in the same direction edp is a type of etchant that is carcinogenic and corrosive which can rust any metal and difficult to remove as it leaves brown stains on the surface based on the literature tmah is the most preferred etchant to be used as it exhibits low toxicity and compatible with metal oxide it is capable to form perfect wafer squares but it requires longer processing time thus it is important to choose right etchant based on the materials and desired application wagner 131 reported that the etch rate of both types of etching varies depending on the plane of the crystalline material and the etchant concentration although isotropic etching is faster than anisotropic etching it is difficult to precisely control the etch rate 131 therefore isotropic etching is generally used to remove pre damaged surfaces round pre etched sharp corners produce large geometries and fabricate the structures on single crystal lattices anisotropic etching on the other hand is more precise but the etch rate depends on the orientation of the crystal plane if the orientation of the wafer does not meet the process requirements the formation of the cavity will not have the desired properties as a result it is critical to carefully select the type of etching because the etch rate is affected by the temperature and concentration of the solution which affects the final shape of the cavity with the desired depth 132 plasma etching is a material removal technique using the plasma generated from different gaseous media such as air 133 oxygen 134 ammonia and nitrogen 135 conventional wet chemical etching releases chemical wastes which require an adequate waste treatment process the advantages of plasma etching techniques include selective etching high and controllable etching rate precise etching at a small scale 10 nm and no contamination and hazardous issues plasma etching can be employed on polymeric materials to achieve desired surface chemistry morphology and structures 136 according to chu et al 137 o2 plasma treatment has been proved as an efficient and useful surface modification to form oxygen functionalities onto polymeric materials via ion implantation w jo 138 applied o2 plasma etching treatment to produce micro nanoscale structured rough surfaces on the 3d printed mesh filters the treated surface exhibited different surface wettability fig 3 6c d of superhydrophobic and superoleophilic properties fig 3 6e f which increased oil water separation efficiency however in the paper the separation efficiency percentage was not reported in another work done by 84 direct recovery of spilled oil using hierarchically porous oil scoop with capillary induced anti oil fouling was developed via 3d printing and subsequently oxygen plasma etching was applied to fabricate nanopillars on the fibre surface it has been reported that over 95 of the spilled oil is recovered from the oil contaminated water outperforming the efficiency of commercial oil absorbents in terms of oil removal and recovery rates hence the 3d printed oil scoop has the potential to be a promising solution for oil spill response in the oceans and rivers overall the reported study proved that the combination of plasma treatment and 3d printing in improving the efficiency of oil removal and the filtration and recovery device can potentially be employed as a practical separation in the industry electron beam etching methods have been widely used to improve the biological properties and quality of the printed parts by a creating surface topography on the microstructures b reducing surface roughness and grain size 100 and c producing antifouling biocompatible 99 and corrosion resistant surface 101 shahbazi et al 139 used electron beam irradiation to crosslink acrylic acid graft copolymers into the structure of a high performance 3d network nanohydrogel the printed alginate clay g poly acrylic acid nanocomposite ink was irradiated at different doses in a static mode of the conveyor belt using a rhodotron type electron accelerator machine at room temperature the irradiated ink has shown improvement in structural strength due to the high extent of crosslinking density of the chains from the result the high density of the cross linked network at 45 kgy was reported to have great water resistance and low water solubility indicating the structure is stiff and capable to withstand mechanical deformation during printing including improvement in thermal stability and crystalline properties after printing this can conclude that the irradiation treatment significantly improves the quality of the printed superabsorbent hydrogel with a promising strategy to be applied in removing heavy metals in a short period in summary surface functionalization aided by etching offers great postprocessing techniques as its low cost requires a simple process with high feature resolution the problem with these approaches is the difficulty of efficiently and evenly etching complex 3d structures particularly hierarchical porous structures additionally it is hard to control the etching rate as it may affecting the mechanical properties of the printed parts and cause low feature resolution 3 4 3 surface grafting surface grafting as a bottom up approach has been used to perform interfacial modification by either adding onto or growing the polymer chain from the material surface to achieve a desired surface property such as anti fouling 140 chemical stability super wetting biocompatibility and antibacterial property 141 which find its applications in membrane technology 142 environmental remediation 143 adsorption and oil separation 138 silanization or silane treatment is a liquid or vapor phase chemical reaction for surface grafting 144 the technique has been widely used in surface functionalization due to its simplicity and cost effectiveness a broad range of chemical functionalities could be formed on the surface using different types of silane coupling agents different functional groups to enhance the mechanical properties 145 148 cross linked density 149 thermal stability improve wettability 99 and dispersion stability 146 147 150 the surface activation through hydrolysis of the alkoxy group is crucial to have the good formation of silanization piranha solution is commonly hydroxylation method utilized to remove unbound and adsorbed surface contamination before surface activation and after silane treatment 151 moreover silane coupling agent also can act as surface modifier to improve hydrophobic property of the materials 152 which is favorable characteristics in water treatment zhang d et al 67 used a hybrid silane solution which is 3 glycidyloxypropyl trimethoxysilane gptms and 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane aptms as coupling agents the silane coupling is to graft chitosan on the flat skew hexagonal monolithic structure for heavy metal adsorption application the deposited of the grafted chitosan were confirmed via characterization studies of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir scanning electron microscopy sem x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps zhang et al successfully fabricated an optimal design of a 3d porous structure with polymer chelation properties that exhibits high specific sorption capacity with fast reaction and superior diffusion resistance however the mechanical properties of the modified 3d printed monolithic structure were not reported in this research in another study figuerola et al 153 utilized the surface grafting method to immobilize polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf derived carbons that act as a binder on the 3d printed ceramic support and subsequent calcination the pvdf c coated 3d printed ceramic device has good thermal stability as it can withstand temperatures above 1273 k with no apparent weight loss based on the uv vis spectrophotometer reading the intensity of the signal is always zero indicating it is chemically stable and can be used in extraction applications this study demonstrates that surface grafting can be used on ceramic supports under optimal grafting conditions this method can overcome the limitation of functional porous solids becoming embedded in the binder which limits overall performance hydrogel is an example of a hydrophilic material that contains a crosslinked network that is full of water it is commonly applied to increase wettability to achieve better efficiency in oil water separation yan et al 154 exploits such an advantage to coat hydrogel on the 3d printed membrane in acrylic acid aa and acrylamide am solution the coating has enhanced the demulsification of oil in water emulsions and improved the underwater oil contact angle of superhydrophilic and underwater superoleophobic over 150 c with a low adhesion force 1 Î¼n and rolling angle of 15 there are also no oil drops on the superoleophobic mesh during the oil receding thus the results showed that the mesh has excellent underwater repellency and is easy to roll off from the surface which is a promising strategy for oil water separation although hydrogel has great performance several technical hurdles such as process design implications and optimizing conditions of the preparation process shall be examined further for wider adoption as new separation technology in conclusion surface grafting can be further utilized to achieve functional surfaces with tailored unique features however the drawback of this strategy is that it required compatible active materials such as modifier or crosslinker to graft with the 3d printed materials without compromising the intrinsic properties of 3d printed structure impacting the 3d printing process and resolution apart from that a lot of residuals of unreacted compounds could occur and need to be completely removed through the leaching process and cause chemical waste and pollution which is not practical for real application 3 4 4 biofilm formation biofilms is a multicellular stage of growth in the life cycle of bacteria it is commonly well attached to bio carriers surfaces in which many microorganisms form a microbial community with a specific function it generally serves as the main body to degrade organic pollutants and convert nutrients in natural and artificial bioprocesses after the inoculation period a biofilm layer will attach to the surface of the bio carrier commonly the 3d printed materials will be inoculated in a bacteria media i e activated sludge fisheries for biofilm growth before being used as a bio carrier tang et al 155 studied about the biofilm s characteristic on the carrier during its growing cycle which in turn affects the degradation of pollutant performance proano pena et al 156 fabricated different configurations of 3d printed bio carrier that were then inoculated with a nitrifying bacteria community in another work singh et al 157 introduced functional biofilm coating by immersing a 3d printed catalytic static mixer in bovine serum albumin bsa solution the bsa prepared printed csm was dipped into the zeolitic imidazolate frameworks zif 8 precursor solution for 1 min and dried under a flow of n2 gas the biomimetic mineralization mediated mof encapsulation is the key to this technology it physically protects the active enzyme while improving its ability to adhere to the device surface making it a simple robust and versatile fabrication technique that can be used in organic pollutant degradation applications overall surface functionalized 3d printing postprocessing methods like etching deposition surface grafting and others have been extensively used to produce a variety of structural materials with distinctive properties some of the techniques were used as first level modification techniques to preferentially change surface morphologies and physicochemical characteristics for ensuing functional postprocessing while others were used as second level postprocessing techniques to produce other flexible features furthermore in terms of surface properties different approaches have distinct functionalization capacities it is worth noting that combining surface functionalization methods can lead to synergistic mechanisms that improve the overall performance of devices and components as a result this effective approach will be a powerful route to further improve and meet industrial demand 4 recent advances of scientific and innovative functionalized 3d printed materials for water application functionalized 3d printing technology has emerged as an efficient fabrication technique in water treatment owing to its simplicity and novelty in designing geometrically complex parts in a single step as opposed to the time consuming traditional manufacturing methods most importantly additive manufacturing can help to reduce material waste because it uses only the material needed to print the object nonetheless it emits particulates such as volatile organic compound from the main material and ultra fine particle emission which must be addressed in order to reduce the environmental impact of the process 168 the recent advancements that take the approach of combining 3d printing and pre post treatment for performance enhancement in water treatment are summarized in table 4 1 alongside the pros and cons of the application based on the proposed system and the performance efficiency including its reusability and recyclability from fig 4 1 it can be concluded that sla fdm and sls are the most preferred printing techniques to be utilized for fabrication and the chemical modification method is widely utilized for the post treatment as shown in fig 4 1 various industries have shown an interest in serial production aided with fdm compared to other printing techniques although it has been proven that sla is most preferred due to its precision and better quality of printing as shown in figs 4 1 and 4 2 a detailed guideline was given from material selection recommended printing technique and lastly further post treatment to be applied based on 3 different routes chemical physical or biological functionalization from this guideline the researchers can further develop based on their research of interest and opportunities in utilizing additive manufacturing and surface functionalization for various applications specifically in water treatment the following section will be discussing on the emerging application of functionalized 3d printed materials in water application i e heavy metal removal dye removal oil water separation specifically on its performance efficiency maximum reusability and recyclability and characterization study 4 1 heavy metal removal industrial discharge contains a variety of organic and inorganic contaminants heavy metals which can be poisonous and or carcinogenic to humans and other living things 169 the heavy metals from various sectors that are most concerning are copper cu lead pb zinc zn cadmium cd arsenic as nickel ni chromium cr and mercury hg 170 these heavy metals need to be filtered to meet the legislation limits set by the department of environment hence various water treatment processes such as chemical oxidation and reduction ion exchange reverse osmosis electrodialysis ultrafiltration and adsorption have been developed zhang d et al 67 investigated on copper cu removal by using highly porous and reusable 3d printed monolithic structure with silane coupling agent as a crosslinker followed by chitosan immobilization as shown in fig 4 3a based fig 4 3b skewed hexagonal holes has the highest adsorption capacity of 13 2 mg g within 60 min of contact time compared to other two different structures with round and square holes that can only achieve 9 3 mg g and 9 8 mg g respectively this is due to high surface area and porosity of the surface the outcome of the study was also reflected based on the characterization study of sem as shown in fig 4 3c where from fig 4 3c i to iii a cranky layer of chitosan can be clearly observed as compared to before grafting process showed in fig 4 3c iv further confirmation of chitosan deposition on monolithic structure and ascertain material composition were done using xps study based on all obtained evidence as represented by high resolution xps spectra of n 1s o 1s and c 1s it can firmly confirm that a dense and uniform layer of chitosan was deposited on the surface of the 3d printed sample on top of that it was also reported that the monolithic structure has excellent recyclability and reusability as the performance retained between 13 7 mg g to around 11 mg g after four filtration cycles due to strong bond formed between chitosan and epoxy group leading to a robust mechanism of adsorption performance fig 4 3d illustrated the adsorption desorption cycles of cu ii removal retained at above 90 indicating it is recyclable and stable kim et al 34 modified 3d printed potable and small scale water purification unit surface by using iron iii oxide as an adsorbent for arsenic removal as illustrated in fig 4 3e the 3d printed filter has a rust like color after adsorption of iron oxide iii indicating that the iron oxide was absorbed on the filter the morphology results showed that the roughness of the filter surface increases as arsenic elements are seen on the filter fig 4 3e i to ii the proposed system can achieve removal rate of 96 2 within a short period of time based on the results the removal percentage is highly affected by the channel width of the 3d printed filter fig 4 3f showed the adsorption equilibrium of the 3d printed filter with different channel widths from 0 8 to 4 0 mm it was found that the equilibrium was reached after 2 min for filters for adsorption of as iii with channel width of 0 8 mm and 1 0 mm the narrower the channel width the shorter the time required to reach equilibrium however as mentioned by kim et al a channel that is too narrow requires more time for the pretreatment process because the elution process requires several repeated processes therefore it is important to choose a channel width that can be fabricated and subjected to the functionalization treatment in this case 0 8 mm was chosen for efficient pretreatment on top of that sufficient elution time is required in the adsorptive filter system to allow the arsenic and contaminated water to interact with the iron oxide particles it was observed that when 500 ml containing 20 mg l arsenic in the contaminated water passed through the filter the filtration rate remained below 48 even with channel width of 0 8 mm as shown in fig 4 3g which was in contrast when the experiment was idle for 3 h when treating extremely polluted water it was suggested that a rate controller be used to maximize filtration power the residence time can be controlled by varying the mesh pattern in the rate controller s outlet resulting in better removal efficiency moreover the 3d printed filter system could maintain the adsorption capacities at 86 and 77 after the 2nd and 3rd repeated recycling processes respectively fig 4 3h the promising result is due to the narrow channels which increase the internal surface area allowing more iron oxide iii to be deposited on the internal filter in another study reported by ji et al 120 a functionalized 3d printed hierarchical porous device using lacunary polyoxometalate anions can remove transition metal pollutants co ni and cu from water at 44 2 40 5 and 67 respectively however the drawback is the proposed system required longer time over a period of 12 h to achieve higher removal percentage although the decentralized system can be another facile route to convert commercial 3d printed polymers into macroporous ones the current results are not promising for the use of the technology in industry and require extensive work to further develop the currently proposed approach material properties such as mechanical strength chemical stability as well as process parameters can be investigated first to identify the adsorption mechanism before scaling up shahbazi et al 139 fabricated a 3d printed crosslinked alginate nanoclay hydrogel using electron beam irradiation to adsorb pb ii from wastewater this novel 3d printed functional hydrogel showed a fast and higher adsorption capacity of 481 mg g at an irradiance of 5 kgy the adsorption equilibrium could be achieved within 10 min of contact time shahbazi et al also studied the effect of adsorption of pb ii in a high impurities synthetic wastewater containing other heavy metals the adsorption capacity of pb ii was reported to be half that of the original indicating that the printed hydrogel is not selective in the removal of heavy metals and thus can be a potential adsorbent for the removal of various metal ions however the test of reusability of this printed hydrogel has not been reported which may hinder its practical use in industry 4 2 oil water separation oil water separation has received a lot of attention in recent years due to significant water pollution caused by the frequent discharge of industrial oily effluent and risk of accidental oil spills into the marine environment 171 the water contains 10 of oil which is coming from the surfactants in the environment through emulsify process in the water phase and cannot be directly discharged directly to the environment mesh based materials spacers and membranes are some of the most promising approaches for oil water separation technology the porous membrane in particular will function as a filter capturing suspended materials while allowing water to pass through as a result substantial research is being conducted in order to establish a simple and effective fabrication approach for producing membranes with excellent selectivity and permeability all the aforementioned properties can be achieved by utilizing additive manufacturing technology and introduction of surface functionalization this approach can offer flexible design improve super wetting property i e hydrophilicity hydrophobicity enhance antifouling property that is crucial features for membrane lifetime and efficiency yan et al 143 customized 3d printing oil skimmer to collect and remove different types of oil as demonstrated in fig 4 4a surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to modify the surface of the 3d printed mesh to increase hydrophobicity based on sem images shown in fig 4 4a i and ii it can be observed that the solution deposited on the surface indicating that the modification process is successful an alternative oil collection test was used to demonstrate the durability of the oil skimmer as shown in fig 4 4b where all oils were successfully collected from the water without the need to clean the mesh in between it was claimed that the performance of oil removal could reach 97 6 fig 4 4c with great reusability as the oil separation stability retained after 10 cycles 90 as shown in fig 4 4d the collected oil was placed at the bottom of the vessel indicating that the vessel s dimensions determine the oil capacity besides that yan et al further investigated by preparing 3d printed meshes with further treatment via hydrogel coating for oil water separation 154 surface polymerization of fe ii mediated redox reaction was used in the treatment hydrogel was chosen as the crosslinked network to promote wettability properties due to its water holding capabilities yan et al also discovered that synchronizing the demulsification and separation processes resulted in more collisions between neighbouring emulsions with inorganic salts leading to better and efficient separation of oil in water mixtures fig 4 4e illustrated the synchronous demulsification and separation process with optical microscopy of water permeating through s usm mesh it was reported that the separation efficiency can be achieved up to 85 with great repeatability at approximately 90 after 15 cycles as stated in fig 4 4f and g respectively the main objective of this study is to prepare a simple s usm by in situ method and investigate its wettability and separation performance which can be further developed to be used in daily life in another study xing et al 130 used fused deposition modelling fdm to fabricate a lotus lead inspired superhydrophobic porous membrane the printed membrane was then chemically etched and subsequently decorated with polystyrene nanospheres fig 4 4h depicted a bright field optical microscope image of a 3d printed pla membrane before and after etching using acetone it was discovered that the porosity of the printed membrane decreases as the pore size decreases which contradict with the concept of membrane however the pore size of the printed membrane can be tuned via controlling printing infill setting and nozzle diameter parameters the pore size of the membrane is strongly influenced by the width of the actual filament and the distance between two adjacent filaments the results shown in fig 4 4i indicates that as the membrane pore size increases from 40 to 600 Î¼m the flux also increases due to lower flow resistance however the separation efficiency decreases with increasing pore size this can be explained by a decrease in the membrane ability to repel water which also responsible to the instability of the flux measurement the separation efficiency and flux were found to be maintained at 250 Î¼m resulting in an oil water separation efficiency of 99 4 and a high flux of 60 kl m 2 h 1 in addition the recyclability was tested with a hexane water mixture the result showed that the modified 3d printed pla membrane achieved a separation efficiency of about 95 after 10 cycles as shown in fig 4 4j although it was declared that the membrane has excellent chemical tolerance mechanical durability and relatively low cost further justification and scale up are needed to further develop for industrial scale application yuan et al 123 established a robust switchable wettability of the robust membrane functionalized with candle soot by selective laser sintering of a 3d printed membrane for the separation of multiphase liquid mixtures the modified 3d printed membrane showed a high separation efficiency of 99 1 and retained its performance after 10 cycles as shown in fig 4 4k based on fig 4 4l the separation of the oil water mixture can be observed when the water passed through the n hexane which was repelled above the vessels due to the immiscibility of the two solvents when the water has penetrated the candle soot layer it forms a water layer and subsequently repels the hexane the water layer also absorbs water when it interacts with the n hexane water mixtures this functional tuning membrane has a high solvent resistance and can be used to separate immiscible organic mixtures therefore this strategy of fusing polymers with functional nanoparticles in 3d printing is very promising and is expected to be further explored for various separations in water and environmental remediation as a conclusion the combination of 3d printing and post treatment has demonstrated that this synergistic approach can be explored for broader integration in the synthesis of functional 3d printed membranes and meshes for oil water separation due to the above excellent properties 4 3 dye removal a lot of extensive works done by researchers to synthesize 3d printed materials to offer the purpose in dye removal especially in textile industry for example wang et al 159 developed simple and complex coated 3d printed acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs frameworks the printed skewer was then coated with cu btc via in situ stepwise coating after that the cu btc abs was used as an absorbent to remove methylene blue from an aqueous solution wang et al found that the removal efficiency of mb solutions was high reaching 98 3 and 93 3 for the 5 and 10 mg l concentrations respectively within 10 min this work uses abs extensively in synthesizing the cu btc abs composites hence the ability of the abs polymer to be recycled is critical for its practical applications the mb removal efficiency remained over 58 10 mg l and 68 5 mg l after 5 cycles although the results for reusability and recyclability did not show a good value the adsorbent can be easily separated without requiring centrifugation filtration or magnetic separation this study demonstrates that the cu btc abs composite may be an effective adsorbent for environmental cleanup and that 3d printing may be a quick and environmentally friendly way to create new functional composites for uses other than adsorption in another study shi et al 69 developed similar approach by fabricating 3d printed metal organic frameworks mof with polylactic acid pla where cu mofs are coated on the surface via in situ step by step growth to remove malachite green mg from water in this study the printed pla skeleton were coated with different layers of mof fig 4 5a illustrated the sem images of cu mofs crystals after in situ stepwise coating it can clearly be seen that there are octahedral crystals on the pla surface indicating the cu mofs can growth efficiently on the pla surface after multilayer of coatings via in situ process the removal effectiveness of mg was determined to be 90 within 10 min fig 4 5b the coated pla sheet with cu mofs has high removal efficiency with spontaneous adsorption it was discovered that the color of the pla skeleton changed to pure white during recyclability test using hcl solution and sem imaging revealed a smooth surface as shown in fig 4 5c the film can also be washed in acetone and can be reused up to five times fig 4 5d although it has excellent capability of removal within short period of time however it needs to recoat again for regeneration process and the removal efficiency decrease from one cycle to another cycle or repetition apart from that photocatalysis for water and environmental remediation recently has gained attention among researchers due to rapid technical improvement cost effective and can be widely used for various application phang et al 161 studied on the 3d printed photoreactor with thermoset coating using g c3n4 homojunction for rhb dye degradation and total organic carbon toc removal the photoreactor was fabricated using digital light printing dlp technique followed by coating with a thin film of immobilized gcn based thermoset coating on the base of the photoreactor according to the structure of the surface morphology the surface of the hdt resin has a homogeneous fibrous texture as shown in fig 4 5e i and ii respectively the fibrous texture was indicative of a typical polymer resin sem images of the gcn based thermoset coating depicted dense and aggregated gcn4 structure fig 4 5e iii fig 4 4e iv clearly showed interconnected mesopores with laminar structure edx analysis was further investigated to scan the elemental composition the edx spectra revealed that the hdt resin contains only c and o whereas the 3d printed photocatalyst coated with a gcn based thermoset coating showed the presence of the additional element n furthermore under the irradiation of a 50 w led the modified photocatalytic system successfully degraded 95 62 of rhb dye and 78 56 of toc in 24 h fig 4 5f phang et al also found that the operating conditions can be made more time and cost efficient by eliminating the additional centrifugation step to recover the photocatalyst the photoactivity reusability test showed that the original photocatalytic efficiency was maintained at 98 5 with no significant decrease in photochemical degradation performance even after 5 consecutive cycles as illustrated in fig 4 5g fig 4 5h showed the comparison between the 3d printed reactor before and after the recyclability test although it has excellent photoactivity and photostability it needs longer photocatalytic time to achieve maximum degradation hence further investigation is required to optimize the performance through post treatment via surface functionalization selection of optimum operational parameters selection of materials and printing parameters the gcn based thermoset coating was found to be intact and securely adhered to the base of the 3d printed photoreactor another 3d printed photocatalytic activity was developed by kumbhakar et al 164 showed great photodegradation efficiency with 91 removal for mixed dye followed by rhb dye 88 mb dye 81 and mo dye 54 within 20min this work takes the approach of using different scaffold designs and surface grown nanomaterials via in situ growth of zno nanoflakes the various geometrical configurations offered by 3d printing that have a higher surface to volume ratio can further improve the process efficiency however in this work mechanical and chemical stability of the material were not reported in this study which is crucial for real application nevertheless this research work paves a way for introducing a sustainable approach by integrating 3d printing and photocatalysis for water application and environmental remediation 4 4 micropollutants degradation micropollutants such as biocides pharmaceuticals and personal care products commonly can be found in wastewater treatment plants and removed through biological treatment processes 172 173 according to analytical surveys based on previous studies many polar organic micropollutants are not or are only partially removed in conventional wastewater treatment which is then discharged into rivers and streams consequently this will have a negative impact on aquatic ecosystems and human health hence a novel process configuration is much needed to increase the degradation capacity to improve micropollutants removal this could be achieved through additive manufacturing fabrication as specific size geometry and porosity can be tailored based on the function in bioreactor system bio carriers play a crucial role in controlling the effectiveness of water pollution removal through its specific surface area and topology proano pena et al 156 evaluated the performance of 3 d printed biofilter media bio carriers with various surface area design for the nitrification process in the wastewater treatment proano pena et al used material jetting technique to fabricate gyroid carrier there is a limited selection of materials that can be used which has an impact on the effectiveness of a bio carrier this technique only allows using photocurable resins which have the ideal viscosity for better printing in this research work three different experimental configurations were tested on the biocarriers for converting ammonia to nitrate in a series of batch reactors constant fill ratio biocarrier media count and total surface area the results showed that the best performing biocarrier design had ammonia nitrogen conversion rates of 99 33 for large ssa gyroid with constant fill ratio 94 74 for medium ssa gyroid with constant total surface area and 92 73 for large ssa gyroid with constant bio carrier media count at 8 h it is also demonstrated that the specific surface area of the bio carrier was correlated with the ammonia conversion performance with the highest rates of ammonia conversion 99 33 and nitrate production 2 7 mg l for manufactured gyroid bio carriers with a specific surface area that is 1980 5 m2 m3 however since these experiments were done within 8 h further study is required to determine the bio carriers performance over the long term using similar printing techniques and materials to fabricate different types of gyroid structures with different specific surface areas elliott et al compared the effectiveness of gyroid media to the conventional k1 kaldnes carrier in terms of nh3 removal rate preliminary results from a single run showed that the spherical gyroid removes twice as much nh3 as the k1 kaldnes at 1 620 ppm and 0 710 ppm respectively moreover it has also been reported that the surface roughness of the gyroid structure which has a bio multi sloped carrier s surface has increased resulting in increased biofilm adhesion the use of acrylate based resins to fabricate the biocarrier has also affected the biofilm adhesion the biocarrier with a negative surface charged inhibits microbial adhesion this outcome was similarly reported by zhang et al as it further confirmed that the increase in the biofilm attachment and shorter biofilm formation is promoted by the positive surface charged of the bio carrier biocarrier 174 hence based on the literature it can be concluded that when a small area is present microbial growth and functionality are stimulated which in turn increasing overall process yield on the other hand tang et al 155 designed a spindle shaped semi suspended bio carrier that had a unique impact on the traits of the attached biofilm throughout its entire growth cycle the biofilm formation can be observed as early as day 6 of its growing cycle as compared to a traditional suspended bio carrier after 12 days of continuous operation the biofilm in both zones thickened and the color of the biofilm deepened from white to light brown and light pink as depicted in fig after 30 days the biofilm on the bio carriers thickened and turned into dark brown based on its bioreactor performance in the first ten days cod removal increased to 80 then increased to 90 and finally decreased at the end of the life cycle of the microorganism total nitrogen tn removal was also reported to follow a similar pattern showing a mix of aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the reactor tang et al also found that the composition of the microbial community also differs depending on the position of the biofilm structure and shape of the bio carriers tang et al reported that biofilm was easily attached to the media due to the carriers semi suspended state which prevents collision however these studies concentrated on biofilm formation rather than taking the consideration of surface roughness and wettability bernasconi et al 167 fabricated various multifunctional micro robotics using the sla process at a laser speed of 250 4300 mm s and a printing layer thickness of 10 25 mm and subsequently coated with nanocoating of silver titania for bacterial degradation in water based on photocatalytic activity the silver titania coated microrobot has sped up rhb degradation and demonstrated a potential application for gram negative bacterial population control with a cell viability of 94 this microdevice also can be used to control and purify water inside canalizations and small water reservoirs the 3d printed microdevice was successfully produced in 30 min and had excellent physical integrity and reproducibility under the sem and optical microscope the dimension deviation between the actual printed microdevices and the theoretical design is 20 Î¼m showing that the fabrication method is highly accurate singh et al 157 took a different approach by creating a precision engineered device that integrates a catalytic enzyme onto a 3d printed polymer matrix to optimize continuous fluid mixing the combination of both additive manufacturing and bio surface functionalization approaches has yielded a 3d catalytic static mixer csm coated in a mof enzyme complex the static mixer was explicitly developed for the flow process industry to improve solution mixing through intimate turbulent mixing increased flow rates and improved efficiency over multiple run cycles based on the research findings the substrate conversion rate increased rapidly over the first 4 h reaching nearly 90 conversion by the first 9 h it then increased gradually over the following 24 h equilibrating at 100 conversion this concept for practical continuous bioremediation and real time monitoring can be applied to any mof that can be anchored onto the 3d support structure and any bioactive molecule that can be encapsulated within the respective mof for large volumes of wastewater bioremediation such devices can be easily realized with the help of industrial scale 3d printers and stacked in series and parallel and packed into bed reactors the key to this research is using biomimetic mineralization mediated mof encapsulation that physically protects the active enzyme while improving its ability to adhere to the device surface making it a simple robust and versatile fabrication technique 4 5 other pollutants removal figuerola et al 153 fabricated ceramic 3d printed supports using the sla technique based on a matrix of interconnected small cubes as a proof of concept coated with a pvdf dmf mixture that simultaneously serves as a binder and source of carbon the coated media was heated in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain highly robust and functional carbon coated devices the prepared pvdf derived carbon coated ceramic 3d printed devices were tested to extract various organic pollutants such as bisphenol a some dyes and pharmaceuticals this coated device which can be easily retrieved by simply applying a magnetic field demonstrated high performance with a maximum adsorption capacity of 122 5 mg g 98 9 and fast kinetics for bisphenol a extraction it also showed excellent reusability with its adsorption capacity remained unchanged of above 90 after ten extraction cycles although it showed promising results it required a high maintenance procedure as the recovered supports needed to be recoated with carbon for another cycle of extraction of organic pollutants however this research has portrayed water technology s long term stability and durability moreover the developed coating method allows for the immobilization of a highly porous carbon on it in a quick simple and efficient manner in short 3d printing technologies for water treatment applications have a great potential for manufacturing usage and industrial application however the development is still at the infant stage which requires more work to be done some researchers have developed the technologies by integrating 3d printing and further improved by post treatment using surface functionalization for better performance surface roughness and mechanical properties but there is still a gap that requires room for improvement to produce a central system without compromising either its chemical and mechanical properties and production in the nanoscale field i e pore size this review has summarized the key development and current trend of the technologies for functionalized 3d printing for water treatment and can be a reference for other researchers to further develop 5 challenges and future perspectives the adoption of additive manufacturing for water treatment applications has shown significant growth in the industry including surface functionalization of 3d printed using physical and chemical modifications many current studies have investigated and demonstrated the potential of surface functionalized 3d printable materials as emerging and innovative water treatment methods of industrial standard despite the rapid development challenges such as materials selection additive manufacturing procedure and resolution require continuous improvements an important diagram representing the development of surface functionalized 3d printing materials systems or water treatment applications is shown in fig 5 1 firstly the mechanical stability and durability of 3d printed structures continue to be critical issues in creating robust and functional layers that promote interfacial adhesion between 3d structures further research is necessary to study and understand the mechanisms in enhancing interfacial bonding when a surface functionalized strategy is used previous studies have revealed the effective interfacial bonding for polymeric materials is via the chemical approach for example the adhesive mechanism in low surface energy polymeric materials is not adequately understood which could limit the wider applications of the material besides stability of the 3d printed materials in extreme conditions such as strong acidic and alkaline media is crucial as the substrates produced by 3d printing play a significant role in defining the functional and structural features of the water treatment device in addition the long term durability and safety measures also need to be considered when dealing with wastewater treatment applications 5 the second issue is the high production cost for larger scale applications the high cost is further complicated by the limitation of materials available for 3d printing as the conventional membrane or microfluidic technology usually used only polymeric materials such as pvdf ptfe pes and polyamide the recent advance in printing multiple materials with different properties and functions are much anticipated and may be adopted in 3d printing to improve the performance and mechanical strength 5 therefore the development of next generation 3d printed materials of low cost environmental friendly and scalable requires a detailed and careful consideration of different surface functionalization methods and suitable polymer materials thirdly it is challenging to meet multidimensional demands during practical implementation which typically requires a complex structure with high feature resolution however the current attempts in surface functionalized 3d printing were highly targeted to specific applications to this end developing a more universal surface functionalization method that suits a wider range of materials become increasingly important therefore the development of multifunctional 3d printed devices and components that utilize functional induced biomaterials combined with desirable surface modified functionality could be a promising approach a substantial effort in synthesis modification and post synthetic functionalization involving the attachment or incorporation of specific functional groups as adsorbents has been proven successfully in ionic pollutants removal in addition the surface modifying agents method like grafting can form cooperative and multi beneficial functional groups and could be an effective way of forming a chelating and strong bond to both polar and non polar surface character of the pollutants 176 therefore surface functionalized with the integration of 3d printing has shown an avenue that has promising direction in this field many studies that have been done in recent years are only at the lab and prototyping stage which will be the key development for further investigation to focus on developing a versatile commercial product the surface functionalization method of post 3d printing is also still limited to certain types of materials i e polymer metallic surface which need to be explored for industrial scale production two main aspects will be the key ultimate goals in the future manufacturing high resolution and cost effective advanced am technologies and constructing a robust and universal surface functionalization for functional and desirable surfaces that can easily be scaled up on top of that the current experimental work is still lab testing and using an aqueous solution as part of the performance analysis more research can be done to test with real effluent or wastewater as this is crucial to test the performance before scaling into the prototype stage this is because wastewater samples containing different concentrations of impurities may affect the mechanical strength of the printer parts especially for polymeric materials as they may experience inflammation when submerged in the water due to the hydrophilic behavior in the future high performance emerging surface functionalized 3d printed materials will be the cofactor in designing an innovative centralized system of functional devices and components to be employed in water treatment applications therefore an in depth study that focuses on surface functionalization that has unique features with similar surface chemistry and interactions needs to be explored in detail including developing a standard manufacturing principle as there is plenty of room for the development to be paved as the potential commercial products to meet the actual demand furthermore functionalized 3d water technology should be thoroughly explored for use in emerging applications focusing on surface features such as photoelectrochemical water splitting water harvesting desalination and water harvesting on top of that the evolution of am technologies to 4d and 5d printing can be done to overcome the limitations mentioned above under optimal printing conditions 4d printing can self assemble or change shape over time in response to the right stimuli i e light temperature pressure magnetic fields in the case of 5d printing it is the extension of 3d printing with a rotatable printing bed of x y and z axes to print complex and curvy surfaces hence the new responsiveness to stimuli via 4d and 5d printing with better structures and novel architectural designs with more functionalities can be employed in water treatment

12679,the nitrogen removal of bioretention system brs mainly depends on various microorganisms among which complete ammonia oxidization bacteria comammox are important nitrogen removers however the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs have been rarely studied and its role in ammonia oxidation is unknown in this study 18 field brss were investigated to distinguish the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira followed by a mesocosm bioretention experiment to examine the variation in the abundance of comammox nitrospira after rainfall event the results showed that 1 comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes were widely distributed in the field brss with the absolute abundance of 4 72 102 to 9 97 103 copies g 1 dry soil 2 within 12 24 h after rainfall event comammox nitrospira increased rapidly and its growth rate was even higher than that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 3 a total of 20 operational taxonomic units otus of comammox nitrospira amoa genes were detected in the field brss these otus were classified as nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 on phylogeny except one unique otu the other otus were phylogenetically similar to the sequences detected in wetlands 4 different otus responded differently to soil physicochemical factors indicating the environmental adaptability of comammox nitrospira these results were helpful to improve the understanding of microbial nitrogen transformation pathways and their roles in brs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira bioretention system microbial community phylogenetic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bioretention system brs known as rain garden is a layered facility composed of plants planting soil sand bed gravel sump and drainage layer as one of the most important low impact development lid facilities brs has been widely applied to purify urban rainfall runoff at its source 1 it has been proved to be effective in removing various pollutants in urban runoff such as phosphorus suspended solids chemical oxygen demand and heavy metals 2 however the removal efficiency of nitrogenous pollutants is low and unstable which has been widely concerned in stormwater management 3 5 microorganisms play a key role in nitrogen transformation in brs 6 a better understanding of the abundance and diversity of nitrogen cycling microbial communities in brs is necessary to unveil the mechanism of changes in nitrogen removal efficiency ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were found widely distributed in brs 7 and their abundance and diversity in brs were dissected in the previous studies 3 in addition to aoa and aob a new ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira was then discovered in deep petroleum well and circulating aquaculture system 8 9 in later studies comammox nitrospira was found widely distributed in natural freshwater e g wetland and lake water 10 terrestrial ecosystems e g forest soil and paddy water 11 and river sediments 12 comammox nitrospira can independently complete the entire ammonia oxidation process in purification cultivation 8 9 furthermore kits et al 13 and palomo et al 14 reported that comammox nitrospira had a higher affinity for ammonia and oxygen than most aob and aoa and it showed a competitive advantage in environments with low ammonia and trace oxygen however comammox nitrospira and its role in ammonia oxidation in brs have not been reported so far the ecological environment of brs is similar to wetland agricultural soil and forest soils it can be speculated that comammox nitrospira may exist in brs and has a certain effect on nitrification in addition the processes of microbial nitrogen transformation in brs mainly occur in the dry period after rain 4 to reveal the role of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation in brs it is necessary to detect the variations of different ammonia oxidizers aoa aob and comammox nitrospira etc with time after rain to understand the diverse microbial nitrogen transformation pathways and their roles in brs high throughput sequencing and qpcr were used in this study to detect the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in bioretention systems of shenzhen china specifically our aims are 1 to identify the distribution of comammox nitrospira in brs 2 to determine the role of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation in brs 3 to distinguish the similarities and differences between the comammox nitrospira in brs and other ecological systems 4 to reveal the effects of environmental variables on the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the sampling sites of this study were located in shenzhen 22 35 40 n 113 58 20 e a coastal city in southeast china fig s1a which has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1933 mm the rainy season in shenzhen is from april to september with an average temperature of 27 0 c shenzhen is one of the pilot cities of national sponge city construction in china the concept of sponge city was similar to lid which promotes the implementation of lid facilities such as bioretention green roof permeable pavement to store infiltrate retain and purify rainfall runoff at its source 15 brs has become one of the most widely used lid facilities in shenzhen to investigate the existence of comammox nitrospira amoa genes in brs 18 typical brss in shenzhen were selected as sampling sites fig s1a and table s1 these brss can be divided into 4 groups according to the use type of land where they are located campus park residential area and roadway fig s1b c d e brs samples in the campus collected the runoff from sidewalks or roads with light traffic where good maintenance and high vegetation coverage can be usually found fig s1b brs samples in the park or residential area collected the runoff from sidewalks roofs parking lots grass ditches or road with light traffic where good to moderate maintenance and high to moderate vegetation coverage can be usually found fig s1c d brs samples near the roadway collected the runoff from roads with heavy traffic and they usually have moderate or bad maintenance and moderate or low vegetation coverage fig s1e these brss were composed of vegetation layer soil layer sand layer and gravel layer from top to bottom since brs played a more important role in purifying runoff in rainy season than other seasons the soil samples were collected in wet season july 2019 sampling of each brs was conducted in 5 7 days after rain soil samples were collected from five points one in the middle and four at the edge in each brs with a hand held soil sampler at each sampling site for each brs samples from five points were thoroughly mixed into one mixed sample before sieved with a 2 mm sieve to remove the gravel and leaves sieved samples were transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and stored at 20 c for further process 2 2 mesocosm system to detect the variations of different ammonia oxidizers with time after rainfall

high throughput sequencing was processed by qiime http qiime org operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity were clustered using uclust algorithm blastn https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi was used to analyze the representative sequence of each otu and select the closest related sequences from ncbi national center for biotechnology information principal component analysis pca based on bray curtis distances was used to determine the beta diversity of comammox nitrospira community structure among different sampling sites canoco 5 software http www canoco5 com was used for multivariate redundancy analysis rda and spss 23 https www ibm com spss was used for pearson correlation analysis to determine the relationship between environmental factors and comammox nitrospira community phylogenetic analysis was carried out with mega 5 software https www megasoftware net using neighbor joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications the growth rate of ammonia oxidizing functional genes within 72 h after rain was calculated to characterize the stress response of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom to rainfall events the calculation equation is as follows 1 v n n 1 a n 1 a n a n 100 where n is the time after rainfall with the values of 1 2 3 4 5 corresponding to 12 h 24 h 36 h 48 h and 72 h after rainfall respectively v n n 1 is the growth rate of ammonia oxidizing functional genes from n time to n 1 time after rainfall a n and a n 1 are absolute abundance of ammonia oxidizing functional genes at n time and n 1 time after rainfall respectively 3 results 3 1 abundance and distribution of comammox nitrospira amoa gene and its response to rain the abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the 18 sampling sites ranged from 4 72 102 to 9 97 103 copies g 1 dry soil fig 1 the average abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the brss of campus park residential area and roadway was 7 84 103 2 18 103 2 99 103 and 2 58 103 copies g 1 dry soil respectively the brs in the campus contained the highest abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa genes after rain the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in the experiment brs increased initially reached the peak of 5 0 103 copies g 1 dry soil at 36 h in root layer fig 2a and 3 3 104 copies g 1 dry soil at 48 h in non root layer fig 2b then the abundance began to decrease in terms of different layers the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in the root layer was lower and reached its peak earlier than non root layer compared to aoa and aob the abundance of comammox nitrospira was close to aoa but much lower than aob in the root layer while the abundance of comammox nitrospira was lower than both aoa and aob in the non root layer the growth rate of comammox nitrospira varied with time after rain fig 2c d it increased rapidly at the beginning reached the peak at 12 24 h and then decreased to negative value in terms of different layers the growth rate of comammox nitrospira in the root layer was much higher than that in non root layer within 24 h after rain compared to aoa and aob within 12 24 h after rain the growth rate of comammox nitrospira was lower than aoa but much higher than aob in the root layer meanwhile the growth rate of comammox nitrospira was higher than both aoa and aob in the non root layer 3 2 diversity and phylogeny of comammox nitrospira 3 2 1 diversity distribution at each sampling point the coverage rates of 12 sampling points were above 99 indicating that the sequencing results of these samples were representative table s3 a total of 38 572 raw reads were obtained and were clustered into 20 otus at 97 identity an average of 10 otus can be detected at each sampling point but the composition varied between sites among the 12 sampling points the average of shannon and simpson index was 1 293 and 0 387 respectively table s3 campus 1 harbored the highest shannon index and the lowest simpson index indicating that the sampling point had the highest diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes on the other hand park 1 had the lowest shannon index and the highest simpson index suggesting the lowest diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes 3 2 2 dominant otus in this study the dominant otu was defined as the otu detected at 60 of sampling sites 7 of 12 sampling sites and whose number of detected sequences accounted for 5 of the total number of detected sequences of all 20 otus the relative abundance of otus at different sampling points was shown in fig 3a otu1 otu2 otu5 otu6 were detected at all 12 sampling points in addition otu3 otu4 otu8 and otu11 were detected at 60 of sampling points while otu16 otu17 otu19 and otu20 were detected at only one sampling point otu1 and otu2 contained the largest and second largest sequences accounting for 39 71 and 22 64 of the total number of detected sequences respectively in addition the number of sequences of otu3 otu4 and otu5 also accounted for above 5 of the total number of detected sequences respectively according to the wide distribution and high relative abundance of otu in sampling points otu1 otu2 otu3 otu4 and otu5 were identified as the dominant otus in this study fig 3b the sequences of the five otus accounted for 91 08 of the total numbers of detected sequences 3 2 3 phylogenetic analysis to explore the phylogenetic development of comammox nitrospira amoa genes a neighbor joining tree of 20 representative otus obtained from brs along with reference sequences downloaded from national center of biotechnology information ncbi database were constructed using neighbor joining method by mega 5 0 software generally comammox nitrospira amoa genes can be divided into two clades clade a and clade b while the clade a can be further divided into three subclades clade a 1 clade a 2 8 18 and clade a 3 19 20 while clade a 2 can be further divided into clade a 2 1 and clade a 2 2 21 the clade a 1 consisted of three clusters nitrospira inopinata cluster ca nitrospira nitrificans cluster and ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster where all the otus detected in this experiment belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a cluster fig 4 among them 9 otus 5 otus and 6 otus were classified as nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 respectively specifically the 6 otus in clade a 2 were all classified as clade a 2 1 while none of the 20 otus belonged to clade a 2 2 or clade a 3 fig s2 among the five dominant otus otu 1 5 both otu1 and otu2 that harbored the highest relative abundance belonged to the comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 cluster the reference sequences most similar to the dominant otus on phylogeny were shown in table s4 otu1 showed 97 64 similarity to the sequence mn481704 1 previously detected in wetland environment while otu2 was 100 the same with the sequence mt790471 1 which was detected in estuaries tidal flat wetland otu3 fell into the nitrospira inopinata cluster on phylogeny it was most similar to the sequence mt790443 1 which was detected in estuaries tidal flat wetland but the similarity was only 86 02 otu3 had relatively low similarity to the sequences previously detected in the other ecosystems indicating it might be a unique species of comammox nitrospira in brs otu4 and otu5 fell into the ca nitrospira nitrificans cluster otu4 was most similar to the sequence mn481695 1 detected in wetland with 92 15 similarity and otu5 was most similar to the sequence mk290936 1 detected in intertidal zone with 96 12 similarity as is shown in the phylogenetic tree fig 4 the comammox nitrospira amoa genes detected in this study were obviously different from aoa and aob on evolutionary relationship demonstrating their peculiarity as compared to canonical aom 3 3 effects of environmental variables on comammox nitrospira distribution 3 3 1 cluster analysis of comammox nitrospira community pca analysis on otu level was used to evaluate the community structure of comammox nitrospira among different sampling sites fig 5 while the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 57 44 and 25 56 of the diversity variation respectively sampling sites with similar community structure were clustered together in the pca plot specifically all sampling points can be divided into three groups along their land use related attribute except park 2 group1 included campus 1 and campus 2 which were campus related group2 included residence 4 residence 5 park 1 park 4 and park 6 which were related to residential area park group3 included road 1 road 2 road 4 and park 3 which were roadway related except for park 3 3 3 2 relationship between environmental parameters and comammox nitrospira community in rda analysis fig 6 and pearson correlation analysis table s5 otu1 and otu2 were positively correlated with nh4 n r 0 705 p 0 01 and r 0 529 p 0 05 respectively while otu3 was negatively correlated with nh4 n om and ph otu4 was positively correlated to ph and otu5 was positively correlated with om and ph in addition the abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene was positively correlated with om r 0 613 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 existence and importance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene the present study investigated the comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the brss in shenzhen overall comammox nitrospira amoa gene can be universally found in the brss but with lower abundance compared to aoa and aob suggesting that comammox nitrospira was not the dominant aom in the brss the result was consistent with previous studies on comammox nitrospira in most natural or agricultural systems e g wetland river water grassland and paddy soil 11 13 18 22 recently sun et al 23 reported that the abundance of comammox nitrospira was 2 21 to 5 44 times lower than that of aoa or aob in coastal wetlands li et al 24 found that comammox nitrospira was less than aoa and aob in three types of agricultural soil red soil black soil and alluvial soil in contrast comammox nitrospira was often found with higher abundance than aoa and aob in some engineered systems e g wastewater treatment plant and recirculating aquaculture systems 22 25 28 which was different from brs natural or agricultural lands therefore from the perspective of aom community composition brs was similar to wetland or agricultural systems rather than the engineered systems as for the dynamic variation after rain the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in brs had a tendency to increase rapidly at the beginning and then decrease gradually which showed the response pattern of comammox nitrospira to moisture and nutrients input 29 specifically comammox nitrospira in different layers had distinct abundance and response patterns to rainfall in root layer the abundance of comammox nitrospira was initially lower but varied rapidly after rain which led to the growth rate reached the apex earlier than in non root layer and the abundance was close to aoa it was noteworthy that not only comammox nitrospira but also aoa and aob conducted a slighter response to rain in non root layer than in root layer including the variation of both the abundance and growth rate this phenomenon may be caused by the difference of environmental conditions between layers specifically during the raining event soil moisture and nutrient impulse first occurred in root layer so the aom in root layer first responded aoa and comammox nitrospira could grow faster after rain may because they had lower ammonium half saturation constants and higher affinity for ammonia than aob 30 then with the rapid infiltration of water and consumption of nutrients the growth rate of aom dropped earlier than non root layer on the contrary in non root layer the changes of environmental conditions after rain was relatively mild thus the variation was gentle besides different response pattern of aom after rain also reflected the niche differences among them in brs which may need further study however there are limitations in using the lab scale systems to simulate the actual situation especially considering the dynamic changes of microorganisms further field investigation is needed to confirm the dynamic changes of comammox nitrospira in brs after rain 4 2 comparison of diversity and phylogeny between brs and other systems in terms of diversity index the number of otu species on comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes in brs was close to that in rice paddy soil agricultural rhizosphere and forest soil and surpassed that in some engineered systems e g groundwater well wastewater treatment plant and drinking water treatment plant 17 furthermore the average shannon values of comammox nitrospira in brs 1 293 was higher than that in activated sludge 0 946 but lower than that in agricultural soil 1 647 river sediment 1 9413 and intertidal zone 1 759 22 therefore the diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes detected in the brss was higher than that in the engineered systems but lower than that in the natural or agricultural ecosystems in terms of comammox nitrospira phylogeny brs has similarities and differences from other systems firstly most of the comammox nitrospira amoa sequences 67 detected in the brss belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 2 on phylogeny fig 4 this result was consistent with the previous findings that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was predominated in agricultural soil 17 31 for example xu et al 31 reported that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 accounted for at least 86 of the total comammox nitrospira in all samples from typical agricultural soils zhao et al 22 also proved that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was mostly distributed in agricultural soil and rarely detected in activated sludge and drinking water furthermore sun et al 21 determined a new subcluster clade a 2 2 of comammox nitrospira and renamed previous clade a 2 as a 2 1 clade a 2 2 mainly contains sequences from engineered systems such as sand filters and freshwater biofilms furthermore the otus classified as clade a 2 all belonged to clade a 2 1 but a 2 2 fig s2 which showed the difference of comammox diversity between brs and engineered systems secondly only a small proportion 33 of comammox nitrospira amoa sequences in the brss belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 1 previous studies indicated that comammox nitrospira clade a 1 was mainly existed in freshwater groundwater and engineered systems 17 18 furthermore no comammox nitrospira amoa sequences in brss belonged to ca nitrospira nitrosa a cluster of comammox nitrospira clade a 1 which has been reported to be predominated in wwtps 22 thirdly li et al 20 found a brand new cluster different from clade a 1 and a 2 and named it as clade a 3 which was majorly obtained from soils especially agricultural and forest soils although clade a3 had similar sources as clade a 2 1 none of the 20 otus obtained from brs belonged to clade a 3 fig s2 which indicated the unique diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs fourthly no bacteria of comammox nitrospira clade b were found in brs neither this result was consistent with the previous findings that comammox nitrospira clade b presented a lower abundance than comammox nitrospira clade a 17 31 on the whole the phylogenetic structure of comammox nitrospira in brs was similar to that in agricultural soil but quite different from that in engineered systems furthermore different otus may have different phylogenetic characteristics among the five dominant otus otu1 5 identified in this study otu1 and otu2 had a close phylogenetic relationship with the reference sequences mn481704 1 and mt790471 1 retrieved from wetland or estuarine environment while otu4 and otu5 had a close phylogenetic relationship with the reference sequences mn481695 1 and mk290936 1 retrieved from intertidal zone or wetland soil since the sequences of otu1 otu2 out4 and otu5 accounted for 76 98 of the total numbers of detected sequences it can be inferred that the dominant otus detected in brs had a high probability to originate from wetland or intertidal zone the result can be explained by the fact that the sampling sites of this study were located in coastal areas and soil substrate in brss were mostly derived from local ecosystems which indicating that comammox nitrospira community in brss was affected by geographical conditions however there were some differences between brs and other ecosystems for example otu3 had low similarity 90 to the sequences previously detected in the other ecosystems which implicated that otu3 may be a unique comammox nitrospira found in brs 4 3 environmental variables affecting abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira 4 3 1 effect of land use related attribute of brs on community structure of comammox nitrospira the pca analysis indicated the brs with same or similar land use related attribute possibly had similar community structure of comammox nitrospira while the community structure varied greatly with different land use related attribute fundamentally different land use related attribute corresponded to vast differences in human activities of the catchment area specifically in campus there was relatively few traffic and high frequency of road cleaning on the contrary there was a lot of traffic on urban roadways with less cleaning while residence and parks conducted a moderate traffic and cleaning frequency such different patterns of human activities caused different characteristics of non point pollution and runoff quality 32 34 brss constructed with different land use related attribute received the local runoff with corresponding pollution conditions which resulted in distinct environmental conditions in brss and then affected the community structure of comammox nitrospira however park 2 and park 3 were exceptions although park 3 was installed in a park it belonged to group3 roadway rather than group2 residence park field investigations showed that park 3 received the runoff from a parking lot which was more similar to that from roadways so the community structure of comammox nitrospira in park 3 was possibly similar to that in the brss nearby roadway park 2 was an isolated point in fig 3b and did not belong to any group field investigations showed that park 2 received the runoff from a grass ditch along sidewalks since the runoff has been greatly reduced and purified by the grass ditch before entering the brs the system actually received less runoff and pollution load resulting in the system in an oligotrophic state in addition the vegetation coverage of the system was relatively low the phenomenon was consistent with the finding that nh4 n was much lower and the abundance of otu3 a species suitable for living in an oligotrophic environment was relatively higher in park 2 generally although the pca analysis showed that the community structure of comammox nitrospira in brs was clustered along land use related attribute of brs the fundamental factors were runoff characteristics therefore further field monitoring of runoff was helpful to directly and deeply reveal the impact on community structure of comammox nitrospira 4 3 2 effect of om on abundance of comammox nitrospira the result showed that the overall abundance of comammox nitrospira was positively correlated with om in the soil substrate which was consistent with some former studies in lake soil and tidal sediments 12 30 35 36 it should be noted that all the detected comammox nitrospira in brs belonged to clade a while the otus with highest abundance otu1 and otu2 belonged to clade a 2 1 previous studies have shown that different types of comammox conducted distinct response to nutrients the relative abundance of clade a increased with nutrients addition whereas clade b was the opposite which may because of the different physiological characteristics between the clades 30 besides clade a 2 was generally dominant in clade a in agriculture soil with fertilization while clade a 1 was less competitive 19 31 37 all these may explain the positive effect of om on the abundance of comammox nitrospira in brs 4 3 3 effect of nitrogen content and ph on different otus otu1 and otu2 which belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 2 positively correlated with nh4 n in the soil substrate this is consistent with the adaptability of clade a 2 to ammonia xu et al 31 reported that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was more abundant and widely distributed in agricultural soils with relatively high nh4 n content li et al 20 also found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was positively correlated with nh4 n in specific forest soils sun et al 23 divided clade a 2 into clade a 2 1 and clade a 2 2 and found that the soil derived clade a 2 1 was suitable in a high ammonia environment while clade a 1 and clade a 2 2 was not otu3 which belonged to nitrospira inopinata showed different environmental adaptability from other dominant otus otu3 negatively correlated with nh4 n in the soil substrate which may because nitrospira inopinata has low ammonium half saturation constants k m which has been confirmed by pure culture method 13 it means that nitrospira inopinata harbored a higher affinity to nh4 n and could better adapt to the environment with low concentration of ammonia nitrogen 13 this may also explain why the relative abundance of otu3 in park 2 was particularly high park 2 was far away from motorway and sidewalk and less polluted runoff entered the brs thus nh4 n in soil substrate of park 2 was much lower than that of other sampling points which was conducive to the competitive growth of nitrospira inopinata in addition otu3 negatively correlated with ph in the soil substrate which is different from other dominant otus ph was considered as a key factor affecting the abundance and community composition of comammox nitrospira 38 in some former studies comammox nitrospira showed a higher abundance in acidic soils 11 and adapted to lower ph 31 39 the potential explanation may include 1 high ammonia affinity nh3 rather than nh4 was the direct substrate for ammonia oxidation 40 under acidic environment nh3 could be efficiently converted to nh4 which meant the substrate availability and effectiveness decrease with lower ph 41 therefore the high ammonia affinity of nitrospira inopinata led to its tolerance to lower ph 42 2 ph homeostasis genome of nitrospira inopinata contained the kdpabc and kdpde gene clusters encoding the kdp potassium uptake system which can uptake of potassium to generate reverse membrane potentials thus nitrospira inopinata could maintain homeostasis under low ph conditions 31 otu4 and otu5 which belonged to ca nitrospira nitrificans positively correlated with ph which was opposite to otu3 jiang et al 43 also found the abundance of ca nitrospira nitrificans in chaohu lake china positively correlated with ph implying this cluster had competitive advantage in slightly alkalescent environment overall different otus of comammox nitrospira had different responses to soil environmental parameters indicating the adaptability of comammox nitrospira community to environmental changes 5 conclusion this study investigated the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes in brss in the southeast coastal area of china by using high throughput sequencing and qpcr we found that 1 comammox nitrospira amoa genes were widely distributed in the bioretention systems comammox nitrospira might play an important role in ammonia oxidation at the initial stage after rain particularly in the root layer of brs 2 the main comammox nitrospira communities were nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 on phylogeny in which 5 otus were identified as the dominant otus except one unique otu the other otus were phylogenetically similar to the sequences detected in wetlands 3 the community structure of comammox nitrospira was affected by the land use related attribute where the brss were located different otus had different responses to organic matter ph and nitrogen content in soil substrate implicating the adaptability of comammox nitrospira community to different environment it should be noted that this study was carried out in the coastal area of southeast china further investigation in other regions is needed to understand the characteristics of comammox nitrospira in brss in different geographical or climate zones besides metagenomics can be used in future to further investigate the genetic potentials of comammox nitrospira in brss credit authorship

12679,the nitrogen removal of bioretention system brs mainly depends on various microorganisms among which complete ammonia oxidization bacteria comammox are important nitrogen removers however the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs have been rarely studied and its role in ammonia oxidation is unknown in this study 18 field brss were investigated to distinguish the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira followed by a mesocosm bioretention experiment to examine the variation in the abundance of comammox nitrospira after rainfall event the results showed that 1 comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes were widely distributed in the field brss with the absolute abundance of 4 72 102 to 9 97 103 copies g 1 dry soil 2 within 12 24 h after rainfall event comammox nitrospira increased rapidly and its growth rate was even higher than that of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob 3 a total of 20 operational taxonomic units otus of comammox nitrospira amoa genes were detected in the field brss these otus were classified as nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 on phylogeny except one unique otu the other otus were phylogenetically similar to the sequences detected in wetlands 4 different otus responded differently to soil physicochemical factors indicating the environmental adaptability of comammox nitrospira these results were helpful to improve the understanding of microbial nitrogen transformation pathways and their roles in brs graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira bioretention system microbial community phylogenetic analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction bioretention system brs known as rain garden is a layered facility composed of plants planting soil sand bed gravel sump and drainage layer as one of the most important low impact development lid facilities brs has been widely applied to purify urban rainfall runoff at its source 1 it has been proved to be effective in removing various pollutants in urban runoff such as phosphorus suspended solids chemical oxygen demand and heavy metals 2 however the removal efficiency of nitrogenous pollutants is low and unstable which has been widely concerned in stormwater management 3 5 microorganisms play a key role in nitrogen transformation in brs 6 a better understanding of the abundance and diversity of nitrogen cycling microbial communities in brs is necessary to unveil the mechanism of changes in nitrogen removal efficiency ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and ammonia oxidizing archaea aoa were found widely distributed in brs 7 and their abundance and diversity in brs were dissected in the previous studies 3 in addition to aoa and aob a new ammonia oxidizer comammox nitrospira was then discovered in deep petroleum well and circulating aquaculture system 8 9 in later studies comammox nitrospira was found widely distributed in natural freshwater e g wetland and lake water 10 terrestrial ecosystems e g forest soil and paddy water 11 and river sediments 12 comammox nitrospira can independently complete the entire ammonia oxidation process in purification cultivation 8 9 furthermore kits et al 13 and palomo et al 14 reported that comammox nitrospira had a higher affinity for ammonia and oxygen than most aob and aoa and it showed a competitive advantage in environments with low ammonia and trace oxygen however comammox nitrospira and its role in ammonia oxidation in brs have not been reported so far the ecological environment of brs is similar to wetland agricultural soil and forest soils it can be speculated that comammox nitrospira may exist in brs and has a certain effect on nitrification in addition the processes of microbial nitrogen transformation in brs mainly occur in the dry period after rain 4 to reveal the role of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation in brs it is necessary to detect the variations of different ammonia oxidizers aoa aob and comammox nitrospira etc with time after rain to understand the diverse microbial nitrogen transformation pathways and their roles in brs high throughput sequencing and qpcr were used in this study to detect the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in bioretention systems of shenzhen china specifically our aims are 1 to identify the distribution of comammox nitrospira in brs 2 to determine the role of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation in brs 3 to distinguish the similarities and differences between the comammox nitrospira in brs and other ecological systems 4 to reveal the effects of environmental variables on the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling the sampling sites of this study were located in shenzhen 22 35 40 n 113 58 20 e a coastal city in southeast china fig s1a which has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual rainfall of 1933 mm the rainy season in shenzhen is from april to september with an average temperature of 27 0 c shenzhen is one of the pilot cities of national sponge city construction in china the concept of sponge city was similar to lid which promotes the implementation of lid facilities such as bioretention green roof permeable pavement to store infiltrate retain and purify rainfall runoff at its source 15 brs has become one of the most widely used lid facilities in shenzhen to investigate the existence of comammox nitrospira amoa genes in brs 18 typical brss in shenzhen were selected as sampling sites fig s1a and table s1 these brss can be divided into 4 groups according to the use type of land where they are located campus park residential area and roadway fig s1b c d e brs samples in the campus collected the runoff from sidewalks or roads with light traffic where good maintenance and high vegetation coverage can be usually found fig s1b brs samples in the park or residential area collected the runoff from sidewalks roofs parking lots grass ditches or road with light traffic where good to moderate maintenance and high to moderate vegetation coverage can be usually found fig s1c d brs samples near the roadway collected the runoff from roads with heavy traffic and they usually have moderate or bad maintenance and moderate or low vegetation coverage fig s1e these brss were composed of vegetation layer soil layer sand layer and gravel layer from top to bottom since brs played a more important role in purifying runoff in rainy season than other seasons the soil samples were collected in wet season july 2019 sampling of each brs was conducted in 5 7 days after rain soil samples were collected from five points one in the middle and four at the edge in each brs with a hand held soil sampler at each sampling site for each brs samples from five points were thoroughly mixed into one mixed sample before sieved with a 2 mm sieve to remove the gravel and leaves sieved samples were transferred into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and stored at 20 c for further process 2 2 mesocosm system to detect the variations of different ammonia oxidizers with time after rainfall and reveal the contribution of comammox nitrospira in ammonia oxidation in brs a mesocosm scale bioretention experiment was conducted in the campus of peking university shenzhen graduate school

bottom fig s1g the vegetation zone was planted with phragmites australise and the soil zone was 50 cm thick composed of a mixture of local sandy loam coarse sand and peat moss with a mass ratio of 4 5 1 a perforated pipe was set at the bottom of the column which was vertically risen 30 cm to form the submerged zone the submerged zone consisted of a 20 cm thick sand layer and a 10 cm thick gravel layer the bioretention column was watered with synthetic runoff volume 70 l pollutant 2 5 mg l 1 nh4 n by ammonium chloride 2 5 mg l 1 no3 n by potassium nitrate 5 mg l 1 organic n by l alanine and

high throughput sequencing was processed by qiime http qiime org operational taxonomic units otus with 97 similarity were clustered using uclust algorithm blastn https blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi was used to analyze the representative sequence of each otu and select the closest related sequences from ncbi national center for biotechnology information principal component analysis pca based on bray curtis distances was used to determine the beta diversity of comammox nitrospira community structure among different sampling sites canoco 5 software http www canoco5 com was used for multivariate redundancy analysis rda and spss 23 https www ibm com spss was used for pearson correlation analysis to determine the relationship between environmental factors and comammox nitrospira community phylogenetic analysis was carried out with mega 5 software https www megasoftware net using neighbor joining method with 1000 bootstrap replications the growth rate of ammonia oxidizing functional genes within 72 h after rain was calculated to characterize the stress response of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms aom to rainfall events the calculation equation is as follows 1 v n n 1 a n 1 a n a n 100 where n is the time after rainfall with the values of 1 2 3 4 5 corresponding to 12 h 24 h 36 h 48 h and 72 h after rainfall respectively v n n 1 is the growth rate of ammonia oxidizing functional genes from n time to n 1 time after rainfall a n and a n 1 are absolute abundance of ammonia oxidizing functional genes at n time and n 1 time after rainfall respectively 3 results 3 1 abundance and distribution of comammox nitrospira amoa gene and its response to rain the abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the 18 sampling sites ranged from 4 72 102 to 9 97 103 copies g 1 dry soil fig 1 the average abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the brss of campus park residential area and roadway was 7 84 103 2 18 103 2 99 103 and 2 58 103 copies g 1 dry soil respectively the brs in the campus contained the highest abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa genes after rain the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in the experiment brs increased initially reached the peak of 5 0 103 copies g 1 dry soil at 36 h in root layer fig 2a and 3 3 104 copies g 1 dry soil at 48 h in non root layer fig 2b then the abundance began to decrease in terms of different layers the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in the root layer was lower and reached its peak earlier than non root layer compared to aoa and aob the abundance of comammox nitrospira was close to aoa but much lower than aob in the root layer while the abundance of comammox nitrospira was lower than both aoa and aob in the non root layer the growth rate of comammox nitrospira varied with time after rain fig 2c d it increased rapidly at the beginning reached the peak at 12 24 h and then decreased to negative value in terms of different layers the growth rate of comammox nitrospira in the root layer was much higher than that in non root layer within 24 h after rain compared to aoa and aob within 12 24 h after rain the growth rate of comammox nitrospira was lower than aoa but much higher than aob in the root layer meanwhile the growth rate of comammox nitrospira was higher than both aoa and aob in the non root layer 3 2 diversity and phylogeny of comammox nitrospira 3 2 1 diversity distribution at each sampling point the coverage rates of 12 sampling points were above 99 indicating that the sequencing results of these samples were representative table s3 a total of 38 572 raw reads were obtained and were clustered into 20 otus at 97 identity an average of 10 otus can be detected at each sampling point but the composition varied between sites among the 12 sampling points the average of shannon and simpson index was 1 293 and 0 387 respectively table s3 campus 1 harbored the highest shannon index and the lowest simpson index indicating that the sampling point had the highest diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes on the other hand park 1 had the lowest shannon index and the highest simpson index suggesting the lowest diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes 3 2 2 dominant otus in this study the dominant otu was defined as the otu detected at 60 of sampling sites 7 of 12 sampling sites and whose number of detected sequences accounted for 5 of the total number of detected sequences of all 20 otus the relative abundance of otus at different sampling points was shown in fig 3a otu1 otu2 otu5 otu6 were detected at all 12 sampling points in addition otu3 otu4 otu8 and otu11 were detected at 60 of sampling points while otu16 otu17 otu19 and otu20 were detected at only one sampling point otu1 and otu2 contained the largest and second largest sequences accounting for 39 71 and 22 64 of the total number of detected sequences respectively in addition the number of sequences of otu3 otu4 and otu5 also accounted for above 5 of the total number of detected sequences respectively according to the wide distribution and high relative abundance of otu in sampling points otu1 otu2 otu3 otu4 and otu5 were identified as the dominant otus in this study fig 3b the sequences of the five otus accounted for 91 08 of the total numbers of detected sequences 3 2 3 phylogenetic analysis to explore the phylogenetic development of comammox nitrospira amoa genes a neighbor joining tree of 20 representative otus obtained from brs along with reference sequences downloaded from national center of biotechnology information ncbi database were constructed using neighbor joining method by mega 5 0 software generally comammox nitrospira amoa genes can be divided into two clades clade a and clade b while the clade a can be further divided into three subclades clade a 1 clade a 2 8 18 and clade a 3 19 20 while clade a 2 can be further divided into clade a 2 1 and clade a 2 2 21 the clade a 1 consisted of three clusters nitrospira inopinata cluster ca nitrospira nitrificans cluster and ca nitrospira nitrosa cluster where all the otus detected in this experiment belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a cluster fig 4 among them 9 otus 5 otus and 6 otus were classified as nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 respectively specifically the 6 otus in clade a 2 were all classified as clade a 2 1 while none of the 20 otus belonged to clade a 2 2 or clade a 3 fig s2 among the five dominant otus otu 1 5 both otu1 and otu2 that harbored the highest relative abundance belonged to the comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 cluster the reference sequences most similar to the dominant otus on phylogeny were shown in table s4 otu1 showed 97 64 similarity to the sequence mn481704 1 previously detected in wetland environment while otu2 was 100 the same with the sequence mt790471 1 which was detected in estuaries tidal flat wetland otu3 fell into the nitrospira inopinata cluster on phylogeny it was most similar to the sequence mt790443 1 which was detected in estuaries tidal flat wetland but the similarity was only 86 02 otu3 had relatively low similarity to the sequences previously detected in the other ecosystems indicating it might be a unique species of comammox nitrospira in brs otu4 and otu5 fell into the ca nitrospira nitrificans cluster otu4 was most similar to the sequence mn481695 1 detected in wetland with 92 15 similarity and otu5 was most similar to the sequence mk290936 1 detected in intertidal zone with 96 12 similarity as is shown in the phylogenetic tree fig 4 the comammox nitrospira amoa genes detected in this study were obviously different from aoa and aob on evolutionary relationship demonstrating their peculiarity as compared to canonical aom 3 3 effects of environmental variables on comammox nitrospira distribution 3 3 1 cluster analysis of comammox nitrospira community pca analysis on otu level was used to evaluate the community structure of comammox nitrospira among different sampling sites fig 5 while the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 57 44 and 25 56 of the diversity variation respectively sampling sites with similar community structure were clustered together in the pca plot specifically all sampling points can be divided into three groups along their land use related attribute except park 2 group1 included campus 1 and campus 2 which were campus related group2 included residence 4 residence 5 park 1 park 4 and park 6 which were related to residential area park group3 included road 1 road 2 road 4 and park 3 which were roadway related except for park 3 3 3 2 relationship between environmental parameters and comammox nitrospira community in rda analysis fig 6 and pearson correlation analysis table s5 otu1 and otu2 were positively correlated with nh4 n r 0 705 p 0 01 and r 0 529 p 0 05 respectively while otu3 was negatively correlated with nh4 n om and ph otu4 was positively correlated to ph and otu5 was positively correlated with om and ph in addition the abundance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene was positively correlated with om r 0 613 p 0 05 4 discussion 4 1 existence and importance of comammox nitrospira amoa gene the present study investigated the comammox nitrospira amoa gene in the brss in shenzhen overall comammox nitrospira amoa gene can be universally found in the brss but with lower abundance compared to aoa and aob suggesting that comammox nitrospira was not the dominant aom in the brss the result was consistent with previous studies on comammox nitrospira in most natural or agricultural systems e g wetland river water grassland and paddy soil 11 13 18 22 recently sun et al 23 reported that the abundance of comammox nitrospira was 2 21 to 5 44 times lower than that of aoa or aob in coastal wetlands li et al 24 found that comammox nitrospira was less than aoa and aob in three types of agricultural soil red soil black soil and alluvial soil in contrast comammox nitrospira was often found with higher abundance than aoa and aob in some engineered systems e g wastewater treatment plant and recirculating aquaculture systems 22 25 28 which was different from brs natural or agricultural lands therefore from the perspective of aom community composition brs was similar to wetland or agricultural systems rather than the engineered systems as for the dynamic variation after rain the absolute abundance of comammox nitrospira in brs had a tendency to increase rapidly at the beginning and then decrease gradually which showed the response pattern of comammox nitrospira to moisture and nutrients input 29 specifically comammox nitrospira in different layers had distinct abundance and response patterns to rainfall in root layer the abundance of comammox nitrospira was initially lower but varied rapidly after rain which led to the growth rate reached the apex earlier than in non root layer and the abundance was close to aoa it was noteworthy that not only comammox nitrospira but also aoa and aob conducted a slighter response to rain in non root layer than in root layer including the variation of both the abundance and growth rate this phenomenon may be caused by the difference of environmental conditions between layers specifically during the raining event soil moisture and nutrient impulse first occurred in root layer so the aom in root layer first responded aoa and comammox nitrospira could grow faster after rain may because they had lower ammonium half saturation constants and higher affinity for ammonia than aob 30 then with the rapid infiltration of water and consumption of nutrients the growth rate of aom dropped earlier than non root layer on the contrary in non root layer the changes of environmental conditions after rain was relatively mild thus the variation was gentle besides different response pattern of aom after rain also reflected the niche differences among them in brs which may need further study however there are limitations in using the lab scale systems to simulate the actual situation especially considering the dynamic changes of microorganisms further field investigation is needed to confirm the dynamic changes of comammox nitrospira in brs after rain 4 2 comparison of diversity and phylogeny between brs and other systems in terms of diversity index the number of otu species on comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes in brs was close to that in rice paddy soil agricultural rhizosphere and forest soil and surpassed that in some engineered systems e g groundwater well wastewater treatment plant and drinking water treatment plant 17 furthermore the average shannon values of comammox nitrospira in brs 1 293 was higher than that in activated sludge 0 946 but lower than that in agricultural soil 1 647 river sediment 1 9413 and intertidal zone 1 759 22 therefore the diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa functional genes detected in the brss was higher than that in the engineered systems but lower than that in the natural or agricultural ecosystems in terms of comammox nitrospira phylogeny brs has similarities and differences from other systems firstly most of the comammox nitrospira amoa sequences 67 detected in the brss belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 2 on phylogeny fig 4 this result was consistent with the previous findings that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was predominated in agricultural soil 17 31 for example xu et al 31 reported that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 accounted for at least 86 of the total comammox nitrospira in all samples from typical agricultural soils zhao et al 22 also proved that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was mostly distributed in agricultural soil and rarely detected in activated sludge and drinking water furthermore sun et al 21 determined a new subcluster clade a 2 2 of comammox nitrospira and renamed previous clade a 2 as a 2 1 clade a 2 2 mainly contains sequences from engineered systems such as sand filters and freshwater biofilms furthermore the otus classified as clade a 2 all belonged to clade a 2 1 but a 2 2 fig s2 which showed the difference of comammox diversity between brs and engineered systems secondly only a small proportion 33 of comammox nitrospira amoa sequences in the brss belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 1 previous studies indicated that comammox nitrospira clade a 1 was mainly existed in freshwater groundwater and engineered systems 17 18 furthermore no comammox nitrospira amoa sequences in brss belonged to ca nitrospira nitrosa a cluster of comammox nitrospira clade a 1 which has been reported to be predominated in wwtps 22 thirdly li et al 20 found a brand new cluster different from clade a 1 and a 2 and named it as clade a 3 which was majorly obtained from soils especially agricultural and forest soils although clade a3 had similar sources as clade a 2 1 none of the 20 otus obtained from brs belonged to clade a 3 fig s2 which indicated the unique diversity of comammox nitrospira in brs fourthly no bacteria of comammox nitrospira clade b were found in brs neither this result was consistent with the previous findings that comammox nitrospira clade b presented a lower abundance than comammox nitrospira clade a 17 31 on the whole the phylogenetic structure of comammox nitrospira in brs was similar to that in agricultural soil but quite different from that in engineered systems furthermore different otus may have different phylogenetic characteristics among the five dominant otus otu1 5 identified in this study otu1 and otu2 had a close phylogenetic relationship with the reference sequences mn481704 1 and mt790471 1 retrieved from wetland or estuarine environment while otu4 and otu5 had a close phylogenetic relationship with the reference sequences mn481695 1 and mk290936 1 retrieved from intertidal zone or wetland soil since the sequences of otu1 otu2 out4 and otu5 accounted for 76 98 of the total numbers of detected sequences it can be inferred that the dominant otus detected in brs had a high probability to originate from wetland or intertidal zone the result can be explained by the fact that the sampling sites of this study were located in coastal areas and soil substrate in brss were mostly derived from local ecosystems which indicating that comammox nitrospira community in brss was affected by geographical conditions however there were some differences between brs and other ecosystems for example otu3 had low similarity 90 to the sequences previously detected in the other ecosystems which implicated that otu3 may be a unique comammox nitrospira found in brs 4 3 environmental variables affecting abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira 4 3 1 effect of land use related attribute of brs on community structure of comammox nitrospira the pca analysis indicated the brs with same or similar land use related attribute possibly had similar community structure of comammox nitrospira while the community structure varied greatly with different land use related attribute fundamentally different land use related attribute corresponded to vast differences in human activities of the catchment area specifically in campus there was relatively few traffic and high frequency of road cleaning on the contrary there was a lot of traffic on urban roadways with less cleaning while residence and parks conducted a moderate traffic and cleaning frequency such different patterns of human activities caused different characteristics of non point pollution and runoff quality 32 34 brss constructed with different land use related attribute received the local runoff with corresponding pollution conditions which resulted in distinct environmental conditions in brss and then affected the community structure of comammox nitrospira however park 2 and park 3 were exceptions although park 3 was installed in a park it belonged to group3 roadway rather than group2 residence park field investigations showed that park 3 received the runoff from a parking lot which was more similar to that from roadways so the community structure of comammox nitrospira in park 3 was possibly similar to that in the brss nearby roadway park 2 was an isolated point in fig 3b and did not belong to any group field investigations showed that park 2 received the runoff from a grass ditch along sidewalks since the runoff has been greatly reduced and purified by the grass ditch before entering the brs the system actually received less runoff and pollution load resulting in the system in an oligotrophic state in addition the vegetation coverage of the system was relatively low the phenomenon was consistent with the finding that nh4 n was much lower and the abundance of otu3 a species suitable for living in an oligotrophic environment was relatively higher in park 2 generally although the pca analysis showed that the community structure of comammox nitrospira in brs was clustered along land use related attribute of brs the fundamental factors were runoff characteristics therefore further field monitoring of runoff was helpful to directly and deeply reveal the impact on community structure of comammox nitrospira 4 3 2 effect of om on abundance of comammox nitrospira the result showed that the overall abundance of comammox nitrospira was positively correlated with om in the soil substrate which was consistent with some former studies in lake soil and tidal sediments 12 30 35 36 it should be noted that all the detected comammox nitrospira in brs belonged to clade a while the otus with highest abundance otu1 and otu2 belonged to clade a 2 1 previous studies have shown that different types of comammox conducted distinct response to nutrients the relative abundance of clade a increased with nutrients addition whereas clade b was the opposite which may because of the different physiological characteristics between the clades 30 besides clade a 2 was generally dominant in clade a in agriculture soil with fertilization while clade a 1 was less competitive 19 31 37 all these may explain the positive effect of om on the abundance of comammox nitrospira in brs 4 3 3 effect of nitrogen content and ph on different otus otu1 and otu2 which belonged to comammox nitrospira clade a 2 positively correlated with nh4 n in the soil substrate this is consistent with the adaptability of clade a 2 to ammonia xu et al 31 reported that comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was more abundant and widely distributed in agricultural soils with relatively high nh4 n content li et al 20 also found that the abundance of comammox nitrospira clade a 2 was positively correlated with nh4 n in specific forest soils sun et al 23 divided clade a 2 into clade a 2 1 and clade a 2 2 and found that the soil derived clade a 2 1 was suitable in a high ammonia environment while clade a 1 and clade a 2 2 was not otu3 which belonged to nitrospira inopinata showed different environmental adaptability from other dominant otus otu3 negatively correlated with nh4 n in the soil substrate which may because nitrospira inopinata has low ammonium half saturation constants k m which has been confirmed by pure culture method 13 it means that nitrospira inopinata harbored a higher affinity to nh4 n and could better adapt to the environment with low concentration of ammonia nitrogen 13 this may also explain why the relative abundance of otu3 in park 2 was particularly high park 2 was far away from motorway and sidewalk and less polluted runoff entered the brs thus nh4 n in soil substrate of park 2 was much lower than that of other sampling points which was conducive to the competitive growth of nitrospira inopinata in addition otu3 negatively correlated with ph in the soil substrate which is different from other dominant otus ph was considered as a key factor affecting the abundance and community composition of comammox nitrospira 38 in some former studies comammox nitrospira showed a higher abundance in acidic soils 11 and adapted to lower ph 31 39 the potential explanation may include 1 high ammonia affinity nh3 rather than nh4 was the direct substrate for ammonia oxidation 40 under acidic environment nh3 could be efficiently converted to nh4 which meant the substrate availability and effectiveness decrease with lower ph 41 therefore the high ammonia affinity of nitrospira inopinata led to its tolerance to lower ph 42 2 ph homeostasis genome of nitrospira inopinata contained the kdpabc and kdpde gene clusters encoding the kdp potassium uptake system which can uptake of potassium to generate reverse membrane potentials thus nitrospira inopinata could maintain homeostasis under low ph conditions 31 otu4 and otu5 which belonged to ca nitrospira nitrificans positively correlated with ph which was opposite to otu3 jiang et al 43 also found the abundance of ca nitrospira nitrificans in chaohu lake china positively correlated with ph implying this cluster had competitive advantage in slightly alkalescent environment overall different otus of comammox nitrospira had different responses to soil environmental parameters indicating the adaptability of comammox nitrospira community to environmental changes 5 conclusion this study investigated the abundance and diversity of comammox nitrospira amoa genes in brss in the southeast coastal area of china by using high throughput sequencing and qpcr we found that 1 comammox nitrospira amoa genes were widely distributed in the bioretention systems comammox nitrospira might play an important role in ammonia oxidation at the initial stage after rain particularly in the root layer of brs 2 the main comammox nitrospira communities were nitrospira inopinata ca nitrospira nitrificans and comammox nitrospira clade a 2 1 on phylogeny in which 5 otus were identified as the dominant otus except one unique otu the other otus were phylogenetically similar to the sequences detected in wetlands 3 the community structure of comammox nitrospira was affected by the land use related attribute where the brss were located different otus had different responses to organic matter ph and nitrogen content in soil substrate implicating the adaptability of comammox nitrospira community to different environment it should be noted that this study was carried out in the coastal area of southeast china further investigation in other regions is needed to understand the characteristics of comammox nitrospira in brss in different geographical or climate zones besides metagenomics can be used in future to further investigate the genetic potentials of comammox nitrospira in brss credit authorship
