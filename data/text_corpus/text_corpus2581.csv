promising advanced material that has been broadly utilized and demonstrated promising results in various water treatment applications the notable superiority of ctfs compared to other advanced materials such as metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs is due to its triazine linkage architecture which absence of weaker bonds and a substantial amount of n content making it adjustable surface area porosity electro optical properties and stability ctfs have been developed for adsorptive removal photocatalysis and membrane filtration exhibiting versatile

resource essential for ecosystems and human well being along with population growth rising in many countries worldwide water is a highly sought after commodity the earth provides less than 3 of freshwater and it is used as a source of clean water 1 in addition to decreasing amount of freshwater available water pollution is becoming more frequent due to fast growing industrial advancement prevention efforts are needed to treat wastewater before being discharged into the environment 2 many methods have been used to treat water such as photocatalytic degradation 3 4 fenton process degradation 5 catalytic oxidation 6 7 adsorption 8 11 and membrane filtration 12 the development of conventional materials such as activated carbon alumina silica natural zeolite and resin have been widely used and tested for wastewater adsorption processes 13 15 even though most carbon based material such as activated carbon has higher adsorption and performance towards organic compounds it is known that it has limitations for metals and other inorganic contaminants 16 and poor active sites 17 present research in wastewater treatment focuses on producing emerging non conventional materials one of the most eminent developed engineered materials is porous frameworks consisting of metal organic frameworks mofs with metal sites and covalent organic frameworks cofs solely designed from organic building blocks 18 19 the porous framework is a highly ordered porous material with compelling facets i e high porosity pore functionality and versatile skeletons 16 18 these multifaceted materials can be adjustable by controlling the functionalization 16 20 different linkages have been developed considering porous frameworks unique characteristics including boroxine boronate ester borosilicate imine hydrazone and borazine 21 nevertheless these linkages are unstable because they are very vulnerable to hydrolysis other approaches have been applied e g tautomerization and linkage conversion 18 22 however having a material with high stability is more advantageous and practical than further modifications triazine or aromatic cn linkage is becoming one of the prominent explorations due to distinct characteristics such as the nonexistence of weaker bonds except the aromatic bond which contributes to high chemical stability and abundant n content 18 in 2008 thomas et al 23 succeeded in synthesizing a porous organic polymer compound composed of triazine bonds with a precursor in the form of dicyanobenzene dcb the compound was then conceptualized as ctfs covalent triazine frameworks initially ctfs are made through ionothermal reactions at a 400 c 500 c temperature in zncl2 in which both zncl2 and building blocks monomer melts and are mixed at that temperature ctfs have several unique properties that are very attractive for various purposes for example a triazine group with a cn bond provides an abundant catalyst s active site 24 infrastructural chemical bonds in ctfs are solid so they have very high structural stability diverse structures with modification of synthesis and monomers selection 25 27 ctf s various properties make ctfs very promising and widely used for various water treatment applications since then the investigations and studies on ctfs materials have steadily grown over time fig 1 shows the exponential growth in published original research articles about ctfs materials especially water treatment applications as far as our knowledge the comprehensive review of these rising materials solely for wastewater treatment applications is still unavailable this review is deliberately intended to offer a comprehensive review and summary of the latest development in ctfs for water treatment applications 2 ctf in 2005 cote et al successfully synthesized material with pure crystalline organic groups with properties almost similar to zeolites 28 this material was drafted under the name covalent organic framework cof cote et al first synthesized cof 1 and cof 5 materials which are the cof class with an aromatic material arrangement that has boron ester bonds in the formation of the polymer the most widely synthesized cof is by boron linkage because it has high crystallinity mesoporous material and a large surface area however boron linkage cof has limited usability because of a drawback in the material properties with low chemical stability 29 kuhn et al succeeded in making a new porous polymer material using an ionothermal approach with properties similar to cof having a large surface area with high chemical stability 23 this material is conceived as ctfs which has an intramolecular bond in an azine bond with a triazine group the substance namely ctf 1 was synthesized by reacting dcb as a monomer with the help of zncl2 which functioned as solvent and catalyst at 400 c 23 this approach produces a ctfs material that is porous and has a large surface area however this procedure has the disadvantage of requiring a longer time in the synthesis process so it is impractical to mass produce ctf 30 then along with its development ctfs was synthesized with various building blocks or monomers with different reaction methods with their respective processes the fundamental step in producing ctfs is the trimerization reaction that results in the formation of triazine in the 1960s yanagida et al successfully produced 2 4 6 triaryl s triazine using metal halides as a catalyst the process is carried out at a temperature above the metal halides melting point 200 c 400 c 31 later h a vogel and g h miller in the 70s developed a polymerization technique to form polymers from di tri and tetra nitrile precursors by the same method at higher temperatures 410 c 550 c 32 33 the research carried out then becomes the basis for the synthesis of ctf in the future fig 2 demonstrates the basic model of the ctfs material namely 2d and 3d structures as seen the pore characteristic is subjugated by the triazine link of the ctf the type of monomer constituent also determines the pore size of the ctf 34 2 1 ctf properties and tunability in the water treatment process one of the required characteristics is the material stability compared to the other covalent organic based materials such as cof and mof ctfs with triazine linkers has chemical properties that are stable and resistant to acid and alkaline conditions 35 37 these attributes make ctfs an attractive candidate for the water treatment process ctfs is porous semiconductor polymer with excellent surface area properties ctfs are renowned for their structure tunability which facilitates the modification of different water treatment applications 32 35 36 2 1 1 pore and surface area properties of ctf besides the high stability ctfs also has an extensive surface area many studies confirmed that basic ctf 1 synthesized from 1 4 dicyanobenzene using ionothermal methods has around 800 1000 m2 g of surface area with a porous aperture size of 1 5 nm 37 39 those microporous properties of ctf 1 have multifaceted utilization such as dye removal heavy metal removal and salt rejection in the desalination process the versatility of ctfs could be improved since the pore size of the ctf is dependent on the organic monomer in the material different monomers such as 1 3 5 tricyanobenzene will create very narrow pores with an aperture size 1 nm and can be utilized for salt rejection in the desalination process 40 other methods for tuning the pore size of the ctf could be directed using the introduction of another element to the ctfs structures many studies have been conducted by adding other features and functional groups such as fe2o3 s f and k to alter the pore size and surface chemical properties of the ctfs 41 44 the result of different functionalizations is presented in table 1 the dense electrons on the ctfs surfaces could interact with the electrophilic adsorbate triazine functional groups could act as basic sites for nucleophilic adsorbate thus increasing the versatility of ctf as an adsorbent 37 fig 3 and table 2 display the computational design of the various ctfs with the different elemental functional groups and pore properties as can be seen ctf 0 which was synthesized using 1 3 5 tricyanobenzene has a narrow aperture compared to ctf 1 however ctf 1 could be modified using different elements such as cl and ch3 to further narrow the pore size 47 in addition it can be seen that the pore aperture size on the ctfs depends on the organic linker and van der walls effect on each atom in the ctfs structures fig 3 thus ctfs will have a relatively smaller pore aperture of ctfs with fewer phenyl groups on the linker moreover the fabrication conditions can alter the pore and surface area properties the temperature difference and lewis acid salt composition affect the pore properties of ctfs in the ionothermal method some studies have shown that high temperature and high monomer salt ratio would increase the surface area properties of the ctfs however it can also reduce the microporosity of the material itself 48 49 another alternative for the ctfs polymerization process is to use p2o5 as the catalyst to overcome this deficiency as a result the synthesized ctfs have a relatively larger surface area and micro sized pores than the ionothermal method using a zncl2 catalyst 18 50 51 ctfs can be produced at low temperatures via superacid assisted polycondensation however the material has a limited surface area 200 m2 g and an amorphous phase furthermore ctfs can be modified using microwave assisted to increase surface area and crystallinity phase 52 thus it can be concluded that the surface area properties of the ctfs are affected by crystallinity the high temperature approaches using ionothermal and p2o5 catalyzed have relatively more crystalline properties than low temperature synthesis methods 2 1 2 electro optical properties of ctfs besides ctfs another carbon nitride g c3n4 material had been studied as photoactive the g c3n4 and ctfs have common chemical structures and properties because they have the same conjugated π bond with stacking aromatic and triazine functional groups in their structure this architecture led to the semiconductive and electro optical active properties of the materials however the most prominent properties of ctfs compared to g c3n4 are the tunability and the vast diversity of ctfs there are several fabrication methods to tailor the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process ren et al studied phenyl series as monomer spacers to synthesize ctfs 52 as more spacers are available in the ctfs structure the bandgap of the ctfs decreases from 2 95 ev to 2 48 ev with the valence and conduction band moving to a more negative position this is due to the enlarged π bond electron delocalization and weaker electron movement of the benzene ring in the ctfs fig 4 a and b exhibits ctfs with different monomer linkers on the 2d plane structure the smaller linker of the ctfs will increase the ctf s bandgap 53 the synthesis process is also essential to create photoactive ctfs materials ionothermal methods leave the ctfs partially carbonized in dark colored ctfs making the ctfs have a volatile band structure and less responsive to photon energy 30 54 55 the superacid catalyzed trimerization process is a promising synthesis method for ctfs as photoactive materials however it has some drawbacks the ctfs produced have low crystallinity and thermal stability properties nevertheless kuecken et al have successfully combined superacid and ionothermal methods to improve the stability and crystallinity of the ctfs materials 54 another method to increase the effectiveness of the charge transfer process is by the addition of another element or dopant in the ctfs structure some studies have been carried out with the addition of metal to ctfs to enhance the photocarrier transfer activity in the photocatalyst process metals such as cu bi and nonmetals such as s and p have been studied in the ctfs structure to improve their performance in photocatalytic operations 56 59 introducing another atom could replace the n atom on the ctfs structure which usually occurs by adding nonmetal atoms the addition of metal atoms will form a complex bond with the n atom available in the triazine group of ctf 1 in addition nonmetal ions such as p will delocalize the valence electrons in the triazine structure of ctfs thereby broadening the band distribution of ctfs the extended band distribution of ctfs improves the charge transfer process 60 61 subsequently the addition of metal to the ctfs structure will increase the total conductivity of the ctf material 62 the metal addition with a suitable composition to the ctfs material will increase the electron density on the ctf surface the availability of a large amount of electrons on the material s surface efficiently improves the photo induced charge transfer process thus improving the photocatalytic process 63 2 1 3 water stability the strong π covalent bond between c and n in the triazine structure confers exceptional stability to ctfs 64 the triazine linkage bond in ctfs has a stronger chemical bond than metal organic linkage bonds in mof and boroxine linkage in some cof species whereas susceptible to dehydration reaction 65 the water stability of the ctfs was studied by various researchers ghazi et al 66 studied the chemical stability of ctf 1 various ph conditions 2 7 and 9 were studied to adsorb cd2 the ctf 1 materials did not show any surface corrosion under sem characterization which has very high chemical stability the stability in aqueous media is also observable in the high recyclability of the adsorption process yang et al 35 discovered that thio group decorated covalent triazine framework has excellent recyclability on hg2 removal that material only lost 5 on adsorption efficiency after 5 times usage additionally ctfs possess high resistance to photo corrosion in aqueous media li et al 67 have studied the reusability of photocatalyst in the water disinfection process ctfs based material has excellent photocatalytic reusability up to 5 times with less than 5 decrease in efficiency it is proven that ctf has high resistance towards photo corrosion 2 2 ctf synthesis methods 2 2 1 ionothermal methods kuhn et al 23 used several monomers such as 1 4 dicyanobenzene 4 4 dicyano 1 1 biphenyl 2 5 dicyanothiophene 2 6 dicyanopyridine and 1 3 5 tris 4 cyanophenyl benzene for ctfs synthesis with the assist of zinc chloride zncl2 as a catalyst at 400 c liquid zncl2 helps the monomers to form a blackish solid resulting from the trimerization process the melted zncl2 will create a powerful ionic solvent and become a medium to dissolve nitrile monomers the melted zncl2 also acts as ionized lewis acid zn and cl and will react with the nitrile group to ensure the trimerization reaction 31 68 fig 5 illustrates that lewis acid zncl2 will accept the free electron pair from the nitrile functional group cn from dcb and create nitrilum salt 1 the carbon atom from nitrilum salt will have a nucleophilic attack from the second dcb monomer to form immonium salt 2 69 the third dcb will undergo another nucleophilic attack into immonium salt 3 afterward the cyclization reaction creates the triazine rings 4 which bear the triazine after basic hydrolysis 5 70 at the time ctfs derived from 1 4 dicyanobenzene had the largest pore of all synthesized ctfs because the pore size of 1 4 dicyanobenzene itself was the largest among all monomers 23 ctf produced by the ionothermal method has low to high crystallinity characteristics with a large surface area 54 the use of ionothermal methods has simple processing flexibility and results in materials with a significant degree of crystallinity and high surface area 45 however the subsequent process of removing zn and cl ions are mandatory to maintain the geometric structure and chemical properties of the ctfs therefore in every ctfs synthesis process by ionothermal method ctfs are washed with hcl to dissolve zn ions from the ctfs structures that have been synthesized table 3 presented various ctfs with ionothermal synthesis methods and its application 2 2 2 superacid catalyzed methods the trimerization process can be carried out with a superacid catalyst trifluoromethanesulfate with the highest strength of all lewis and bronsted acid 73 trifluoromethanesulfate acid was first synthesized in 1954 and later it was widely used for organic synthesis processes 74 in the 70s this method was used by a h vogel to synthesize triazine based polymers the process occurs in the liquid phase and at low temperature in the superacid method resulting in a higher yield of ctf and a shorter reaction time than the solid phase reaction ionothermal 30 54 furthermore ctfs generated will immediately precipitate without any impurities and solid products can be separated easily from the solvent making it easier for further processing 75 76 there is no other carbonization process in some instances even at room temperature ctf produced by the superacid method will have a yellowish appearance and fluorescent properties and be suitable to use as a photocatalyst 51 52 77 further the synthesis process with the superacid method can produce ctf material with an interfacial structure and is ideal to be embedded for membrane fabrication 75 78 the superacid catalyzed method for synthesizing ctfs was initially carried out by ren et al used trifluoromethanesulfonic acid cf3so3h as a catalyst for monomer transformation in the temperature range 0 100 c 52 some of the monomers used are 1 4 dicyanobenzene 4 4 oxydibenzonitrile and 4 4 biphenyldicarbonitrile the results showed that various monomers could form ctf with amorphous structures liu et al also proved that ctfs could be formed with slight modifications by adding dichloromethane ch2cl2 to help cf3so3h convert 1 4 dicyanobenzene to ctf at 100 c 79 a few representative studies of ctf synthesized using superacid methods are listed in table 4 however the superacid process has disadvantages the as prepared ctfs are highly amorphous and have a limited degree of polymerization compared to the ionothermal method ren et al 52 used microwave assisted in the subsequent process to increase the crystallinity of ctfs kuecken et al combined superacid and ionothermal methods to obtain ctfs with high crystallinity 54 as shown in fig 6a kuecken shows that pre ctfs and ctfs synthesized using the super acid catalyzed method have no crystallinity peak from the xrd pattern the crystallinity properties of ctfs would be visible only after they have been re synthesized at sealed conditions using ionothermal methods 30 fig 6b also reveals that ionothermal methods improved the surface area properties of ctfs moreover the superacid method is costly and dangerous due to carcinogenic solvents the illustration of superacid synthesis is presented in fig 7 as can be seen superacid methods are done in reflux conditions with milder conditions 2 2 3 phosphorous pentoxide p2o5 catalyzed methods yu et al developed a ctfs synthesis using phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 catalyst 50 as in fig 8 ctfs synthesized using phosphorous pentoxide methods has a smaller aperture than the superacid synthesis method 1 4 nm vs 1 nm through this method p2o5 is used for the direct condensation process of terephthalamide ta to form an s triazine ring in practice the process takes place in several stages first the main component of the aromatic amide c o nh2 is converted into nitrile cn using p2o5 as a catalyst then develops into an s triazine ring due to the condensation process then aromatic amide and nitrile products form the ctfs structures through p2o5 catalysis and a high surface area of 2034 m2 g is obtained the phosphorus pentoxide method operates at 400 c and has the advantage which is easier to separate the product from the catalyst and the process is environmentally friendly 2 2 4 friedel crafts coupling reaction in addition to the methods described an alternative ctf synthesis method is the friedel craft coupling reaction method this method is claimed to be relatively less expensive and safer than the superacid catalyzed process 80 81 in the friedel craft coupling procedure the possibility of ctfs being produced is more because the combination of polymer body building blocks in the form of aromatic rings is available in various types in addition the reaction time is much faster than the ionothermal method 16h vs 40h 64 82 this reaction used cyanuric chloride as a triazine building block and coupled with an aromatic ring as a polymer body ctfs with this method have amorphous characteristics with a large surface area ctfs synthesized by this method have been applied several times for the gas phase and liquid phase adsorbent fig 9 shows the mechanism of the friedel crafts synthesis route cyanuric chloride will react with alcl3 on friedel crafts reaction 1 and form cyanuric carbocation 2 each cyanuric carbocation will react with other 3 benzene molecules in nucleophilic reaction 3 to form a covalent triazine framework 4 80 83 2 2 5 amidine based polycondensation a new synthesis route to obtain ctfs emerged in 2017 fig 10 shows the synthetic route of amidine based ctfs ctfs were successfully synthesized using aldehyde and an amidine by schiff base reaction 1 followed by a michael addition reaction 2 18 84 this method was done in mild conditions without the presence of a strong basic or acid substance in 2017 wang et al first synthesized ctfs based material using amidine based polycondensation namely ctf hust 1 ctf hust 2 ctf hust 3 and ctf hust 4 after reacted terephthalamidine with four different monomers namely 1 4 benzene dialdehyde 4 4 biphenyl dialdehyde tris 4 formyl phenyl amine and tris 4 formylbiphenyl amine these reactions were done in relatively mild conditions at 120 c using cs2co3 as a base catalyst and dmso as solvent successfully synthesized ctfs are yellow which is partial carbonization was very minimum compared to the other methods amidine based polycondensation promises scalability and ease of the synthetic process since it was done in one pot polymerization without protection by an inert atmosphere the use of a relatively cheap catalyst and a milder solvent 84 as a result of less partial carbonization of ctfs using amidine polycondensation compared to ionothermal and p2o5 amidine based ctfs are more suitable for photocatalytic applications liu et al modified the mechanism to improve the crystalline properties by using in situ slow oxidation of alcohol monomer into aldehyde monomer 85 those processes will decrease the nucleation rates assembly rates and produce ctfs crystallinity phase 3 application 3 1 adsorbent 3 1 1 heavy metal adsorption the development of an increasingly advanced industry has made water contamination by heavy metals a problem to overcome the minamata bay incident opened the world s eyes to the real dangers of heavy metal pollution unlike carbon based compounds heavy metals will never degrade in nature and accumulate by the effects of bioaccumulation in a living organism the extraordinary lousy health effects from cancer to nerve damage in the human body lead to the need for valuable materials to remove heavy metals from nature ctfs are known as a porous material that has a large surface area theoretically ctfs can have a surface area of more than 1500 m2 g and also have high chemical stability 32 38 50 52 64 71 72 77 numerous n atoms in the ctfs structures make ctfs excellent materials in the heavy metal adsorption process atom n will interact with heavy metals such as pb2 and cd2 through chelation 66 therefore it makes ctfs attractive materials for the adsorption process compared to other adsorbent materials such as activated carbon and clay heavy metal adsorption in other adsorbents such as activated carbon and clay has less adsorption capacity than ctfs for instance activated carbon derived from rice husk 86 and clay based material bentonite grafted with poly n acryloylglycinamide 87 have 55 87 mg g and 25 72 mg g of hg2 adsorption capacity another adsorbent material for heavy metal removal that has been extensively studied is metal organic framework mof is composed of metal ions and organic linkers and then connected into a three dimensional lattice mof material example used for hg2 adsorbent is uio 66 nhc s nhme it has adsorption capacity of 769 mg g 88 all materials have less adsorption capacity than ctfs based materials such as sctn 1 with the adsorption capacity of 1253 mg g for hg2 the high adsorption capacity of ctf is based on chemical bonding stabilization between the ctf and heavy metal adsorbate therefore making the adsorption phenomenon becomes more easily occurred ctf 0 or ctf 1 synthesized by ghazi et al in 2018 was successfully used to adsorb cd2 from aqueous with an adsorption capacity of 29 26 mg g 66 cadmium is known to have a higher solubility than other heavy metals ctf 1 was synthesized using ionothermal methods and its skeletal structure is very stable up to 600 c because it has crystalline properties the ctf 1 that has been synthesized by ghazi et al has a surface area of 490 m2 g and pore size of 1 3 nm in this experiment the adsorption phenomenon of ctf 1 followed the langmuir and dubnin radushkevich adsorption model so that the adsorption process was classified as chemisorption the illustration schematic of the ctf 1 in adsorbing heavy metals and their properties is shown in fig 11 modifying monomers in the synthesis process by adding additional functional groups such as sulfur oxygen ammonia and even metals increases ctfs adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal because of the chelating phenomenon of heavy metal towards different functional groups 35 44 ctf with the thioether functional group sctn 1 is proved to have an adsorption capacity of up to 1253 mg g for hg2 ions removal had studied by mondal et al 44 sctn 1 has an excellent surface area with 1249 m2 g 1 of surface area and micropore pore properties the high adsorption value is due to the interaction of hg2 ions with the n and s atoms contained in the sctn 1 structure the presence of the sulfur functional group in the ctfs structures increased the mercury removal in the adsorption process thus the hg2 ion has created a ligand bond towards n and s atoms present in the ctf structure those phenomena can be seen from xps spectroscopy in fig 12 hg 4f has a binding energy peak at 105 1 ev and 100 9 ev 44 on the other hand sctn 1 has a robust s2p signal at 164 3 ev and 163 2 ev for doublet signals of s2p3 2 and 2p1 2 after the adsorption process the binding energy peak of the s2p from sctn was shifted to a higher binding energy value which is attributed to the binding of electron rich sulfur with mercury ions 44 it is proven that its adsorption effectiveness can reach 95 after seven consecutive reusabilities these properties come from the relatively stable covalent bond in the covalent triazine frameworks yang z et al also studied ctf with a thio group for hg2 ion removal which resulted in up to 840 5 mg g adsorption capacity 35 the selectivity of thio groups ctfs are shown outstanding performance as opposed to 11 different competitive heavy metal ions in the wastewater solution the material s performance indicates hg2 adsorption up to 99 removal effectiveness ph influences in hg2 adsorption is investigated the study was conducted in a ph range of 1 12 the highest adsorption efficiency was achieved at ph 5 at lower ph a high concentration of h ion would compete with hg2 to interact with the triazine and s functional group at the higher ph hg2 will interact with oh and make a complex compound that prevents the interaction between hg2 ions and triazine and s species of ctf adsorbent the addition of metal oxide material to ctf 1 was carried out by leus et al i e γ fe2o3 43 γ fe2o3 was synthesized first and then added with ctf 1 by in situ doping modified fe particles have been used as adsorbents for heavy metal removal numerous studies however have demonstrated that fe2o3 is unstable due to the high oxidation potential of fe hindering the long term use of the material therefore further modification of fe based adsorbent is necessary the addition of γ fe2o3 particles increases the intraparticle pores of the ctf 1 composite adsorbent material and raises the stability of both materials the doped material is then used to adsorb heavy metals such as as3 as5 and hg2 γ fe2o3 ctf 1 is also used for the adsorption process by simulating real life conditions by being tested using surface ground and wastewater in the presence of additional ions in the form of ca2 mg2 ph effect and natural organic materials the results obtained by this experiment are that the material is not influenced by the presence of other ions available in the wastewater the ph effect has only decreased hg2 adsorption capacity at ph 11 the basic condition increases the formation of stable hydroxide complexes withdrawing free ions from the solution the adsorption capacity of γ fe2o3 ctf 1 for arsenite is 198 0 mg g arsenate 102 3 mg g and divalent mercury 165 8 mg g the difference in heavy metals adsorption performance using ctfs are in the list in table 5 3 1 2 organic based material adsorption the organic contaminant is highly prolific in wastewater components given the industry s exceptionally rapid development in this modern world 89 90 adsorption methods for organic pollutants are the easiest and most effective in terms of process cost simplicity of design and operation intricacies 91 3 1 2 1 dye adsorption the development of the textile paper and printing industries increased dye waste contaminating the water according to rojas et al 10 000 tons of dye waste are withdrawn each year into the environment 89 dye waste in water negatively affects human health and wildlife habitats some dyes are very toxic to the point of being carcinogenic 92 94 in recent years several experiments have been carried out to test the effectiveness of ctfs in adsorbing various types of dyes as shown in table 6 wang t et al investigated the adsorption activity of dyes such as rhodamine b rhb with molecule weight of 479 02 reactive brilliant red x 3b with molecule weight of 615 30 and acid violet 4bs with molecule weight of 813 70 ctf 1 was synthesized through the primary ionothermal method at high temperatures of 400 c to 600 c 37 the ctf 1 produced from this method has a large surface area of 2071 m2 g 1 the experimental results in fig 13 a showed that the maximum adsorption capacity qe up to 469 mg g for rhb 431 mg g for x 3b and 178 mg g for 4bs this value is significantly superior to the qe value of activated carbon ac which is only half of the ctfs various influences in the experiment such as parameters kinetics and reusability of the catalyst were tested the result is that ctf 1 has very effective removal for both anionic dyes and cationic dyes as for ctf 1 the anionic dyes such as x 3b and 4bs the anionic dyes free electrons will interact with the n atom in the triazine linkers in the ctf as for cationic the phenomenon of adsorption of cationic dyes such as rhb occurs due to electrostatic and dispersive interactions with the surface of ctf 1 fig 13 b in this study ctf 1 has high material stability because it can use adsorption up to 4 times without losing its effectiveness the ctf 1 adsorption kinetics tested are pseudo second order representing liquid membrane diffusion internal diffusion and surface adsorption furthermore this experiment s isotherm model follows the langmuir isotherm which indicates the chemosorption trend 37 an f et al also used ctf 1 and ctf dcbp ctf 2 as adsorbent material for adsorbing methylene blue mb mo and chrysophenine g cg dyes 95 the dyes have a significantly bigger molecular size cg has molecular 680 7 g mol much bigger than mb which is 309 85 g mol and mo 327 33 g mol ctf 1 and ctf dcbp were synthesized using two different monomers but using the same ionothermal methods ctf dcbp has considerably bigger surface area 1745 45 m2 g 1 and pore volume 1 42 cm3 g 1 than ctf 1 with 782 m2 g 1 of surface area and 0 40 cm3 g 1 of pore volume the more extensive surface area and pore size make cg adsorption easier onto the ctf dcbp surface area the experiment also studied the different adsorption mechanisms of cationic and anionic properties of dyes as we know mb has cationic properties and mo has opposites properties mb has protonated n atoms in its structure that will counter interact with rich π electron in all ctfs surfaces therefore this may explain the remarkable results of the mb adsorption phenomenon on ctfs on the other hand mo anionic dyes has a different adsorption mechanism in the study ctfs have a point zero charge pzc around ph of 7 8 which implies the positive charge of the ctfs material ctfs properties indicate the material can form strong hydrogen bonds towards anionic material in this case mo furthermore this study also explored the ph impact on the adsorption process the result is that cationic dyes type mb adsorption capacity will increase on the higher ph and anionic type mo and cg will do the opposite soltani et al synthesized porous ctf ph sba 15 organic inorganic material hybrid silica and ctfs adsorbent materials 96 the result is auspicious because albeit sba 15 has a slightly higher surface area of 621 m2 g 1 vs 537 m2 g shown in table 6 the adsorption process for mb of sba 15 material is considerably lower than the ctf ph sba 15 fig 14a it implies the effect of the binding site on ctfs structural abilities as mentioned in the an f et al studies mb as cationic dyes will bind onto the rich π electron sites and has electron dispersive interaction with the ctfs aromatic skeletal rather than only physical bind into the sba 15 surface 95 the mechanism of the synthesis and adsorption process is shown in fig 14b the total methylene blue adsorption efficiency of sba 15 ph ctf is 569 049 mg g relatively high compared to other materials such as mof hkust 1 and uio 66 with 454 mg g and 106 mg g although those materials have a more significant surface area than the sba 15 ph ctf 1726 m2 g and 1125 m2 g vs 537 m2 g 98 this result confirms the previous explanation that the surface area affects the adsorption process and the strong physical and chemical interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate mokhtari et al used fluorene based ctfs flu cof as an adsorbent for acid blue 9 dyes removal 97 the synthesis route of flu cof is presented in fig 15 as prepared ctfs have oxygen linked atoms in its structure assuming it will employ stronger interaction with the dyes mokhtari conducted several operation conditions such as ph effect contact times and kinetical parameters the result is that flu cof is highly effective for anionic dyes types the adsorption isotherm is well fitted to langmuir and pseudo second order for isothermal models the result from previous studies indicated that ctfs has excellent adsorption efficiency the ctfs are effective for the adsorption of anionic and cationic dyes the adsorption capacity of ctfs is far superior compared to other adsorbent materials such as activated carbon and synthetic silica 3 1 2 2 other organic substance aside from heavy metals and industrial dyes many dangerous organic substances in wastewater can harm the aquatic environment aromatic compounds such as phenol 99 101 and pharmaceutical waste 102 103 in the water must be overcome as they are hazardous to human health and the environmental ecosystem ctfs have many unique features on the molecular properties such as large surface area chemical bond stability and ability to interact directly towards the adsorbate improving the effectivity of organic material removed from the wastewater table 7 lists several ctfs materials that have been applied to adsorb various organic substances liu j et al have studied ctf 1 as an adsorbent and compared commercial polymeric adsorbent amberlite xad 4 to remove many aromatic compounds such as benzene phenol aniline nitrobenzene 1 3 dinitrobenzene 1 3 5 trinitrobenzene 4 methyl 2 6 dinitrophenol benzenesulfonate naphthalene 2 naphthol 1 naphthalenamine 2 naphthalenesulfonate and pyrene 34 ctf 1 was synthesized using the ionothermal method the result shows a remarkable performance of ctf 1 which has more than twice the adsorption capacity than the commercial adsorbent 46 the superiority of ctfs over xad 4 as adsorbents as shown in table 7 is attributable to the distinct adsorbing characteristics ctfs have superior surface charge properties with an abundant electron environment in its structures 105 106 ctfs have outstanding performance in absorbing polar and non polar organic matter in contrast xad 4 consists of a hydrophobic based material suitable for adsorbing hydrophobic molecules however the hydrophobic nature of xad 4 makes the effectiveness of removing polar organic compounds limited liu j et al investigated antibiotic removal using ctfs as adsorbent 46 the ctfs were synthesized using 1 4 dicyanobenzene and 4 4 biphenylcarbonitrile as basic monomers by the ionothermal method two different ctfs were obtained ctf 1 1 4 dicyanobenzene and ctfdcbp 4 4 biphenylcarbonitrile the adsorbents were then used to adsorb sulfamethoxazole smx and tylosin tl as prepared ctf 1 has predominated microporous properties and ctfdcbp has both mesoporous and microporous properties the following properties explain that ctf 1 has better adsorption results for smx adsorption than tl because it has a bigger molecular size preventing diffusion into ctf 1 micropores on the other hand ctfdcbp has bigger pores volumes than ctf 1 1 42 cm3 g vs 0 40 cm3 g which is suitable for adsorbing bigger molecules as in this case smx molecules the adsorption distribution coefficient kd of the ctf 1 is 104 105 l kg for smx and 102 103 l kg for tl in comparison ctfdcbp has kd of smx 104 105 l kg and kd of tl 105 106 l kg furthermore akpe et al recently studied four different covalent organic frameworks for adsorbing smx namely mctp ctftpb cbap cbap eda and cbap so3h 104 mctp or ctftpb was synthesized using the friedel craft mechanism using 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene and cyanuric chloride as the monomer compared with other cof such as a carbonyl incorporated aromatic polymer cbap cbap functionalized with ethylenediamine cbap eda functionalized using sulfonic acid cbap so3h and commercial activated carbon ac mctp has a larger surface area the properties of the synthesized materials above can be seen in table 8 the adsorption performance of mctp is also far superior to the other materials mctp has smx adsorption capacity of 367 mg g much higher than cbap 252 mg g cbap eda 227 mg g cbap so3h 267 mg g and ac 257 mg g according to liu et al and akpe et al the excellent adsorption performance of the ctfs are not only the influence of textural porous properties of ctfs materials but the chemical properties of the ctfs are also dominant in this phenomenon 46 104 additionally both state that the electrostatic force of π π aromatic stack on the antibiotic molecules towards ctfs structures are the most important mechanism of antibiotic adsorption therefore ctfs are very prominent and can remove pharmaceutical waste for future water treatment the stability of the adsorption material is also prominent in ctfs based adsorbents mctp has less than 5 of efficiency decrease after compared to other materials such as mof for instance uio 66 only retains 80 of the adsorption capacity of sulfonamide waste after four usages 107 as stated in the previous study the triazine linker in ctfs is more stable than the metal organic linker in mof 3 2 membranes ctfs with micro mesopores properties are a promising material for utilizing water separation membranes the main advantage of ctfs compared to other materials commonly used for membranes is that ctfs have an extensive tuning potential so that the pore size and material properties of the ctfs can be adjusted as needed 108 109 besides ctfs have a structure that tends to be physically and chemically stable therefore it can be used as a membrane to separate waste from water in the water purifying process 47 table 9 summarizes numerous ctfs that have been applied for membrane application the interface method synthesizes ctfs membrane materials directly on the surface of the tfmsa as the solvents fig 16 a and b reveals that the membrane is synthesized using interface methods dcb is dropped carefully therefore it floats on the surface as the reaction goes directly making it a thin ctfs membrane layer as seen in fig 16 c 110 from table 9 ctf 1 has a salt rejection rate of 91 this value allows ctf 1 to be used for brackish water treatment or multistage saltwater treatment the data presented by lin et al shows that the smaller the pore of the ctfs will increase the salt rejection and reduce the water flux 47 in addition the difference charge in the ctfs structures will affect the salt rejection the negatively charged ctf 1 cl on the structure will make the positively charged sodium ion move easier towards the membrane pores thus in practice ctfs could be produced using different building blocks allowing for easy modification of the pore size and chemical characteristics to provide the desired features for the seawater desalination process li g et al successfully synthesized pristine catalyzed acid 2d ctf 1 with the interface reaction method at 100 c to form a thin layered membrane 110 the membrane is then used to separate several dyes such as methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb methylene blue mb congo red cr and gold au nanoparticles 2d ctf 1 pristine membranes have varying rejection effectivity for several types of dyes the greater the relative size of the dye molecules the greater the rejection value dye molecules such as mb dimension 1 53 nm 0 65 nm 0 28 nm cr dimension 2 42 nm 0 96 nm 0 71 nm and au nanoparticles 5 nm have a rejection rate of 96 the use of 2d ctf 1 pristine for separation has a high water flux of up to 141 50 l m 2 h 1 however 2d ctf 1 pristine has limitations for rejecting dye molecules with small molecular sizes such as rhb dimension 1 27 nm 1 13 nm 0 72 nm and mo dimension 1 31 nm 0 70 nm 0 5 nm with a rejection rate 13 pristine 2d ctf 1 that was successfully synthesized has an intraskeletal layer distance of 1 39 nm in size so that it can be used to effectively separate pollutants up to a molecular size 1 4 nm yin c et al recently synthesized 2d ctf 1 with the superacid method then further modified it by oxidizing the material making the 2d ctf 1 have a carbonyl functional group in the ctfs structures which can be seen in fig 17 a 78 fig 17 b also showed how ctfs could be modified using dmso as a proton acceptor and cf3so3h as a proton donor to create a carbonyl functional group on the ctfs structure this modification results in the pore size and the intraskeletal membrane distance becoming smaller than pristine 2d ctf 1 as prepared pristine 2d ctf 1 has roughly 1 3 1 4 nm of intraskeletal pore size compared to smaller 1 1 nm of oxidized ctf 1 membranes smaller pore makes the rejection of smaller molecules such as mo increase significantly the rejection percentage of mo in oxidized ctf 1 is almost 60 compared to 13 of pristine ctfs however a smaller intraskeletal radius of oxidized ctf 1 reduces the water flux compared to pristine ctf 1 oxidized ctf 1 has more than 50 decrease in water flux 140 vs 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the oxidizing process of ctf 1 also makes the surface of the materials become more negatively charged because of the presence of the oxygen atom this characteristic helps the membrane to reject the negatively charged mo molecules from water 3 3 photocatalytic water treatment photocatalytic has the advantage of removing wastes and pollutants in water over other methods the most important of which is where the pollutant substance is completely destroyed 111 112 this can happen pollutants especially organic pollutants react with radical molecules because in the photocatalytic process producing the simplest molecules of the organic substances co2 and h2o 113 114 compared to other methods such as chemically activated degradation aop 115 116 photocatalytic degradation is more environmentally friendly since it does not employ any additional chemicals to decompose the pollutant the degradation reaction with the photocatalytic method took place in the presence of light as an energy source and a catalyst with semiconductor properties with the availability of a covalent bond and a conduction band where oxidation and reduction reactions take place to produce radical molecules 117 119 photocatalytic processes for the degradation of organic waste substances in water have been carried out with various metal based catalysts such as tio2 106 zno 112 cds 113 znfe2o4 114 cetio4 115 subsequently due to the leaching of metal catalysts in wastewater researchers are currently developing non metallic catalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride such as melem g c3n4 120 porous g c3n4 121 porous graphene like g c3n4 122 nanotube g c3n4 123 h bn g c3n4 124 however g c3n4 still has drawbacks namely flexibility and tunability of the physical and chemical properties of the material in recent years ctfs have become the focus of attention of researchers due to its flexibility and tunability 125 126 several representative studies about photocatalytic oxidation using ctfs are found in table 10 ctfs have semiconductor properties derived from the π stacked aromatic unit of triazine and benzene from its structure which can undergo photo generated electron separation and charge transfer 53 129 131 ctf 1 has been studied and has a band gap value of 2 42 ev in the ctf 1 structure there is a benzene ring with an electron affinity value of 1 15 ev triazine is an electron acceptor with an affinity of 0 46 ev 54 this small band gap value makes ctfs exceptionally suited for use in photocatalytic processes the ctfs synthesis process is generally ionothermal at temperatures 400 c and time 40 h the long synthesis process causes the material s carbonization which could theoretically make ctfs inactive in the photocatalytic process the carbonization can cause the light spectrum to absorb more in the structure without any charge transfer 24 32 45 54 based on research conducted by niu et al that the ctfs with an amorphous structure has an irregular 3d crosslinked phenylene triazine ring that easily transfers electrons than the 2d crystalline structure of ctfs with nearly identical band gap values 1 57 ev of ctf a vs 1 60 ev of ctf c 127 these results indicate that the amorphous structure is better in the photocatalytic process because ctfs have a larger surface area and facilitates the mass transfer process to the active site of the catalyst many researchers have used ctfs for the photocatalytic process and most of them used it for the hydrogen production process for the water splitting reaction and co2 reduction ctfs can then be tuned to increase its effectiveness the ctfs catalyst can be modified by replacing the building block to obtain more conjugated molecules in its structure the synthesis method is also commonly carried out to achieve a suitable ctfs structure in the photocatalytic process besides that metal and nonmetal doping were also carried out to reduce the band gap value and increase the active catalyst site niu f et al synthesized two types of ctfs using the ionothermal method 127 the as prepared ctfs distinguish into two catalysts with different mole ratios of zncl2 and dcb the mole ratio of dcb and zncl2 with a 1 1 resulted in a crystalline ctfs while a 1 2 ratio of dcb and zncl2 resulted in an amorphous ctfs both have a significant difference in performance where ctf a amorphous is much better in the photocatalytic process than ctf c crystalline mb removal efficiency using ctf a at a concentration of 100 ppm can be achieved more than 98 while with ctf c the removal is less than 90 as shown in fig 18 2 a and 2 b this occurs because the electron transfer process happens more quickly in amorphous ctfs than crystalline therefore the charge transfer process will occur more efficiently and effectively 18 fig 18 1 a and 1 b shows the correlation between the ctfs structure and the ctf s semiconductor property as a photocatalyst as seen the uv drs spectrum of ctf c has a lower cut off value compared to ctf a 839 vs 831 ev interpolarizing uv drs value of those materials resulting in a band gap value of ctf a 1 57 ev vs ctf c 1 60 ev some researchers have also modified ctfs for photocatalytic degradation the addition of metal to ctfs was carried out by li l et al by adding ag agbr to the ctfs structures 67 this material is then used to disinfect water from the e coli bacteria the results obtained were that 99 9 of the bacteria became inactive at 12 5 min after the photocatalytic process li l et al stated that the radical species that influence the initial disinfection reaction is o2 fig 19 a shows the charge transfer photocatalytic mechanism of the bacteria inactivation process o2 is produced from the charge transfer reduction process in the conduction band cb of ctf 1 ag agbr the addition of ag agbr reduces the cb value so that the o2 production process will occur faster since electron from cb ctfs will easily be transferred into cb from agbr which has a lower energy value 1 03 vs 0 3 ev as seen in fig 19 b o2 will damage the cell walls of the bacteria e coli besides there is a minor species of radical production in the form of h2o2 from the reaction between o2 and water which also plays a role in this reaction although it does not dominate zhu s r et al carried out biobr metal composites addition to the ctfs structure to degrade the antibiotic compounds tetracycline hydrochloride tc and ciprofloxacin cip 56 the addition of bibobr to ctf 3d reduces the band gap value of pure biobr 2 78 ev vs 2 85 ev then increased the surface area to 120 of pristine biobr the ctf biobr mixture has a much better performance than pure biobr with an increased degradation efficiency of up to 30 and a reaction speed of 1 86 times faster this can occur because the presence of ctf 3d causes the charge transfer process to take place faster with a decrease in the band gap value besides the substrate s mass transfer process to the active catalyst site also occurs faster due to the larger surface area of the ctfs ctfs can also be used to degrade photos catalytically in the solid phase ctf is used to adsorb pollutants from the solution then pollutants trapped in the ctfs structure are degraded by direct photocatalyst adsorbent in a solid state after the process is complete the material is tested with uv spectra 128 the composite ctfs consists of silica sba 15 and 2 5 dicyanothiophene dct used as a building block monomer the monomer is then added with silica mesopores sba 15 and reacted with the superacid catalyzed method this study shows that two dyes rhb and mb can be degraded up to 90 kobs 0 119 min 1 and kobs 0 030 m 1 while org was achieved only 80 kobs 0 132 min 1 as shown in fig 20 c for properties ftir hr tem and sem and solid state degradation mechanism on rhb dyes of ctfs can be seen in fig 20 a b and d photocatalysis with ctfs materials have a unique reaction mechanism ctfs will degrade organic substances with o2 radicals ctfs have a valence band in the 2 ev position 127 131 while oh requires a potential value of 2 8 ev 132 hence thermodynamically ctfs are unable to produce oh by default 4 conclusion and insight ctfs have been in development for about ten years with excellent results ctfs applications for various purposes show promising results that exceed other widely used materials in these general topics ctfs have extraordinary potential to be used as an advanced material substitute for conventional materials such as zeolite activated carbon and graphene oxide in the field of wastewater treatment its tunable structure with excellent physical and chemical properties makes ctfs the perfect candidate compared to other materials such as mofs and cofs in general the availability of triazine bonds in the ctfs structures opens up the potential for ctfs to be used as active material in chemical reactions making it highly suitable for use as both a primary catalyst and catalyst support in various water purification chemical reactions i e photocatalysis the different ctfs synthesis methods and precursors are diverse and can still be developed according to the requirements it provides a wide choice of structural chemical and physical properties which can be tuned according to wastewater treatment applications four methods can prepare ctfs ionothermal superacid catalyzed p2o5 catalyzed and friedel craft coupling reaction the different reaction methods offer their respective advantages and disadvantages ctfs can be made with various crystallinity properties surface area and catalyst activity with different types of synthesis ionothermal provides the most straightforward ctfs synthesis with the most crystalline ctfs products with the drawback of ctfs will undergo a carbonization process because it runs at high temperatures the superacid catalyzed method produces amorphous uncarbonized ctfs with fast reaction times and relatively low temperatures however this method cannot be used on a large scale because it is a rather expensive process and the catalyst substance in the synthesis process is somewhat carcinogenic p2o5 catalyst in ctfs synthesis methods results in uncarbonized ctfs due to the relatively low reaction temperature but it has the disadvantage of an extended synthesis time 40 h synthesis with friedel craft coupling is an attractive alternative method because it has the advantages of synthesis in a mild state resulting in uncarbonized ctfs the use of harmless substances and is relatively cheap compared to superacid however this method is complicated to make on a large scale because of the limited amount of substances in the synthesis process the application of ctfs in the adsorption process has had extraordinary results ctfs go beyond materials such as activated carbon zeolite and clay in the wastewater adsorption process all types of waste ranging from organic to inorganic materials such as heavy metals and dyes can be removed through ctfs adsorption this can be explained because ctfs have a high surface area of 1500 m2 g with micro to mesoporous material pore the ctfs can then easily be modified the pore s size with the different precursor building blocks of the ctfs in addition ctfs can interact directly with chemical bonds with waste materials both organic and inorganic the interaction happened due to the ctfs structure that owned the chemical properties of the triazine and π π stack content of the aromatic ring the unique and diverse chemical properties make ctfs very suitable for use as a membrane for wastewater treatment the pore size between ctfs molecules can be adjusted up to 1 nm therefore it can be used to filter seawater in one process however the small pore size causes the water flux to be hindered to tackle this the ctfs can then adjust its surface charge properties to reject the ions from the salt contained in seawater to pass through the ctfs membranes without making the pore size somewhat smaller in addition to conventional methods of treating wastewater ctfs can be used to degrade organic waste by the photocatalytic process compared to traditional methods the photocatalytic method has an absolute advantage instead of only changing the phase of the waste material the photocatalytic process will change the phase and chemistry of organic waste into much less dangerous compounds namely co2 and h2o with the help of sunlight this process can occur because the ctfs have semiconductor properties from the stacked π bonds between the ctfs structure this characteristic causes the electrons on the ctfs structure s surface to move from the valence band to the conduction band in the presence of photon energy which is the semi conductivity phenomenon of the ctfs materials these properties can then be enhanced by adding other atoms to the structure increasing the semi conductivity of ctfs and then increasing the overall photocatalytic performance with the extraordinary potential of the ctfs it is interesting that the ctfs can be continuously developed in the future in order to overcome the most fundamental problem in the future namely maintaining the availability of clean water declaration of competing interest no issues of financial interests personal relationships as potential competing interests acknowledgments this work was supported by the

12905,effective degradation of hazardous effluents from the water environment has become essential due to the face paced growth of industrial wastewater the covalent triazine frameworks ctfs is a promising advanced material that has been broadly utilized and demonstrated promising results in various water treatment applications the notable superiority of ctfs compared to other advanced materials such as metal organic frameworks mofs and covalent organic frameworks cofs is due to its triazine linkage architecture which absence of weaker bonds and a substantial amount of n content making it adjustable surface area porosity electro optical properties and stability ctfs have been developed for adsorptive removal photocatalysis and membrane filtration exhibiting versatile

resource essential for ecosystems and human well being along with population growth rising in many countries worldwide water is a highly sought after commodity the earth provides less than 3 of freshwater and it is used as a source of clean water 1 in addition to decreasing amount of freshwater available water pollution is becoming more frequent due to fast growing industrial advancement prevention efforts are needed to treat wastewater before being discharged into the environment 2 many methods have been used to treat water such as photocatalytic degradation 3 4 fenton process degradation 5 catalytic oxidation 6 7 adsorption 8 11 and membrane filtration 12 the development of conventional materials such as activated carbon alumina silica natural zeolite and resin have been widely used and tested for wastewater adsorption processes 13 15 even though most carbon based material such as activated carbon has higher adsorption and performance towards organic compounds it is known that it has limitations for metals and other inorganic contaminants 16 and poor active sites 17 present research in wastewater treatment focuses on producing emerging non conventional materials one of the most eminent developed engineered materials is porous frameworks consisting of metal organic frameworks mofs with metal sites and covalent organic frameworks cofs solely designed from organic building blocks 18 19 the porous framework is a highly ordered porous material with compelling facets i e high porosity pore functionality and versatile skeletons 16 18 these multifaceted materials can be adjustable by controlling the functionalization 16 20 different linkages have been developed considering porous frameworks unique characteristics including boroxine boronate ester borosilicate imine hydrazone and borazine 21 nevertheless these linkages are unstable because they are very vulnerable to hydrolysis other approaches have been applied e g tautomerization and linkage conversion 18 22 however having a material with high stability is more advantageous and practical than further modifications triazine or aromatic cn linkage is becoming one of the prominent explorations due to distinct characteristics such as the nonexistence of weaker bonds except the aromatic bond which contributes to high chemical stability and abundant n content 18 in 2008 thomas et al 23 succeeded in synthesizing a porous organic polymer compound composed of triazine bonds with a precursor in the form of dicyanobenzene dcb the compound was then conceptualized as ctfs covalent triazine frameworks initially ctfs are made through ionothermal reactions at a 400 c 500 c temperature in zncl2 in which both zncl2 and building blocks monomer melts and are mixed at that temperature ctfs have several unique properties that are very attractive for various purposes for example a triazine group with a cn bond provides an abundant catalyst s active site 24 infrastructural chemical bonds in ctfs are solid so they have very high structural stability diverse structures with modification of synthesis and monomers selection 25 27 ctf s various properties make ctfs very promising and widely used for various water treatment applications since then the investigations and studies on ctfs materials have steadily grown over time fig 1 shows the exponential growth in published original research articles about ctfs materials especially water treatment applications as far as our knowledge the comprehensive review of these rising materials solely for wastewater treatment applications is still unavailable this review is deliberately intended to offer a comprehensive review and summary of the latest development in ctfs for water treatment applications 2 ctf in 2005 cote et al successfully synthesized material with pure crystalline organic groups with properties almost similar to zeolites 28 this material was drafted under the name covalent organic framework cof cote et al first synthesized cof 1 and cof 5 materials which are the cof class with an aromatic material arrangement that has boron ester bonds in the formation of the polymer the most widely synthesized cof is by boron linkage because it has high crystallinity mesoporous material and a large surface area however boron linkage cof has limited usability because of a drawback in the material properties with low chemical stability 29 kuhn et al succeeded in making a new porous polymer material using an ionothermal approach with properties similar to cof having a large surface area with high chemical stability 23 this material is conceived as ctfs which has an intramolecular bond in an azine bond with a triazine group the substance namely ctf 1 was synthesized by reacting dcb as a monomer with the help of zncl2 which functioned as solvent and catalyst at 400 c 23 this approach produces a ctfs material that is porous and has a large surface area however this procedure has the disadvantage of requiring a longer time in the synthesis process so it is impractical to mass produce ctf 30 then along with its development ctfs was synthesized with various building blocks or monomers with different reaction methods with their respective processes the fundamental step in producing ctfs is the trimerization reaction that results in the formation of triazine in the 1960s yanagida et al successfully produced 2 4 6 triaryl s triazine using metal halides as a catalyst the process is carried out at a temperature above the metal halides melting point 200 c 400 c 31 later h a vogel and g h miller in the 70s developed a polymerization technique to form polymers from di tri and tetra nitrile precursors by the same method at higher temperatures 410 c 550 c 32 33 the research carried out then becomes the basis for the synthesis of ctf in the future fig 2 demonstrates the basic model of the ctfs material namely 2d and 3d structures as seen the pore characteristic is subjugated by the triazine link of the ctf the type of monomer constituent also determines the pore size of the ctf 34 2 1 ctf properties and tunability in the water treatment process one of the required characteristics is the material stability compared to the other covalent organic based materials such as cof and mof ctfs with triazine linkers has chemical properties that are stable and resistant to acid and alkaline conditions 35 37 these attributes make ctfs an attractive candidate for the water treatment process ctfs is porous semiconductor polymer with excellent surface area properties ctfs are renowned for their structure tunability which facilitates the modification of different water treatment applications 32 35 36 2 1 1 pore and surface area properties of ctf besides the high stability ctfs also has an extensive surface area many studies confirmed that basic ctf 1 synthesized from 1 4 dicyanobenzene using ionothermal methods has around 800 1000 m2 g of surface area with a porous aperture size of 1 5 nm 37 39 those microporous properties of ctf 1 have multifaceted utilization such as dye removal heavy metal removal and salt rejection in the desalination process the versatility of ctfs could be improved since the pore size of the ctf is dependent on the organic monomer in the material different monomers such as 1 3 5 tricyanobenzene will create very narrow pores with an aperture size 1 nm and can be utilized for salt rejection in the desalination process 40 other methods for tuning the pore size of the ctf could be directed using the introduction of another element to the ctfs structures many studies have been conducted by adding other features and functional groups such as fe2o3 s f and k to alter the pore size and surface chemical properties of the ctfs 41 44 the result of different functionalizations is presented in table 1 the dense electrons on the ctfs surfaces could interact with the electrophilic adsorbate triazine functional groups could act as basic sites for nucleophilic adsorbate thus increasing the versatility of ctf as an adsorbent 37 fig 3 and table 2 display the computational design of the various ctfs with the different elemental functional groups and pore properties as can be seen ctf 0 which was synthesized using 1 3 5 tricyanobenzene has a narrow aperture compared to ctf 1 however ctf 1 could be modified using different elements such as cl and ch3 to further narrow the pore size 47 in addition it can be seen that the pore aperture size on the ctfs depends on the organic linker and van der walls effect on each atom in the ctfs structures fig 3 thus ctfs will have a relatively smaller pore aperture of ctfs with fewer phenyl groups on the linker moreover the fabrication conditions can alter the pore and surface area properties the temperature difference and lewis acid salt composition affect the pore properties of ctfs in the ionothermal method some studies have shown that high temperature and high monomer salt ratio would increase the surface area properties of the ctfs however it can also reduce the microporosity of the material itself 48 49 another alternative for the ctfs polymerization process is to use p2o5 as the catalyst to overcome this deficiency as a result the synthesized ctfs have a relatively larger surface area and micro sized pores than the ionothermal method using a zncl2 catalyst 18 50 51 ctfs can be produced at low temperatures via superacid assisted polycondensation however the material has a limited surface area 200 m2 g and an amorphous phase furthermore ctfs can be modified using microwave assisted to increase surface area and crystallinity phase 52 thus it can be concluded that the surface area properties of the ctfs are affected by crystallinity the high temperature approaches using ionothermal and p2o5 catalyzed have relatively more crystalline properties than low temperature synthesis methods 2 1 2 electro optical properties of ctfs besides ctfs another carbon nitride g c3n4 material had been studied as photoactive the g c3n4 and ctfs have common chemical structures and properties because they have the same conjugated π bond with stacking aromatic and triazine functional groups in their structure this architecture led to the semiconductive and electro optical active properties of the materials however the most prominent properties of ctfs compared to g c3n4 are the tunability and the vast diversity of ctfs there are several fabrication methods to tailor the effectiveness of the photocatalytic process ren et al studied phenyl series as monomer spacers to synthesize ctfs 52 as more spacers are available in the ctfs structure the bandgap of the ctfs decreases from 2 95 ev to 2 48 ev with the valence and conduction band moving to a more negative position this is due to the enlarged π bond electron delocalization and weaker electron movement of the benzene ring in the ctfs fig 4 a and b exhibits ctfs with different monomer linkers on the 2d plane structure the smaller linker of the ctfs will increase the ctf s bandgap 53 the synthesis process is also essential to create photoactive ctfs materials ionothermal methods leave the ctfs partially carbonized in dark colored ctfs making the ctfs have a volatile band structure and less responsive to photon energy 30 54 55 the superacid catalyzed trimerization process is a promising synthesis method for ctfs as photoactive materials however it has some drawbacks the ctfs produced have low crystallinity and thermal stability properties nevertheless kuecken et al have successfully combined superacid and ionothermal methods to improve the stability and crystallinity of the ctfs materials 54 another method to increase the effectiveness of the charge transfer process is by the addition of another element or dopant in the ctfs structure some studies have been carried out with the addition of metal to ctfs to enhance the photocarrier transfer activity in the photocatalyst process metals such as cu bi and nonmetals such as s and p have been studied in the ctfs structure to improve their performance in photocatalytic operations 56 59 introducing another atom could replace the n atom on the ctfs structure which usually occurs by adding nonmetal atoms the addition of metal atoms will form a complex bond with the n atom available in the triazine group of ctf 1 in addition nonmetal ions such as p will delocalize the valence electrons in the triazine structure of ctfs thereby broadening the band distribution of ctfs the extended band distribution of ctfs improves the charge transfer process 60 61 subsequently the addition of metal to the ctfs structure will increase the total conductivity of the ctf material 62 the metal addition with a suitable composition to the ctfs material will increase the electron density on the ctf surface the availability of a large amount of electrons on the material s surface efficiently improves the photo induced charge transfer process thus improving the photocatalytic process 63 2 1 3 water stability the strong π covalent bond between c and n in the triazine structure confers exceptional stability to ctfs 64 the triazine linkage bond in ctfs has a stronger chemical bond than metal organic linkage bonds in mof and boroxine linkage in some cof species whereas susceptible to dehydration reaction 65 the water stability of the ctfs was studied by various researchers ghazi et al 66 studied the chemical stability of ctf 1 various ph conditions 2 7 and 9 were studied to adsorb cd2 the ctf 1 materials did not show any surface corrosion under sem characterization which has very high chemical stability the stability in aqueous media is also observable in the high recyclability of the adsorption process yang et al 35 discovered that thio group decorated covalent triazine framework has excellent recyclability on hg2 removal that material only lost 5 on adsorption efficiency after 5 times usage additionally ctfs possess high resistance to photo corrosion in aqueous media li et al 67 have studied the reusability of photocatalyst in the water disinfection process ctfs based material has excellent photocatalytic reusability up to 5 times with less than 5 decrease in efficiency it is proven that ctf has high resistance towards photo corrosion 2 2 ctf synthesis methods 2 2 1 ionothermal methods kuhn et al 23 used several monomers such as 1 4 dicyanobenzene 4 4 dicyano 1 1 biphenyl 2 5 dicyanothiophene 2 6 dicyanopyridine and 1 3 5 tris 4 cyanophenyl benzene for ctfs synthesis with the assist of zinc chloride zncl2 as a catalyst at 400 c liquid zncl2 helps the monomers to form a blackish solid resulting from the trimerization process the melted zncl2 will create a powerful ionic solvent and become a medium to dissolve nitrile monomers the melted zncl2 also acts as ionized lewis acid zn and cl and will react with the nitrile group to ensure the trimerization reaction 31 68 fig 5 illustrates that lewis acid zncl2 will accept the free electron pair from the nitrile functional group cn from dcb and create nitrilum salt 1 the carbon atom from nitrilum salt will have a nucleophilic attack from the second dcb monomer to form immonium salt 2 69 the third dcb will undergo another nucleophilic attack into immonium salt 3 afterward the cyclization reaction creates the triazine rings 4 which bear the triazine after basic hydrolysis 5 70 at the time ctfs derived from 1 4 dicyanobenzene had the largest pore of all synthesized ctfs because the pore size of 1 4 dicyanobenzene itself was the largest among all monomers 23 ctf produced by the ionothermal method has low to high crystallinity characteristics with a large surface area 54 the use of ionothermal methods has simple processing flexibility and results in materials with a significant degree of crystallinity and high surface area 45 however the subsequent process of removing zn and cl ions are mandatory to maintain the geometric structure and chemical properties of the ctfs therefore in every ctfs synthesis process by ionothermal method ctfs are washed with hcl to dissolve zn ions from the ctfs structures that have been synthesized table 3 presented various ctfs with ionothermal synthesis methods and its application 2 2 2 superacid catalyzed methods the trimerization process can be carried out with a superacid catalyst trifluoromethanesulfate with the highest strength of all lewis and bronsted acid 73 trifluoromethanesulfate acid was first synthesized in 1954 and later it was widely used for organic synthesis processes 74 in the 70s this method was used by a h vogel to synthesize triazine based polymers the process occurs in the liquid phase and at low temperature in the superacid method resulting in a higher yield of ctf and a shorter reaction time than the solid phase reaction ionothermal 30 54 furthermore ctfs generated will immediately precipitate without any impurities and solid products can be separated easily from the solvent making it easier for further processing 75 76 there is no other carbonization process in some instances even at room temperature ctf produced by the superacid method will have a yellowish appearance and fluorescent properties and be suitable to use as a photocatalyst 51 52 77 further the synthesis process with the superacid method can produce ctf material with an interfacial structure and is ideal to be embedded for membrane fabrication 75 78 the superacid catalyzed method for synthesizing ctfs was initially carried out by ren et al used trifluoromethanesulfonic acid cf3so3h as a catalyst for monomer transformation in the temperature range 0 100 c 52 some of the monomers used are 1 4 dicyanobenzene 4 4 oxydibenzonitrile and 4 4 biphenyldicarbonitrile the results showed that various monomers could form ctf with amorphous structures liu et al also proved that ctfs could be formed with slight modifications by adding dichloromethane ch2cl2 to help cf3so3h convert 1 4 dicyanobenzene to ctf at 100 c 79 a few representative studies of ctf synthesized using superacid methods are listed in table 4 however the superacid process has disadvantages the as prepared ctfs are highly amorphous and have a limited degree of polymerization compared to the ionothermal method ren et al 52 used microwave assisted in the subsequent process to increase the crystallinity of ctfs kuecken et al combined superacid and ionothermal methods to obtain ctfs with high crystallinity 54 as shown in fig 6a kuecken shows that pre ctfs and ctfs synthesized using the super acid catalyzed method have no crystallinity peak from the xrd pattern the crystallinity properties of ctfs would be visible only after they have been re synthesized at sealed conditions using ionothermal methods 30 fig 6b also reveals that ionothermal methods improved the surface area properties of ctfs moreover the superacid method is costly and dangerous due to carcinogenic solvents the illustration of superacid synthesis is presented in fig 7 as can be seen superacid methods are done in reflux conditions with milder conditions 2 2 3 phosphorous pentoxide p2o5 catalyzed methods yu et al developed a ctfs synthesis using phosphorus pentoxide p2o5 catalyst 50 as in fig 8 ctfs synthesized using phosphorous pentoxide methods has a smaller aperture than the superacid synthesis method 1 4 nm vs 1 nm through this method p2o5 is used for the direct condensation process of terephthalamide ta to form an s triazine ring in practice the process takes place in several stages first the main component of the aromatic amide c o nh2 is converted into nitrile cn using p2o5 as a catalyst then develops into an s triazine ring due to the condensation process then aromatic amide and nitrile products form the ctfs structures through p2o5 catalysis and a high surface area of 2034 m2 g is obtained the phosphorus pentoxide method operates at 400 c and has the advantage which is easier to separate the product from the catalyst and the process is environmentally friendly 2 2 4 friedel crafts coupling reaction in addition to the methods described an alternative ctf synthesis method is the friedel craft coupling reaction method this method is claimed to be relatively less expensive and safer than the superacid catalyzed process 80 81 in the friedel craft coupling procedure the possibility of ctfs being produced is more because the combination of polymer body building blocks in the form of aromatic rings is available in various types in addition the reaction time is much faster than the ionothermal method 16h vs 40h 64 82 this reaction used cyanuric chloride as a triazine building block and coupled with an aromatic ring as a polymer body ctfs with this method have amorphous characteristics with a large surface area ctfs synthesized by this method have been applied several times for the gas phase and liquid phase adsorbent fig 9 shows the mechanism of the friedel crafts synthesis route cyanuric chloride will react with alcl3 on friedel crafts reaction 1 and form cyanuric carbocation 2 each cyanuric carbocation will react with other 3 benzene molecules in nucleophilic reaction 3 to form a covalent triazine framework 4 80 83 2 2 5 amidine based polycondensation a new synthesis route to obtain ctfs emerged in 2017 fig 10 shows the synthetic route of amidine based ctfs ctfs were successfully synthesized using aldehyde and an amidine by schiff base reaction 1 followed by a michael addition reaction 2 18 84 this method was done in mild conditions without the presence of a strong basic or acid substance in 2017 wang et al first synthesized ctfs based material using amidine based polycondensation namely ctf hust 1 ctf hust 2 ctf hust 3 and ctf hust 4 after reacted terephthalamidine with four different monomers namely 1 4 benzene dialdehyde 4 4 biphenyl dialdehyde tris 4 formyl phenyl amine and tris 4 formylbiphenyl amine these reactions were done in relatively mild conditions at 120 c using cs2co3 as a base catalyst and dmso as solvent successfully synthesized ctfs are yellow which is partial carbonization was very minimum compared to the other methods amidine based polycondensation promises scalability and ease of the synthetic process since it was done in one pot polymerization without protection by an inert atmosphere the use of a relatively cheap catalyst and a milder solvent 84 as a result of less partial carbonization of ctfs using amidine polycondensation compared to ionothermal and p2o5 amidine based ctfs are more suitable for photocatalytic applications liu et al modified the mechanism to improve the crystalline properties by using in situ slow oxidation of alcohol monomer into aldehyde monomer 85 those processes will decrease the nucleation rates assembly rates and produce ctfs crystallinity phase 3 application 3 1 adsorbent 3 1 1 heavy metal adsorption the development of an increasingly advanced industry has made water contamination by heavy metals a problem to overcome the minamata bay incident opened the world s eyes to the real dangers of heavy metal pollution unlike carbon based compounds heavy metals will never degrade in nature and accumulate by the effects of bioaccumulation in a living organism the extraordinary lousy health effects from cancer to nerve damage in the human body lead to the need for valuable materials to remove heavy metals from nature ctfs are known as a porous material that has a large surface area theoretically ctfs can have a surface area of more than 1500 m2 g and also have high chemical stability 32 38 50 52 64 71 72 77 numerous n atoms in the ctfs structures make ctfs excellent materials in the heavy metal adsorption process atom n will interact with heavy metals such as pb2 and cd2 through chelation 66 therefore it makes ctfs attractive materials for the adsorption process compared to other adsorbent materials such as activated carbon and clay heavy metal adsorption in other adsorbents such as activated carbon and clay has less adsorption capacity than ctfs for instance activated carbon derived from rice husk 86 and clay based material bentonite grafted with poly n acryloylglycinamide 87 have 55 87 mg g and 25 72 mg g of hg2 adsorption capacity another adsorbent material for heavy metal removal that has been extensively studied is metal organic framework mof is composed of metal ions and organic linkers and then connected into a three dimensional lattice mof material example used for hg2 adsorbent is uio 66 nhc s nhme it has adsorption capacity of 769 mg g 88 all materials have less adsorption capacity than ctfs based materials such as sctn 1 with the adsorption capacity of 1253 mg g for hg2 the high adsorption capacity of ctf is based on chemical bonding stabilization between the ctf and heavy metal adsorbate therefore making the adsorption phenomenon becomes more easily occurred ctf 0 or ctf 1 synthesized by ghazi et al in 2018 was successfully used to adsorb cd2 from aqueous with an adsorption capacity of 29 26 mg g 66 cadmium is known to have a higher solubility than other heavy metals ctf 1 was synthesized using ionothermal methods and its skeletal structure is very stable up to 600 c because it has crystalline properties the ctf 1 that has been synthesized by ghazi et al has a surface area of 490 m2 g and pore size of 1 3 nm in this experiment the adsorption phenomenon of ctf 1 followed the langmuir and dubnin radushkevich adsorption model so that the adsorption process was classified as chemisorption the illustration schematic of the ctf 1 in adsorbing heavy metals and their properties is shown in fig 11 modifying monomers in the synthesis process by adding additional functional groups such as sulfur oxygen ammonia and even metals increases ctfs adsorption capacity for heavy metal removal because of the chelating phenomenon of heavy metal towards different functional groups 35 44 ctf with the thioether functional group sctn 1 is proved to have an adsorption capacity of up to 1253 mg g for hg2 ions removal had studied by mondal et al 44 sctn 1 has an excellent surface area with 1249 m2 g 1 of surface area and micropore pore properties the high adsorption value is due to the interaction of hg2 ions with the n and s atoms contained in the sctn 1 structure the presence of the sulfur functional group in the ctfs structures increased the mercury removal in the adsorption process thus the hg2 ion has created a ligand bond towards n and s atoms present in the ctf structure those phenomena can be seen from xps spectroscopy in fig 12 hg 4f has a binding energy peak at 105 1 ev and 100 9 ev 44 on the other hand sctn 1 has a robust s2p signal at 164 3 ev and 163 2 ev for doublet signals of s2p3 2 and 2p1 2 after the adsorption process the binding energy peak of the s2p from sctn was shifted to a higher binding energy value which is attributed to the binding of electron rich sulfur with mercury ions 44 it is proven that its adsorption effectiveness can reach 95 after seven consecutive reusabilities these properties come from the relatively stable covalent bond in the covalent triazine frameworks yang z et al also studied ctf with a thio group for hg2 ion removal which resulted in up to 840 5 mg g adsorption capacity 35 the selectivity of thio groups ctfs are shown outstanding performance as opposed to 11 different competitive heavy metal ions in the wastewater solution the material s performance indicates hg2 adsorption up to 99 removal effectiveness ph influences in hg2 adsorption is investigated the study was conducted in a ph range of 1 12 the highest adsorption efficiency was achieved at ph 5 at lower ph a high concentration of h ion would compete with hg2 to interact with the triazine and s functional group at the higher ph hg2 will interact with oh and make a complex compound that prevents the interaction between hg2 ions and triazine and s species of ctf adsorbent the addition of metal oxide material to ctf 1 was carried out by leus et al i e γ fe2o3 43 γ fe2o3 was synthesized first and then added with ctf 1 by in situ doping modified fe particles have been used as adsorbents for heavy metal removal numerous studies however have demonstrated that fe2o3 is unstable due to the high oxidation potential of fe hindering the long term use of the material therefore further modification of fe based adsorbent is necessary the addition of γ fe2o3 particles increases the intraparticle pores of the ctf 1 composite adsorbent material and raises the stability of both materials the doped material is then used to adsorb heavy metals such as as3 as5 and hg2 γ fe2o3 ctf 1 is also used for the adsorption process by simulating real life conditions by being tested using surface ground and wastewater in the presence of additional ions in the form of ca2 mg2 ph effect and natural organic materials the results obtained by this experiment are that the material is not influenced by the presence of other ions available in the wastewater the ph effect has only decreased hg2 adsorption capacity at ph 11 the basic condition increases the formation of stable hydroxide complexes withdrawing free ions from the solution the adsorption capacity of γ fe2o3 ctf 1 for arsenite is 198 0 mg g arsenate 102 3 mg g and divalent mercury 165 8 mg g the difference in heavy metals adsorption performance using ctfs are in the list in table 5 3 1 2 organic based material adsorption the organic contaminant is highly prolific in wastewater components given the industry s exceptionally rapid development in this modern world 89 90 adsorption methods for organic pollutants are the easiest and most effective in terms of process cost simplicity of design and operation intricacies 91 3 1 2 1 dye adsorption the development of the textile paper and printing industries increased dye waste contaminating the water according to rojas et al 10 000 tons of dye waste are withdrawn each year into the environment 89 dye waste in water negatively affects human health and wildlife habitats some dyes are very toxic to the point of being carcinogenic 92 94 in recent years several experiments have been carried out to test the effectiveness of ctfs in adsorbing various types of dyes as shown in table 6 wang t et al investigated the adsorption activity of dyes such as rhodamine b rhb with molecule weight of 479 02 reactive brilliant red x 3b with molecule weight of 615 30 and acid violet 4bs with molecule weight of 813 70 ctf 1 was synthesized through the primary ionothermal method at high temperatures of 400 c to 600 c 37 the ctf 1 produced from this method has a large surface area of 2071 m2 g 1 the experimental results in fig 13 a showed that the maximum adsorption capacity qe up to 469 mg g for rhb 431 mg g for x 3b and 178 mg g for 4bs this value is significantly superior to the qe value of activated carbon ac which is only half of the ctfs various influences in the experiment such as parameters kinetics and reusability of the catalyst were tested the result is that ctf 1 has very effective removal for both anionic dyes and cationic dyes as for ctf 1 the anionic dyes such as x 3b and 4bs the anionic dyes free electrons will interact with the n atom in the triazine linkers in the ctf as for cationic the phenomenon of adsorption of cationic dyes such as rhb occurs due to electrostatic and dispersive interactions with the surface of ctf 1 fig 13 b in this study ctf 1 has high material stability because it can use adsorption up to 4 times without losing its effectiveness the ctf 1 adsorption kinetics tested are pseudo second order representing liquid membrane diffusion internal diffusion and surface adsorption furthermore this experiment s isotherm model follows the langmuir isotherm which indicates the chemosorption trend 37 an f et al also used ctf 1 and ctf dcbp ctf 2 as adsorbent material for adsorbing methylene blue mb mo and chrysophenine g cg dyes 95 the dyes have a significantly bigger molecular size cg has molecular 680 7 g mol much bigger than mb which is 309 85 g mol and mo 327 33 g mol ctf 1 and ctf dcbp were synthesized using two different monomers but using the same ionothermal methods ctf dcbp has considerably bigger surface area 1745 45 m2 g 1 and pore volume 1 42 cm3 g 1 than ctf 1 with 782 m2 g 1 of surface area and 0 40 cm3 g 1 of pore volume the more extensive surface area and pore size make cg adsorption easier onto the ctf dcbp surface area the experiment also studied the different adsorption mechanisms of cationic and anionic properties of dyes as we know mb has cationic properties and mo has opposites properties mb has protonated n atoms in its structure that will counter interact with rich π electron in all ctfs surfaces therefore this may explain the remarkable results of the mb adsorption phenomenon on ctfs on the other hand mo anionic dyes has a different adsorption mechanism in the study ctfs have a point zero charge pzc around ph of 7 8 which implies the positive charge of the ctfs material ctfs properties indicate the material can form strong hydrogen bonds towards anionic material in this case mo furthermore this study also explored the ph impact on the adsorption process the result is that cationic dyes type mb adsorption capacity will increase on the higher ph and anionic type mo and cg will do the opposite soltani et al synthesized porous ctf ph sba 15 organic inorganic material hybrid silica and ctfs adsorbent materials 96 the result is auspicious because albeit sba 15 has a slightly higher surface area of 621 m2 g 1 vs 537 m2 g shown in table 6 the adsorption process for mb of sba 15 material is considerably lower than the ctf ph sba 15 fig 14a it implies the effect of the binding site on ctfs structural abilities as mentioned in the an f et al studies mb as cationic dyes will bind onto the rich π electron sites and has electron dispersive interaction with the ctfs aromatic skeletal rather than only physical bind into the sba 15 surface 95 the mechanism of the synthesis and adsorption process is shown in fig 14b the total methylene blue adsorption efficiency of sba 15 ph ctf is 569 049 mg g relatively high compared to other materials such as mof hkust 1 and uio 66 with 454 mg g and 106 mg g although those materials have a more significant surface area than the sba 15 ph ctf 1726 m2 g and 1125 m2 g vs 537 m2 g 98 this result confirms the previous explanation that the surface area affects the adsorption process and the strong physical and chemical interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbate mokhtari et al used fluorene based ctfs flu cof as an adsorbent for acid blue 9 dyes removal 97 the synthesis route of flu cof is presented in fig 15 as prepared ctfs have oxygen linked atoms in its structure assuming it will employ stronger interaction with the dyes mokhtari conducted several operation conditions such as ph effect contact times and kinetical parameters the result is that flu cof is highly effective for anionic dyes types the adsorption isotherm is well fitted to langmuir and pseudo second order for isothermal models the result from previous studies indicated that ctfs has excellent adsorption efficiency the ctfs are effective for the adsorption of anionic and cationic dyes the adsorption capacity of ctfs is far superior compared to other adsorbent materials such as activated carbon and synthetic silica 3 1 2 2 other organic substance aside from heavy metals and industrial dyes many dangerous organic substances in wastewater can harm the aquatic environment aromatic compounds such as phenol 99 101 and pharmaceutical waste 102 103 in the water must be overcome as they are hazardous to human health and the environmental ecosystem ctfs have many unique features on the molecular properties such as large surface area chemical bond stability and ability to interact directly towards the adsorbate improving the effectivity of organic material removed from the wastewater table 7 lists several ctfs materials that have been applied to adsorb various organic substances liu j et al have studied ctf 1 as an adsorbent and compared commercial polymeric adsorbent amberlite xad 4 to remove many aromatic compounds such as benzene phenol aniline nitrobenzene 1 3 dinitrobenzene 1 3 5 trinitrobenzene 4 methyl 2 6 dinitrophenol benzenesulfonate naphthalene 2 naphthol 1 naphthalenamine 2 naphthalenesulfonate and pyrene 34 ctf 1 was synthesized using the ionothermal method the result shows a remarkable performance of ctf 1 which has more than twice the adsorption capacity than the commercial adsorbent 46 the superiority of ctfs over xad 4 as adsorbents as shown in table 7 is attributable to the distinct adsorbing characteristics ctfs have superior surface charge properties with an abundant electron environment in its structures 105 106 ctfs have outstanding performance in absorbing polar and non polar organic matter in contrast xad 4 consists of a hydrophobic based material suitable for adsorbing hydrophobic molecules however the hydrophobic nature of xad 4 makes the effectiveness of removing polar organic compounds limited liu j et al investigated antibiotic removal using ctfs as adsorbent 46 the ctfs were synthesized using 1 4 dicyanobenzene and 4 4 biphenylcarbonitrile as basic monomers by the ionothermal method two different ctfs were obtained ctf 1 1 4 dicyanobenzene and ctfdcbp 4 4 biphenylcarbonitrile the adsorbents were then used to adsorb sulfamethoxazole smx and tylosin tl as prepared ctf 1 has predominated microporous properties and ctfdcbp has both mesoporous and microporous properties the following properties explain that ctf 1 has better adsorption results for smx adsorption than tl because it has a bigger molecular size preventing diffusion into ctf 1 micropores on the other hand ctfdcbp has bigger pores volumes than ctf 1 1 42 cm3 g vs 0 40 cm3 g which is suitable for adsorbing bigger molecules as in this case smx molecules the adsorption distribution coefficient kd of the ctf 1 is 104 105 l kg for smx and 102 103 l kg for tl in comparison ctfdcbp has kd of smx 104 105 l kg and kd of tl 105 106 l kg furthermore akpe et al recently studied four different covalent organic frameworks for adsorbing smx namely mctp ctftpb cbap cbap eda and cbap so3h 104 mctp or ctftpb was synthesized using the friedel craft mechanism using 1 3 5 triphenylbenzene and cyanuric chloride as the monomer compared with other cof such as a carbonyl incorporated aromatic polymer cbap cbap functionalized with ethylenediamine cbap eda functionalized using sulfonic acid cbap so3h and commercial activated carbon ac mctp has a larger surface area the properties of the synthesized materials above can be seen in table 8 the adsorption performance of mctp is also far superior to the other materials mctp has smx adsorption capacity of 367 mg g much higher than cbap 252 mg g cbap eda 227 mg g cbap so3h 267 mg g and ac 257 mg g according to liu et al and akpe et al the excellent adsorption performance of the ctfs are not only the influence of textural porous properties of ctfs materials but the chemical properties of the ctfs are also dominant in this phenomenon 46 104 additionally both state that the electrostatic force of π π aromatic stack on the antibiotic molecules towards ctfs structures are the most important mechanism of antibiotic adsorption therefore ctfs are very prominent and can remove pharmaceutical waste for future water treatment the stability of the adsorption material is also prominent in ctfs based adsorbents mctp has less than 5 of efficiency decrease after compared to other materials such as mof for instance uio 66 only retains 80 of the adsorption capacity of sulfonamide waste after four usages 107 as stated in the previous study the triazine linker in ctfs is more stable than the metal organic linker in mof 3 2 membranes ctfs with micro mesopores properties are a promising material for utilizing water separation membranes the main advantage of ctfs compared to other materials commonly used for membranes is that ctfs have an extensive tuning potential so that the pore size and material properties of the ctfs can be adjusted as needed 108 109 besides ctfs have a structure that tends to be physically and chemically stable therefore it can be used as a membrane to separate waste from water in the water purifying process 47 table 9 summarizes numerous ctfs that have been applied for membrane application the interface method synthesizes ctfs membrane materials directly on the surface of the tfmsa as the solvents fig 16 a and b reveals that the membrane is synthesized using interface methods dcb is dropped carefully therefore it floats on the surface as the reaction goes directly making it a thin ctfs membrane layer as seen in fig 16 c 110 from table 9 ctf 1 has a salt rejection rate of 91 this value allows ctf 1 to be used for brackish water treatment or multistage saltwater treatment the data presented by lin et al shows that the smaller the pore of the ctfs will increase the salt rejection and reduce the water flux 47 in addition the difference charge in the ctfs structures will affect the salt rejection the negatively charged ctf 1 cl on the structure will make the positively charged sodium ion move easier towards the membrane pores thus in practice ctfs could be produced using different building blocks allowing for easy modification of the pore size and chemical characteristics to provide the desired features for the seawater desalination process li g et al successfully synthesized pristine catalyzed acid 2d ctf 1 with the interface reaction method at 100 c to form a thin layered membrane 110 the membrane is then used to separate several dyes such as methyl orange mo rhodamine b rhb methylene blue mb congo red cr and gold au nanoparticles 2d ctf 1 pristine membranes have varying rejection effectivity for several types of dyes the greater the relative size of the dye molecules the greater the rejection value dye molecules such as mb dimension 1 53 nm 0 65 nm 0 28 nm cr dimension 2 42 nm 0 96 nm 0 71 nm and au nanoparticles 5 nm have a rejection rate of 96 the use of 2d ctf 1 pristine for separation has a high water flux of up to 141 50 l m 2 h 1 however 2d ctf 1 pristine has limitations for rejecting dye molecules with small molecular sizes such as rhb dimension 1 27 nm 1 13 nm 0 72 nm and mo dimension 1 31 nm 0 70 nm 0 5 nm with a rejection rate 13 pristine 2d ctf 1 that was successfully synthesized has an intraskeletal layer distance of 1 39 nm in size so that it can be used to effectively separate pollutants up to a molecular size 1 4 nm yin c et al recently synthesized 2d ctf 1 with the superacid method then further modified it by oxidizing the material making the 2d ctf 1 have a carbonyl functional group in the ctfs structures which can be seen in fig 17 a 78 fig 17 b also showed how ctfs could be modified using dmso as a proton acceptor and cf3so3h as a proton donor to create a carbonyl functional group on the ctfs structure this modification results in the pore size and the intraskeletal membrane distance becoming smaller than pristine 2d ctf 1 as prepared pristine 2d ctf 1 has roughly 1 3 1 4 nm of intraskeletal pore size compared to smaller 1 1 nm of oxidized ctf 1 membranes smaller pore makes the rejection of smaller molecules such as mo increase significantly the rejection percentage of mo in oxidized ctf 1 is almost 60 compared to 13 of pristine ctfs however a smaller intraskeletal radius of oxidized ctf 1 reduces the water flux compared to pristine ctf 1 oxidized ctf 1 has more than 50 decrease in water flux 140 vs 64 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 the oxidizing process of ctf 1 also makes the surface of the materials become more negatively charged because of the presence of the oxygen atom this characteristic helps the membrane to reject the negatively charged mo molecules from water 3 3 photocatalytic water treatment photocatalytic has the advantage of removing wastes and pollutants in water over other methods the most important of which is where the pollutant substance is completely destroyed 111 112 this can happen pollutants especially organic pollutants react with radical molecules because in the photocatalytic process producing the simplest molecules of the organic substances co2 and h2o 113 114 compared to other methods such as chemically activated degradation aop 115 116 photocatalytic degradation is more environmentally friendly since it does not employ any additional chemicals to decompose the pollutant the degradation reaction with the photocatalytic method took place in the presence of light as an energy source and a catalyst with semiconductor properties with the availability of a covalent bond and a conduction band where oxidation and reduction reactions take place to produce radical molecules 117 119 photocatalytic processes for the degradation of organic waste substances in water have been carried out with various metal based catalysts such as tio2 106 zno 112 cds 113 znfe2o4 114 cetio4 115 subsequently due to the leaching of metal catalysts in wastewater researchers are currently developing non metallic catalysts based on graphitic carbon nitride such as melem g c3n4 120 porous g c3n4 121 porous graphene like g c3n4 122 nanotube g c3n4 123 h bn g c3n4 124 however g c3n4 still has drawbacks namely flexibility and tunability of the physical and chemical properties of the material in recent years ctfs have become the focus of attention of researchers due to its flexibility and tunability 125 126 several representative studies about photocatalytic oxidation using ctfs are found in table 10 ctfs have semiconductor properties derived from the π stacked aromatic unit of triazine and benzene from its structure which can undergo photo generated electron separation and charge transfer 53 129 131 ctf 1 has been studied and has a band gap value of 2 42 ev in the ctf 1 structure there is a benzene ring with an electron affinity value of 1 15 ev triazine is an electron acceptor with an affinity of 0 46 ev 54 this small band gap value makes ctfs exceptionally suited for use in photocatalytic processes the ctfs synthesis process is generally ionothermal at temperatures 400 c and time 40 h the long synthesis process causes the material s carbonization which could theoretically make ctfs inactive in the photocatalytic process the carbonization can cause the light spectrum to absorb more in the structure without any charge transfer 24 32 45 54 based on research conducted by niu et al that the ctfs with an amorphous structure has an irregular 3d crosslinked phenylene triazine ring that easily transfers electrons than the 2d crystalline structure of ctfs with nearly identical band gap values 1 57 ev of ctf a vs 1 60 ev of ctf c 127 these results indicate that the amorphous structure is better in the photocatalytic process because ctfs have a larger surface area and facilitates the mass transfer process to the active site of the catalyst many researchers have used ctfs for the photocatalytic process and most of them used it for the hydrogen production process for the water splitting reaction and co2 reduction ctfs can then be tuned to increase its effectiveness the ctfs catalyst can be modified by replacing the building block to obtain more conjugated molecules in its structure the synthesis method is also commonly carried out to achieve a suitable ctfs structure in the photocatalytic process besides that metal and nonmetal doping were also carried out to reduce the band gap value and increase the active catalyst site niu f et al synthesized two types of ctfs using the ionothermal method 127 the as prepared ctfs distinguish into two catalysts with different mole ratios of zncl2 and dcb the mole ratio of dcb and zncl2 with a 1 1 resulted in a crystalline ctfs while a 1 2 ratio of dcb and zncl2 resulted in an amorphous ctfs both have a significant difference in performance where ctf a amorphous is much better in the photocatalytic process than ctf c crystalline mb removal efficiency using ctf a at a concentration of 100 ppm can be achieved more than 98 while with ctf c the removal is less than 90 as shown in fig 18 2 a and 2 b this occurs because the electron transfer process happens more quickly in amorphous ctfs than crystalline therefore the charge transfer process will occur more efficiently and effectively 18 fig 18 1 a and 1 b shows the correlation between the ctfs structure and the ctf s semiconductor property as a photocatalyst as seen the uv drs spectrum of ctf c has a lower cut off value compared to ctf a 839 vs 831 ev interpolarizing uv drs value of those materials resulting in a band gap value of ctf a 1 57 ev vs ctf c 1 60 ev some researchers have also modified ctfs for photocatalytic degradation the addition of metal to ctfs was carried out by li l et al by adding ag agbr to the ctfs structures 67 this material is then used to disinfect water from the e coli bacteria the results obtained were that 99 9 of the bacteria became inactive at 12 5 min after the photocatalytic process li l et al stated that the radical species that influence the initial disinfection reaction is o2 fig 19 a shows the charge transfer photocatalytic mechanism of the bacteria inactivation process o2 is produced from the charge transfer reduction process in the conduction band cb of ctf 1 ag agbr the addition of ag agbr reduces the cb value so that the o2 production process will occur faster since electron from cb ctfs will easily be transferred into cb from agbr which has a lower energy value 1 03 vs 0 3 ev as seen in fig 19 b o2 will damage the cell walls of the bacteria e coli besides there is a minor species of radical production in the form of h2o2 from the reaction between o2 and water which also plays a role in this reaction although it does not dominate zhu s r et al carried out biobr metal composites addition to the ctfs structure to degrade the antibiotic compounds tetracycline hydrochloride tc and ciprofloxacin cip 56 the addition of bibobr to ctf 3d reduces the band gap value of pure biobr 2 78 ev vs 2 85 ev then increased the surface area to 120 of pristine biobr the ctf biobr mixture has a much better performance than pure biobr with an increased degradation efficiency of up to 30 and a reaction speed of 1 86 times faster this can occur because the presence of ctf 3d causes the charge transfer process to take place faster with a decrease in the band gap value besides the substrate s mass transfer process to the active catalyst site also occurs faster due to the larger surface area of the ctfs ctfs can also be used to degrade photos catalytically in the solid phase ctf is used to adsorb pollutants from the solution then pollutants trapped in the ctfs structure are degraded by direct photocatalyst adsorbent in a solid state after the process is complete the material is tested with uv spectra 128 the composite ctfs consists of silica sba 15 and 2 5 dicyanothiophene dct used as a building block monomer the monomer is then added with silica mesopores sba 15 and reacted with the superacid catalyzed method this study shows that two dyes rhb and mb can be degraded up to 90 kobs 0 119 min 1 and kobs 0 030 m 1 while org was achieved only 80 kobs 0 132 min 1 as shown in fig 20 c for properties ftir hr tem and sem and solid state degradation mechanism on rhb dyes of ctfs can be seen in fig 20 a b and d photocatalysis with ctfs materials have a unique reaction mechanism ctfs will degrade organic substances with o2 radicals ctfs have a valence band in the 2 ev position 127 131 while oh requires a potential value of 2 8 ev 132 hence thermodynamically ctfs are unable to produce oh by default 4 conclusion and insight ctfs have been in development for about ten years with excellent results ctfs applications for various purposes show promising results that exceed other widely used materials in these general topics ctfs have extraordinary potential to be used as an advanced material substitute for conventional materials such as zeolite activated carbon and graphene oxide in the field of wastewater treatment its tunable structure with excellent physical and chemical properties makes ctfs the perfect candidate compared to other materials such as mofs and cofs in general the availability of triazine bonds in the ctfs structures opens up the potential for ctfs to be used as active material in chemical reactions making it highly suitable for use as both a primary catalyst and catalyst support in various water purification chemical reactions i e photocatalysis the different ctfs synthesis methods and precursors are diverse and can still be developed according to the requirements it provides a wide choice of structural chemical and physical properties which can be tuned according to wastewater treatment applications four methods can prepare ctfs ionothermal superacid catalyzed p2o5 catalyzed and friedel craft coupling reaction the different reaction methods offer their respective advantages and disadvantages ctfs can be made with various crystallinity properties surface area and catalyst activity with different types of synthesis ionothermal provides the most straightforward ctfs synthesis with the most crystalline ctfs products with the drawback of ctfs will undergo a carbonization process because it runs at high temperatures the superacid catalyzed method produces amorphous uncarbonized ctfs with fast reaction times and relatively low temperatures however this method cannot be used on a large scale because it is a rather expensive process and the catalyst substance in the synthesis process is somewhat carcinogenic p2o5 catalyst in ctfs synthesis methods results in uncarbonized ctfs due to the relatively low reaction temperature but it has the disadvantage of an extended synthesis time 40 h synthesis with friedel craft coupling is an attractive alternative method because it has the advantages of synthesis in a mild state resulting in uncarbonized ctfs the use of harmless substances and is relatively cheap compared to superacid however this method is complicated to make on a large scale because of the limited amount of substances in the synthesis process the application of ctfs in the adsorption process has had extraordinary results ctfs go beyond materials such as activated carbon zeolite and clay in the wastewater adsorption process all types of waste ranging from organic to inorganic materials such as heavy metals and dyes can be removed through ctfs adsorption this can be explained because ctfs have a high surface area of 1500 m2 g with micro to mesoporous material pore the ctfs can then easily be modified the pore s size with the different precursor building blocks of the ctfs in addition ctfs can interact directly with chemical bonds with waste materials both organic and inorganic the interaction happened due to the ctfs structure that owned the chemical properties of the triazine and π π stack content of the aromatic ring the unique and diverse chemical properties make ctfs very suitable for use as a membrane for wastewater treatment the pore size between ctfs molecules can be adjusted up to 1 nm therefore it can be used to filter seawater in one process however the small pore size causes the water flux to be hindered to tackle this the ctfs can then adjust its surface charge properties to reject the ions from the salt contained in seawater to pass through the ctfs membranes without making the pore size somewhat smaller in addition to conventional methods of treating wastewater ctfs can be used to degrade organic waste by the photocatalytic process compared to traditional methods the photocatalytic method has an absolute advantage instead of only changing the phase of the waste material the photocatalytic process will change the phase and chemistry of organic waste into much less dangerous compounds namely co2 and h2o with the help of sunlight this process can occur because the ctfs have semiconductor properties from the stacked π bonds between the ctfs structure this characteristic causes the electrons on the ctfs structure s surface to move from the valence band to the conduction band in the presence of photon energy which is the semi conductivity phenomenon of the ctfs materials these properties can then be enhanced by adding other atoms to the structure increasing the semi conductivity of ctfs and then increasing the overall photocatalytic performance with the extraordinary potential of the ctfs it is interesting that the ctfs can be continuously developed in the future in order to overcome the most fundamental problem in the future namely maintaining the availability of clean water declaration of competing interest no issues of financial interests personal relationships as potential competing interests acknowledgments this work was supported by the

12906,alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 was evaluated for pb2 removal after magnetically functionalization maga which led to a considerable improvement in the natural mineral s characteristics and adsorption capability pb2 adsorption was investigated in both batch and column systems concerning the influence of ph maga amounts contact time initial pb2 concentration ionic strength flow rate and bed height the maximum pb2 adsorption performance was obtained at ph 5 0 the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models were found to characterize the adsorption process maga had a monolayer pb2 adsorption capacity of 158 73 mg g 1 application tests with real wastewater have shown that maga has satisfactory adsorption performance 90 for practical applications as well furthermore the adsorption efficiency of pb2 ions in dynamic flow mode was still around 80 after 10 consecutive cycles maga was characterized by infrared ir brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx isoelectric point iep and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis thermodynamic analysis indicated that the binding of pb2 ions to maga was endothermic the maximum breakthrough capacity calculated from the breakthrough curve at the exhausted point was 31 1 mg g 1 the estimated cost of preparing maga was calculated to be 6 70 usd kg overall the findings clearly showed that the maga seems to be an eco friendly economic and recyclable adsorbent for the removal of toxic pb2 from wastewaters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alunite breakthrough heavy metal lead ii magnetic adsorbent wastewater treatment 1 introduction lead has high bioaccumulation in the human body and can cause brain damage resulting in a reduction in learning and memory as well as easily altering bone metabolism and creating genetic abnormalities 1 2 the elimination of heavy metal ions from polluted industrial effluents has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their known toxicity to living things existing traditional treatment systems have a high cost and require regular chemical input making them impracticable and uneconomical as well as causing significant environmental destruction simple cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies might thus be used to remove toxic metal ions from industrial effluents and other metal polluted areas 3 8 because of their stability high solubility and migration activity in aqueous media removing these pollutants is extremely difficult it is critical to develop an effective method for treating heavy metal contaminated wastewater 9 adsorption is generally presumed to be superior to alternative processing technologies in terms of cost flexibility compact design simplicity of operation and sensitivity to toxic contaminants in various processing technologies 10 because activated carbon the most extensively utilized adsorbent is so expensive discovering low cost and renewable adsorption materials is becoming increasingly crucial 11 13 effective adsorbent materials should have high surface area mechanical and physical stability and most significantly a large number of binding groups another significant characteristic of a promising sorbent is the ease of recovery in this context magnetically functionalized sorbents have attracted considerable attention in recent years by applying an external magnetic field magnetic sorbents can be separated from the sorption medium simply and quickly this greatly simplifies the sample pretreatment process and eliminates the need for centrifugation and filtration 14 magnetic adsorption is an exciting technique for increasing the capacity of treatment plants 15 researchers are increasingly focused on developing innovative and efficient magnetic sorbents as a result of these characteristics 14 chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 16 bentonite 17 illite 18 montmorillonite 19 fes lignin derived carbon 20 zeolite 21 fe3o4 bone activated carbon 22 rice husk activated carbon 23 fe3o4 sepiolite composite 24 multi wall carbon nanotube 25 magnetic acid activated carbon 26 and magnetic magnesium zinc ferrite 27 are some recent examples of magnetically functionalized adsorbents aimed at the removal of different pollutants alunite having the chemical formula kal3 so4 2 oh 6 is a potassium alum that often occurs as rhombohedral and hexagonal crystals 28 unless calcined alunite cannot dissolve in water acids or bases 29 the hydrothermal modification of tuff resulted in the formation of this mineral which contained roughly 50 sio2 aluminum sulfate alumina potassium alum and potassium sulfate are the most common products of alunite 30 only a few research on the use of alunite as an adsorbent has been reported in the literature even though it has been successfully utilized in the wastewater treatment process phosphate removal was investigated using calcined alunite 31 and the thermal decomposition product of alunite kcl 32 alunite was also successfully utilized as an efficient adsorbent in natural or calcined forms for reactive 33 acid 34 35 and disperse dyes 36 the simplicity of non contact magnetic separation technology combined with alunite s adsorption potential might pave the way for a new approach to realizing the necessary water treatment process thus in this work we hypothesize that magnetically modified alunite maga was synthesized and employed as a regenerable eco friendly and inexpensive adsorbent for the removal of pb2 contaminant to the best of our knowledge there have also been no reports of magnetically functionalized alunite being synthesized and employed as an adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from the contaminated aquatic medium to test the hypothesis of this study maga s adsorption efficacy against this toxic metal was extensively investigated in both batch and dynamic flow systems under various experimental conditions this research not only offers a simple and comprehensive strategy for employing magnetically modified alunite in batch and continuous treatment systems but also offers the potential for long term usage in the treatment of pb2 contaminated waters alunite one of the components of maga employed as a sorbent in this study is a naturally occurring mineral magnetite on the other hand is a non toxic material that is even utilized as an antimicrobial agent against several pathogens 37 therefore maga with these features might be referred to as eco friendly in this study 2 experimental studies 2 1 chemicals and equipment pb no3 2 was purchased from sigma aldrich 99 and used to prepare a stock solution 1000 mg l 1 different concentrations of pb2 ion solutions were obtained by freshly diluting these solutions dilute hcl merck 37 and naoh merck 99 solutions were used to adjust the ph values of the working solutions fecl3 sigma aldrich 98 0 and feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 0 were used to synthesize maga alunite was provided from natural deposits in kütahya şaphane turkey the ph measurements in this study were made using a ph meter wtw inolab 720 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas perkin elmer analyst

taken to characterize the functional groups on the surface of the sorbent material quantachrome instruments autosorb 1 model bet surface area analyzer was used to measure the surface area of maga to analyze the surface charges at different ph levels zeta potentials were determined using a malvern zeta sizer the surface morphology of maga was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem jeol 5600 lv sem at 20 kev accelerating voltage magnetic properties were determined by vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis lakeshore 7407 vsm x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out by panalytical empyrean cu kα the tube voltage and current were 45 kv and 40 ma respectively with a scan rate of 2 min 1 2 2 development of maga alunite was ground using a basic analytical mill ika a11 and dried in an oven at 105 c for 3 h the magnetization of alunite was carried out by the alkaline co precipitation technique as described in previous studies 38 39 with minor modifications briefly 50 g of alunite 212 μm was suspended in 500 ml of deionized water a mixture including 18 g of fecl3 and 15 5 g of feso4 7h2o in distilled water was prepared heated at 70 c for 15 min and cooled to room temperature under continuous stirring alunite suspension was added to this mixture and stirred for 30 min then a solid phase was formed by dropwise addition of 10 m naoh solution and agitated for 60 min the precipitated solid was stored at room temperature for 24 h before being filtered the precipitate was rinsed several times with distilled water the prepared magnetic product was heated overnight at 50 c bottled and labeled as maga 2 3 batch sorption studies batch sorption experiments for pb2 adsorption onto maga were conducted in 25 ml aqueous pb2 solutions to determine the optimum experimental conditions batch adsorption studies were carried out by changing ph 2 0 to 5 5 sorbent dosage 20 to 80 mg contact time 1 60 min and ionic strength 0 01 0 1 m the metal ion solutions were mixed with a known amount of maga shaken at 200 rpm and at room temperature by an orbital shaker gerhardt tho 500 1 the solid phase was collected in the bottom of the beakers with an external magnet after the adsorption trials and easily separated by decantation then the clear solutions were analyzed by faas for pb2 ions the adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 of maga is calculated using the equation below 1 q e v c i c e m where c i and c e are the pb2 ion concentrations mg l 1 in the solutions before and after pb2 sorption respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the amount of maga g sorption isotherms were examined at different initial pb2 ion concentrations 25 600 mg l 1 using the fixed amount of adsorbent 50 mg on the other hand the initial pb2 ion concentration was kept constant at 100 mg l 1 in the kinetic studies results are presented as the mean of three replicates in this research error bars were included in all figures spss 15 0 was used to statistically evaluate the data 2 4 continuous mode sorption studies the continuous mode sorption system used in this study consists of a glass column 1 05 cm internal diameter 20 cm glass column height for sorbent filling a peristaltic pump ismatec ipc 16 for solution flow and tygon tubings for connection pb2 ion solution at a fixed concentration 100 mg l 1 was passed through the column operated in an up flow mode effluents were collected at the end of the sorption procedure and analyzed as stated above 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnetic sorbent table 1 shows the obtained data from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm the specific surface area of alunite decreased from 27 20 to 5 60 m2 g 1 after magnetically modification of the mineral on the other hand the functionalization of alunite also resulted in a decrease in micropore and total pore volumes while a 1 83 fold increase was observed in total pore size these findings were in line with the results that were previously reported 40 42 the n2 adsorption isotherms for alunite and maga are given in fig 1 according to the iupac classification n2 adsorption isotherms of alunite and maga can be classified as typeiii corresponding to macroporous materials a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis was used to determine the magnetic strength of the maga as shown in fig 2 the magnetic response of the generated material was noticeable when exposed to an external magnetic field while no magnetic properties were observed for natural alunite the saturation magnetization of maga was 12 8 emu remanence and coevercity values fig 2 of adsorbents also imply that the proposed sorbent material is a magnetite coated composite on the other hand this suggested absorbent has a strong enough magnetic response to allow for quick magnetic separation throughout the sorption process similar observations were found regarding the effect of magnetic functionalization 43 44 maga could also be quickly removed from the solution using a magnet in a few seconds this further revealed that the suggested adsorbent had a strong magnetic property the phase components of the alunite and maga were determined by xrd analysis the typical xrd pattern of alunite with a minor phase quartz sio2 and al2si2o5 oh 4 45 46 in the mineral structure was presented in fig 3 the xrd pattern of maga fig 3 revealed the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ of 30 35 6 43 3 53 7 57 5 and 62 9 demonstrating that the phase of fe3o4 47 these results verified that magnetite coated the alunite surface successfully the infrared ir spectra of the materials alunite magnetite maga maga pb2 are shown in fig 4 the bands at 3450 and 1255 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of alunite were due to stretching and bending vibrations of hydroxyl groups so4 2 bending vibrations were observed at 1110 and 1074 cm 1 alo interaction was represented by vibrational frequencies less than 1000 cm 1 46 48 sio peaks originating from sio2 can be found in the alunite structure 49 a broad band at about 3420 cm 1 and a sharp characteristic band at about 578 cm 1 were visible in the spectra of magnetite indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups from the water and feo groups respectively 50 51 ir spectrum of maga indicated the characteristic peaks in the wavenumber region of 3000 3700 cm 1 which were attributed to stretching vibrations of the oh and al o h bonding o h o bending vibration of interlayer water can be seen at the wavenumbers between 1550 and 1640 cm 1 the peaks at 1085 and 1032 cm 1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of so and si o si groups of alunite respectively the peak around 795 cm 1 can be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of sio groups furthermore the marked peaks in the ir spectrum of maga between 430 and 630 cm 1 can be attributed to feo stretching vibrations arising from the magnetite structure utilized for adsorbent modification these findings are similar to those reported 52 53 and could be important evidences for the incorporation of fe3o4 with the alunite surface the peaks observed in the ir spectrum of maga following the adsorption procedure did not change significantly this finding implies that pb2 adsorption on maga may occur via a mechanism other than complexation 54 to examine the surface properties of alunite maga and pb2 loaded maga sem micrographs at 1500 magnification are given in fig 5 after the magnetization procedure a relatively porous and heterogeneous surface of natural alunite fig 5a was coated with fe3o4 and converted to a regular surface structure fig 5b fig 5d f show the edx spectra of alunite and maga before and after pb2 adsorption the primary elements of maga were found to be c o si al k ca and fe the surface functionalization was validated by the large extent of the new strong fe signal in the spectrum of maga besides the emergence of a pb signal in the edx spectrum of maga following adsorption indicates that pb2 ions were successfully removed by the recommended magnetic sorbent material 3 2 ph effect the ph value of the solution is often the most crucial parameter controlling the metal adsorption characteristics due to its significant impact on the surface properties of the adsorbent and metal ion form in the solution 55 the impact of solution ph on pb2 adsorption was examined in the pb2 solutions at ph ranges of 2 0 5 5 using 20 mg maga and results are depicted in fig 6a the adsorption of pb2 onto maga was significantly influenced by the ph values of the medium lower pb2 ion adsorption was observed under strongly acidic conditions at ph 2 0 and 3 0 it is known that pb2 pboh and pbo are all stable species at ph 3 ph 6 5 and ph 11 respectively for the pb h2o system 56 at extremely low ph values protons were more common than pb2 ions protons were more likely to coat the surface of maga resulting in less heavy metal removal due to electrostatic repulsive forces between h3o and pb2 ions as the solution ph rose a lower number of protons were available to compete with the target metal ions for unoccupied sites on the maga resulting in increased sorption in addition the zeta potentials of maga as a function of ph are presented in fig 6a the isoelectric point iep of maga was around ph 3 5 when ph 3 5 the surface of maga is positively charged on the other hand the overall surface charge of maga will become negative and electrostatic interaction will be responsible for pb2 sorption the maximum removal of pb2 ions was achieved at about ph 5 0 with a removal percentage of 40 37 this ph profile of pb2 adsorption is similar to that reported for hdtma bentonite 57 and fe3o4 nanoadsorbent 58 3 3 effect of maga dosage the natural alunite did not successfully remove the pb2 ions as seen in fig 6b on the other hand the adsorbed amounts of pb2 ions steadily increased from 23 67 to 98 14 with an increase in maga dose from 10 to 50 mg a higher adsorbent dosage means a higher number of active binding sites and greater surface area resulting in a higher removal percentage 59 afterward the removal percentage of pb2 ions stayed constant due to the saturation of active sites on the maga surface the dose of 50 mg was selected to minimize the quantity of maga required while maximizing pb2 uptake the influence of the amount of adsorbent on the adsorption efficiency of various contaminants on different adsorbent materials was similarly explained 60 63 3 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamic study the influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity of maga at 293 303 and 313 k is shown in fig 7 the sorption efficiency gradually enhanced as the temperature increased because pb2 adsorption was favored at high temperatures it was concluded that the adsorption process was endothermic the enhanced mobility and distribution of ionic species may contribute to maga s higher adsorption efficiency as temperature rises 64 because of its temperature dependence the adsorption equilibrium constant k c c o c e c e can be used to predict thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures at equilibrium the equilibrium constant define the adsorbate distribution between the liquid and solid phases for the pb2 adsorption process the van t hoff equation eq 2 was used to compute the changes of enthalpy δh and entropy δs from the slope and intercept respectively standard gibbs free energy δg of adsorption was also calculated 2 δ g o rt ln k c 3 ln k c δ g o rt δ h o rt δ s o r table 2 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters for the pb2 adsorption onto maga the negative δg values demonstrated that the adsorption process was spontaneous 65 and they increased with temperature suggesting that increasing the temperature improved the pb2 removal from aqueous solutions using maga the endothermic character was confirmed by the positive δh value finally a positive value of δs during the pb2 adsorption process indicated greater randomness at the magnetic sorbent metal ion solution interface similar findings were also reported by dusi et al 66 3 5 equilibrium time and kinetics of pb2 adsorption the adsorption efficiency of pb2 at different temperatures of 20 30 and 40 c was examined with time intervals ranging from 1 to 60 min fig 8 indicates rapid adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga at the initial stage of the adsorption process furthermore adsorption equilibrium was quickly established within 20 10 and 5 min at 20 30 and 40 c respectively this extremely quick adsorption equilibrium time may be regarded as a significant advantage in terms of process efficiency when using maga in practical applications 67 similar short equilibrium periods for metal ion adsorption onto magnetically modified adsorbents have also been reported by other researchers 68 71 this is contrary to other highly porous sorbent materials where pore diffusion stages limit adsorption 69 to examine the adsorption rate and mechanism for pb2 adsorption onto maga the adsorption kinetics was analyzed using the pseudo first order pfo eq 4 72 and the pseudo second order pso eq 5 73 models 4 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t mg g 1 and q e mg g 1 are adsorption capacities at different times t and at equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pso the pseudo second order kinetic model exhibited good linearity with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 for the pb2 removal process as shown in table 3 adsorption capacity values calculated from the model equations also agree with the experimental values the adsorption capacities of maga for pb2 ions slightly changed with temperature the pseudo first order kinetic model was found to not adequately describe the time dependent data due to lower correlation coefficients a chi square χ2 analysis was also conducted to determine the most suitable kinetic model and the values are listed in table 3 lower χ2 and higher f values further demonstrated that the pseudo second order kinetic model better described the removal of pb2 on maga 3 6 adsorption isotherms in this study equilibrium adsorption data were evaluated using the linear regression fitting of freundlich 74 langmuir 75 and d r 76 isotherms eqs 6 8 described in the following equations 6 q e k f c e n 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e q m exp β ε 2 where q e and c e are the adsorption capacity of maga mol g 1 and residual metal ion concentration in solution mol l 1 at equilibrium respectively q m is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of maga mol g 1 k l is the langmuir constant l mol 1 k f mol g 1 mol l 1 1 n and n dimensionless are the freundlich constants related to the relative adsorption capacity and the intensity respectively ε is polanyi potential calculated by ε rt ln 1 1 c e β mol2 kj 2 is the d r isotherm constant and represents the mean adsorption energy e kj mol 1 which may be determined from e 1 2β 1 2 the adsorption data of pb2 onto maga better fitted the langmuir model with the r 2 value of 0 973 fig 9 and table 4 it can also be suggested that the freundlich isotherm was not favorable for pb2 removal on maga since the χ2 value was the highest and the f value was the lowest for this model these findings implied that the adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga followed a monolayer adsorption process the maximum monolayer pb2 adsorption capacity of maga was obtained as 7 66 10 4 mol g 1 158 7 mg g 1 and compared with the performances of other recent magnetically modified adsorbents reported in the literature table 5 maga can be utilized as an effective magnetic adsorbent for pb2 removal with the advantage of higher adsorption capacity on the other hand the e value 11 60 kj mol 1 showed that the ion exchange plays a significant role in the adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga 3 7 influence of ionic strength the relationship between pb2 adsorption performance of maga and ionic strength is presented in fig 10 a slight decrease was observed in the adsorption capacity of pb2 ions by increasing nano3 concentration from 0 01 to 0 1 m due to the increased competing background electrolyte ions the electrostatic interaction mechanism may possibly be implicated in the pb2 adsorption by maga based on this behavior furthermore the decrease in maga adsorption capability caused by increasing nano3 concentrations could indicate that ion exchange was also involved in the process 3 8 column studies fig 11a shows an actual photo of the adsorption column set up system fig 11b indicated the breakthrough curves with an increase in maga amount from 10 to 40 mg bed height from 0 5 to 2 0 mm under fixed experimental conditions c 0 100 mg l 1 ph 5 0 flow rate 1 0 ml min 1 column i d 1 05 cm table 6 displays the adsorption column performance metrics of the trials the increase in maga amount resulted slowly saturation of the adsorption column broadening of the mass transfer zone mtz and increased an 50 breakthrough t br and exhaustion time t ex the adsorption percentage r gradually increased while the adsorption capacity gradually decreased as the amount of maga increased this type of behavior could be attributed to a longer contact period between pb2 ions and maga with higher amounts of adsorbent 85 86 pb2 adsorption onto maga as a function of the flow rate is presented in fig 11c the breakthrough curves shifted away from the origin as the flow rate increased the prior breakthrough and exhaustion times were achieved by increasing the flow rate from 0 5 to 2 0 ml min 1 resulting in less interaction between pb2 ions and adsorbent maga showed a reduction in its adsorption capacity at 2 ml min 1 then almost constant q ex was observed at the lower flow rates 0 5 and 1 0 ml min 1 this could be due to the sufficient time for pb2 interaction with maga in the column at the studied flow rates 3 9 real wastewater application pb2 removal percentage of maga was investigated in a batch system using real wastewater to assess the adsorbent performance under real conditions wastewater was supplied from a metal treatment unit of a factory in turkey the content was analyzed by aas and found as cd2 0 71 mg l 1 mn2 0 21 mg l 1 k 10 mg l 1 ca2 187 3 mg l 1 and mg2 35 44 mg l 1 the wastewater sample was spiked with 100 mg l 1 pb2 solution before conducting the optimized adsorption procedure the pb2 adsorption percentage of maga was recorded as 90 09 in the real wastewater sample while the synthetic pb2 solution had a removal percentage of 98 14 due to its high adsorption performance maga appears to be a viable option for the treatment of pb2 containing wastewaters 3 10 desorption studies the reusability of an adsorbent is a remarkable property for estimating its industrial and practical application potential to make the manufactured adsorbent more environmentally friendly a study of its adsorption desorption efficiency and reusability is required adsorbents having a high reusability performance are preferred for cost effective and efficient wastewater management 87 88 the maga s recyclability was tested by recovering adsorbed pb2 ions in ten consecutive cycles fig 12 indicated that the adsorption efficiency of maga slightly decreased but it was higher than 70 even after 10 cycles however the desorption efficiency of maga did not have a monotonous trend along with the cycles this trend may be explained by the metal ions that remained on the adsorbent during the initial cycles and were desorbed during the subsequent desorption cycles a similar desorption trend was also reported by briao et al 89 a good regeneration ability and stability of maga implied that it has a great deal of potential for practical use in removing toxic pb2 ions 3 11 possible mechanism of pb2 adsorption onto maga the adsorption of pb2 on maga was a complicated process in which various interactions coexisted the adsorption mechanism was referred to as electrostatic interaction based on the influence of ph the electrostatic interaction mechanism was also confirmed by the decreasing pb2 adsorption tendency in the presence of background electrolyte ions based on the results of the d r isotherm the pb2 adsorption process involved ion exchange with an e value of 11 60 kj mol 1 ion exchange mechanism could be supported by a decrease in the adsorption capacity of maga by increasing the concentration of background electrolyte in the light of the pseudo second order kinetics pb2 adsorption involved chemical bonding and the rate limiting step is chemisorption thermodynamic parameters demonstrated that the pb2 adsorption onto maga was spontaneous and endothermic since the adsorption capacity of maga enhanced with increasing temperature micro precipitation and pore filling mechanisms on the macroporous surface were involved in the pb2 adsorption process according to sem micrographs and bet isotherms of alunite and maga however no characteristic changes in the ir spectra of maga after pb2 adsorption were observed implying that the role of complexation with functional groups in the adsorption process was negligible overall scheme 1 depicts the mechanisms that may be responsible for the pb2 adsorption process electrostatic interaction ion exchange and micro precipitation are all possible mechanisms for pb2 adsorption onto maga 3 12 cost analysis of maga commercialization of the adsorption approach for removing contaminants from polluted waters is strongly reliant on the cost of adsorbent manufacture the estimated cost of preparing 1 kg of maga was calculated to be 6 70 usd including raw materials 0 063 usd power 0 907 usd and all chemical expenditures 5 730 usd considering the current price of commercial activated carbon in turkey approximately 10 7 usd per kg the estimated maga manufacturing cost demonstrates that the suggested preparation method is an economical procedure additionally maga s high removal percentage for pb2 ions as well as its regenerability makes it more efficient inexpensive and practicable for industrial use 90 4 conclusion this study showed the feasibility of maga as a suitable magnetic sorbent with a noticeable adsorption potential for pb2 ions maga eliminates the requirement for additional centrifugation or filtering during the phase separation process initial ph and adsorbent amount had an effect on the maga adsorption performance adsorption equilibrium was attained in 10 min the kinetic data were well represented by the pseudo second order model and the well fitting equilibrium data to the langmuir isotherm revealed monolayer adsorption of pb2 ions onto the homogeneous surface of maga the applicability of maga in real wastewater also makes its use possible for metal removal the proposed adsorbent was successfully applied to synthetic pb2 solution and industrial effluent with an adsorption percentage of around 90 overall the results of this study revealed that maga is a new promising sorbent for the adsorption of hazardous pb2 ions as a consequence future research into maga s adaptability in combating additional organic and inorganic contaminants as well as scale up

12906,alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 was evaluated for pb2 removal after magnetically functionalization maga which led to a considerable improvement in the natural mineral s characteristics and adsorption capability pb2 adsorption was investigated in both batch and column systems concerning the influence of ph maga amounts contact time initial pb2 concentration ionic strength flow rate and bed height the maximum pb2 adsorption performance was obtained at ph 5 0 the pseudo second order kinetic and langmuir isotherm models were found to characterize the adsorption process maga had a monolayer pb2 adsorption capacity of 158 73 mg g 1 application tests with real wastewater have shown that maga has satisfactory adsorption performance 90 for practical applications as well furthermore the adsorption efficiency of pb2 ions in dynamic flow mode was still around 80 after 10 consecutive cycles maga was characterized by infrared ir brunauer emmett teller bet scanning electron microscope sem energy dispersive x ray edx isoelectric point iep and vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis thermodynamic analysis indicated that the binding of pb2 ions to maga was endothermic the maximum breakthrough capacity calculated from the breakthrough curve at the exhausted point was 31 1 mg g 1 the estimated cost of preparing maga was calculated to be 6 70 usd kg overall the findings clearly showed that the maga seems to be an eco friendly economic and recyclable adsorbent for the removal of toxic pb2 from wastewaters graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords alunite breakthrough heavy metal lead ii magnetic adsorbent wastewater treatment 1 introduction lead has high bioaccumulation in the human body and can cause brain damage resulting in a reduction in learning and memory as well as easily altering bone metabolism and creating genetic abnormalities 1 2 the elimination of heavy metal ions from polluted industrial effluents has attracted considerable attention in recent years because of their known toxicity to living things existing traditional treatment systems have a high cost and require regular chemical input making them impracticable and uneconomical as well as causing significant environmental destruction simple cost effective and environmentally friendly technologies might thus be used to remove toxic metal ions from industrial effluents and other metal polluted areas 3 8 because of their stability high solubility and migration activity in aqueous media removing these pollutants is extremely difficult it is critical to develop an effective method for treating heavy metal contaminated wastewater 9 adsorption is generally presumed to be superior to alternative processing technologies in terms of cost flexibility compact design simplicity of operation and sensitivity to toxic contaminants in various processing technologies 10 because activated carbon the most extensively utilized adsorbent is so expensive discovering low cost and renewable adsorption materials is becoming increasingly crucial 11 13 effective adsorbent materials should have high surface area mechanical and physical stability and most significantly a large number of binding groups another significant characteristic of a promising sorbent is the ease of recovery in this context magnetically functionalized sorbents have attracted considerable attention in recent years by applying an external magnetic field magnetic sorbents can be separated from the sorption medium simply and quickly this greatly simplifies the sample pretreatment process and eliminates the need for centrifugation and filtration 14 magnetic adsorption is an exciting technique for increasing the capacity of treatment plants 15 researchers are increasingly focused on developing innovative and efficient magnetic sorbents as a result of these characteristics 14 chitosan al2o3 fe3o4 16 bentonite 17 illite 18 montmorillonite 19 fes lignin derived carbon 20 zeolite 21 fe3o4 bone activated carbon 22 rice husk activated carbon 23 fe3o4 sepiolite composite 24 multi wall carbon nanotube 25 magnetic acid activated carbon 26 and magnetic magnesium zinc ferrite 27 are some recent examples of magnetically functionalized adsorbents aimed at the removal of different pollutants alunite having the chemical formula kal3 so4 2 oh 6 is a potassium alum that often occurs as rhombohedral and hexagonal crystals 28 unless calcined alunite cannot dissolve in water acids or bases 29 the hydrothermal modification of tuff resulted in the formation of this mineral which contained roughly 50 sio2 aluminum sulfate alumina potassium alum and potassium sulfate are the most common products of alunite 30 only a few research on the use of alunite as an adsorbent has been reported in the literature even though it has been successfully utilized in the wastewater treatment process phosphate removal was investigated using calcined alunite 31 and the thermal decomposition product of alunite kcl 32 alunite was also successfully utilized as an efficient adsorbent in natural or calcined forms for reactive 33 acid 34 35 and disperse dyes 36 the simplicity of non contact magnetic separation technology combined with alunite s adsorption potential might pave the way for a new approach to realizing the necessary water treatment process thus in this work we hypothesize that magnetically modified alunite maga was synthesized and employed as a regenerable eco friendly and inexpensive adsorbent for the removal of pb2 contaminant to the best of our knowledge there have also been no reports of magnetically functionalized alunite being synthesized and employed as an adsorbent for the removal of contaminants from the contaminated aquatic medium to test the hypothesis of this study maga s adsorption efficacy against this toxic metal was extensively investigated in both batch and dynamic flow systems under various experimental conditions this research not only offers a simple and comprehensive strategy for employing magnetically modified alunite in batch and continuous treatment systems but also offers the potential for long term usage in the treatment of pb2 contaminated waters alunite one of the components of maga employed as a sorbent in this study is a naturally occurring mineral magnetite on the other hand is a non toxic material that is even utilized as an antimicrobial agent against several pathogens 37 therefore maga with these features might be referred to as eco friendly in this study 2 experimental studies 2 1 chemicals and equipment pb no3 2 was purchased from sigma aldrich 99 and used to prepare a stock solution 1000 mg l 1 different concentrations of pb2 ion solutions were obtained by freshly diluting these solutions dilute hcl merck 37 and naoh merck 99 solutions were used to adjust the ph values of the working solutions fecl3 sigma aldrich 98 0 and feso4 7h2o sigma aldrich 99 0 were used to synthesize maga alunite was provided from natural deposits in kütahya şaphane turkey the ph measurements in this study were made using a ph meter wtw inolab 720 flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer faas perkin elmer analyst

taken to characterize the functional groups on the surface of the sorbent material quantachrome instruments autosorb 1 model bet surface area analyzer was used to measure the surface area of maga to analyze the surface charges at different ph levels zeta potentials were determined using a malvern zeta sizer the surface morphology of maga was examined using scanning electron microscopy sem jeol 5600 lv sem at 20 kev accelerating voltage magnetic properties were determined by vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis lakeshore 7407 vsm x ray diffraction xrd analysis was carried out by panalytical empyrean cu kα the tube voltage and current were 45 kv and 40 ma respectively with a scan rate of 2 min 1 2 2 development of maga alunite was ground using a basic analytical mill ika a11 and dried in an oven at 105 c for 3 h the magnetization of alunite was carried out by the alkaline co precipitation technique as described in previous studies 38 39 with minor modifications briefly 50 g of alunite 212 μm was suspended in 500 ml of deionized water a mixture including 18 g of fecl3 and 15 5 g of feso4 7h2o in distilled water was prepared heated at 70 c for 15 min and cooled to room temperature under continuous stirring alunite suspension was added to this mixture and stirred for 30 min then a solid phase was formed by dropwise addition of 10 m naoh solution and agitated for 60 min the precipitated solid was stored at room temperature for 24 h before being filtered the precipitate was rinsed several times with distilled water the prepared magnetic product was heated overnight at 50 c bottled and labeled as maga 2 3 batch sorption studies batch sorption experiments for pb2 adsorption onto maga were conducted in 25 ml aqueous pb2 solutions to determine the optimum experimental conditions batch adsorption studies were carried out by changing ph 2 0 to 5 5 sorbent dosage 20 to 80 mg contact time 1 60 min and ionic strength 0 01 0 1 m the metal ion solutions were mixed with a known amount of maga shaken at 200 rpm and at room temperature by an orbital shaker gerhardt tho 500 1 the solid phase was collected in the bottom of the beakers with an external magnet after the adsorption trials and easily separated by decantation then the clear solutions were analyzed by faas for pb2 ions the adsorption capacity q e mg g 1 of maga is calculated using the equation below 1 q e v c i c e m where c i and c e are the pb2 ion concentrations mg l 1 in the solutions before and after pb2 sorption respectively v is the solution volume l and m is the amount of maga g sorption isotherms were examined at different initial pb2 ion concentrations 25 600 mg l 1 using the fixed amount of adsorbent 50 mg on the other hand the initial pb2 ion concentration was kept constant at 100 mg l 1 in the kinetic studies results are presented as the mean of three replicates in this research error bars were included in all figures spss 15 0 was used to statistically evaluate the data 2 4 continuous mode sorption studies the continuous mode sorption system used in this study consists of a glass column 1 05 cm internal diameter 20 cm glass column height for sorbent filling a peristaltic pump ismatec ipc 16 for solution flow and tygon tubings for connection pb2 ion solution at a fixed concentration 100 mg l 1 was passed through the column operated in an up flow mode effluents were collected at the end of the sorption procedure and analyzed as stated above 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnetic sorbent table 1 shows the obtained data from the nitrogen adsorption isotherm the specific surface area of alunite decreased from 27 20 to 5 60 m2 g 1 after magnetically modification of the mineral on the other hand the functionalization of alunite also resulted in a decrease in micropore and total pore volumes while a 1 83 fold increase was observed in total pore size these findings were in line with the results that were previously reported 40 42 the n2 adsorption isotherms for alunite and maga are given in fig 1 according to the iupac classification n2 adsorption isotherms of alunite and maga can be classified as typeiii corresponding to macroporous materials a vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis was used to determine the magnetic strength of the maga as shown in fig 2 the magnetic response of the generated material was noticeable when exposed to an external magnetic field while no magnetic properties were observed for natural alunite the saturation magnetization of maga was 12 8 emu remanence and coevercity values fig 2 of adsorbents also imply that the proposed sorbent material is a magnetite coated composite on the other hand this suggested absorbent has a strong enough magnetic response to allow for quick magnetic separation throughout the sorption process similar observations were found regarding the effect of magnetic functionalization 43 44 maga could also be quickly removed from the solution using a magnet in a few seconds this further revealed that the suggested adsorbent had a strong magnetic property the phase components of the alunite and maga were determined by xrd analysis the typical xrd pattern of alunite with a minor phase quartz sio2 and al2si2o5 oh 4 45 46 in the mineral structure was presented in fig 3 the xrd pattern of maga fig 3 revealed the characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ of 30 35 6 43 3 53 7 57 5 and 62 9 demonstrating that the phase of fe3o4 47 these results verified that magnetite coated the alunite surface successfully the infrared ir spectra of the materials alunite magnetite maga maga pb2 are shown in fig 4 the bands at 3450 and 1255 cm 1 in the ftir spectrum of alunite were due to stretching and bending vibrations of hydroxyl groups so4 2 bending vibrations were observed at 1110 and 1074 cm 1 alo interaction was represented by vibrational frequencies less than 1000 cm 1 46 48 sio peaks originating from sio2 can be found in the alunite structure 49 a broad band at about 3420 cm 1 and a sharp characteristic band at about 578 cm 1 were visible in the spectra of magnetite indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups from the water and feo groups respectively 50 51 ir spectrum of maga indicated the characteristic peaks in the wavenumber region of 3000 3700 cm 1 which were attributed to stretching vibrations of the oh and al o h bonding o h o bending vibration of interlayer water can be seen at the wavenumbers between 1550 and 1640 cm 1 the peaks at 1085 and 1032 cm 1 can be ascribed to the stretching vibrations of so and si o si groups of alunite respectively the peak around 795 cm 1 can be attributed to asymmetric stretching vibrations of sio groups furthermore the marked peaks in the ir spectrum of maga between 430 and 630 cm 1 can be attributed to feo stretching vibrations arising from the magnetite structure utilized for adsorbent modification these findings are similar to those reported 52 53 and could be important evidences for the incorporation of fe3o4 with the alunite surface the peaks observed in the ir spectrum of maga following the adsorption procedure did not change significantly this finding implies that pb2 adsorption on maga may occur via a mechanism other than complexation 54 to examine the surface properties of alunite maga and pb2 loaded maga sem micrographs at 1500 magnification are given in fig 5 after the magnetization procedure a relatively porous and heterogeneous surface of natural alunite fig 5a was coated with fe3o4 and converted to a regular surface structure fig 5b fig 5d f show the edx spectra of alunite and maga before and after pb2 adsorption the primary elements of maga were found to be c o si al k ca and fe the surface functionalization was validated by the large extent of the new strong fe signal in the spectrum of maga besides the emergence of a pb signal in the edx spectrum of maga following adsorption indicates that pb2 ions were successfully removed by the recommended magnetic sorbent material 3 2 ph effect the ph value of the solution is often the most crucial parameter controlling the metal adsorption characteristics due to its significant impact on the surface properties of the adsorbent and metal ion form in the solution 55 the impact of solution ph on pb2 adsorption was examined in the pb2 solutions at ph ranges of 2 0 5 5 using 20 mg maga and results are depicted in fig 6a the adsorption of pb2 onto maga was significantly influenced by the ph values of the medium lower pb2 ion adsorption was observed under strongly acidic conditions at ph 2 0 and 3 0 it is known that pb2 pboh and pbo are all stable species at ph 3 ph 6 5 and ph 11 respectively for the pb h2o system 56 at extremely low ph values protons were more common than pb2 ions protons were more likely to coat the surface of maga resulting in less heavy metal removal due to electrostatic repulsive forces between h3o and pb2 ions as the solution ph rose a lower number of protons were available to compete with the target metal ions for unoccupied sites on the maga resulting in increased sorption in addition the zeta potentials of maga as a function of ph are presented in fig 6a the isoelectric point iep of maga was around ph 3 5 when ph 3 5 the surface of maga is positively charged on the other hand the overall surface charge of maga will become negative and electrostatic interaction will be responsible for pb2 sorption the maximum removal of pb2 ions was achieved at about ph 5 0 with a removal percentage of 40 37 this ph profile of pb2 adsorption is similar to that reported for hdtma bentonite 57 and fe3o4 nanoadsorbent 58 3 3 effect of maga dosage the natural alunite did not successfully remove the pb2 ions as seen in fig 6b on the other hand the adsorbed amounts of pb2 ions steadily increased from 23 67 to 98 14 with an increase in maga dose from 10 to 50 mg a higher adsorbent dosage means a higher number of active binding sites and greater surface area resulting in a higher removal percentage 59 afterward the removal percentage of pb2 ions stayed constant due to the saturation of active sites on the maga surface the dose of 50 mg was selected to minimize the quantity of maga required while maximizing pb2 uptake the influence of the amount of adsorbent on the adsorption efficiency of various contaminants on different adsorbent materials was similarly explained 60 63 3 4 effect of temperature and thermodynamic study the influence of temperature on the adsorption capacity of maga at 293 303 and 313 k is shown in fig 7 the sorption efficiency gradually enhanced as the temperature increased because pb2 adsorption was favored at high temperatures it was concluded that the adsorption process was endothermic the enhanced mobility and distribution of ionic species may contribute to maga s higher adsorption efficiency as temperature rises 64 because of its temperature dependence the adsorption equilibrium constant k c c o c e c e can be used to predict thermodynamic parameters at different temperatures at equilibrium the equilibrium constant define the adsorbate distribution between the liquid and solid phases for the pb2 adsorption process the van t hoff equation eq 2 was used to compute the changes of enthalpy δh and entropy δs from the slope and intercept respectively standard gibbs free energy δg of adsorption was also calculated 2 δ g o rt ln k c 3 ln k c δ g o rt δ h o rt δ s o r table 2 summarizes the thermodynamic parameters for the pb2 adsorption onto maga the negative δg values demonstrated that the adsorption process was spontaneous 65 and they increased with temperature suggesting that increasing the temperature improved the pb2 removal from aqueous solutions using maga the endothermic character was confirmed by the positive δh value finally a positive value of δs during the pb2 adsorption process indicated greater randomness at the magnetic sorbent metal ion solution interface similar findings were also reported by dusi et al 66 3 5 equilibrium time and kinetics of pb2 adsorption the adsorption efficiency of pb2 at different temperatures of 20 30 and 40 c was examined with time intervals ranging from 1 to 60 min fig 8 indicates rapid adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga at the initial stage of the adsorption process furthermore adsorption equilibrium was quickly established within 20 10 and 5 min at 20 30 and 40 c respectively this extremely quick adsorption equilibrium time may be regarded as a significant advantage in terms of process efficiency when using maga in practical applications 67 similar short equilibrium periods for metal ion adsorption onto magnetically modified adsorbents have also been reported by other researchers 68 71 this is contrary to other highly porous sorbent materials where pore diffusion stages limit adsorption 69 to examine the adsorption rate and mechanism for pb2 adsorption onto maga the adsorption kinetics was analyzed using the pseudo first order pfo eq 4 72 and the pseudo second order pso eq 5 73 models 4 q t q e 1 exp k 1 t 5 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where q t mg g 1 and q e mg g 1 are adsorption capacities at different times t and at equilibrium respectively k 1 min 1 is the rate constant of pfo and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pso the pseudo second order kinetic model exhibited good linearity with a correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 999 for the pb2 removal process as shown in table 3 adsorption capacity values calculated from the model equations also agree with the experimental values the adsorption capacities of maga for pb2 ions slightly changed with temperature the pseudo first order kinetic model was found to not adequately describe the time dependent data due to lower correlation coefficients a chi square χ2 analysis was also conducted to determine the most suitable kinetic model and the values are listed in table 3 lower χ2 and higher f values further demonstrated that the pseudo second order kinetic model better described the removal of pb2 on maga 3 6 adsorption isotherms in this study equilibrium adsorption data were evaluated using the linear regression fitting of freundlich 74 langmuir 75 and d r 76 isotherms eqs 6 8 described in the following equations 6 q e k f c e n 7 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 8 q e q m exp β ε 2 where q e and c e are the adsorption capacity of maga mol g 1 and residual metal ion concentration in solution mol l 1 at equilibrium respectively q m is the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of maga mol g 1 k l is the langmuir constant l mol 1 k f mol g 1 mol l 1 1 n and n dimensionless are the freundlich constants related to the relative adsorption capacity and the intensity respectively ε is polanyi potential calculated by ε rt ln 1 1 c e β mol2 kj 2 is the d r isotherm constant and represents the mean adsorption energy e kj mol 1 which may be determined from e 1 2β 1 2 the adsorption data of pb2 onto maga better fitted the langmuir model with the r 2 value of 0 973 fig 9 and table 4 it can also be suggested that the freundlich isotherm was not favorable for pb2 removal on maga since the χ2 value was the highest and the f value was the lowest for this model these findings implied that the adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga followed a monolayer adsorption process the maximum monolayer pb2 adsorption capacity of maga was obtained as 7 66 10 4 mol g 1 158 7 mg g 1 and compared with the performances of other recent magnetically modified adsorbents reported in the literature table 5 maga can be utilized as an effective magnetic adsorbent for pb2 removal with the advantage of higher adsorption capacity on the other hand the e value 11 60 kj mol 1 showed that the ion exchange plays a significant role in the adsorption of pb2 ions onto maga 3 7 influence of ionic strength the relationship between pb2 adsorption performance of maga and ionic strength is presented in fig 10 a slight decrease was observed in the adsorption capacity of pb2 ions by increasing nano3 concentration from 0 01 to 0 1 m due to the increased competing background electrolyte ions the electrostatic interaction mechanism may possibly be implicated in the pb2 adsorption by maga based on this behavior furthermore the decrease in maga adsorption capability caused by increasing nano3 concentrations could indicate that ion exchange was also involved in the process 3 8 column studies fig 11a shows an actual photo of the adsorption column set up system fig 11b indicated the breakthrough curves with an increase in maga amount from 10 to 40 mg bed height from 0 5 to 2 0 mm under fixed experimental conditions c 0 100 mg l 1 ph 5 0 flow rate 1 0 ml min 1 column i d 1 05 cm table 6 displays the adsorption column performance metrics of the trials the increase in maga amount resulted slowly saturation of the adsorption column broadening of the mass transfer zone mtz and increased an 50 breakthrough t br and exhaustion time t ex the adsorption percentage r gradually increased while the adsorption capacity gradually decreased as the amount of maga increased this type of behavior could be attributed to a longer contact period between pb2 ions and maga with higher amounts of adsorbent 85 86 pb2 adsorption onto maga as a function of the flow rate is presented in fig 11c the breakthrough curves shifted away from the origin as the flow rate increased the prior breakthrough and exhaustion times were achieved by increasing the flow rate from 0 5 to 2 0 ml min 1 resulting in less interaction between pb2 ions and adsorbent maga showed a reduction in its adsorption capacity at 2 ml min 1 then almost constant q ex was observed at the lower flow rates 0 5 and 1 0 ml min 1 this could be due to the sufficient time for pb2 interaction with maga in the column at the studied flow rates 3 9 real wastewater application pb2 removal percentage of maga was investigated in a batch system using real wastewater to assess the adsorbent performance under real conditions wastewater was supplied from a metal treatment unit of a factory in turkey the content was analyzed by aas and found as cd2 0 71 mg l 1 mn2 0 21 mg l 1 k 10 mg l 1 ca2 187 3 mg l 1 and mg2 35 44 mg l 1 the wastewater sample was spiked with 100 mg l 1 pb2 solution before conducting the optimized adsorption procedure the pb2 adsorption percentage of maga was recorded as 90 09 in the real wastewater sample while the synthetic pb2 solution had a removal percentage of 98 14 due to its high adsorption performance maga appears to be a viable option for the treatment of pb2 containing wastewaters 3 10 desorption studies the reusability of an adsorbent is a remarkable property for estimating its

the overgrowth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob under conditions of low and high ammonia concentration the results showed that the nitrogen removal efficiency of canon process could be restored to more than 80 in 5 days after 5 mg l nh2oh addition however once the nh2oh was inexistence in the reactor under the low ammonia concentration the nob was restored and thus producing nitrate upon shock

not maintain no more than several months 7 the possible reason is that inevitable generation of nob thus producing accumulation of nitrate and then lead to unstable process operation although the do was lower than 1 mg l under the long term operation the effluent nitrate level was often more than 100 mg l due to the inevitable enrichment of nob and the generally adapt of nob to lower

level of do can inhibit nitrobacter sp as the r strategists while nitrospira sp grow as the k strategists prefer low do concentration and even thrive in the high substrate conditions therefore it would be difficult to suppress nob growth using a single factor over the long term operation the combination of different controlling strategies would be more realistic hydroxylamine nh2oh an intermediate in both nitrification and anammox processes 14 17 demonstrated to be an excellent inhibitor for nob not hampering and even accelerating the ammonium uptake rate of aob 16 18 partial nitrification is difficult to start up and stable operation for a long time so nh2oh has been used in achieving partial nitrification and dealing with the accumulation of nitrate in the effluent of

compared to nitrobacter in contrast the nutrition was maintained at a stable level with a nar of 97 using a real time aeration control strategy following the cessation of nh2oh addition however zhao et al 18 reported that the partial nitrification disappeared progressively in 21 days after stopping nh2oh addition although the do was controlled at 0 2 0 5 mg l without srt controlling in their study moreover xu reported the presence of do could reduce the inhibitory effect of hydroxylamine on nob by 20 0 5 20 it was also reported that the pn effect was quickly achieved with nh2oh addition in the first 4 days to establish spnda simultaneous partial nitrification denitrification and anammox process with low do and the spnda process remained relatively stable within 100 days 21 it was suggested the inhibition of nob by nh2oh was reversible or irreversible is related to the operational strategies after stopping addition of nh2oh especially low do and srt control further nh2oh was also efficient in solving the problem of nitrate accumulation in the canon process by suppressing nob in activated sludge or biofilm systems 22 23 most researches on restoring pn a processes focused on the nitrogen removal performance and the evolution of microbial communities under the condition of one dosage however the evolution of nitrogen removal functional genes under the different nh2oh dosages and influent ammonia concentration have been scarcely detected therefore in this study the nitrogen removal performance and optimization of the canon process with different nh2oh additions at low and high influent ammonia concentrations in the sequencing batch reactor sbbr reactor were studied the changes of microbial communities in the system under the different conditions were investigated by high throughput sequencing which correlated with the removal effect of the long term nitrogen process 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation the cylindrical sbbr was made of plexiglass and had a working volume of 3 5 l with a height and diameter respectively for 33 cm and 15 cm the sbbr was operated with a 4 8 h cycle each day each cycle consisted of 240 480 min of operation that included 10 min feeding 180 420 min aeration 5 min setting 5 min decanting and 40 100 min idling time the volumetric exchanging ratio of the sbr per cycle was 50 accordingly hrt was

the ring the reactor was placed in a thermostatic chamber to maintain the temperature at 30 2 c do was provided with an air pump with a disc diffuser aco 9601 and the aeration rate was controlled with rotameter do was maintained between 0 2 and 0 4 mg l in the aerobic period the ph was recorded but not controlled which varied between 7 2 and 8 5 during the sbr cycle the whole experiment was divided into three main phases the start up of canon process phase i not shown in this paper the effects of dosage and duration of nh2oh on restoration of canon process in situ under low phase ii and high phase iii influent ammonia concentration further phase ii and iii were divided into seven and eight stages respectively tables 3 and 4 the nh2oh was prepared from nh2oh hcl 2 2 wastewater and seed

test process the batch tests were carried out in the reactor directly before aaob activity tests the reactor was pumped with n2 99 99 for 10 min to eliminate the do before substrate addition then the

were collected for dna extraction which covered the two phases of canon process operation i e two samples were taken on the 9th day after adding 5 mg l and 10 mg l nh2oh in phase ii respectively and the third sample were taken on the stable operation in phase iii the three samples were numbered as 1 2 and 3 dna was extracted from the sludge samples using a dna extraction kit and was then visualized using age agarose gel electrophoresis the qualified dna was sequenced using a miseq sequencing platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by the sangon company and the obtained sequences were compared with similar sequences of reference organisms using a blast search 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n vss and tss were measured according to standard methods 27 the total nitrogen tn was defined as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the do concentrations and ph values in the reactor were determined with a portable do analyzer hq30d hach usa and a ph meter phs 10 fangzhou china respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nh2oh on the stability of canon process at low ammonia phase ii after the canon process was successfully start up under high nh4 n 200 mg l level phase i the influent nh4 n concentration was gradually reduced to 50 mg n l the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor began to decrease and then the effects of nh2oh dosage and duration on the canon system under low ammonia conditions were studied phase ii this phase was divided into seven stages a g and the operating parameters of the reactor in each stage are presented in table 1 the influent nh4 n concentration was gradually lowered from 200 mg l to 50 mg l after successful set up of canon process in sbbr phase i not shown in this paper the hrt was maintained at 12 h the same as phase i while the do was reduced from 0 6 mg l to 0 2 mg l resulted in 21 93 mg l of nh4 n in the effluent on the first day of stage a day 1 30 fig 1a although nh4 n in the effluent continuously decreased to 10 52 mg l on the 11st day due to the adaptation of aob to new environment the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio fig 1c was still between 0 16 and 0 20 higher than 0 11 the theoretical value indicating that nob existed in the reactor and the activities of which were partially inhibited by low do however the effluent nh4 n concentration increased to 15 59 mg l due to the breakdown of rotameter on the 13th day and then maintain more than 10 mg l during the following days to restore the activities of aob the hrt was adjusted to 16 h along with extension of aeration time from 330 min to 420 min on the 19th day and effluent nh4 n level decreased immediately to 0 11 mg l on the day of 38th but the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio increased from 0 18 to 0 36 from the19rd day to the 30th day indicating that the activities of nob were stimulated by the prolonged aeration time the nitrogen removal performance of the sbbr was deteriorated the ammonia and tn removal efficiency were 62 and 43 on the 30th day respectively in stage b day 31 37 and stage d day 49 65 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor once a day to inhibit the activity of nob for 7 days and 17 days respectively further in stage f day 76 82 10 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor at the same frequency after introduction of nh2oh the ammonia and tn removal efficiency all elevated significantly under the different application time and dosage of nh2oh and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio decreased quickly even lower than the theoretical value 28 indicating that nob activity was effectively inhibited by nh2oh in the reactor in stage c day 38 48 stage e day66 to 75 and stage g day 83 96 the reactor operated without assisting of nh2oh for 11 days 10 days and 14 days respectively it was found that the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio in stages of c e and g all improved and higher than 0 11 even the tn removal efficiency was no more than 80 due to the accumulation of nitrate it was indicated that the inhibition of nob by nh2oh was reversible which was similar with the results obtained by other authors 16 29 30 compared with stage d nh4 n concentration in the effluent of stage g is obviously lower which suggested that the oxidation activity of aob elevated with the enhancement of nh2oh dosage while the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio increased to 0 32 on the last day of stage g and which was higher than 0 18 on the last day of stage d suggesting that the nob activity recovered more after stopping nh2oh addition with the increase of nh2oh dosage in comparison with addition of 5 mg l nh2oh for 7 days the tn removal efficiency increased by 2 37 when 5 mg l nh2oh was added to reactor for 17 days while the recovery of nob activity was similar the major difference between this study and the most studies is that the present pn a process inoculated with activated sludge in which the recovery of nob activity can be overcome with srt 8 or real time aeration control 30 huang reported that the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio in biofilm reactor increased gradually after nh2oh addition was ceased within 20 days due to robustness of nob activity and then the nitrogen removal performance recovered by decreasing aeration rate 29 therefore nh2oh addition must combined the other controlling strategy such as short srt low do real time aeration control is favorable for inhibition of nob activity 3 2 effect of nh2oh on the stability of canon process under high ammonia concentration phase iii phase iii was divided into eight stages a h for 71 days according to operational conditions of sbbr the influent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 200 mg l do concentration in aerobic time was maintained at 0 4 mg l and the other operating parameters of the reactor at each stage in phase iii are shown in table 2 in phase iii influent nh4 n concentration increased from 50 mg l to 200 mg l at the beginning of stage a days 1 14 sodium nitrite was added to the reactor at the beginning of stage d days 32 43 resulting in 133 mg l of no2 n in the reactor and the temperature of reactor decreased from 30 c to 21 c abruptly on the 56th day the nitrogen removal performance was affected by these shocks significantly and then 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor at the stages of b d and g to recover the nitrogen removal performance of the sbbr 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance of sbbr during stable operation as shown in fig 2 the effluent nh4 n concentration was very high at the beginning of sage a days 1 14 due to the limited activities of aob which was not match the high nh4 n condition although the aeration time was prolonged on the 7th day the nh4 n and tn removal efficiency were only 55 and 45 respectively and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio was 0 17 higher than 0 11 and then 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor to inhibit nob activity once a day in stage b days 15 22 for 7 days the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio decreased to lower than 0 11 immediately indicating the activities of nob was inhibited completely in stage c days 23 31 the effluent nh4 n concentration decreased from 44 01 mg l to 14 46 mg l due to the aeration time was lengthened to 420 min and hrt was adjusted to 16 h further the nh4 n and tn removal efficiency continuously increased to 92 57 and 80 98 respectively after stopping nh2oh addition in stage c and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio maintained between 0 12 and 0 14 it was found that the nitrogen removal performance after stopping nh2oh addition was more stable in phase iii than that of phase ii with the reason maybe that nob activity was double inhibited by nh2oh and fa under high influent nh4 n concentration in the past decades it is generally believed that the presence of fa can inhibit the activity or metabolism of aob and nob in addition nob is more sensitive to fa in the nitrification process which provides an effective method to realize partial nitrification by using high ammonia level 31 anthonisen 32 reported that the inhibited level of fa to nob and aob were 0 1 1 0 mg l and 10 150 mg l respectively the concentration of fa in present reactor at the beginning of sbbr cycle was 6 17 mg l and 24 7 mg l respectively under 50 mg l and 200 mg l influent nh4 n although the fa concentration decreased with time in sbbr due to conversation of ammonia fa is conducive to inhibit nob under high influent nh4 n concentration chen selectively inhibited the nob through the concentration of fa in a zeolite sequence batch reactor 33 3 2 2 influence of high concentration nitrite shock on the stability of the reactor at the beginning of stage d days 32 43 when sodium nitrite was added into the reactor with the no2 n level of 132 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration increased to 100 29 mg l and the effluent no2 n and no3 n concentration decreased to 0 72 mg l and 9 87 mg l respectively indicating the activity of functional flora was seriously affected fig 2a a large number of studies have proved that nitrite is not only an essential substrate for the growth of aaob but also a crucial inhibitor of aaob activity 34 36 the inhibition of nitrite in the anammox reaction has been reported to be one reason for the decrease in the efficiency of nitrogen removal 37 it was reported that aaob can tolerate a wide range of nitrite concentrations during short term exposure time associated nitrogen removal efficiency and bacterial activity were largely impacted by nitrite 38 40 in the subsequent recovery process stage e 5 mg l nh2oh was added into the sbbr it was demonstrated that the activity of aaob effectively promoted while the activity of nob was inhibited and the reactor gradually returned to its previous state when the addition of nh2oh was stopped the ammonia and tn removal efficiency decreased slightly indicating that more time was needed to restore the system which also proved that high concentration of nitrite has a strong inhibitory effect on aaob activity therefore in the actual operation process care should be taken to avoid the impact of high concentrations of nitrite on the canon process 3 2 3 influence of temperature shock on the stability of the reactor temperature was one important factor in biological wastewater treatment because it affects the metabolic activity and species relative abundances in microbial populations the optimum temperature in most current anammox reactors has been reported as being in the range of 30 40 c 41 it has also been noted that incidental temperature shocks may occur anyway due to either the failure of ph control systems or by accident 42 when a sudden decrease in temperature happens cells may suffer from cold shock and even cause damage to cellular structure and function thus promoting the proliferation of undesirable nob and reducing the activity of aaob in canon process 43 45 this experiment investigated the feasibility of restoring the nitrogen removal performance of canon process after temperature shock by assist of nh2oh dosing in case of device failure as shown in table 3 on the day of temperature dropped to 21 c suddenly the aaob activity and the aob activity decreased by 18 93 and 11 56 compared with that of 30 c respectively on the first day after the temperature returned to normal the tn removal efficiency of the reactor continued to drop to 40 86 the aaob and aob activity dropped by 51 19 and 46 67 respectively there was no accumulation of nitrite during the reaction process which was the same as investigation by zhang et al 46 in which study the temperature dropped at a rate of 1 c day from 30 c to 20 c and then to 15 c however fu et al 47 reported that when the temperature dropped sharply to 21 c the aaob activity decreased by 59 24 on the detected day the aob activity only decreased by 8 01 and the nitrite in the reactor was seriously accumulated different nitrogen removal performances produced may be due to the disparate impacts of temperature shock on functional bacteria activity 3 3 effect of nh2oh on the microbial community in canon reactor for further understanding the effects of nh2oh addition and influent nh4 n concentration on the canon performance the microbial communities in biofilm under different nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration were measured by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing the top10 abundant phyla in each sample were selected and their relative abundances are presented in table 4 at the phylum level proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi were the main functional bacteria in the reactor under different performance which accounted for more than 80 of the total microbial community and were also normally found in autotrophic nitrogen removal process 44 45 the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria decreased from 31 65 the 9th day after stopping addition of 5 mg l nh2oh to 26 16 the 9th day after stopping addition of 10 mg l nh2oh in phase ii further decreased to 20 11 in stable operation with high influent nh4 n concentration in phase iii on the contrary the relative abundance of phylum planctomycetes mainly composed of aaob was increased from 23 74 to 31 32 then decreased slightly to 30 43 which suggested the strength of the anammox process with the increase of nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration 12 the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are essential in forming granules or biofilm 49 as shown in fig 3 the dominant genera of aaob are candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia the dominant genus of aob is nitrosomonas and the dominant genus of nob is nitrospira the total relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia increased from 6 11 to 12 7 and the abundance of nitrosomonas increased slightly from 2 96 to 3 62 in restoration stages after stopping dosage of nh2oh increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l it was indicated that the addition of nh2oh can stimulate aaob activity which is consistent with the results of previous batch tests that nh2oh could boost aaob activity in a biofilm 17 however the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased slightly from 1 77 to 1 45 it was indicated that various inhibited impact of 5 mg l nh2oh and 10 mg l on nob produced at high influent nh4 n concentration the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and nitrosomonas was 7 58 and 4 25 which was higher than that of low influent nh4 n concentration the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased slightly and the relative abundance of nitrospira dropped to 0 78 which indicated that nob was inhibited stronger due to double effects of fa and nh2oh under high influent nh4 n concentration these results were consistent with the nitrogen removal performance under different stages of nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration indicating the nitrogen removal performance was influenced by the functional bacteria in the biofilm the co operation of aob and aaob and effectively inhibited nob are very important for stable operation of canon process 44 50 4 conclusions this study firstly investigated the effects of duration and dosage of nh2oh and ammonia concentration on the recovery of nitrogen removal performance of canon process the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio reduced to 0 11 around immediately after addition of nh2oh however the inhibition of nob by nh2oh was reversible and the nob activity recovered more obviously after nh2oh was not existed in the reactor compared with the increase of nh2oh level from 5 mg l to 10 mg l and even the tn removal efficiency increased by 2 37 when the nh2oh introduced into reactor extended from 7 days to 17 days while the recovery of nob activities was similar the nitrogen removal performance was more stable under high influent ammonia level due to nob was double inhibited by nh2oh and fa the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia increased from 3 39 to 7 14 and 2 72 to 5 56 in restoration stages respectively when the dosage of nh2oh increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the abundance of nitrospira under the condition of high influent ammonia concentration was 0 78 much lower than that of low level of influent ammonia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

into three main phases the start up of canon process phase i not shown in this paper the effects of dosage and duration of nh2oh on restoration of canon process in situ under low phase ii and high phase iii influent ammonia concentration further phase ii and iii were divided into seven and eight stages respectively tables 3 and 4 the nh2oh was prepared from nh2oh hcl 2 2 wastewater and seed

test process the batch tests were carried out in the reactor directly before aaob activity tests the reactor was pumped with n2 99 99 for 10 min to eliminate the do before substrate addition then the reactor was immediately sealed using the plastic wrap to avoid the introduction of do the test conditions for the determination of the activities of different functional bacteria were shown in table

were collected for dna extraction which covered the two phases of canon process operation i e two samples were taken on the 9th day after adding 5 mg l and 10 mg l nh2oh in phase ii respectively and the third sample were taken on the stable operation in phase iii the three samples were numbered as 1 2 and 3 dna was extracted from the sludge samples using a dna extraction kit and was then visualized using age agarose gel electrophoresis the qualified dna was sequenced using a miseq sequencing platform illumina inc san diego ca usa by the sangon company and the obtained sequences were compared with similar sequences of reference organisms using a blast search 2 6 analytical methods the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n vss and tss were measured according to standard methods 27 the total nitrogen tn was defined as the sum of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n the do concentrations and ph values in the reactor were determined with a portable do analyzer hq30d hach usa and a ph meter phs 10 fangzhou china respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of nh2oh on the stability of canon process at low ammonia phase ii after the canon process was successfully start up under high nh4 n 200 mg l level phase i the influent nh4 n concentration was gradually reduced to 50 mg n l the nitrogen removal performance of the reactor began to decrease and then the effects of nh2oh dosage and duration on the canon system under low ammonia conditions were studied phase ii this phase was divided into seven stages a g and the operating parameters of the reactor in each stage are presented in table 1 the influent nh4 n concentration was gradually lowered from 200 mg l to 50 mg l after successful set up of canon process in sbbr phase i not shown in this paper the hrt was maintained at 12 h the same as phase i while the do was reduced from 0 6 mg l to 0 2 mg l resulted in 21 93 mg l of nh4 n in the effluent on the first day of stage a day 1 30 fig 1a although nh4 n in the effluent continuously decreased to 10 52 mg l on the 11st day due to the adaptation of aob to new environment the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio fig 1c was still between 0 16 and 0 20 higher than 0 11 the theoretical value indicating that nob existed in the reactor and the activities of which were partially inhibited by low do however the effluent nh4 n concentration increased to 15 59 mg l due to the breakdown of rotameter on the 13th day and then maintain more than 10 mg l during the following days to restore the activities of aob the hrt was adjusted to 16 h along with extension of aeration time from 330 min to 420 min on the 19th day and effluent nh4 n level decreased immediately to 0 11 mg l on the day of 38th but the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio increased from 0 18 to 0 36 from the19rd day to the 30th day indicating that the activities of nob were stimulated by the prolonged aeration time the nitrogen removal performance of the sbbr was deteriorated the ammonia and tn removal efficiency were 62 and 43 on the 30th day respectively in stage b day 31 37 and stage d day 49 65 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor once a day to inhibit the activity of nob for 7 days and 17 days respectively further in stage f day 76 82 10 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor at the same frequency after introduction of nh2oh the ammonia and tn removal efficiency all elevated significantly under the different application time and dosage of nh2oh and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio decreased quickly even lower than the theoretical value 28 indicating that nob activity was effectively inhibited by nh2oh in the reactor in stage c day 38 48 stage e day66 to 75 and stage g day 83 96 the reactor operated without assisting of nh2oh for 11 days 10 days and 14 days respectively it was found that the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio in stages of c e and g all improved and higher than 0 11 even the tn removal efficiency was no more than 80 due to the accumulation of nitrate it was indicated that the inhibition of nob by nh2oh was reversible which was similar with the results obtained by other authors 16 29 30 compared with stage d nh4 n concentration in the effluent of stage g is obviously lower which suggested that the oxidation activity of aob elevated with the enhancement of nh2oh dosage while the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio increased to 0 32 on the last day of stage g and which was higher than 0 18 on the last day of stage d suggesting that the nob activity recovered more after stopping nh2oh addition with the increase of nh2oh dosage in comparison with addition of 5 mg l nh2oh for 7 days the tn removal efficiency increased by 2 37 when 5 mg l nh2oh was added to reactor for 17 days while the recovery of nob activity was similar the major difference between this study and the most studies is that the present pn a process inoculated with activated sludge in which the recovery of nob activity can be overcome with srt 8 or real time aeration control 30 huang reported that the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio in biofilm reactor increased gradually after nh2oh addition was ceased within 20 days due to robustness of nob activity and then the nitrogen removal performance recovered by decreasing aeration rate 29 therefore nh2oh addition must combined the other controlling strategy such as short srt low do real time aeration control is favorable for inhibition of nob activity 3 2 effect of nh2oh on the stability of canon process under high ammonia concentration phase iii phase iii was divided into eight stages a h for 71 days according to operational conditions of sbbr the influent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 200 mg l do concentration in aerobic time was maintained at 0 4 mg l and the other operating parameters of the reactor at each stage in phase iii are shown in table 2 in phase iii influent nh4 n concentration increased from 50 mg l to 200 mg l at the beginning of stage a days 1 14 sodium nitrite was added to the reactor at the beginning of stage d days 32 43 resulting in 133 mg l of no2 n in the reactor and the temperature of reactor decreased from 30 c to 21 c abruptly on the 56th day the nitrogen removal performance was affected by these shocks significantly and then 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor at the stages of b d and g to recover the nitrogen removal performance of the sbbr 3 2 1 nitrogen removal performance of sbbr during stable operation as shown in fig 2 the effluent nh4 n concentration was very high at the beginning of sage a days 1 14 due to the limited activities of aob which was not match the high nh4 n condition although the aeration time was prolonged on the 7th day the nh4 n and tn removal efficiency were only 55 and 45 respectively and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio was 0 17 higher than 0 11 and then 5 mg l nh2oh was added to the reactor to inhibit nob activity once a day in stage b days 15 22 for 7 days the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio decreased to lower than 0 11 immediately indicating the activities of nob was inhibited completely in stage c days 23 31 the effluent nh4 n concentration decreased from 44 01 mg l to 14 46 mg l due to the aeration time was lengthened to 420 min and hrt was adjusted to 16 h further the nh4 n and tn removal efficiency continuously increased to 92 57 and 80 98 respectively after stopping nh2oh addition in stage c and the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio maintained between 0 12 and 0 14 it was found that the nitrogen removal performance after stopping nh2oh addition was more stable in phase iii than that of phase ii with the reason maybe that nob activity was double inhibited by nh2oh and fa under high influent nh4 n concentration in the past decades it is generally believed that the presence of fa can inhibit the activity or metabolism of aob and nob in addition nob is more sensitive to fa in the nitrification process which provides an effective method to realize partial nitrification by using high ammonia level 31 anthonisen 32 reported that the inhibited level of fa to nob and aob were 0 1 1 0 mg l and 10 150 mg l respectively the concentration of fa in present reactor at the beginning of sbbr cycle was 6 17 mg l and 24 7 mg l respectively under 50 mg l and 200 mg l influent nh4 n although the fa concentration decreased with time in sbbr due to conversation of ammonia fa is conducive to inhibit nob under high influent nh4 n concentration chen selectively inhibited the nob through the concentration of fa in a zeolite sequence batch reactor 33 3 2 2 influence of high concentration nitrite shock on the stability of the reactor at the beginning of stage d days 32 43 when sodium nitrite was added into the reactor with the no2 n level of 132 mg l the effluent nh4 n concentration increased to 100 29 mg l and the effluent no2 n and no3 n concentration decreased to 0 72 mg l and 9 87 mg l respectively indicating the activity of functional flora was seriously affected fig 2a a large number of studies have proved that nitrite is not only an essential substrate for the growth of aaob but also a crucial inhibitor of aaob activity 34 36 the inhibition of nitrite in the anammox reaction has been reported to be one reason for the decrease in the efficiency of nitrogen removal 37 it was reported that aaob can tolerate a wide range of nitrite concentrations during short term exposure time associated nitrogen removal efficiency and bacterial activity were largely impacted by nitrite 38 40 in the subsequent recovery process stage e 5 mg l nh2oh was added into the sbbr it was demonstrated that the activity of aaob effectively promoted while the activity of nob was inhibited and the reactor gradually returned to its previous state when the addition of nh2oh was stopped the ammonia and tn removal efficiency decreased slightly indicating that more time was needed to restore the system which also proved that high concentration of nitrite has a strong inhibitory effect on aaob activity therefore in the actual operation process care should be taken to avoid the impact of high concentrations of nitrite on the canon process 3 2 3 influence of temperature shock on the stability of the reactor temperature was one important factor in biological wastewater treatment because it affects the metabolic activity and species relative abundances in microbial populations the optimum temperature in most current anammox reactors has been reported as being in the range of 30 40 c 41 it has also been noted that incidental temperature shocks may occur anyway due to either the failure of ph control systems or by accident 42 when a sudden decrease in temperature happens cells may suffer from cold shock and even cause damage to cellular structure and function thus promoting the proliferation of undesirable nob and reducing the activity of aaob in canon process 43 45 this experiment investigated the feasibility of restoring the nitrogen removal performance of canon process after temperature shock by assist of nh2oh dosing in case of device failure as shown in table 3 on the day of temperature dropped to 21 c suddenly the aaob activity and the aob activity decreased by 18 93 and 11 56 compared with that of 30 c respectively on the first day after the temperature returned to normal the tn removal efficiency of the reactor continued to drop to 40 86 the aaob and aob activity dropped by 51 19 and 46 67 respectively there was no accumulation of nitrite during the reaction process which was the same as investigation by zhang et al 46 in which study the temperature dropped at a rate of 1 c day from 30 c to 20 c and then to 15 c however fu et al 47 reported that when the temperature dropped sharply to 21 c the aaob activity decreased by 59 24 on the detected day the aob activity only decreased by 8 01 and the nitrite in the reactor was seriously accumulated different nitrogen removal performances produced may be due to the disparate impacts of temperature shock on functional bacteria activity 3 3 effect of nh2oh on the microbial community in canon reactor for further understanding the effects of nh2oh addition and influent nh4 n concentration on the canon performance the microbial communities in biofilm under different nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration were measured by 16s rrna high throughput sequencing the top10 abundant phyla in each sample were selected and their relative abundances are presented in table 4 at the phylum level proteobacteria planctomycetes bacteroidetes patescibacteria and chloroflexi were the main functional bacteria in the reactor under different performance which accounted for more than 80 of the total microbial community and were also normally found in autotrophic nitrogen removal process 44 45 the relative abundance of phylum proteobacteria decreased from 31 65 the 9th day after stopping addition of 5 mg l nh2oh to 26 16 the 9th day after stopping addition of 10 mg l nh2oh in phase ii further decreased to 20 11 in stable operation with high influent nh4 n concentration in phase iii on the contrary the relative abundance of phylum planctomycetes mainly composed of aaob was increased from 23 74 to 31 32 then decreased slightly to 30 43 which suggested the strength of the anammox process with the increase of nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration 12 the bacteroidetes and chloroflexi are essential in forming granules or biofilm 49 as shown in fig 3 the dominant genera of aaob are candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia the dominant genus of aob is nitrosomonas and the dominant genus of nob is nitrospira the total relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia increased from 6 11 to 12 7 and the abundance of nitrosomonas increased slightly from 2 96 to 3 62 in restoration stages after stopping dosage of nh2oh increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l it was indicated that the addition of nh2oh can stimulate aaob activity which is consistent with the results of previous batch tests that nh2oh could boost aaob activity in a biofilm 17 however the relative abundance of nitrospira decreased slightly from 1 77 to 1 45 it was indicated that various inhibited impact of 5 mg l nh2oh and 10 mg l on nob produced at high influent nh4 n concentration the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and nitrosomonas was 7 58 and 4 25 which was higher than that of low influent nh4 n concentration the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia decreased slightly and the relative abundance of nitrospira dropped to 0 78 which indicated that nob was inhibited stronger due to double effects of fa and nh2oh under high influent nh4 n concentration these results were consistent with the nitrogen removal performance under different stages of nh2oh dosage and influent nh4 n concentration indicating the nitrogen removal performance was influenced by the functional bacteria in the biofilm the co operation of aob and aaob and effectively inhibited nob are very important for stable operation of canon process 44 50 4 conclusions this study firstly investigated the effects of duration and dosage of nh2oh and ammonia concentration on the recovery of nitrogen removal performance of canon process the no3 nproduced nh4 nconsumed ratio reduced to 0 11 around immediately after addition of nh2oh however the inhibition of nob by nh2oh was reversible and the nob activity recovered more obviously after nh2oh was not existed in the reactor compared with the increase of nh2oh level from 5 mg l to 10 mg l and even the tn removal efficiency increased by 2 37 when the nh2oh introduced into reactor extended from 7 days to 17 days while the recovery of nob activities was similar the nitrogen removal performance was more stable under high influent ammonia level due to nob was double inhibited by nh2oh and fa the relative abundance of candidatus jettenia and candidatus brocadia increased from 3 39 to 7 14 and 2 72 to 5 56 in restoration stages respectively when the dosage of nh2oh increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the abundance of nitrospira under the condition of high influent ammonia concentration was 0 78 much lower than that of low level of influent ammonia declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china nsfc no 51408041 
12908,phosphorus p from bio p sludge can precipitate uncontrolled in the sludge treatment line and decrease the potential for phosphorus recovery the presence of an anaerobic unit or equivalent before the pre dewatering stage could favor the early release of phosphorus and minimize uncontrolled struvite precipitation in the anaerobic digestion ad and post digestion processes in this study a series of batch experiments in a phosphorus stripping unit p stripping unit were conducted to investigate the phosphorus release rate and efficiency of phosphorus being stripped when a bio p sludge was exposed to different amounts of carbon and different temperatures 20 c and between 11 and 13 c the results indicated that with a dose between 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 20 c and between 15 000 25 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 11 13 c can be released 40 65 and 30 38 luxury phosphorus respectively calculations showed that 80 percent of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit 468 kg d 1 was following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility a hybrid mathematical model was developed using the data obtained from the batch kinetic experiments to explain the phosphorus release kinetics in the stripping unit a good fit between the experiment and model predicted data demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the phosphorus release under varying initial conditions mass balance calculations on p and nitrogen n for the sludge pre and post dewatering side streams showed that struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit implementing a p stripping unit would minimize the precipitation in the ad enhance p recovery and reduce the phosphorus content of ebpr

sludge po4 p soluble orthophosphates vss volatile suspended solids 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all organisms as a vital cell component phosphorus cannot be replaced by any other element 1 agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock which is a non renewable resource increasing the life expectancy of phosphorus resources in the world lies in recycling by recovery from municipal and other waste products 2 other drivers to recover phosphorus comes from the fact that the discharge of p from wastewater treatment plants wwtps continues to cause severe eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and the majority of p consumed through food ends up in urban sewage 3 among the different methods developed the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process appears as a feasible technology to remove about 90 of influent phosphorus in wwtp 4 5 in an ebpr activated sludge system the amount of p incorporated in the sludge mass increases from the normal value of 0 02 mg p mg volatile suspended solids vss 1 to values around 0 06 0 15 mg p mg vss 1 0 05 0 10 mg p mgts 1 6 hence ebpr biosolids have higher phosphorus content than those generated from other activated sludge systems and there is a growing concern for its direct land application since the phosphorus concentration is too high for sustainable agriculture use 7 8 an additional concern with the ebpr process application is the unwanted precipitation of phosphorus as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o in the sludge treatment lines 9 such as in the anaerobic digestion ad and post digestion processes in ad phosphorus is supplied by released orthophosphate po4 3 from the sludge solids and organic solid degradation 10 11 ammonia nh4 comes from the degradation of nitrogenous material and magnesium mg2 originates from the degradation of organic material and poly p hydrolysis 12 struvite precipitation occurs when the combined concentrations of mg2 nh4 and po4 3 exceed the struvite solubility product struvite solubility is a function of the ph as ph increases struvite solubility decreases the ad processes show a higher ph than the previous stages of the wastewater treatment and are more susceptible to struvite formation 13 consequently to enhance the subsequent p recovery it is necessary to minimize this unintentional in reactor precipitation 14 the recovery of p from ebpr waste activated sludge was is now expected to include two steps phosphate release solubilization from sludge and subsequent precipitation crystallization of valuable phosphate products 3 15 attractive ways to release solubilize p and enhance resource recovery from was are the implementation of alkaline methods 16 17 or acid methods such as ad of was at low ph 18 however the studies on the effects of ph on p release from was are not consistent 19 and the effectiveness of treatments can vary significantly between sludge samples especially in alkaline treatments 3 on the other hand operational strategies based on handling the sludges produced in wwtp primary and ebpr sludge have been reported as alternative methods to release phosphorus early in the sludge treatment line marti et al 4 reported that if pre fermented primary sludge pfps and ebpr sludge are mixed in a gravity thickener and a high flow rate washing stream is implemented the phosphorus precipitation in the digester can be reduced and the p recovery can be enhanced the reason for this is the presence of high content of volatile fatty acids vfa in the pfps which promotes the release of phosphorus under an anaerobic environment 7 korving et al 20 reported that the phosphorus recovery could be increased from 10 to 17 of the influent phosphate load in full scale installations for struvite crystallization in digested sludge when phosphate is stripped from activated sludge before digestion for instance via wasstrip process 21 it is thus clear that the early release of phosphorus in the sludge treatment line is advantageous however more knowledge is needed to optimize this strategy to any type of bio p sludge ebpr sludge with a variable amount of p incorporated in the sludge mass different temperatures and when carbon sources are dosed in a p stripping unit or equivalent this research aims to generate a deeper understanding of the most critical parameters affecting the p release in a p stripping unit to enhance nutrient recovery in bio p plants in room and cold temperatures the parameters investigated were the phosphorus accumulated in the sludge mg p mg ts 1 the hydraulic retention time the temperature 18 20 c and 11 13 c the type of carbon source acetate and fermented primary sludge supernatant fpss the type of dose multiple dose or one time dose and the release of ions such as magnesium and potassium a quantitative assessment of the experimental data was conducted and a mathematical model was developed to estimate the amount of phosphorus released in the p stripping process under varying initial conditions finally a comparison of mass balance calculations of a case study indicating the potential p recovery with and without a p stripping unit in the sludge line is presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of was and was incubator the raw sludge used in the present study was ebpr was and was obtained from ivar central wwtp north jæren snj stavanger norway the

po4 p soluble cod acetate with a ratio of 0 14 were fed simultaneously in the filling phase fig 1a 2 2 experimental design of p stripping experiments batch experiments were performed to investigate the phosphate release rate and the efficiency of phosphorus stripping when the ebpr was was exposed to different carbon sources such as acetate and fpss and at different temperatures 20 c room

table 1 the experiments were carried out in a p stripping anaerobic unit with a working volume of 1 6 l fig 1b the reactor had a cylinder shape and a lid containing small holes for sample extraction a motor with blades sets at 60 rpm was placed at the top to provide complete mixing and avoid dead zones settled sludge collected at the end of the aerobic cycle of the sbr was used for each experiment immediately after collection the sludge was characterized for ts vs tp po4 p and scod the phosphorus accumulated in the sludge was determined in all batch experiments table 1 each experiment lasted between 2 and 5 h depending on the type of experiment two different carbon dosing regimens were implemented 1 multiple additions and 2 one off addition in multiple additions the same quantity of scod

2 4 1 model structure mechanistic models explaining the anaerobic release of phosphorus in an activated sludge process are available in the literature 23 however the relatively low number of variables measured in the experiments tp po4 p scod ts vs mg2 compared to the number of variables 19 state variables in the asm2d pose a significant challenge in fitting the data obtained from the p stripping experiments conducted in this work black box models such as ann plsr ensemble tree etc have also been used to explain phosphorus release in activated sludge 24 however these models do not maintain stoichiometric experimentally validated ratios 25 hybrid models combining kinetic equations obtained from asm2d model with data regression techniques provide reasonable data fit while maintaining a significant level of model interpretability a simplified model was created by extracting the equations pertaining to the predominant processes in a p stripping unit the model considers 5 state variables soluble cod s f readily uptake carbon source s a polyhydroxyalkanoates x pha polyphosphates x pp and soluble ortho phosphates s po with 3 different processes a schematic of these processes occurring in a p stripping reactor is presented in fig 1 a brief description of the three processes is provided below a μ 1 s f and s a which is consumed by the biomass b μ 2 uptake of s a source to store polyhydroxyalkanoates x pha in the biomass c μ 3 release of soluble ortho phosphates s po by consuming stored polyphosphates x pp in the biomass mineral precipitation reactions 26 can also occur in the biological phosphorus removal process however results presented in barat et al 27 show that calcium precipitation is almost negligible in the anaerobic conditions compared to the aerobic stages due to a ph drop often caused by p release moreover with the operating conditions ph 7 2 and initial ca2 51 86 mgl 1 alkalinity 200 mg l 1 as caco3 during the kinetic experiments no decrease in calcium concentration was observed and the precipitation of po₄3 ions was unlikely see section 3 6 therefore the physico chemical processes describing the precipitation of p in the presence of ca2 mg2 or k ions are assumed to be insignificant compared to the release of p through the biological pathway and can be ignored in the model the kinetic equations pertaining to the processes μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are obtained from the asm2s model described in 23 these biological transformations follow a monod s kinetic form for both the growth of biomass as well as the consumption of the substrate the exhaustive model form presented in 23 is further reduced to limit the number of parameters to be estimated in the model calibration stage the following assumptions that are in line with the model reduction principles adapted in 28 were made to simplify the model and reduce the number of model parameters a the growth and death kinetics of biomass are slower compared to that of substrates

algorithm and obtain the optimization parameters the python script used in model calibration can be provided on request 2 5 simulation of case study the ivar snj wwtp was selected to visualize the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows in the sludge treatment line with and without the implementation of a p stripping unit considering the experimental data and the mathematical model estimations for the calculations it was considered that the snj served a population of 411 000 p e for 2035 and had the design infrastructure presented in table 2 the existing wastewater treatment processes at the plant include a fine mesh sieve primary treatment ebpr activated sludge anaerobic and aerobic basins and sedimentation the sludge treatment line includes pre dewatering anaerobic digestion and post dewatering a modified wastewater sludge line including a p stripping unit before pre dewatering was proposed a mass balance approach using microsoft excel was performed to estimate the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows the input data required for the mass balance model in the sludge treatment line included a waste biological sludge flow rate of 1764 m3 d 1 biological sludge production of 17 639 kg ts d 1 tp of 917 kg d 1 and solid concentration of 1 the total nitrogen was calculated assuming that the cell in nitrogen is 0 1 gn gvs 1 31 and the vs was assumed as 70 of ts for the pre dewatering unit it was considered that the facility concentrates the biological sludge to 5 solids content the available phosphorus in the digester consists of the dissolved p concentration in the influent stream and the p released during the anaerobic digestion process due to poly p hydrolysis and organic solid degradation 13 during anaerobic digestion it was assumed that 80 of the phosphorus stored as poly p luxury p and 80 of the organic solid degradation were released however other studies had reported a release of phosphorus between 60 and 100 during anaerobic digestion 10 11 the mass balances considered that 40 of the available soluble phosphorus in the ad was precipitated as struvite the same as reported 13 the post dewatering facility concentrates the digested sludge to 35 solids content the volume of the p stripping unit was computed based on the needed hrt to strip the maximum of the luxury p available 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus released carbon uptake ratios with acetate as carbon source the ratio between phosphate release and carbon uptake prel acuptake 1 is a typical parameter of biological phosphorus removal process used as a good indicator of metabolism involved in the acetic acid uptake under anaerobic conditions 32 in this study the results of p stripping experiments indicated a strong correlation pearson correlation r2 0 83 between p release and carbon consumed for all batch experiments tested fig 2a the anaerobic p released carbon uptake 1 ratio obtained in each experiment was plotted as a function of the amount of phosphorus accumulated in the sludge on a ts concentration basis expressed as the mg p mg ts 1 ratio fig 2b shows that this relationship had a strong correlation pearson correlation r2 0 80 the same as reported by van loosdrecht et al 33 the results indicated that when the phosphorus content in the sludge was between 0 047 and 0 077 mg p mg ts 1 the p released carbon uptake 1 ratio had an average value of 0 45 0 03 mg p mg cod acetate 1 0 47 0 03 mol p mol c 1 fig 2b this ratio is in the range of the reported stoichiometric ratios for phosphorus and carbon transformations 0 35 0 66 mol p mol c 1 during the anaerobic cycles of ebpr with acetate as a carbon source 34 however there is a strong variability of this ratio in the literature ranging from values as low as 0 025 to even 0 75 p mol c mol 1 or higher 32 strong variability in the p release carbon uptake 1 ratio could be due to ph variations the ratio between p cod 1 in raw wastewater and the ratio between pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao bacteria present in the sludge 32 35 36 in addition the carbon source the poly p content of paos and the specific clade of paos enriched in the study have been shown to affect the p released c uptake 1 ratio 33 in this study it was found a consistency in this ratio which indicates that the bio p sludge releases the same phosphorus and consumes the same carbon when the phosphorus content in the sludge is in the range of 0 047 0 077 mg p mg ts 1 see fig 2b loosdrecht et al 33 based on literature data indicated that an activated sludge system will have a satisfactory ebpr activity when the anaerobic p released c uptake 1 and sludge mg p mg ts 1 ratios are around or higher than 0 50 mol p mol c 1and 0 10 mg p mg ts 1 respectively in this research values close to 0 50 mol p mol c 1 were achieved in the range of 0 05 0 078 mg p mg ts 1 in the sludge fig 2 and satisfactory ebpr activity was achieved this is in agreement with a previously published work 32 reporting stoichiometric values of different ebpr systems between 0 43 and 0 57 mol p mol c 1 when the p in the sludge contains between 0 06 and 0 08 mg p mg ts 1 and acetate was used as a carbon source 3 2 phosphorus release rate since the release of phosphorus by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos under anaerobic conditions is accompanied by the uptake of vfa e g acetate understanding the influence of acetate on the release of phosphorus from the return activated sludge ras is relevant 37 in this study the specific phosphorus release rate was calculated at different initial scod concentrations fig 3 and table 1 as a general trend it was observed that the initial scod concentration did not influence the release rate in the first 30 min of the experiment 11 34 mg p g ts h 1 when the phosphorus content in the sludge was between 0 05 and 0 07 mg tp mg ts 1 salehi et al 37 reported a similar observation but the author did not report the phosphorus content in the sludge in this research it was observed that when the sludge contains sufficient phosphorus accumulated 0 05 0 07 mg p mg ts 1 the specific release rate can be affected by limited concentrations of initial scod e g 53 6 mg scod l 1 fig 3 and table 1 in addition the release rate can also be affected when the phosphorus content in the sludge is low 0 020 mg p mg ts 1 even if there is sufficient scod available e g 800 and 400 mg scodl 1 fig 3 the low phosphorus content may indicate low pao population in the sludge this is confirmed by the findings of he et al 38 who indicated that the specific release rate had a strong linear and positive correlation with the percentage of poly p content in the sludge confirming that the p release rate is positively related to pao relative abundance 3 3 phosphorus released as a function of the ratio of scod dosed p accumulated in the sludge at room and cold 3 3 1 room temperature the p release has been reported as a function of the ratio of carbon dosed as vfa per volatile suspended solids mg vfa mg vss 1 in a pilot test with bio p sludge 39 40 in this research it was considered relevant to study the p release as a function of the carbon dosed per phosphorus content in the sludge fig 4a and b show the percentage of p released with respect to total p and luxury p excess phosphorus accumulated by paos for each experiment tested as a function of the ratio of scod dosed per p accumulated in the sludge expressed as mg scod dosed mg p mg ts 1 1 the results indicated a linear increase in the p released up to 10 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 fig 4a the maximum p released with respect to total p and luxury p was found between ratios of 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 and was 30 46 and 40 65 respectively for multiple dose and one off addition regimens fig 4a and b when this ratio exceeded 20 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 and the p in the sludge was higher than 0 05 mg p mg ts 1 only 24 of tp fig 4a and table 1 and 30 of luxury p point p2 fig 4b and table 1 were released at lower ratios 0 020 mg p mg ts 1 points named as p1 p3 and p4 fig 4a and table 1 a release of 60 70 of luxury p was observed but the potential of p recovery is low the reason for this is the low p content in the sludge see table 1 therefore based on these results it is possible to conclude that it does not represent any benefit applying ratios greater than 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 when the p in the sludge is 0 05 mg p mg ts 1 this knowledge can be considered when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge treatment line at room temperature conditions 3 3 2 cold temperature the fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge can be a sustainable strategy to produce fpss with high vfa content such as acetic acid 41 and propionic acid which are suitable carbon sources for ebpr 42 this research found that the fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge at four days hydraulic retention time hrt and 2 ts produces an fpss with around 30 and 50 acetate and propionic acids respectively data not shown therefore a set of p release experiments in cold conditions was performed using the produced fpss as a primary carbon source and acetate as a reference figs 5a and b the results indicated that approximately 20 25 and 30 38 of the total and luxury phosphorus in the sludge respectively was released at a ratio of 15 000 25 000 mg scod dosed mg tp mg ts in the sludge 1 1 this percentage of p released in cold conditions was lower than in room temperature experiments fig 4 however the same finding was reported by brdjanovic et al 43 who indicated that low temperatures correlate to a slower rate of kinetic activity of bio p bacteria and therefore a decline in the p release and uptake rates compared with acetate fpss turned out to be an excellent carbon source for p stripping experiments figs 5 a and b however to evaluate the utilization of fpss by the ebpr biomass a dose of fpps was first characterized and then its consumption during the p release was assessed figs 6 a c its composition was as follows mg l 1 128 vfa 37 acetic 66 propionic 3 isobutyric 14 butyric 5 isovaleric and 4 valeric acids and 28 non vfa this dose was added every hour during the p release experiment which lasted 6 h fig 5a shows the po4 p released the consumption of the different vfa and the consumption of the sum of vfa the results indicated that despite the availability of different vfa not all of them were consumed evenly fig 6 b and c after 120 min neither acetic nor propionic acids were consumed fig 6a it was interesting to see that the iso butyric acid was generated during the p release experiment instead of being consumed fig 6c of the total individual vfas dosed only 32 40 29 7 and 39 of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid isovaleric and valeric acid respectively were consumed fig 6c however of the total vfa dosed 513 mg l 1mg the ebpr biomass consumed only 37 and propionic acid was the most consumed vfa several studies have reported that propionate can best enhance the biological phosphorus removal bpr process in biological nutrient removal systems 41 44 this may be the reason for the preference of biomass for propionic acid calculations of the ratio mg p mg cod 1 indicated a ratio of 0 52 which is quite similar to the ratio found with acetate as a unique carbon source see fig 2a however in this case the scod was composed of vfa and non vfa these results indicate the versatility of the ebpr biomass to utilize the different carbon sources present in the fpss therefore fpss can be a suitable carbon source when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge line in winter conditions 3 4 correlation between phosphate release magnesium release and conductivity during p stripping magnesium and potassium play an essential role in the stability of the ebpr process these ions are co transported with phosphate into and out of bacterial cells to maintain electroneutrality inside the cell 45 different molar ratios mg 2 p 1 and k p 1 have been proposed in the literature previous studies have been reporting experimental values of 0 25 0 28 mg mg 2 mg p 1 0 3 0 32 mol mg mol p 1 46 47 and 0 35 g kg p 1 45 in the present work the p release and magnesium were recorded for all p stripping batch experiments at room temperature the results indicated a very strong correlation r2 0 96 between these two parameters fig 7a and was found a ratio of 0 20 0 05 mg mg 2 mg p 1 0 24 0 05 mol mg 2 mol p 1 which is slightly lower than the reported values on the other hand conductivity measurements can be used to monitor the processes in wastewater treatment that causes changes in conductivity the variation of conductivity in the wastewater can be caused by the variation of the ion content such as phosphate 48 barat et al 49 reported a clear correlation between the amount of p released and taken up and changes in the conductivity of an ebpr sbr process in this research the conductivity change during the p stripping kinetic experiments was also recorded the results indicated a strong correlation r 2 0 98 between po4 p release and changes in conductivity fig 7b which in turn had a strong correlation with mg release fig 7 a by following the conductivity variations it will be possible to know when the sludge has released the maximum phosphorus during the anaerobic phase which is shown by the end of the increase in conductivity 48 thus measuring the changes in conductivity from influent and effluent of the stripping unit can be an easy and cheap monitoring tool to predict the p released and magnesium during the process this indicates the potential use of conductivity as a tool when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge treatment line 3 5 model validation the experimental dataset was classified to separate sections a initial stages of the experiments when the mg p mg ts 1 ratio was 0 3 dataset 1 b conditions where the sludge was mature and the mg p mg ts 1 ratio was 0 45 dataset 2 and c conditions where multiple doses of soluble cod were added to the batch once every hour during the experiment dataset 3 each dataset was used separately to calibrate the model described in eqs 1 5 the corresponding stoichiometric and kinetic parameters corresponding to datasets 1 2 and 3 along with the root mean square error and r2 values are provided in table 3 fig 8 shows the variations in po4 p released both measured and model predicted for different batches separated by their dataset 1 fig 8a dataset 2 fig 8b and dataset 3 fig 8c during the batch tests a qualitative comparison between both lab measured and predicted values presented in fig 8 shows that the model predicted values of po4 p released follow similar trends as that of the values measured by standardized lab tests the regression plot showing lab measured versus model predicted values and residual plots are presented in fig 9 the data points in fig 9 are colour coded to identify the data pertaining to the corresponding dataset the r2 value of 0 917 and an even distribution of values in the residual plot indicate the ability of the mathematical model to predict the amount of prelease in the p stripping reaction 3 6 case study to guarantee p rich streams and thereby increase the efficiency of the nutrient recovery processes the sludge treatment line must be optimized in this research the ebpr ivar central wwtp north jæren snj stavanger norway was used as a case study the actual sludge treatment line of wwtp includes pre dewatering anaerobic digester and post dewatering fig 10 a modified sludge line was proposed including a p striping unit before the pre dewatering facility fig 11 mass balance calculations of the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows in the sludge treatment line without and with the presence of a p stripping unit were computed figs 10 and 11 respectively the calculations were projected for the year 2035 when the snj ivar will serve a population of 411 000 pe table 2 the input parameter used in the mass balance calculations were a biological sludge flow of 1764 m3 d 1 sludge concentration of 1 and the same initial conditions used in the mathematical model see below the mathematical model developed in the previous section was simulated with the initial conditions of ts 17639 kg d 1 10 000 mgl 1 tp of 520 mg l 1 po4 p of 20 mg l 1 and varying quantities of carbon dose the resulting percentage of p released predicted by the model for different amounts of carbon dose is presented in fig 12a from this figure it can be observed that increasing the dosage beyond 832 2 mg codl 1 16 640 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 does not increase the percentage release of luxury phosphorus corresponding to 69 8 of the total luxury p available the model predicted values of the percentage of luxury p released during the batch shows that the release of p stabilizes after 3 h and can therefore be considered as the optimal hrt value fig 12b to evaluate the efficiency of the p stripping process in the sludge treatment fig 11 it is necessary to evaluate the potential unwanted calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit calcium phosphate precipitation has been reported in biological phosphorus removal systems 27 49 50 however it is a very complex process involving various parameters such as calcium phosphate ions concentration ionic strength temperature ion types ph and time 27 51 the most stable phase of calcium phosphate is hydroxyapatite hap and the most common precursors for the hap formation are brushite dcpd cahpo4 2h2o octacalcium phosphate ocp ca4h po4 3 3h2o and amorphous calcium phosphate acp ca3 po4 2 xh2o 27 52 the evolution of different calcium phosphate forms is reported as a function of the ph e g at ph 7 4 and 26 c will follow acp ocp hap 53 in addition the time required for the total transformation of calcium phosphate in hap is also a function of the ph e g at ph 7 5 will take 255 min 51 in this research the potential calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit was evaluated calculations of the saturation index si at the experimental conditions at the end of the stripping period 12 c ph of 7 2 po4 p 16 7 160 mg l 1 ca2 51 86 mgl 1 and alkalinity 200 mg l 1 as caco3 indicated that some of the precursors of hap such as ca3 po4 2 am2 ca3 po4 2 beta ocp and dcpd were slightly supersaturated this could indicate potential calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit as hap which was the most strongly saturated however no calcium decrease was observed during the batch experiments tested 2 5 h therefore we can conclude that no calcium phosphate precipitation occurred during p stripping the same observation under anaerobic conditions was reported by barat et al 27 who showed no solid formation of calcium phosphate similar calculations for struvite showed that struvite was highly undersaturated and therefore not precipitate in the p stripping unit fig 11 shows that 80 of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit 468 kg d 1 is following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility this amount represents 43 of the total phosphorus in the sludge and 34 of all phosphate entering the plant if 7 mgl 1 tp is considered via the influent this p recovery is comparable to the highest phosphate recovery reported by korving et al 20 17 35 when the phosphorus is stripped from activated sludge before digestion the physicochemical characteristics of this pre dewatering sidestream are high soluble phosphorus concentration and low ammonium concentration fig 11 the p recovery in sidestreams with low ammonium concentration is suitable for calcium phosphate 54 or potassium struvite kmgpo4 6h2o as potential final products 55 during anaerobic digestion part of particulate phosphorus is hydrolyzed and converted to soluble phosphorus figs 10 and 11 ammonia is also generated in the digesters during the degradation of proteins 12 and the post digested sludges contain the major amount of soluble nitrogen ammonia in both configurations figs 10 and 11 the p release and precipitation are simultaneous processes during anaerobic digestion 13 the most relevant fixation mechanisms of phosphorus in the digester are the formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o which precipitates according to the released mg 2 counterions from polyphosphate hydrolysis 49 in this study based on the experimental ratio of 0 20 mg mg mg p 1 at least 20 of luxury p released from poly p hydrolysis can be precipitated with magnesium however organic matter degradation produces also a release of magnesium 4 and consequently the precipitation of soluble phosphorus in the digestion can be even more therefore it was assumed that 40 of the soluble p composed by the influent stream poly p hydrolysis and organic solid degradation present in ad was precipitated as struvite same as reported by marti et al 13 the calculations indicated that the struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit a comparison of both scenarios showed that the soluble p in the post anaerobic digestion sludge represents 40 and 23 of the tp content in the sludge for the existing and modified configurations respectively it was evident that the existing sludge configuration fig 10 contains more soluble phosphorus and magnesium in the post digested sludge than the modified configuration with the p stripping unit fig 11 therefore there is a higher risk of accumulation of struvite on ad itself pipe walls and equipment surfaces of ad and post digestion processes in the existing sludge line configuration this is a frequent problem reported in many wastewaters treatment plants around the world 12 13 the comparison of the concentrated rejects water of both sceneries indicated that there is a higher potential for p recovery with the p stripping configuration fig 11 than with the existing configuration fig 10 in addition it represents a good strategy for the sludge treatment to reduce struvite precipitation problems in the digesters land applied biosolids tend to have p n ratios higher than what is necessary for agricultural purposes however the reduction of p improves the quality of the biosolids by reducing the p n ratio and the amount of p lost to the environment in runoff 5 in this work the implementation of the p stripping unit also favours the reduction of phosphorus in the final cake it was found that only 17 of the tp in the sludge 917 kg d 1 was present in the modified fig 12 and 26 in the existing configuration fig 10 the results of the mass balances indicated that in a hrt of 3 h 70 of the total luxury p available in the sludge will be released when a p stripping unit is implemented fig 11 this short retention time represents an advantage since several batches of sludge per day can be treated in addition the required dimensions such as volume and area for the p stripping unit can be calculated based on the hrt and the known sludge flow based on the needed hrt of 3 h and the sludge flow of 1764 m3 d 1 the volume and area to build a p stripping unit were estimated to be 220 m3 and 11 8 m2 respectively the results of this work can contribute to generate and optimize p rich streams and enhance phosphorus recovery although the methodology of this work was implemented for activated sludge it can be also applied for bio p sludge coming from ebpr sbr or from hias mbbr process 56 4 conclusions in this work the ideal operating parameters to implement a p stripping unit or equivalent were identified the results indicated that with a dose between 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 20 c and between 15 000 25 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 11 13 c can be released 40 65 and 30 38 luxury phosphorus respectively simulation of the case study shows that 80 of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit is following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit therefore the implementation of a p stripping unit will enhance the potential for p recovery the mathematical model developed can adequately explain the p release and calculate the optimal values of cod dosage under varying initial sludge compositions the results of this work can be used as a tool to predict the theoretical p released for any sludge quality and carbon dose and to design and operate p stripping units the

12908,phosphorus p from bio p sludge can precipitate uncontrolled in the sludge treatment line and decrease the potential for phosphorus recovery the presence of an anaerobic unit or equivalent before the pre dewatering stage could favor the early release of phosphorus and minimize uncontrolled struvite precipitation in the anaerobic digestion ad and post digestion processes in this study a series of batch experiments in a phosphorus stripping unit p stripping unit were conducted to investigate the phosphorus release rate and efficiency of phosphorus being stripped when a bio p sludge was exposed to different amounts of carbon and different temperatures 20 c and between 11 and 13 c the results indicated that with a dose between 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 20 c and between 15 000 25 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 11 13 c can be released 40 65 and 30 38 luxury phosphorus respectively calculations showed that 80 percent of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit 468 kg d 1 was following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility a hybrid mathematical model was developed using the data obtained from the batch kinetic experiments to explain the phosphorus release kinetics in the stripping unit a good fit between the experiment and model predicted data demonstrates the ability of the model to predict the phosphorus release under varying initial conditions mass balance calculations on p and nitrogen n for the sludge pre and post dewatering side streams showed that struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit implementing a p stripping unit would minimize the precipitation in the ad enhance p recovery and reduce the phosphorus content of ebpr

sludge po4 p soluble orthophosphates vss volatile suspended solids 1 introduction phosphorus p is an essential element for all organisms as a vital cell component phosphorus cannot be replaced by any other element 1 agriculture is dependent on phosphorus derived from phosphate rock which is a non renewable resource increasing the life expectancy of phosphorus resources in the world lies in recycling by recovery from municipal and other waste products 2 other drivers to recover phosphorus comes from the fact that the discharge of p from wastewater treatment plants wwtps continues to cause severe eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and the majority of p consumed through food ends up in urban sewage 3 among the different methods developed the enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process appears as a feasible technology to remove about 90 of influent phosphorus in wwtp 4 5 in an ebpr activated sludge system the amount of p incorporated in the sludge mass increases from the normal value of 0 02 mg p mg volatile suspended solids vss 1 to values around 0 06 0 15 mg p mg vss 1 0 05 0 10 mg p mgts 1 6 hence ebpr biosolids have higher phosphorus content than those generated from other activated sludge systems and there is a growing concern for its direct land application since the phosphorus concentration is too high for sustainable agriculture use 7 8 an additional concern with the ebpr process application is the unwanted precipitation of phosphorus as struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o in the sludge treatment lines 9 such as in the anaerobic digestion ad and post digestion processes in ad phosphorus is supplied by released orthophosphate po4 3 from the sludge solids and organic solid degradation 10 11 ammonia nh4 comes from the degradation of nitrogenous material and magnesium mg2 originates from the degradation of organic material and poly p hydrolysis 12 struvite precipitation occurs when the combined concentrations of mg2 nh4 and po4 3 exceed the struvite solubility product struvite solubility is a function of the ph as ph increases struvite solubility decreases the ad processes show a higher ph than the previous stages of the wastewater treatment and are more susceptible to struvite formation 13 consequently to enhance the subsequent p recovery it is necessary to minimize this unintentional in reactor precipitation 14 the recovery of p from ebpr waste activated sludge was is now expected to include two steps phosphate release solubilization from sludge and subsequent precipitation crystallization of valuable phosphate products 3 15 attractive ways to release solubilize p and enhance resource recovery from was are the implementation of alkaline methods 16 17 or acid methods such as ad of was at low ph 18 however the studies on the effects of ph on p release from was are not consistent 19 and the effectiveness of treatments can vary significantly between sludge samples especially in alkaline treatments 3 on the other hand operational strategies based on handling the sludges produced in wwtp primary and ebpr sludge have been reported as alternative methods to release phosphorus early in the sludge treatment line marti et al 4 reported that if pre fermented primary sludge pfps and ebpr sludge are mixed in a gravity thickener and a high flow rate washing stream is implemented the phosphorus precipitation in the digester can be reduced and the p recovery can be enhanced the reason for this is the presence of high content of volatile fatty acids vfa in the pfps which promotes the release of phosphorus under an anaerobic environment 7 korving et al 20 reported that the phosphorus recovery could be increased from 10 to 17 of the influent phosphate load in full scale installations for struvite crystallization in digested sludge when phosphate is stripped from activated sludge before digestion for instance via wasstrip process 21 it is thus clear that the early release of phosphorus in the sludge treatment line is advantageous however more knowledge is needed to optimize this strategy to any type of bio p sludge ebpr sludge with a variable amount of p incorporated in the sludge mass different temperatures and when carbon sources are dosed in a p stripping unit or equivalent this research aims to generate a deeper understanding of the most critical parameters affecting the p release in a p stripping unit to enhance nutrient recovery in bio p plants in room and cold temperatures the parameters investigated were the phosphorus accumulated in the sludge mg p mg ts 1 the hydraulic retention time the temperature 18 20 c and 11 13 c the type of carbon source acetate and fermented primary sludge supernatant fpss the type of dose multiple dose or one time dose and the release of ions such as magnesium and potassium a quantitative assessment of the experimental data was conducted and a mathematical model was developed to estimate the amount of phosphorus released in the p stripping process under varying initial conditions finally a comparison of mass balance calculations of a case study indicating the potential p recovery with and without a p stripping unit in the sludge line is presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of was and was incubator the raw sludge used in the present study was ebpr was and was obtained from ivar central wwtp north jæren snj stavanger norway the

po4 p soluble cod acetate with a ratio of 0 14 were fed simultaneously in the filling phase fig 1a 2 2 experimental design of p stripping experiments batch experiments were performed to investigate the phosphate release rate and the efficiency of phosphorus stripping when the ebpr was was exposed to different carbon sources such as acetate and fpss and at different temperatures 20 c room

immediately after collection the sludge was characterized for ts vs tp po4 p and scod the phosphorus accumulated in the sludge was determined in all batch experiments table 1 each experiment lasted between 2 and 5 h depending on the type of experiment two different carbon dosing regimens were implemented 1 multiple additions and 2 one off addition in multiple additions the same quantity of scod was dosed every 1 or 2 h to the reactor for a period of 2 5 h whereas in a one off addition the reactor received all scod at the start of the experiment table 1 samples of sludge for analysis of scod

2 4 1 model structure mechanistic models explaining the anaerobic release of phosphorus in an activated sludge process are available in the literature 23 however the relatively low number of variables measured in the experiments tp po4 p scod ts vs mg2 compared to the number of variables 19 state variables in the asm2d pose a significant challenge in fitting the data obtained from the p stripping experiments conducted in this work black box models such as ann plsr ensemble tree etc have also been used to explain phosphorus release in activated sludge 24 however these models do not maintain stoichiometric experimentally validated ratios 25 hybrid models combining kinetic equations obtained from asm2d model with data regression techniques provide reasonable data fit while maintaining a significant level of model interpretability a simplified model was created by extracting the equations pertaining to the predominant processes in a p stripping unit the model considers 5 state variables soluble cod s f readily uptake carbon source s a polyhydroxyalkanoates x pha polyphosphates x pp and soluble ortho phosphates s po with 3 different processes a schematic of these processes occurring in a p stripping reactor is presented in fig 1 a brief description of the three processes is provided below a μ 1 s f and s a which is consumed by the biomass b μ 2 uptake of s a source to store polyhydroxyalkanoates x pha in the biomass c μ 3 release of soluble ortho phosphates s po by consuming stored polyphosphates x pp in the biomass mineral precipitation reactions 26 can also occur in the biological phosphorus removal process however results presented in barat et al 27 show that calcium precipitation is almost negligible in the anaerobic conditions compared to the aerobic stages due to a ph drop often caused by p release moreover with the operating conditions ph 7 2 and initial ca2 51 86 mgl 1 alkalinity 200 mg l 1 as caco3 during the kinetic experiments no decrease in calcium concentration was observed and the precipitation of po₄3 ions was unlikely see section 3 6 therefore the physico chemical processes describing the precipitation of p in the presence of ca2 mg2 or k ions are assumed to be insignificant compared to the release of p through the biological pathway and can be ignored in the model the kinetic equations pertaining to the processes μ 1 μ 2 and μ 3 are obtained from the asm2s model described in 23 these biological transformations follow a monod s kinetic form for both the growth of biomass as well as the consumption of the substrate the exhaustive model form presented in 23 is further reduced to limit the number of parameters to be estimated in the model calibration stage the following assumptions that are in line with the model reduction principles adapted in 28 were made to simplify the model and reduce the number of model parameters a the growth and death kinetics of biomass are slower compared to that of substrates therefore the dynamics of biomass concentrations are ignored b the effect of particulate hydrolysis reactions is insignificant in the process and has been ignored c the x pao is lumped with the rate

calibration the stoichiometric and the kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to the model equations presented in eqs 1 5 the parameter estimation method involving the minimization of a root mean square error rmse between the experimental data and model predicted data described in 29 was used the mathematical model and the optimization problem statement were implemented in python the minimize function available as a part of python s open source scipy library 30 was used to solve the constrained optimization problem sequential least squares programming algorithm and obtain the optimization parameters the python script used in model calibration can be provided on request 2 5 simulation of case study the ivar snj wwtp was selected to visualize the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows in the sludge treatment line with and without the implementation of a p stripping unit considering the experimental data and the mathematical model estimations for the calculations it was considered that the snj served a population of 411 000 p e for 2035 and had the design infrastructure presented in table 2 the existing wastewater treatment processes at the plant include a fine mesh sieve primary treatment ebpr activated sludge anaerobic and aerobic basins and sedimentation the sludge treatment line includes pre dewatering anaerobic digestion and post dewatering a modified wastewater sludge line including a p stripping unit before pre dewatering was proposed a mass balance approach using microsoft excel was performed to estimate the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows the input data required for the mass balance model in the sludge treatment line included a waste biological sludge flow rate of 1764 m3 d 1 biological sludge production of 17 639 kg ts d 1 tp of 917 kg d 1 and solid concentration of 1 the total nitrogen was calculated assuming that the cell in nitrogen is 0 1 gn gvs 1 31 and the vs was assumed as 70 of ts for the pre dewatering unit it was considered that the facility concentrates the biological sludge to 5 solids content the available phosphorus in the digester consists of the dissolved p concentration in the influent stream and the p released during the anaerobic digestion process due to poly p hydrolysis and organic solid degradation 13 during anaerobic digestion it was assumed that 80 of the phosphorus stored as poly p luxury p and 80 of the organic solid degradation were released however other studies had reported a release of phosphorus between 60 and 100 during anaerobic digestion 10 11 the mass balances considered that 40 of the available soluble phosphorus in the ad was precipitated as struvite the same as reported 13 the post dewatering facility concentrates the digested sludge to 35 solids content the volume of the p stripping unit was computed based on the needed hrt to strip the maximum of the luxury p available 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphorus released carbon uptake ratios with acetate as carbon source the ratio between phosphate release and carbon uptake prel acuptake 1 is a typical parameter of biological phosphorus removal process used as a good indicator of metabolism involved in the acetic acid uptake under anaerobic conditions 32 in this study the results of p stripping experiments indicated a strong correlation pearson correlation r2 0 83 between p release and carbon consumed for all batch experiments tested fig 2a the anaerobic p released carbon uptake 1 ratio obtained in each experiment was plotted as a function of the amount of phosphorus accumulated in the sludge on a ts concentration basis expressed as the mg p mg ts 1 ratio fig 2b shows that this relationship had a strong correlation pearson correlation r2 0 80 the same as reported by van loosdrecht et al 33 the results indicated that when the phosphorus content in the sludge was between 0 047 and 0 077 mg p mg ts 1 the p released carbon uptake 1 ratio had an average value of 0 45 0 03 mg p mg cod acetate 1 0 47 0 03 mol p mol c 1 fig 2b this ratio is in the range of the reported stoichiometric ratios for phosphorus and carbon transformations 0 35 0 66 mol p mol c 1 during the anaerobic cycles of ebpr with acetate as a carbon source 34 however there is a strong variability of this ratio in the literature ranging from values as low as 0 025 to even 0 75 p mol c mol 1 or higher 32 strong variability in the p release carbon uptake 1 ratio could be due to ph variations the ratio between p cod 1 in raw wastewater and the ratio between pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao bacteria present in the sludge 32 35 36 in addition the carbon source the poly p content of paos and the specific clade of paos enriched in the study have been shown to affect the p released c uptake 1 ratio 33 in this study it was found a consistency in this ratio which indicates that the bio p sludge releases the same phosphorus and consumes the same carbon when the phosphorus content in the sludge is in the range of 0 047 0 077 mg p mg ts 1 see fig 2b loosdrecht et al 33 based on literature data indicated that an activated sludge system will have a satisfactory ebpr activity when the anaerobic p released c uptake 1 and sludge mg p mg ts 1 ratios are around or higher than 0 50 mol p mol c 1and 0 10 mg p mg ts 1 respectively in this research values close to 0 50 mol p mol c 1 were achieved in the range of 0 05 0 078 mg p mg ts 1 in the sludge fig 2 and satisfactory ebpr activity was achieved this is in agreement with a previously published work 32 reporting stoichiometric values of different ebpr systems between 0 43 and 0 57 mol p mol c 1 when the p in the sludge contains between 0 06 and 0 08 mg p mg ts 1 and acetate was used as a carbon source 3 2 phosphorus release rate since the release of phosphorus by polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos under anaerobic conditions is accompanied by the uptake of vfa e g acetate understanding the influence of acetate on the release of phosphorus from the return activated sludge ras is relevant 37 in this study the specific phosphorus release rate was calculated at different initial scod concentrations fig 3 and table 1 as a general trend it was observed that the initial scod concentration did not influence the release rate in the first 30 min of the experiment 11 34 mg p g ts h 1 when the phosphorus content in the sludge was between 0 05 and 0 07 mg tp mg ts 1 salehi et al 37 reported a similar observation but the author did not report the phosphorus content in the sludge in this research it was observed that when the sludge contains sufficient phosphorus accumulated 0 05 0 07 mg p mg ts 1 the specific release rate can be affected by limited concentrations of initial scod e g 53 6 mg scod l 1 fig 3 and table 1 in addition the release rate can also be affected when the phosphorus content in the sludge is low 0 020 mg p mg ts 1 even if there is sufficient scod available e g 800 and 400 mg scodl 1 fig 3 the low phosphorus content may indicate low pao population in the sludge this is confirmed by the findings of he et al 38 who indicated that the specific release rate had a strong linear and positive correlation with the percentage of poly p content in the sludge confirming that the p release rate is positively related to pao relative abundance 3 3 phosphorus released as a function of the ratio of scod dosed p accumulated in the sludge at room and cold 3 3 1 room temperature the p release has been reported as a function of the ratio of carbon dosed as vfa per volatile suspended solids mg vfa mg vss 1 in a pilot test with bio p sludge 39 40 in this research it was considered relevant to study the p release as a function of the carbon dosed per phosphorus content in the sludge fig 4a and b show the percentage of p released with respect to total p and luxury p excess phosphorus accumulated by paos for each experiment tested as a function of the ratio of scod dosed per p accumulated in the sludge expressed as mg scod dosed mg p mg ts 1 1 the results indicated a linear increase in the p released up to 10 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 fig 4a the maximum p released with respect to total p and luxury p was found between ratios of 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 and was 30 46 and 40 65 respectively for multiple dose and one off addition regimens fig 4a and b when this ratio exceeded 20 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 and the p in the sludge was higher than 0 05 mg p mg ts 1 only 24 of tp fig 4a and table 1 and 30 of luxury p point p2 fig 4b and table 1 were released at lower ratios 0 020 mg p mg ts 1 points named as p1 p3 and p4 fig 4a and table 1 a release of 60 70 of luxury p was observed but the potential of p recovery is low the reason for this is the low p content in the sludge see table 1 therefore based on these results it is possible to conclude that it does not represent any benefit applying ratios greater than 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 when the p in the sludge is 0 05 mg p mg ts 1 this knowledge can be considered when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge treatment line at room temperature conditions 3 3 2 cold temperature the fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge can be a sustainable strategy to produce fpss with high vfa content such as acetic acid 41 and propionic acid which are suitable carbon sources for ebpr 42 this research found that the fermentation of cellulosic primary sludge at four days hydraulic retention time hrt and 2 ts produces an fpss with around 30 and 50 acetate and propionic acids respectively data not shown therefore a set of p release experiments in cold conditions was performed using the produced fpss as a primary carbon source and acetate as a reference figs 5a and b the results indicated that approximately 20 25 and 30 38 of the total and luxury phosphorus in the sludge respectively was released at a ratio of 15 000 25 000 mg scod dosed mg tp mg ts in the sludge 1 1 this percentage of p released in cold conditions was lower than in room temperature experiments fig 4 however the same finding was reported by brdjanovic et al 43 who indicated that low temperatures correlate to a slower rate of kinetic activity of bio p bacteria and therefore a decline in the p release and uptake rates compared with acetate fpss turned out to be an excellent carbon source for p stripping experiments figs 5 a and b however to evaluate the utilization of fpss by the ebpr biomass a dose of fpps was first characterized and then its consumption during the p release was assessed figs 6 a c its composition was as follows mg l 1 128 vfa 37 acetic 66 propionic 3 isobutyric 14 butyric 5 isovaleric and 4 valeric acids and 28 non vfa this dose was added every hour during the p release experiment which lasted 6 h fig 5a shows the po4 p released the consumption of the different vfa and the consumption of the sum of vfa the results indicated that despite the availability of different vfa not all of them were consumed evenly fig 6 b and c after 120 min neither acetic nor propionic acids were consumed fig 6a it was interesting to see that the iso butyric acid was generated during the p release experiment instead of being consumed fig 6c of the total individual vfas dosed only 32 40 29 7 and 39 of acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid isovaleric and valeric acid respectively were consumed fig 6c however of the total vfa dosed 513 mg l 1mg the ebpr biomass consumed only 37 and propionic acid was the most consumed vfa several studies have reported that propionate can best enhance the biological phosphorus removal bpr process in biological nutrient removal systems 41 44 this may be the reason for the preference of biomass for propionic acid calculations of the ratio mg p mg cod 1 indicated a ratio of 0 52 which is quite similar to the ratio found with acetate as a unique carbon source see fig 2a however in this case the scod was composed of vfa and non vfa these results indicate the versatility of the ebpr biomass to utilize the different carbon sources present in the fpss therefore fpss can be a suitable carbon source when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge line in winter conditions 3 4 correlation between phosphate release magnesium release and conductivity during p stripping magnesium and potassium play an essential role in the stability of the ebpr process these ions are co transported with phosphate into and out of bacterial cells to maintain electroneutrality inside the cell 45 different molar ratios mg 2 p 1 and k p 1 have been proposed in the literature previous studies have been reporting experimental values of 0 25 0 28 mg mg 2 mg p 1 0 3 0 32 mol mg mol p 1 46 47 and 0 35 g kg p 1 45 in the present work the p release and magnesium were recorded for all p stripping batch experiments at room temperature the results indicated a very strong correlation r2 0 96 between these two parameters fig 7a and was found a ratio of 0 20 0 05 mg mg 2 mg p 1 0 24 0 05 mol mg 2 mol p 1 which is slightly lower than the reported values on the other hand conductivity measurements can be used to monitor the processes in wastewater treatment that causes changes in conductivity the variation of conductivity in the wastewater can be caused by the variation of the ion content such as phosphate 48 barat et al 49 reported a clear correlation between the amount of p released and taken up and changes in the conductivity of an ebpr sbr process in this research the conductivity change during the p stripping kinetic experiments was also recorded the results indicated a strong correlation r 2 0 98 between po4 p release and changes in conductivity fig 7b which in turn had a strong correlation with mg release fig 7 a by following the conductivity variations it will be possible to know when the sludge has released the maximum phosphorus during the anaerobic phase which is shown by the end of the increase in conductivity 48 thus measuring the changes in conductivity from influent and effluent of the stripping unit can be an easy and cheap monitoring tool to predict the p released and magnesium during the process this indicates the potential use of conductivity as a tool when a p stripping unit is implemented in the sludge treatment line 3 5 model validation the experimental dataset was classified to separate sections a initial stages of the experiments when the mg p mg ts 1 ratio was 0 3 dataset 1 b conditions where the sludge was mature and the mg p mg ts 1 ratio was 0 45 dataset 2 and c conditions where multiple doses of soluble cod were added to the batch once every hour during the experiment dataset 3 each dataset was used separately to calibrate the model described in eqs 1 5 the corresponding stoichiometric and kinetic parameters corresponding to datasets 1 2 and 3 along with the root mean square error and r2 values are provided in table 3 fig 8 shows the variations in po4 p released both measured and model predicted for different batches separated by their dataset 1 fig 8a dataset 2 fig 8b and dataset 3 fig 8c during the batch tests a qualitative comparison between both lab measured and predicted values presented in fig 8 shows that the model predicted values of po4 p released follow similar trends as that of the values measured by standardized lab tests the regression plot showing lab measured versus model predicted values and residual plots are presented in fig 9 the data points in fig 9 are colour coded to identify the data pertaining to the corresponding dataset the r2 value of 0 917 and an even distribution of values in the residual plot indicate the ability of the mathematical model to predict the amount of prelease in the p stripping reaction 3 6 case study to guarantee p rich streams and thereby increase the efficiency of the nutrient recovery processes the sludge treatment line must be optimized in this research the ebpr ivar central wwtp north jæren snj stavanger norway was used as a case study the actual sludge treatment line of wwtp includes pre dewatering anaerobic digester and post dewatering fig 10 a modified sludge line was proposed including a p striping unit before the pre dewatering facility fig 11 mass balance calculations of the phosphorus and nitrogen mass flows in the sludge treatment line without and with the presence of a p stripping unit were computed figs 10 and 11 respectively the calculations were projected for the year 2035 when the snj ivar will serve a population of 411 000 pe table 2 the input parameter used in the mass balance calculations were a biological sludge flow of 1764 m3 d 1 sludge concentration of 1 and the same initial conditions used in the mathematical model see below the mathematical model developed in the previous section was simulated with the initial conditions of ts 17639 kg d 1 10 000 mgl 1 tp of 520 mg l 1 po4 p of 20 mg l 1 and varying quantities of carbon dose the resulting percentage of p released predicted by the model for different amounts of carbon dose is presented in fig 12a from this figure it can be observed that increasing the dosage beyond 832 2 mg codl 1 16 640 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 does not increase the percentage release of luxury phosphorus corresponding to 69 8 of the total luxury p available the model predicted values of the percentage of luxury p released during the batch shows that the release of p stabilizes after 3 h and can therefore be considered as the optimal hrt value fig 12b to evaluate the efficiency of the p stripping process in the sludge treatment fig 11 it is necessary to evaluate the potential unwanted calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit calcium phosphate precipitation has been reported in biological phosphorus removal systems 27 49 50 however it is a very complex process involving various parameters such as calcium phosphate ions concentration ionic strength temperature ion types ph and time 27 51 the most stable phase of calcium phosphate is hydroxyapatite hap and the most common precursors for the hap formation are brushite dcpd cahpo4 2h2o octacalcium phosphate ocp ca4h po4 3 3h2o and amorphous calcium phosphate acp ca3 po4 2 xh2o 27 52 the evolution of different calcium phosphate forms is reported as a function of the ph e g at ph 7 4 and 26 c will follow acp ocp hap 53 in addition the time required for the total transformation of calcium phosphate in hap is also a function of the ph e g at ph 7 5 will take 255 min 51 in this research the potential calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit was evaluated calculations of the saturation index si at the experimental conditions at the end of the stripping period 12 c ph of 7 2 po4 p 16 7 160 mg l 1 ca2 51 86 mgl 1 and alkalinity 200 mg l 1 as caco3 indicated that some of the precursors of hap such as ca3 po4 2 am2 ca3 po4 2 beta ocp and dcpd were slightly supersaturated this could indicate potential calcium phosphate precipitation in the p stripping unit as hap which was the most strongly saturated however no calcium decrease was observed during the batch experiments tested 2 5 h therefore we can conclude that no calcium phosphate precipitation occurred during p stripping the same observation under anaerobic conditions was reported by barat et al 27 who showed no solid formation of calcium phosphate similar calculations for struvite showed that struvite was highly undersaturated and therefore not precipitate in the p stripping unit fig 11 shows that 80 of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit 468 kg d 1 is following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility this amount represents 43 of the total phosphorus in the sludge and 34 of all phosphate entering the plant if 7 mgl 1 tp is considered via the influent this p recovery is comparable to the highest phosphate recovery reported by korving et al 20 17 35 when the phosphorus is stripped from activated sludge before digestion the physicochemical characteristics of this pre dewatering sidestream are high soluble phosphorus concentration and low ammonium concentration fig 11 the p recovery in sidestreams with low ammonium concentration is suitable for calcium phosphate 54 or potassium struvite kmgpo4 6h2o as potential final products 55 during anaerobic digestion part of particulate phosphorus is hydrolyzed and converted to soluble phosphorus figs 10 and 11 ammonia is also generated in the digesters during the degradation of proteins 12 and the post digested sludges contain the major amount of soluble nitrogen ammonia in both configurations figs 10 and 11 the p release and precipitation are simultaneous processes during anaerobic digestion 13 the most relevant fixation mechanisms of phosphorus in the digester are the formation of magnesium ammonium phosphate struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o which precipitates according to the released mg 2 counterions from polyphosphate hydrolysis 49 in this study based on the experimental ratio of 0 20 mg mg mg p 1 at least 20 of luxury p released from poly p hydrolysis can be precipitated with magnesium however organic matter degradation produces also a release of magnesium 4 and consequently the precipitation of soluble phosphorus in the digestion can be even more therefore it was assumed that 40 of the soluble p composed by the influent stream poly p hydrolysis and organic solid degradation present in ad was precipitated as struvite same as reported by marti et al 13 the calculations indicated that the struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit a comparison of both scenarios showed that the soluble p in the post anaerobic digestion sludge represents 40 and 23 of the tp content in the sludge for the existing and modified configurations respectively it was evident that the existing sludge configuration fig 10 contains more soluble phosphorus and magnesium in the post digested sludge than the modified configuration with the p stripping unit fig 11 therefore there is a higher risk of accumulation of struvite on ad itself pipe walls and equipment surfaces of ad and post digestion processes in the existing sludge line configuration this is a frequent problem reported in many wastewaters treatment plants around the world 12 13 the comparison of the concentrated rejects water of both sceneries indicated that there is a higher potential for p recovery with the p stripping configuration fig 11 than with the existing configuration fig 10 in addition it represents a good strategy for the sludge treatment to reduce struvite precipitation problems in the digesters land applied biosolids tend to have p n ratios higher than what is necessary for agricultural purposes however the reduction of p improves the quality of the biosolids by reducing the p n ratio and the amount of p lost to the environment in runoff 5 in this work the implementation of the p stripping unit also favours the reduction of phosphorus in the final cake it was found that only 17 of the tp in the sludge 917 kg d 1 was present in the modified fig 12 and 26 in the existing configuration fig 10 the results of the mass balances indicated that in a hrt of 3 h 70 of the total luxury p available in the sludge will be released when a p stripping unit is implemented fig 11 this short retention time represents an advantage since several batches of sludge per day can be treated in addition the required dimensions such as volume and area for the p stripping unit can be calculated based on the hrt and the known sludge flow based on the needed hrt of 3 h and the sludge flow of 1764 m3 d 1 the volume and area to build a p stripping unit were estimated to be 220 m3 and 11 8 m2 respectively the results of this work can contribute to generate and optimize p rich streams and enhance phosphorus recovery although the methodology of this work was implemented for activated sludge it can be also applied for bio p sludge coming from ebpr sbr or from hias mbbr process 56 4 conclusions in this work the ideal operating parameters to implement a p stripping unit or equivalent were identified the results indicated that with a dose between 10 000 17 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 20 c and between 15 000 25 000 mg scod mg p mg ts 1 1 at 11 13 c can be released 40 65 and 30 38 luxury phosphorus respectively simulation of the case study shows that 80 of the soluble phosphorus present in the p stripping unit is following the reject water of the pre dewatering facility struvite precipitates 1 6 times more in the existing than in the modified configuration which includes a p stripping unit therefore the implementation of a p stripping unit will enhance the potential for p recovery the mathematical model developed can adequately explain the p release and calculate the optimal values of cod dosage under varying initial sludge compositions the results of this work can be used as a tool to predict the theoretical p released for any sludge quality and carbon dose and to design and operate p stripping units the information gained in this study can be used to generate and optimize p rich streams early in the sludge line and thereby enhance phosphorus recovery declaration of competing interest the authors

12909,how to accelerate the fe iii fe ii cycle to improve oh generation is of significance for heterogeneous electro fenton hetero ef cathode in this work feooh nanosheets modified carbon felt feooh cf were prepared by in situ electrodeposition and used as a hetero ef cathode for enhanced sulfamerazine smr removal via visible light assisted electro fenton vis ef process material characterization results suggested that the interaction between feooh and cf was strengthened via the formation of fe o c bonding due to the special electrodeposition method as expected the as prepared cathode exhibited excellent ef catalysis ability and visible light activation with visible light assistance the smr removal rate for feooh cf 40 was as high as 92 41 which was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process in addition the applicable ph range could be expanded to a mild condition for feooh cf cathode via the vis ef process only 0 13 of total electrodeposited fe was leached to the solution indicative of good stability mechanism analysis revealed that the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding can significantly promote fe iii fe ii cycle under visible light irradiation thus activating the in situ generated h2o2 to produce abundant oh these findings proved feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance keywords electro fenton heterogeneous cathode carbon felt visible light assistance sulfamerazine removal 1 introduction in recent years the frequent detection of antibiotics in the aquatic environment has posed potential threats to human beings and ecosystems causing antibiotic resistance carcinogenic effects and changes in environmental microbial communities 1 2 sulfamerazine smr with broad spectrum antibacterial properties is the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic high levels of smr residues have been found in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants and also in natural waters due to the poor biodegradability 3 4 therefore effective approaches to alleviate smr contamination from aqueous solutions are highly desired great endeavors have been made to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions among them electro fenton ef technology as a promising advanced oxidation process aops can effectively destroy the organic pollutants based on non selective powerful hydroxyl radicals oh eo 2 80 v vs she thus eliminating the toxicity 5 7 during the classic ef process h2o2 can be continuously and in situ supplied at cathode via o2 electro reduction then react with fe2 to generate oh from fenton chemistry compared with traditional fenton technology ef technology can ensure the economy and safety of water treatment without the external addition of h2o2 normally carbonaceous cathode materials are preferentially applied which can provide satisfactory h2o2 generation efficiency carbon felt cf is the most popular alternative because of its three dimensional structure with high porosity excellent stability and low cost 8 heterogeneous ef hetero ef exhibits better application prospects than homogeneous ef homo ef 9 the use of solid fe based catalysts such as zero valent iron and iron oxides can overcome the activity loss and iron sludge management problems caused by the depletion of soluble fe2 10 11 especially the development of fe functionalized hetero ef cathodes has attracted great attention which can avoid the agglomeration of catalysts and the recovery of suspended particles 12 despite these blessings how to accelerate fe iii fe ii cycle to improve oh generation is still an obstacle it is well known that fe2 in homo ef can be regenerated by the electro reduction of fe3 at the cathode however for the solid phase the fe iii fe ii cycle is far more sluggish which limits the efficiency of the hetero ef reaction it was reported that physical field assistance could enhance the degradation of pollutants 13 especially uv irradiation is helpful to promote fe ii regeneration by enhancing charge transfer in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction 14 in addition uv irradiation can promote the generation of oh from h2o2 decomposition accordingly a photo assisted electro fenton pef process was developed 15 17 however uv irradiation is energy intensive and costly which hinders its practical application to utilize the more economically feasible solar energy a visible light assisted ef vis ef system is highly desired iron oxyhydroxide feooh has been widely used as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton like processes zhang et al found that feooh ac as cathodic catalysts can efficiently remove amaranth decolorization within 240 min via adsorption and fenton oxidation due to the absence of strong bonding between feooh and ac more iron dissolution made fe3 fe2 transformation expectably facilitated and homogeneous fenton oxidation contributed 31 78 of decolorization rates 18 wang et al distributed γ feooh uniformly into graphene aerogel to limit catalyst leaching the as prepared hetero ef cathodes can achieve 89 8 of mineralization of sulfamethoxazole within 300 min but the fe iii fe ii cycle has been not discussed 19 it was reported that through anchoring feooh with substrates such as gac 20 graphene 21 and mesoporous carbon 22 the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding can endow those composite photo fenton catalysts with accelerated fe iii fe ii cycle and less catalyst leaching under visible light irradiation however the agglomeration of suspended catalysts and their recovery problem still needs to be resolved based on the analysis feooh with ef catalysis ability and visible light activation should be the promising catalyst for the pef process notably in the vis ef system feooh functionalized hetero ef cathodes with good stability are more necessary unfortunately there have been few reports in the literature so far electrodeposition is an effective method for in situ immobilization of nano materials on conductive substrates which can expose more active sites and enhance the adhesion between engineering interfaces 23 24 in this work feooh nanosheets modified carbon felt feooh cf were prepared by electrodeposition and used as a hetero ef cathode for enhanced smr removal via the vis ef process due to the special electrodeposition method the interaction between feooh and cf was strengthened via fe o c bonding resulting in an improved electron transfer and good stability with less fe leaching as expected the as prepared cathode exhibited excellent ef catalysis with the assistance of visible light thus the specific objectives of this work were 1 to report a feooh cf hetero ef cathode with ef catalysis ability and visible light activation 2 to develop a vis ef system for effective smr removal 3 to explore the involved mechanism in terms of oh generation and fe species evolution in vis ef process these findings proved feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of feooh cf hetero ef cathodes the raw cf 2 2 cm2 was pretreated with acetone and deionized water washing followed by drying at 100 c then feooh cf hetero ef cathodes were prepared by in situ electrodeposition typically a three electrode system was applied where cf ag agcl and pt sheet were used as working electrode reference electrode and counter electrode respectively 200 ml electrolyte containing 0 1 m nano3 and fe so4 2 was used then feooh was in situ electrodeposited on cf under a potential of 0 5 v for different times from 10 to 40 min after washing with deionized water and drying at 60 c the feooh cf hetero ef cathodes with different feooh loadings were obtained which were recorded as feooh cf x x represented the electrodeposition time 2 2 characterization the morphology and structure of feooh cf cathodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectroscopy eds using a hitachi s 4800 electron microscope the functional groups of electrodes were analyzed by fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy using a thermo nicolet is10 spectrometer the phase structures of electrodes were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd patterns on a bruker axs d 8 advance powder diffraction system with cu kα λ 1 5418 å radiation the chemical states of electrodes were measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a phi quantera ii system electrochemical properties of the as prepared cathodes were analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry lsv and cyclic voltammetry cv tests in a three electrode system feooh cf or cf ag agcl and pt sheet were used as working electrode reference electrode and counter electrode respectively lsv was performed in o2 saturated na2so4 aqueous solution 0 05 mm at a scan rate of 10 mv s cv tests were carried out in 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 0 1 m kcl solution at a scan rate of 10 mv s the electroactive

molecule 1 10 5 mol cm3 2 3 procedures and analysis smr removal experiments were carried out in an undivided cylindrical glass reactor with cooling water circulation 100 ml of a mixed solution with smr 20 mg l and na2so4 0 05 m was used as simulated wastewater similar to the electrochemical characterization a three electrode system was applied in a typical vis ef process depending on the electrode size and reactor volume an optimal distance of 2 cm was adopted between the working electrode and counter electrode to avoid electrode contact and ensure effective current efficiency a 500 w xe lamp with a uv light cutoff filter λ 420 nm was used to provide visible light irradiation which was placed in front of the reactor after feeding the air for 10 min the reaction was initiated by simultaneously turning on the lamp and the electrochemical station meanwhile cooling water circulation was conducted to keep the whole process at room temperature at set intervals samples were withdrawn and filtered through a millipore filter 0 22 μm for analysis by controlling whether to turn on the lamp the electrochemical station or air feeding smr remove experiments under different control conditions were carried out the stability of the feooh cf cathode was investigated over five consecutive runs and the used cathode was rinsed with deionized water between each run three repeated trials were conducted in all experiments and the average values were reported the smr concentration was analyzed on a waters e2695 series high performance liquid chromatography system hplc the mobile phase was acetonitrile water 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min and the detection wavelength was 270 nm the total organic carbon toc concentration was analyzed on a shimadzu toc l analyzer the degraded products were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer hplc ms agilent the concentrations of leached iron were analyzed on a zeenit 700p atomic absorption spectroscopy aas the total electrodeposited fe of feooh cf cathode was determined by digestion with strong acid in the microwave oven followed by dilution and aas analysis oh was detected by using tert butanol tba as a scavenger electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements were also performed using a bruker 320 epr spectrometer to detect oh 3 result and discussion 3 1 materials characterization of feooh cf sem analyses were performed to characterize the morphology of as prepared cathodes as shown the raw cf exhibited a fibrous structure with a smooth surface fig 1a however the surface became rather rough for feooh cf after the in situ electrodeposition fig 1b when further magnifying the sem image many interwoven nanosheets anchored on the fiber surface can be observed moreover the corresponding eds elemental mappings revealed the existence of c o and fe elements in feooh cf 40 fig 1c e especially the distribution area of o and fe elements was highly coincident with the nanosheets area indicative of the electrodeposited iron oxygen species to further investigate the specific structure of as prepared cathodes ftir and xrd analyses were performed as shown in fig 2a compared with raw cf the ftir spectrum of feooh cf exhibited several new peaks the peak at 475 cm 1 corresponded to feo stretching vibration and the peaks at 735 and 1021 cm 1 corresponded to fe oh bending vibration besides the peak at 3186 cm 1 should be assigned to oh stretching vibration confirming the existence of h o h bond in the hydrated feooh 25 fig 2b showed the xrd patterns of raw cf and feooh cf both cathodes exhibited the diffraction peak of graphitic structure at 2θ 22 5o besides feooh cf presented another four characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 14 1o 27 1o 36 3o and 47 0o respectively which can be assigned to the 020 120 031 and 051 planes of γ feooh phase jcpds 74 1877 26 the direct evidence of the existence of γ feooh could be found in the tem and hrtem images fig s1 as shown the layer structure of nanosheets could be observed and the interfacial spacings of lattice fringes were measured to be 6 51 2 903 2 202 and 1 896 a respectively the lattice fringes agreed well with the xrd analysis in addition some weak characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 1o and 35 5o can be observed in the xrd pattern of feooh cf which can be assigned to the magnetite phase jcpds 19 0629 that is to say there may be a few other iron oxides present in the electrodeposited materials it may be ascribed to the hydrolysis behavior of iron salts under different conditions in a typical electrodeposition process no3 was reduced to generate oh while fe2 was oxidized to fe3 accordingly a hydrolyzation precipitation process between fe3 and oh resulted in the in situ electrodeposition of feooh eq 2 4 besides it was reported that the hydrolysis of the mixed fe2 and fe3 solution may form magnetite in this case the oxidation rate of fe2 and the hydrolysis rate of fe3 are matched to cause the formation of fe ii fe iii octahedron which then rapidly combine with fe iii tetrahedron to form magnetite 27 therefore we inferred that in addition to the first dominant process the latter process may inevitably occur under our electrochemical operating conditions despite this we considered the amount of magnetite to be negligible compared to the γ feooh according to the eds spectrum the atomic ratio and weight ratio of fe and o were 1 2 03 and 1 72 1 respectively which agreed well with the composition of γ feooh fig s2 it suggested that γ feooh was the dominant iron oxygen species it should be noted that the amorphous feooh could also be obtained by electrodeposition in previous work 24 in that work the deoxygenation treatment was conducted during the electrodeposition process whereas dissolved oxygen do was not avoided in our work do could induce the transformation of iron hydrolysate and the presence of do favored the production of γ feooh 28 overall these results suggested that γ feooh nanosheets were successfully prepared and electrodeposited on cf 2 no 3 7 h 2 o 8 e n h 4 10 oh 3 fe 2 e fe 3 4 fe 3 3 oh feooh h 2 o 3 2 electrochemical characterization of feooh cf to investigate the ability of oxygen reduction reaction orr lsv curves of feooh cf and cf cathodes were recorded in o2 saturated na2so4 aqueous solution 0 05 mm at a scan rate of 10 mv s fig 3a in the potential range of 0 8 v to 0 v feooh cf cathode exhibited a stronger current response as compared with cf cathode indicating more electron transfers occurred during the orr process especially an obvious orr peak around 0 2 v was observed for feooh cf cathode pointed by a dashed line it manifested that feooh cf cathode exhibited a better orr performance which was conducive to the subsequent ef process cv tests were carried out to analyze the electrochemical properties of the as prepared cathodes in potassium ferricyanide solution at a scan rate of 10 mv s as shown in fig 3b both feooh cf and cf cathodes exhibited symmetrical fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 redox peaks which can reflect the electroactive surface area cleary feooh cf exhibited a higher current density of redox peaks suggesting an increased electroactive surface area according to the randles sevcik equation the electroactive surface areas of feooh cf and cf cathodes were calculated to be 121 7 cm2 and 49 8cm2 respectively the 2 4 times increase of the electroactive surface area should be ascribed to the high specific surface area of the deposited feooh fig s3 it can be expected that more active sites would be exposed on feooh cf cathode for electrochemical reactions 3 3 smr removal for feooh cf in vis ef process to investigate the smr removal performance of feooh cf cathode a series of control experiments were first conducted including adsorption anode oxidation photocatalysis ef and vis ef as depicted in fig 4 without any physical field assistance only 10 16 of smr was removed by adsorption in addition the effect of photocatalysis namely solo photo assistance on smr removal can be ignored it may be due to the inefficient charge carrier separation and transfer of feooh under visible light irradiation 29 30 when the solo electrical assistance was applied the smr removal rate was slightly increased to 20 22 by anode oxidation furthermore the smr removal rate in the ef process was significantly increased to 84 19 within 90 min suggesting that the fenton reaction between feooh and in situ generated h2o2 dominated the removal of pollutants as expected the best removal performance of feooh cf can be achieved in the vis ef process smr removal rate was as high as 92 41 which was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process a similar observation could be found in zhao s work in which the rhb degradation rate was increased by 108 for mof 2fe co ca hetero ef cathode with solar light irradiation 31 however possible co leaching would result in potential environmental risks the mineralization performance was also important to evaluate the catalytic activity of hetero ef cathodes as shown in fig s4 the toc removal rate in the vis ef process was 82 11 while that in the ef process was only 52 94 based on the toc results the corresponding mineralization current efficiencies in the vis ef process and ef process were 40 86 and 28 42 respectively clearly visible light assistance could significantly enhance the catalytic activity of feooh cf hetero ef cathodes the above results indicated that feooh cf should be a promising cathode in the vis ef process for the effective removal of organic pollutants in our preparation strategy the feooh loading of fabricated cathodes could be controlled by electrodeposition time the effect of feooh loading on smr removal was investigated and the results were shown in fig 5a smr removal rate significantly increased as the electrodeposition time increased from 10 to 40 min 57 17 71 39 86 10 and 92 41 for feooh cf 10 feooh cf 20 feooh cf 30 and feooh cf 40 respectively the increased feooh loading can provide enough catalytic sites for vis ef however as the electrodeposition time further increased to 50 min smr removal performance increased slightly to 93 63 which was not substantially improved compared with feooh cf 40 it may be ascribed to the following reasons i the aggregation of superfluous feooh nanosheets would hinder the exposure of catalytic sites for vis ef and ii the excessively covered cf surface would deteriorate h2o2 generation 19 thus feooh cf 40 with appropriate catalytic loading should be the best cathode for the vis ef process the applied voltage is an important parameter influencing the electron transfer in the ef based processes 32 fig 5b showed the effect of applied voltage on smr removal for feooh cf 40 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 5 v to 2 0 v the smr removal rate was improved from 59 07 to 92 41 the higher applied voltage could accelerate the electrons transfer between anode and cathode thus increasing the reaction rate of the orr process to improve the h2o2 generation in addition the enhanced electron transfer could also contribute to the anode oxidation process 33 considering the small contribution of anode oxidation to smr removal fig 4 the enhanced h2o2 generation should be the main reason for the increased smr removal at higher applied voltages however as the applied voltage further increased to 2 5 v the smr removal rate decreased slightly it may be ascribed to the reduced h2o2 generation at high applied voltage generally an excessively high potential might cause several side reactions such as h2o2 decomposition eq 5 4e oxygen reduction eq 6 and hydrogen evolution eq 7 reactions on the cathode surface 34 although h2o2 generation might be negatively affected at high applied voltage visible light assistance could still maintain the fenton reaction activity and anode oxidation could also be enhanced to a certain extent at high applied voltage because the positive and negative effects cancel each other out the smr removal rate can still reach 91 30 at 2 5 v considering the electrode stability and operating costs 2 v should be the optimal applied voltage 5 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 6 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 7 2 h 2 e h 2 as known ph values greatly affect the activity of fenton based reaction herein the smr removal performances in the vis ef and ef processes were investigated in the ph range of 3 9 as shown in fig 6a the smr removal rate in the ef process decreased as the ph increased from 3 to 9 normally an elevated ph may lead to the activity loss of soluble fe2 due to the iron precipitation in the homogeneous fenton process however the iron leaching of feooh cf was far less as shown later indicating the homogeneous fenton reaction was not the predominant mechanism in the ef process the effect of ph on smr removal can be explained for two reasons on one hand the iron state of feooh in the ef process was largely dependent on the proton environment feooh has empty octahedral sites with a loose structure which makes its inner structure more accessible to the diffusion of protons it was reported that proton inducing could weaken the fe iii o bond and form ofe iii oh2 2 accordingly the unstable state of fe iii inside feooh could be used for fe ii formation in the ef process thus initiating the fenton reaction 35 however it is difficult for fe iii of feooh to convert to fe ii in the ef process at neutral and alkali conditions that is why the smr removal rate significantly deteriorated at ph 7 and 9 almost the same as that in anode oxidation on the one hand h2o2 generation was also largely influenced by the proton environment it was demonstrated that the generated h2o2 concentration decreased with increasing ph values due to the insufficient protons supply which is adverse to smr removal 36 as expected visible light assistance could significantly improve smr removal performance compared with the ef process at all ph conditions in practice application it is of great significance to extend the applicable ph range of the fenton process to a mild condition at a mild acid condition ph 5 the smr removal rate in the vis ef process could still be maintained at 86 06 while that in the ef process was only 51 71 even at ph 9 the smr removal rate was improved from 20 70 to 35 59 with visible light assistance the corresponding kinetics data at different ph values are well fitted with pseudo first order kinetics eq 8 8 in c t c 0 kt where c 0 and c t are smr concentrations at the beginning and at a certain time t as shown in fig s5 all the experimental data had good regression fits with high correlation coefficients r2 0 9 indicating that the removal kinetics followed the pseudo first order model the corresponding kinetics constants for both processes decreased as the ph increased from 3 to 9 fig 6b despite this the k values for the vis ef process were always higher than that for the ef process at all ph conditions for example the k value for the vis ef process was 0 0213 at ph 5 which was 3 04 times higher than that for the ef process 0 007 although visible light assistance had a positive effect on smr removal in the ph range of 3 9 the absolute removal rate under neutral or alkaline conditions may be unsatisfactory compared to acid conditions thus we think the vis ef system in this work is more suitable for application in an acidic environment and a mild condition can be expanded 3 4 possible mechanism for feooh cf in vis ef process it is known that the reactive oxygen species in the fenton process may include radicals oh o2 and non radicals 1o2 21 36 37 thus scavenging tests in the vis ef process were carried out by using tert butyl alcohol tba chloroform and l histidine as oh o2 and 1o2 scavengers respectively as shown in fig 7a smr removal was significantly inhibited with the addition of tba suggesting that oh also had a substantial contribution to pollutant removal in the vis ef process in addition a minor inhibitory effect on smr removal was found for chloroform scavenging proving the presence of o2 however o2 was generated from a rate limiting reductive reaction between fe iii and h2o2 and did not react directly with pollutants upon visible light irradiation fe iii was rapidly converted to fe ii further limiting o2 generation as a consequence the contribution of o2 to smr removal was small meanwhile the limited o2 generation would attenuate the oxidation and recombination of o2 which was against the formation of 1o2 as evidenced the addition of l histidine had little effect on sem removal it demonstrated that the non radical pathway of 1o2 was negligible in the vis ef process overall scavenging tests testified that oh was predominant in the vis ef system the generation of oh should be ascribed to the fenton reaction between feooh and in situ generated h2o2 the amount of h2o2 and oh were quantitatively detected to analyze the difference between the vis ef process and the ef process the comparative results suggested that more oh was generated in the vis ef process thereby leading to a lower h2o2 cumulative amount fig 7b this result was further confirmed by dmpo oh epr spectra as depicted in fig 7c the typical dmpo oh peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 could be found in epr spectra confirming the generation of oh in both processes however the vis ef process exhibited a stronger oh signal compared with the ef process it indicated that visible light assistance could enhance the catalytic ability of the feooh cf cathode for h2o2 activation as a result smr removal was significantly improved in the vis ef process to elucidate the reason for the enhanced oh generation xps analyses for the raw and used feooh cf cathodes were employed to investigate interfacial electronic interactions and surface element changes fig 8a showed high resolution xps spectra of o 1 s for the raw and used cathodes the o1 spectra of raw feooh cf can be divided into five peaks assigned to fe o fe 530 3 ev fe o c 531 1 ev fe o h 531 9 ev co 533 0 ev and adsorbed h o h 533 9 ev 38 the formation of fe o c bonding by the electrodeposition method indicated a strong interaction between feooh and cf which is beneficial to improving electron transfer and stability of feooh cf cathodes furthermore fe species evolution was studied by high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p as shown in fig 8b two peaks at 712 ev and 725 ev can be observed in both spectra corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of feooh 39 compared with the raw cathode fe 2p1 2 shifted slightly toward high binding energy for both used cathodes indicating fe ii was generated on feooh 40 especially the binding energy shift for vis ef used cathode was 0 91 ev while that for ef used cathode was 0 52 ev upon spectra fitting it can be calculated that the percentage of fe ii for raw ef used and vis ef used cathode were 45 9 48 6 and 50 2 respectively clearly it demonstrated that fe iii fe ii cycle in the vis ef process was significantly improved although cathode reduction could potentially initiate fe iii fe ii cycle visible light assistance should be a predominant reason the degraded intermediates of smr in the vis ef system were analyzed by hplc ms based on the experimental results and reported studies the possible degradation pathway of smr was proposed in fig s6 as depicted the appearance of intermediate a m z 173 and intermediate b m z 109 indicated that the sn bond in smr was first attacked by oh then the amino group in a was converted into the nitro group while the methyl group in b was carboxylated yielding intermediate c m z 187 and intermediate d m z 139 respectively upon ongoing oxidation the breakage of the rings in c and d would produce some short chain carboxylic acids which were finally mineralized into co2 and h2o in summary cleavage of the sn bond was the main degradation pathway of smr in the vis ef system based on the results and discussions presented above the possible catalytic mechanism of the vis ef system was proposed in fig 9 in a typical vis ef process the fe iii of feooh was first induced by proton to form ofe iii oh2 2 the unstable state of fe iii inside feooh could be used for fe ii formation by cathode reduction more importantly a chemical bond rupture of ofe iii oh2 2 could occur under visible light irradiation enhancing fe ii formation and the subsequent fenton reaction 21 41 moreover the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding on feooh cf also favored the iron state transformation of feooh thus activating the in situ generated h2o2 to produce abundant oh 22 42 accordingly an excellent smr removal performance of feooh cf cathode can be achieved in the vis ef process 3 5 stability and applicability for feooh cf cathode in vis ef process the stability of the feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was investigated in fig 10 fe leaching of fenton catalysts has always been a concern in terms of material stability and environmental risk after 90 min reaction the leaching concentration of total fe was only 0 43 mg l which is far lower than the discharge limit of the european union 2 0 mg l fig 10a notably the total electrodeposited fe of the as prepared cathode was measured to be 8 52 mg cm2 upon calculation only 0 13 of total electrodeposited fe was leached to the solution in one run although the proton induced formation of unstable ofe iii oh2 2 may cause the detachment of fe iii from feooh such a low fe leaching for feooh cf cathode should be ascribed to the strong interaction between feooh and cf via fe o c bonding meanwhile the corresponding current response was maintained at about 0 025 a without obvious fluctuation during the treatment further confirming the good stability fig s3b moreover the stability of the feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was evaluated by consecutive runs fig 10b after 8 runs the smr removal rate decreased from 94 41 to 81 92 that is to say there is about a 13 22 reduction in the vis ef catalytic ability of the feooh cf cathode compared with its initial ability clearly the cathode can be reused by simply deionized water rinsing without any special treatments overall the as prepared feooh cf cathode exhibited some advantages in terms of metal leaching and catalyst agglomeration and recovery as compared with the reported feooh based fenton catalytic materials 18 21 by comparing with various advanced oxidation technologies it can be found that the vis ef system in this study has a very comparable smr removal performance table s1 finally the applicability of feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was investigated by treating actual secondary wastewater collected from a local chemical industry park water quality characteristics listed in table s2 the results are shown in fig 11 after 90 min of treatment the cod removal rate in the vis ef process was 70 8 while that in the ef process was only 53 6 moreover the economy can be analyzed in terms of specific energy consumption sec kwh kg cod although visible light irradiation is provided using a xe lamp in the experiment the utilization of solar energy without light source equipment should be prioritized in practical water treatment thus only electrical energy consumption is taken into account in the economic analysis according to the corresponding current response fig s7 visible light assistance decreased the sec value from 12 48 to 8 98 kwh kg cod ismail et al conducted a comprehensive contrast of energy consumption analysis for various ef processes and summarized that electrical energy consumption of ef technology was in the range of several to tens of kwh kg cod 43 therefore the economy of this vis ef system followed the reasonable route of ef technology these results indicated good applicability of feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process which is promising for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance 4 environmental implications and perspectives taken together promoting the fe iii fe ii cycle of fe functionalized hetero ef cathodes is highly desired for actual applications compared to the reported studies we believe that the improvement of our work lies in 1 an economically feasible visible light or solar assisted ef vis ef system was first constructed with feooh cf cathode which has catalysis ability and visible light activation 2 a simple electrodeposition method was applied to endow the as prepared electrode with improved electron transfer and good stability as a result the as prepared feooh cf cathode exhibited some advantages in terms of metal leaching and catalyst agglomeration and recovery as compared with the reported feooh based fenton catalytic materials with the visible light assistance fe iii fe ii cycle was significantly promoted and the smr removal rate was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process in addition the applicable ph range could be expanded to a mild condition in this system for actual secondary wastewater treatment good applicability could be reflected by the improved cod removal rate and decreased sec value overall these findings demonstrateed feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance despite these advantages some issues still need to be addressed in future studies although the electrodeposition method has demonstrated good prospects in the improvement of hetero ef cathode property the lab scale preparation of these electrodes is quite different from their large scale manufacture in the latter case special attention should be paid to the operating conditions such as electrolytes concentration electrodeposition voltage electrodeposition time as well as electrodeposition device so that the catalyst can be uniformly and firmly coated in addition the techno economic analysis only considered the mineralization current efficiency and energy consumption in the lab scale electrochemical process although solar energy without light source equipment would be prioritized in practical water treatment the utilization efficiency of solar energy should also be considered when scaling up the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

12909,how to accelerate the fe iii fe ii cycle to improve oh generation is of significance for heterogeneous electro fenton hetero ef cathode in this work feooh nanosheets modified carbon felt feooh cf were prepared by in situ electrodeposition and used as a hetero ef cathode for enhanced sulfamerazine smr removal via visible light assisted electro fenton vis ef process material characterization results suggested that the interaction between feooh and cf was strengthened via the formation of fe o c bonding due to the special electrodeposition method as expected the as prepared cathode exhibited excellent ef catalysis ability and visible light activation with visible light assistance the smr removal rate for feooh cf 40 was as high as 92 41 which was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process in addition the applicable ph range could be expanded to a mild condition for feooh cf cathode via the vis ef process only 0 13 of total electrodeposited fe was leached to the solution indicative of good stability mechanism analysis revealed that the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding can significantly promote fe iii fe ii cycle under visible light irradiation thus activating the in situ generated h2o2 to produce abundant oh these findings proved feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance keywords electro fenton heterogeneous cathode carbon felt visible light assistance sulfamerazine removal 1 introduction in recent years the frequent detection of antibiotics in the aquatic environment has posed potential threats to human beings and ecosystems causing antibiotic resistance carcinogenic effects and changes in environmental microbial communities 1 2 sulfamerazine smr with broad spectrum antibacterial properties is the most commonly used sulfonamide antibiotic high levels of smr residues have been found in the effluents from wastewater treatment plants and also in natural waters due to the poor biodegradability 3 4 therefore effective approaches to alleviate smr contamination from aqueous solutions are highly desired great endeavors have been made to remove antibiotics from aqueous solutions among them electro fenton ef technology as a promising advanced oxidation process aops can effectively destroy the organic pollutants based on non selective powerful hydroxyl radicals oh eo 2 80 v vs she thus eliminating the toxicity 5 7 during the classic ef process h2o2 can be continuously and in situ supplied at cathode via o2 electro reduction then react with fe2 to generate oh from fenton chemistry compared with traditional fenton technology ef technology can ensure the economy and safety of water treatment without the external addition of h2o2 normally carbonaceous cathode materials are preferentially applied which can provide satisfactory h2o2 generation efficiency carbon felt cf is the most popular alternative because of its three dimensional structure with high porosity excellent stability and low cost 8 heterogeneous ef hetero ef exhibits better application prospects than homogeneous ef homo ef 9 the use of solid fe based catalysts such as zero valent iron and iron oxides can overcome the activity loss and iron sludge management problems caused by the depletion of soluble fe2 10 11 especially the development of fe functionalized hetero ef cathodes has attracted great attention which can avoid the agglomeration of catalysts and the recovery of suspended particles 12 despite these blessings how to accelerate fe iii fe ii cycle to improve oh generation is still an obstacle it is well known that fe2 in homo ef can be regenerated by the electro reduction of fe3 at the cathode however for the solid phase the fe iii fe ii cycle is far more sluggish which limits the efficiency of the hetero ef reaction it was reported that physical field assistance could enhance the degradation of pollutants 13 especially uv irradiation is helpful to promote fe ii regeneration by enhancing charge transfer in the heterogeneous fenton like reaction 14 in addition uv irradiation can promote the generation of oh from h2o2 decomposition accordingly a photo assisted electro fenton pef process was developed 15 17 however uv irradiation is energy intensive and costly which hinders its practical application to utilize the more economically feasible solar energy a visible light assisted ef vis ef system is highly desired iron oxyhydroxide feooh has been widely used as a heterogeneous catalyst in fenton like processes zhang et al found that feooh ac as cathodic catalysts can efficiently remove amaranth decolorization within 240 min via adsorption and fenton oxidation due to the absence of strong bonding between feooh and ac more iron dissolution made fe3 fe2 transformation expectably facilitated and homogeneous fenton oxidation contributed 31 78 of decolorization rates 18 wang et al distributed γ feooh uniformly into graphene aerogel to limit catalyst leaching the as prepared hetero ef cathodes can achieve 89 8 of mineralization of sulfamethoxazole within 300 min but the fe iii fe ii cycle has been not discussed 19 it was reported that through anchoring feooh with substrates such as gac 20 graphene 21 and mesoporous carbon 22 the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding can endow those composite photo fenton catalysts with accelerated fe iii fe ii cycle and less catalyst leaching under visible light irradiation however the agglomeration of suspended catalysts and their recovery problem still needs to be resolved based on the analysis feooh with ef catalysis ability and visible light activation should be the promising catalyst for the pef process notably in the vis ef system feooh functionalized hetero ef cathodes with good stability are more necessary unfortunately there have been few reports in the literature so far electrodeposition is an effective method for in situ immobilization of nano materials on conductive substrates which can expose more active sites and enhance the adhesion between engineering interfaces 23 24 in this work feooh nanosheets modified carbon felt feooh cf were prepared by electrodeposition and used as a hetero ef cathode for enhanced smr removal via the vis ef process due to the special electrodeposition method the interaction between feooh and cf was strengthened via fe o c bonding resulting in an improved electron transfer and good stability with less fe leaching as expected the as prepared cathode exhibited excellent ef catalysis with the assistance of visible light thus the specific objectives of this work were 1 to report a feooh cf hetero ef cathode with ef catalysis ability and visible light activation 2 to develop a vis ef system for effective smr removal 3 to explore the involved mechanism in terms of oh generation and fe species evolution in vis ef process these findings proved feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of feooh cf hetero ef cathodes the raw cf 2 2 cm2 was pretreated with acetone and deionized water washing followed by drying at 100 c then feooh cf hetero ef cathodes were prepared by in situ electrodeposition typically a three electrode system was applied where cf ag agcl and pt sheet were used as working electrode reference electrode and counter electrode respectively 200 ml electrolyte containing 0 1 m nano3 and fe so4 2 was used then feooh was in situ electrodeposited on cf under a potential of 0 5 v for different times from 10 to 40 min after washing with deionized water and drying at 60 c the feooh cf hetero ef cathodes with different feooh loadings were obtained which were recorded as feooh cf x x represented the electrodeposition time 2 2 characterization the morphology and structure of feooh cf cathodes were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem and energy

spectrometer the phase structures of electrodes were analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd patterns on a bruker axs d 8 advance powder diffraction system with cu kα λ 1 5418 å radiation the chemical states of electrodes were measured by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using a phi quantera ii system electrochemical properties of the as prepared cathodes were analyzed by linear sweep voltammetry lsv and cyclic voltammetry cv tests in a three electrode system feooh cf or cf ag agcl and pt sheet were used as working electrode reference electrode and counter electrode respectively lsv was performed in o2 saturated na2so4 aqueous solution 0 05 mm at a scan rate of 10 mv s cv tests were carried out in 10 mm k3 fe cn 6 0 1 m kcl solution at a scan rate of 10 mv s the electroactive

molecule 1 10 5 mol cm3 2 3 procedures and analysis smr removal experiments were carried out in an undivided cylindrical glass reactor with cooling water circulation 100 ml of a mixed solution with smr 20 mg l and na2so4 0 05 m was used as simulated wastewater similar to the electrochemical characterization a three electrode system was applied in a typical vis ef process depending on the electrode size and reactor volume an optimal distance of 2 cm was adopted between the working electrode and counter electrode to avoid electrode contact and ensure effective current efficiency a 500 w xe lamp with a uv light cutoff filter λ 420 nm was used to provide visible light irradiation which was placed in front of the reactor after feeding the air for 10 min the reaction was initiated by simultaneously turning on the lamp and the electrochemical station meanwhile cooling water circulation was conducted to keep the whole process at room temperature at set intervals samples were withdrawn and filtered through a millipore filter 0 22 μm for analysis by controlling whether to turn on the lamp the electrochemical station or air feeding smr remove experiments under different control conditions were carried out the stability of the feooh cf cathode was investigated over five consecutive runs and the used cathode was rinsed with deionized water between each run three repeated trials were conducted in all experiments and the average values were reported the smr concentration was analyzed on a waters e2695 series high performance liquid chromatography system hplc the mobile phase was acetonitrile water 30 70 v v with a flow rate of 0 1 ml min and the detection wavelength was 270 nm the total organic carbon toc concentration was analyzed on a shimadzu toc l analyzer the degraded products were determined by a high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a mass spectrometer hplc ms agilent the concentrations of leached iron were analyzed on a zeenit 700p atomic absorption spectroscopy aas the total electrodeposited fe of feooh cf cathode was determined by digestion with strong acid in the microwave oven followed by dilution and aas analysis oh was detected by using tert butanol tba as a scavenger electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurements were also performed using a bruker 320 epr spectrometer to detect oh 3 result and discussion 3 1 materials characterization of feooh cf sem analyses were performed to characterize the morphology of as prepared cathodes as shown the raw cf exhibited a fibrous structure with a smooth surface fig 1a however the surface became rather rough for feooh cf after the in situ electrodeposition fig 1b when further magnifying the sem image many interwoven nanosheets anchored on the fiber surface can be observed moreover the corresponding eds elemental mappings revealed the existence of c o and fe elements in feooh cf 40 fig 1c e especially the distribution area of o and fe elements was highly coincident with the nanosheets area indicative of the electrodeposited iron oxygen species to further investigate the specific structure of as prepared cathodes ftir and xrd analyses were performed as shown in fig 2a compared with raw cf the ftir spectrum of feooh cf exhibited several new peaks the peak at 475 cm 1 corresponded to feo stretching vibration and the peaks at 735 and 1021 cm 1 corresponded to fe oh bending vibration besides the peak at 3186 cm 1 should be assigned to oh stretching vibration confirming the existence of h o h bond in the hydrated feooh 25 fig 2b showed the xrd patterns of raw cf and feooh cf both cathodes exhibited the diffraction peak of graphitic structure at 2θ 22 5o besides feooh cf presented another four characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 14 1o 27 1o 36 3o and 47 0o respectively which can be assigned to the 020 120 031 and 051 planes of γ feooh phase jcpds 74 1877 26 the direct evidence of the existence of γ feooh could be found in the tem and hrtem images fig s1 as shown the layer structure of nanosheets could be observed and the interfacial spacings of lattice fringes were measured to be 6 51 2 903 2 202 and 1 896 a respectively the lattice fringes agreed well with the xrd analysis in addition some weak characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 30 1o and 35 5o can be observed in the xrd pattern of feooh cf which can be assigned to the magnetite phase jcpds 19 0629 that is to say there may be a few other iron oxides present in the electrodeposited materials it may be ascribed to the hydrolysis behavior of iron salts under different conditions in a typical electrodeposition process no3 was reduced to generate oh while fe2 was oxidized to fe3 accordingly a hydrolyzation precipitation process between fe3 and oh resulted in the in situ electrodeposition of feooh eq 2 4 besides it was reported that the hydrolysis of the mixed fe2 and fe3 solution may form magnetite in this case the oxidation rate of fe2 and the hydrolysis rate of fe3 are matched to cause the formation of fe ii fe iii octahedron which then rapidly combine with fe iii tetrahedron to form magnetite 27 therefore we inferred that in addition to the first dominant process the latter process may inevitably occur under our electrochemical operating conditions despite this we considered the amount of magnetite to be negligible compared to the γ feooh according to the eds spectrum the atomic ratio and weight ratio of fe and o were 1 2 03 and 1 72 1 respectively which agreed well with the composition of γ feooh fig s2 it suggested that γ feooh was the dominant iron oxygen species it should be noted that the amorphous feooh could also be obtained by electrodeposition in previous work 24 in that work the deoxygenation treatment was conducted during the electrodeposition process whereas dissolved oxygen do was not avoided in our work do could induce the transformation of iron hydrolysate and the presence of do favored the production of γ feooh 28 overall these results suggested that γ feooh nanosheets were successfully prepared and electrodeposited on cf 2 no 3 7 h 2 o 8 e n h 4 10 oh 3 fe 2 e fe 3 4 fe 3 3 oh feooh h 2 o 3 2 electrochemical characterization of feooh cf to investigate the ability of oxygen reduction reaction orr lsv curves of feooh cf and cf cathodes were recorded in o2 saturated na2so4 aqueous solution 0 05 mm at a scan rate of 10 mv s fig 3a in the potential range of 0 8 v to 0 v feooh cf cathode exhibited a stronger current response as compared with cf cathode indicating more electron transfers occurred during the orr process especially an obvious orr peak around 0 2 v was observed for feooh cf cathode pointed by a dashed line it manifested that feooh cf cathode exhibited a better orr performance which was conducive to the subsequent ef process cv tests were carried out to analyze the electrochemical properties of the as prepared cathodes in potassium ferricyanide solution at a scan rate of 10 mv s as shown in fig 3b both feooh cf and cf cathodes exhibited symmetrical fe cn 6 3 fe cn 6 4 redox peaks which can reflect the electroactive surface area cleary feooh cf exhibited a higher current density of redox peaks suggesting an increased electroactive surface area according to the randles sevcik equation the electroactive surface areas of feooh cf and cf cathodes were calculated to be 121 7 cm2 and 49 8cm2 respectively the 2 4 times increase of the electroactive surface area should be ascribed to the high specific surface area of the deposited feooh fig s3 it can be expected that more active sites would be exposed on feooh cf cathode for electrochemical reactions 3 3 smr removal for feooh cf in vis ef process to investigate the smr removal performance of feooh cf cathode a series of control experiments were first conducted including adsorption anode oxidation photocatalysis ef and vis ef as depicted in fig 4 without any physical field assistance only 10 16 of smr was removed by adsorption in addition the effect of photocatalysis namely solo photo assistance on smr removal can be ignored it may be due to the inefficient charge carrier separation and transfer of feooh under visible light irradiation 29 30 when the solo electrical assistance was applied the smr removal rate was slightly increased to 20 22 by anode oxidation furthermore the smr removal rate in the ef process was significantly increased to 84 19 within 90 min suggesting that the fenton reaction between feooh and in situ generated h2o2 dominated the removal of pollutants as expected the best removal performance of feooh cf can be achieved in the vis ef process smr removal rate was as high as 92 41 which was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process a similar observation could be found in zhao s work in which the rhb degradation rate was increased by 108 for mof 2fe co ca hetero ef cathode with solar light irradiation 31 however possible co leaching would result in potential environmental risks the mineralization performance was also important to evaluate the catalytic activity of hetero ef cathodes as shown in fig s4 the toc removal rate in the vis ef process was 82 11 while that in the ef process was only 52 94 based on the toc results the corresponding mineralization current efficiencies in the vis ef process and ef process were 40 86 and 28 42 respectively clearly visible light assistance could significantly enhance the catalytic activity of feooh cf hetero ef cathodes the above results indicated that feooh cf should be a promising cathode in the vis ef process for the effective removal of organic pollutants in our preparation strategy the feooh loading of fabricated cathodes could be controlled by electrodeposition time the effect of feooh loading on smr removal was investigated and the results were shown in fig 5a smr removal rate significantly increased as the electrodeposition time increased from 10 to 40 min 57 17 71 39 86 10 and 92 41 for feooh cf 10 feooh cf 20 feooh cf 30 and feooh cf 40 respectively the increased feooh loading can provide enough catalytic sites for vis ef however as the electrodeposition time further increased to 50 min smr removal performance increased slightly to 93 63 which was not substantially improved compared with feooh cf 40 it may be ascribed to the following reasons i the aggregation of superfluous feooh nanosheets would hinder the exposure of catalytic sites for vis ef and ii the excessively covered cf surface would deteriorate h2o2 generation 19 thus feooh cf 40 with appropriate catalytic loading should be the best cathode for the vis ef process the applied voltage is an important parameter influencing the electron transfer in the ef based processes 32 fig 5b showed the effect of applied voltage on smr removal for feooh cf 40 with the increase of applied voltage from 0 5 v to 2 0 v the smr removal rate was improved from 59 07 to 92 41 the higher applied voltage could accelerate the electrons transfer between anode and cathode thus increasing the reaction rate of the orr process to improve the h2o2 generation in addition the enhanced electron transfer could also contribute to the anode oxidation process 33 considering the small contribution of anode oxidation to smr removal fig 4 the enhanced h2o2 generation should be the main reason for the increased smr removal at higher applied voltages however as the applied voltage further increased to 2 5 v the smr removal rate decreased slightly it may be ascribed to the reduced h2o2 generation at high applied voltage generally an excessively high potential might cause several side reactions such as h2o2 decomposition eq 5 4e oxygen reduction eq 6 and hydrogen evolution eq 7 reactions on the cathode surface 34 although h2o2 generation might be negatively affected at high applied voltage visible light assistance could still maintain the fenton reaction activity and anode oxidation could also be enhanced to a certain extent at high applied voltage because the positive and negative effects cancel each other out the smr removal rate can still reach 91 30 at 2 5 v considering the electrode stability and operating costs 2 v should be the optimal applied voltage 5 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 6 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 7 2 h 2 e h 2 as known ph values greatly affect the activity of fenton based reaction herein the smr removal performances in the vis ef and ef processes were investigated in the ph range of 3 9 as shown in fig 6a the smr removal rate in the ef process decreased as the ph increased from 3 to 9 normally an elevated ph may lead to the activity loss of soluble fe2 due to the iron precipitation in the homogeneous fenton process however the iron leaching of feooh cf was far less as shown later indicating the homogeneous fenton reaction was not the predominant mechanism in the ef process the effect of ph on smr removal can be explained for two reasons on one hand the iron state of feooh in the ef process was largely dependent on the proton environment feooh has empty octahedral sites with a loose structure which makes its inner structure more accessible to the diffusion of protons it was reported that proton inducing could weaken the fe iii o bond and form ofe iii oh2 2 accordingly the unstable state of fe iii inside feooh could be used for fe ii formation in the ef process thus initiating the fenton reaction 35 however it is difficult for fe iii of feooh to convert to fe ii in the ef process at neutral and alkali conditions that is why the smr removal rate significantly deteriorated at ph 7 and 9 almost the same as that in anode oxidation on the one hand h2o2 generation was also largely influenced by the proton environment it was demonstrated that the generated h2o2 concentration decreased with increasing ph values due to the insufficient protons supply which is adverse to smr removal 36 as expected visible light assistance could significantly improve smr removal performance compared with the ef process at all ph conditions in practice application it is of great significance to extend the applicable ph range of the fenton process to a mild condition at a mild acid condition ph 5 the smr removal rate in the vis ef process could still be maintained at 86 06 while that in the ef process was only 51 71 even at ph 9 the smr removal rate was improved from 20 70 to 35 59 with visible light assistance the corresponding kinetics data at different ph values are well fitted with pseudo first order kinetics eq 8 8 in c t c 0 kt where c 0 and c t are smr concentrations at the beginning and at a certain time t as shown in fig s5 all the experimental data had good regression fits with high correlation coefficients r2 0 9 indicating that the removal kinetics followed the pseudo first order model the corresponding kinetics constants for both processes decreased as the ph increased from 3 to 9 fig 6b despite this the k values for the vis ef process were always higher than that for the ef process at all ph conditions for example the k value for the vis ef process was 0 0213 at ph 5 which was 3 04 times higher than that for the ef process 0 007 although visible light assistance had a positive effect on smr removal in the ph range of 3 9 the absolute removal rate under neutral or alkaline conditions may be unsatisfactory compared to acid conditions thus we think the vis ef system in this work is more suitable for application in an acidic environment and a mild condition can be expanded 3 4 possible mechanism for feooh cf in vis ef process it is known that the reactive oxygen species in the fenton process may include radicals oh o2 and non radicals 1o2 21 36 37 thus scavenging tests in the vis ef process were carried out by using tert butyl alcohol tba chloroform and l histidine as oh o2 and 1o2 scavengers respectively as shown in fig 7a smr removal was significantly inhibited with the addition of tba suggesting that oh also had a substantial contribution to pollutant removal in the vis ef process in addition a minor inhibitory effect on smr removal was found for chloroform scavenging proving the presence of o2 however o2 was generated from a rate limiting reductive reaction between fe iii and h2o2 and did not react directly with pollutants upon visible light irradiation fe iii was rapidly converted to fe ii further limiting o2 generation as a consequence the contribution of o2 to smr removal was small meanwhile the limited o2 generation would attenuate the oxidation and recombination of o2 which was against the formation of 1o2 as evidenced the addition of l histidine had little effect on sem removal it demonstrated that the non radical pathway of 1o2 was negligible in the vis ef process overall scavenging tests testified that oh was predominant in the vis ef system the generation of oh should be ascribed to the fenton reaction between feooh and in situ generated h2o2 the amount of h2o2 and oh were quantitatively detected to analyze the difference between the vis ef process and the ef process the comparative results suggested that more oh was generated in the vis ef process thereby leading to a lower h2o2 cumulative amount fig 7b this result was further confirmed by dmpo oh epr spectra as depicted in fig 7c the typical dmpo oh peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 could be found in epr spectra confirming the generation of oh in both processes however the vis ef process exhibited a stronger oh signal compared with the ef process it indicated that visible light assistance could enhance the catalytic ability of the feooh cf cathode for h2o2 activation as a result smr removal was significantly improved in the vis ef process to elucidate the reason for the enhanced oh generation xps analyses for the raw and used feooh cf cathodes were employed to investigate interfacial electronic interactions and surface element changes fig 8a showed high resolution xps spectra of o 1 s for the raw and used cathodes the o1 spectra of raw feooh cf can be divided into five peaks assigned to fe o fe 530 3 ev fe o c 531 1 ev fe o h 531 9 ev co 533 0 ev and adsorbed h o h 533 9 ev 38 the formation of fe o c bonding by the electrodeposition method indicated a strong interaction between feooh and cf which is beneficial to improving electron transfer and stability of feooh cf cathodes furthermore fe species evolution was studied by high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p as shown in fig 8b two peaks at 712 ev and 725 ev can be observed in both spectra corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 of feooh 39 compared with the raw cathode fe 2p1 2 shifted slightly toward high binding energy for both used cathodes indicating fe ii was generated on feooh 40 especially the binding energy shift for vis ef used cathode was 0 91 ev while that for ef used cathode was 0 52 ev upon spectra fitting it can be calculated that the percentage of fe ii for raw ef used and vis ef used cathode were 45 9 48 6 and 50 2 respectively clearly it demonstrated that fe iii fe ii cycle in the vis ef process was significantly improved although cathode reduction could potentially initiate fe iii fe ii cycle visible light assistance should be a predominant reason the degraded intermediates of smr in the vis ef system were analyzed by hplc ms based on the experimental results and reported studies the possible degradation pathway of smr was proposed in fig s6 as depicted the appearance of intermediate a m z 173 and intermediate b m z 109 indicated that the sn bond in smr was first attacked by oh then the amino group in a was converted into the nitro group while the methyl group in b was carboxylated yielding intermediate c m z 187 and intermediate d m z 139 respectively upon ongoing oxidation the breakage of the rings in c and d would produce some short chain carboxylic acids which were finally mineralized into co2 and h2o in summary cleavage of the sn bond was the main degradation pathway of smr in the vis ef system based on the results and discussions presented above the possible catalytic mechanism of the vis ef system was proposed in fig 9 in a typical vis ef process the fe iii of feooh was first induced by proton to form ofe iii oh2 2 the unstable state of fe iii inside feooh could be used for fe ii formation by cathode reduction more importantly a chemical bond rupture of ofe iii oh2 2 could occur under visible light irradiation enhancing fe ii formation and the subsequent fenton reaction 21 41 moreover the enhanced electron transfer via fe o c bonding on feooh cf also favored the iron state transformation of feooh thus activating the in situ generated h2o2 to produce abundant oh 22 42 accordingly an excellent smr removal performance of feooh cf cathode can be achieved in the vis ef process 3 5 stability and applicability for feooh cf cathode in vis ef process the stability of the feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was investigated in fig 10 fe leaching of fenton catalysts has always been a concern in terms of material stability and environmental risk after 90 min reaction the leaching concentration of total fe was only 0 43 mg l which is far lower than the discharge limit of the european union 2 0 mg l fig 10a notably the total electrodeposited fe of the as prepared cathode was measured to be 8 52 mg cm2 upon calculation only 0 13 of total electrodeposited fe was leached to the solution in one run although the proton induced formation of unstable ofe iii oh2 2 may cause the detachment of fe iii from feooh such a low fe leaching for feooh cf cathode should be ascribed to the strong interaction between feooh and cf via fe o c bonding meanwhile the corresponding current response was maintained at about 0 025 a without obvious fluctuation during the treatment further confirming the good stability fig s3b moreover the stability of the feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was evaluated by consecutive runs fig 10b after 8 runs the smr removal rate decreased from 94 41 to 81 92 that is to say there is about a 13 22 reduction in the vis ef catalytic ability of the feooh cf cathode compared with its initial ability clearly the cathode can be reused by simply deionized water rinsing without any special treatments overall the as prepared feooh cf cathode exhibited some advantages in terms of metal leaching and catalyst agglomeration and recovery as compared with the reported feooh based fenton catalytic materials 18 21 by comparing with various advanced oxidation technologies it can be found that the vis ef system in this study has a very comparable smr removal performance table s1 finally the applicability of feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process was investigated by treating actual secondary wastewater collected from a local chemical industry park water quality characteristics listed in table s2 the results are shown in fig 11 after 90 min of treatment the cod removal rate in the vis ef process was 70 8 while that in the ef process was only 53 6 moreover the economy can be analyzed in terms of specific energy consumption sec kwh kg cod although visible light irradiation is provided using a xe lamp in the experiment the utilization of solar energy without light source equipment should be prioritized in practical water treatment thus only electrical energy consumption is taken into account in the economic analysis according to the corresponding current response fig s7 visible light assistance decreased the sec value from 12 48 to 8 98 kwh kg cod ismail et al conducted a comprehensive contrast of energy consumption analysis for various ef processes and summarized that electrical energy consumption of ef technology was in the range of several to tens of kwh kg cod 43 therefore the economy of this vis ef system followed the reasonable route of ef technology these results indicated good applicability of feooh cf cathode in the vis ef process which is promising for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance 4 environmental implications and perspectives taken together promoting the fe iii fe ii cycle of fe functionalized hetero ef cathodes is highly desired for actual applications compared to the reported studies we believe that the improvement of our work lies in 1 an economically feasible visible light or solar assisted ef vis ef system was first constructed with feooh cf cathode which has catalysis ability and visible light activation 2 a simple electrodeposition method was applied to endow the as prepared electrode with improved electron transfer and good stability as a result the as prepared feooh cf cathode exhibited some advantages in terms of metal leaching and catalyst agglomeration and recovery as compared with the reported feooh based fenton catalytic materials with the visible light assistance fe iii fe ii cycle was significantly promoted and the smr removal rate was increased by 110 compared with the pristine ef process in addition the applicable ph range could be expanded to a mild condition in this system for actual secondary wastewater treatment good applicability could be reflected by the improved cod removal rate and decreased sec value overall these findings demonstrateed feooh cf would be a promising hetero ef cathode for practical water treatment with solar energy assistance despite these advantages some issues still need to be addressed in future studies although the electrodeposition method has demonstrated good prospects in the improvement of hetero ef cathode property the lab scale preparation of these electrodes is quite different from their large scale manufacture in the latter case special attention should be paid to the operating conditions such as electrolytes concentration electrodeposition voltage electrodeposition time as well as electrodeposition device so that the catalyst can be uniformly and firmly coated in addition the techno economic analysis only considered the mineralization current efficiency and energy consumption in the lab scale electrochemical process although solar energy without light source equipment would be prioritized in practical water treatment the utilization efficiency of solar energy should also be considered when scaling up the process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
