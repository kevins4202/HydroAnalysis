4735,the naturally occurring ra isotopes 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 226ra t1 2 1 600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 7 y and rn 222rn t1 2 3 82 d have been widely applied as environmental tracers the application of these radioactive tracers has mainly been restricted to the evaluation of oceanographic and land ocean interaction processes although in recent years their use has also been extended to the study of groundwater systems in this context the activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra can be instrumental in providing key information on groundwater transit times in aquifers and those processes governing groundwater discharge into the coastal sea often referred to as submarine groundwater discharge or sgd this work evaluates the potential use of these activity ratios as proxies for investigating groundwater systems through an advective transport model that integrates the radionuclides involved in these activity ratios 224ra 228ra 226ra and 222rn and their immediate parents into a single formulation the results provided by the transport model indicate that the main factors controlling the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios are the alpha recoil supply the retardation factor of ra and the groundwater transit times the advective transport model and the activity ratios are used to present novel applications that interrelate the disciplines of hydrogeology and coastal oceanography the main applications include the determination of groundwater transit times and the assessment of pathways and end members related to submarine groundwater discharge processes these

their use is especially significant in subsurface waters where the availability of other observational or monitoring techniques are very limited hydrogeological tracers provide key information about the characteristics of groundwater flow e g origins pathways velocities and transit times leibundgut and seibert 2011 this enables the investigation of different processes affecting the quantity and quality of groundwater resources such as climate and land use changes pollution and overexploitation of aquifers and intrusion of seawater in coastal aquifers lerner and harris 2009 werner et al 2013 any element with known geochemical behavior and present in small but measurable amounts in groundwater can be potentially used as a hydrological tracer the naturally occurring radium isotopes 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 226ra t1 2 1 600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 7 y and radon 222rn t1 2 3 8 d are promising hydrogeological tracers because 1 ra isotopes and rn are continuously produced by their direct parents from rocks or sediments in the aquifers resulting in measurable activities in groundwater 2 they belong to different naturally occurring decay chains u and th allowing the differentiation of origins and pathways of groundwater and 3 they have different half lives allowing the assessment of processes occurring at different temporal scales the geochemical behavior of ra isotopes and rn in groundwater systems has been studied by many researchers in recent decades in the late 70 s these radionuclides were recognized as significant mining derived contaminants of soils and groundwater international atomic energy agency 1984 later on the understanding of processes controlling their distribution in coastal aquifers became fundamental for the application of these isotopes as tracers of submarine groundwater discharge sgd e g gonneea et al 2008 michael et al 2011 whilst ra isotopes and rn are widely applied by marine scientific communities interested in quantifying groundwater derived inputs of solutes to the coastal ocean e g moore 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 their use is still limited in coastal and inland hydrogeological studies only a few applications have been carried out to evaluate velocities of groundwater and groundwater seawater residence times in coastal aquifers most of these studies have used single radionuclides or the activity ratios of radionuclides from different decay chains e g duque et al 2019 kiro et al 2013 2014 2015 luo and jiao 2019 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2017 in contrast the application of the activity ratios ars of radionuclides from the same decay chain which only requires the evaluation of the parent daughter relationship has been underexploited in hydrogeology this is mainly because the classical analysis of ra isotopes and rn in groundwater is commonly performed by using advective transport models that deal separately with each radionuclide e g krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2019 consequently these models do not account for the dependency of the production rates on the temporal distribution of parent radionuclide activities the development of transport models that include not only the target radionuclide but also the direct parent in the formulation is thus fundamental for the application of these radionuclides and their activity ratios in groundwater studies in this study we propose the use of the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra which are pairs of radionuclides belonging to the same decay chain as proxies of hydrogeological processes the aim of this study is thus to provide a comprehensive analysis of the processes that exert a control on the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater e g production rates retardation and transit times and to present novel applications which interrelate the disciplines of hydrogeology determination of groundwater transit times and coastal oceanography evaluating pathways and end members of sgd to this aim an improved advective transport model that integrates all radionuclides from the same decay chain into a single formulation was developed the advective transport model and the applications of the ars were tested at the experimental site of argentona a mediterranean coastal aquifer 2 advective transport model of radionuclides the activities of radionuclides in groundwater are controlled by their production and decay rates their geochemical behavior and the characteristics of the groundwater flow e g groundwater velocity and transit times swarzenski 2007 the production rates of radionuclides depend on the activities of their parent radionuclide dissolved in groundwater and adsorbed on aquifer solids the radionuclides produced by the α decay of their parent radionuclides e g 224ra 228ra and 222rn from 228th 232th and 226ra respectively are additionally supplied by a process commonly known as α recoil sun and semkow 1998 this process consists of the mobilization of the daughter radionuclide from the outer mineral lattice the effective α recoil zone of the sediment grains to groundwater due to the energy of an α decay mehta and kocar 2018 sun and semkow 1998 the effective α recoil zone comprises the area of the mineral lattice where an α decay may potentially result in the mobilization of the generated target radionuclide from solid to groundwater sun and semkow 1998 different u and th decay chain radionuclides have specific geochemical properties that determine their enrichment in groundwater thorium is mainly associated with solid phases due to its particle reactive behavior and its activities are therefore commonly negligible in groundwater swarzenski 2007 radium is produced by the decay from th and its distribution is governed by a set of geochemical processes such as adsorption desorption precipitation and weathering porcelli 2008 these geochemical processes depend on both the characteristics of the geological matrix e g mineralogy grain size cationic exchange capacity beck and cochran 2013 krishnaswami et al 1982 swarzenski 2007 and the geochemical signature of the groundwater e g ph fe and mn content ionic strength gonneea et al 2008 sajih et al 2014 webster et al 1995 radon is produced from the decay of ra and recoiled directly into groundwater since it is not affected by any chemical reaction e g precipitation adsorption or cationic exchange due to its unreactive nature however in the surficial part of unconfined aquifers first cm to m where groundwater is in contact with air the evasion of rn may represent a relevant sink term that needs to be accounted for rn losses to the atmosphere chiefly depend on groundwater temperature and salinity atmospheric pressure and sediment porosity or rock permeability barberio et al 2018 in order to evaluate all the possible sources and sinks of radionuclides in groundwater we formulate two types of mass balances for all radionuclides in a decay chain one for the radionuclides contained in the sediment grains of the aquifer which we refer to as the solid part and another one for the radionuclides dissolved in groundwater and adsorbed onto solid surfaces which we refer to as the exchangeable part solid part for the mass balance in the solid part we assume that 1 it is not affected by the processes occurring at the surface groundwater interface i e exchangeable part such as ionic exchange or weathering and 2 it is in steady state conditions that is the activities do not change with time the model considers the radioactive decay and production of the target radionuclide including the process of α recoil the α recoil process is included by a parameter α recoil factor μ that represents the fraction of α decays occurring in the solid part that are transferred to the exchangeable part 0 μ 1 the activities in the solid part can be formulated as 1 s i c o n s t a n t i 1 s i 1 μ i 1 s i 1 i 2 n where i is the radionuclide number in the decay chain e g i 1 for 232th and i 2 for 228ra and s bq m 3 of aquifer is the sediment or solid activity the activity produced by the mobilization from the solid mineral lattice of the sediment grains to the exchangeable part via α recoil f bq m 3 of water can be expressed as follows 2 f i 0 i 1 f i μ i 1 s i 1 ϕ 1 i 2 n where ϕ is the aquifer porosity notice that by substituting equation 1 into equation 2 we can express the α recoil f without the α recoil factor μ 3 f i 0 i 1 f i s i 1 s i ϕ 1 i 2 n moreover the sum of the α recoil of all radionuclides in a decay chain must equal the sediment activity of the first isotope s 1 minus that of the last isotope s n eq 4 provided that the sediment activity of an isotope is always lower than that of its parent s i s i 1 eq 1 and that α recoil is the only process that produces this disequilibrium within sediment grains 4 i 2 n f i s 1 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 s n ϕ 1 s 1 s n ϕ 1 equations 2 and 3 may be used to establish the α recoil of the various radionuclides exchangeable part the mass balance of the exchangeable part considers 1 the transport of radionuclides in groundwater 2 the decay of the dissolved and adsorbed target radionuclide and 3 the production from the parent radionuclide content in groundwater on the solid surfaces and in the alpha recoil zone the model assumes that the dissolved and adsorbed radionuclides are in chemical equilibrium and can be expressed as follows 5 ϕ b i t l a i ϕ λ i b i i 1 ϕ b i t l a i ϕ λ i b i ϕ λ i b i 1 ϕ λ i f i i 2 n where a bq m 3 of water is the activity in the water hereinafter dissolved activities b bq m 3 of water is the activity in the exchangeable part dissolved and adsorbed t s is time λ s 1 is the decay constant and l a bq m 3 s 1 is a linear operator for transport which may include terms for advection diffusion and dispersion bear 1972 6 l a q a ϕ d a where q m s 1 is the darcy flux vector and d is a tensor for diffusion dispersion coefficients the transport equation eq 5 is a general equation that can be simplified by assuming steady state conditions b t 0 neglecting the effect of dispersive and diffusive transport relative to advective one l a q a and defining a travel time hereinafter transit time τ s along a flow path x m such that 7 x t τ t 0 v d t d a d τ v a where v m s 1 is the groundwater velocity vector v ϕ 1 q subsequently the transport equation eq 5 becomes 8 a i τ λ i r i a i i 1 a i τ λ i r i a i λ i r i 1 a i 1 λ i f i i 2 n or 9 b i τ λ i r i b i i 1 b i τ λ i r i b i λ i r i b i 1 λ i r i f i i 2 n for dissolved eq 8 and exchangeable eq 9 activities where r is a linear retardation factor r b i r i a i retardation is considered to be the reduction of the average velocity of a solute relative to the groundwater velocity mckinley and alexander 1993 due to the different solid solution interaction processes e g precipitation dissolution ionic exchange indeed the retardation factor depends on the groundwater composition e g salinity ph the characteristics of the geological matrix e g cationic exchange capacity grain size and the geochemistry and half life of each radionuclide thus in a homogeneous system i e no changes in geology or groundwater composition the retardation factor is unique for each isotope in the decay chain and can take values from 1 for unreactive elements such as rn to infinite krishnaswami et al 1982 when the main process of exchange between solid surfaces and solution is ionic exchange the retardation factor can be directly related to the distribution coefficient michael et al 2011 10 r 1 k d ρ b ϕ where k d m3 kg 1 is the distribution coefficient the ratio of solid phase to solute concentrations of radionuclide and ρ b kg m 3 is the sediment dry bulk mass density michael et al 2011 under this assumption all isotopes from a certain element have the same retardation factor provided that the adsorption desorption processes are faster than the decay rates of the considered isotopes krishnaswami et al 1982 a particular case of the transport equation eq 9 would be when the exchangeable and dissolved activities do not change with groundwater transit times r i a i τ b i τ 0 we refer to this particular case as bulk radioactive equilibrium which considers the production and decay of a radionuclide in its dissolved and adsorbed form plus the α recoil supply from the solid in this case eq 9 becomes 11 b i 0 i 1 b i b i 1 f i i 2 n the use of the transport model presented here has some limitations and considerations that should be taken into account before its application the model neglects two processes that might influence the activities of radionuclides in groundwater weathering and chemical precipitation whilst these processes might be relevant in specific areas e g co precipitation of ra under high concentrations of barite or carbonates or in the presence of fe and mn hydro oxides beneš et al 1984 gonneea et al 2013 they are often assumed to play a minor role in the distribution of ra isotopes in groundwaters in comparison to the production decay and adsorption desorption terms porcelli 2008 the model also neglects potential rn losses to the atmosphere which are expected to be negligible in aquifers however if weathering precipitation and or evasion rates are hypothesized as relevant in the studied system a source sink term can be factored into the model s formulation i e eq 5 to account for these processes the assumption of steady state conditions i e activities not varying with time b t 0 which is a common assumption for most of the advective transport models e g krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2019 2017 may not be valid for systems subjected to non periodical forcing such as waves strong precipitation events i e variable recharge sea level variability or sea level rise robinson et al 2018 therefore a proper characterization of the processes affecting the study site and the activities of radionuclides is needed to apply the model presented in this study it should be noted however that the average time that the radium isotopes reside in the system a t 0 depends on both the decay constant and the retardation factor of each radionuclide i e 1 λ r the assumption of steady state should thus be validated on this temporal scale rodellas et al 2021 for instance the dissolved activities of 226ra may reach steady state in 8 days and 23 years for fresh r ra 10 5 and saline r ra 10 2 groundwater respectively the model also considers that groundwater is flowing through a homogeneous aquifer i e constant r and b f and thus neglects potential heterogeneities of the aquifer matrix that can influence the parameters of the model finally the model neglects dispersion and other mixing processes this is particularly relevant for the saltwater freshwater interphase in coastal aquifers where the different end members mix therefore the model may only be applicable to either the fresh or the saline part of an aquifer provided that groundwater is sufficiently enriched in ra and rn isotopes in the appendices appendix a a simple analytical solution for equation 9 was deduced by using vector matrix notation the analytical solution is used in the following sections to assess the behavior of th ra and rn in groundwater section 3 1 and to evaluate the role of α recoil and retardation of ra in the distribution of ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater section 3 2 and 3 3 respectively it should be noted that the analysis of the model parameters assumes that the activities of the inflowing water into the aquifer are negligible compared to those in groundwater this assumption may be valid for most of the groundwater systems since the activities of surficial waters are commonly of orders of magnitude lower than those in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 however this assumption may not be valid in sites where inflowing water is highly enriched in long lived radionuclides e g mining waters dias da cunha et al 2014 the input parameters used for the model in each section are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 thorium radium and radon enrichment in groundwater in this section we use the advective transport model see appendix a to evaluate the different enrichment rates of th ra and rn in groundwater flowing through an aquifer for this purpose a particular case is considered in which the groundwater flowing through the aquifer is saline and the production rate only depends on the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide b i 1 i e there is no α recoil f 0 therefore typical retardation factors for th and ra in saline groundwater were used 1010 and 103 respectively kumar et al 2020 michael et al 2011 and an arbitrary exchangeable activity for the parent radionuclides 232th and 230th of 104 bq m 3 was imposed as exchangeable activity at the inflow boundary of the flow path b0 see table 1 notice that the selected b 0 has no influence on the different radionuclide enrichment rates the evolution of the activities for the different radionuclides as a function of groundwater transit times is shown in fig 1 the results indicate that the effect of groundwater transit times on the activities of 232th and 230th is negligible due to its large retardation factor fig 1a and c nevertheless the exchangeable activities for 228th may be lower than those of 232th this is because the production rate of 228th depends on the activities of 228ra which is partially dissolved in groundwater and can be removed by advective flow fig 1a the activities of rn isotopes in groundwater increase with transit time reaching the equilibrium with the exchangeable activity of its parent ra at a specific groundwater transit time fig 1a and c since rn is a noble gas i e not affected by chemical reactions the characteristic groundwater transit time for achieving the equilibrium with its parent corresponds to the time to reach secular equilibrium with ra 7 t1 2 7 min and 27 days for 220rn and 222rn respectively because it only depends on the half live of each isotope r rn 1 similarly the activities of ra isotopes increase with groundwater transit times in this case however the rate of increase and the specific time at which ra isotopes achieve equilibrium with the exchangeable activities of their parent th not only depend on their half lives but also on the retardation factor of ra consequently ra isotopes require shorter groundwater transit times for achieving their equilibrium activities i e a τ 0 in groundwater minutes hours and months for 224ra with 228th 228ra with 232th and 226ra with 230th respectively than those needed to achieve radioactive secular equilibrium with their parents 25 days 40 years and 10 000 years for 224ra 228ra and 226ra respectively notice that the exchangeable activities of the daughter radionuclides are always lower than the exchangeable activities of their direct parents until they reach equilibrium b i b i 1 at a specific transit time fig 1a and c once this equilibrium is reached the dissolved ars between daughter and parent radionuclides can be described by a i a i 1 r i 1 r i since b i a i r i thus the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra under these conditions are 1 and r ra respectively as shown in fig 2 notably these ars for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are sometimes lower than those found in natural groundwaters e g copenhaver et al 1993 1992 krishnaswami et al 1991 moise et al 2000 vinson et al 2013 2009 this is because in this analysis the production rate is assumed to depend solely on the exchangeable activity b i 1 of the parent radionuclide implicitly neglecting the role of the supply from the effective α recoil zone therefore ars found in natural groundwater samples cannot be explained without explicit consideration of the α recoil supply 3 2 the effect of alpha recoil supply on 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the mobilization of radionuclides from the solid to groundwater due to the energy of an α decay commonly known as α recoil may be an important source of rn and ra isotopes to groundwater e g kigoshi 1971 sun and semkow 1998 swarzenski 2007 in this section the models of the solid part and exchangeable part see section 2 are used to evaluate 1 the role of the grain size in the α recoil 2 the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars and 3 the importance of the α recoil supply relative to the source from the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide 3 2 1 the role of grain size in the supply from alpha recoil the supply from α recoil to groundwater depends on the activity of the parent radionuclide in the sediment grains or solids s as well as on the fraction of α decays occurring in the sediment grains that recoil into groundwater i e α recoil factor μ to evaluate the α recoil factor a similar analysis to the one presented by porcelli 2008 is proposed this analysis is based on the determination of the fraction of α derived nuclides recoiling into groundwater from the volume ratio of the effective α recoil zone to the total sediment grain for this approach it is assumed that 1 the sediment grains are spherical 2 the volume of the effective α recoil zone depends on the characteristic travel distance of the generated α decay daughter radionuclide d α µm 3 the parent radionuclide is uniformly distributed in the sediment grain 4 only half of the α decays occurring in the α recoil zone effectively recoil in groundwater and 5 only α emitters produce the mobilization of the daughter radionuclide this gives the following relation between the α recoil factor μ and grain diameter d µm 12 μ 1 2 1 d 2 d α 3 d 2 3 3 d α d 6 d α 2 d 2 4 d α 3 d 3 notice that if the grain diameter is much higher than the α recoil travel distance d d α eq 12 can be simplified to μ 3 d α d in fig 3 a the α recoil factor μ is evaluated for different grain diameters as expected the α recoil factor decreases as the diameter of the sediment grain increases e g the α recoil supply from sandy sediments is thus expected to be lower relative to muddy sediments the ratio between the α recoil supply of daughter and parent radionuclides for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs can be derived from equation 1 and 2 as follows 13 f ra 224 f ra 228 μ th 228 μ th 232 1 μ th 232 14 f rn 222 f ra 226 μ ra 226 μ th 230 1 μ th 230 considering the average α recoil distances reported by sun and semkow 1998 407 381 370 and 331 å for 224ra 222rn 226ra and 228ra respectively and the derived α recoil vs grain diameter relationship fig 3a the α recoil pair ratios increase with grain diameter towards the values 1 2 and 1 0 for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs respectively these values result from the ratio between average α recoil distances for daughter radionuclides relative to the parent radionuclides 3 2 2 the bulk radioactive equilibrium of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the bulk radioactive equilibrium is a particular situation in which the activity of a radionuclide does not change with groundwater transit time r i a i τ b i τ 0 since its production rate both from exchangeable and α recoil sources equals its decay rate the radioactive equilibrium of dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra including the supply by α recoil can be derived from equation 11 a τ 0 taking into consideration that the exchangeable activities of 228th are in equilibrium with its parent bth 228 bra 228 see fig 1 15 a ra 224 a ra 228 1 f ra 224 b th 232 f ra 228 16 a rn 222 a ra 226 r ra 1 f rn 222 b th 230 f ra 226 these equilibriums depend on 1 the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide b th 232 for 224ra 228ra and b th 230 for 222rn 226ra 2 the retardation factor of ra in the case of the 222rn 226ra ar and 3 the successive α recoil inputs eqs 1 3 the α recoil supply strongly influences the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the ars actually the equilibrium of the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra derived from equation 15 and 16 range from 1 0 and r ra when α recoil is negligible b f to 2 2 and 2 r ra when α recoil is the dominant source term f b respectively notice that the maximum equilibrium for dissolved ars is obtained when using the maximum recoil supply ratios of 1 2 and 1 0 for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs respectively the estimated ranges of ars are similar to those already suggested by porcelli 2008 therefore groundwaters presenting ars outside of these ranges are indicative of transit times shorter than those needed to achieve the bulk radioactive equilibrium hereinafter characteristic equilibrium transit times 3 2 3 alpha recoil vs exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide the relative importance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide b and α recoil f sources not only influences the equilibrium ars when a τ 0 but also their concentration in groundwater it should be noted however that this relative importance b f has no influence on the characteristic equilibrium transit times the advective transport model is used in this section to evaluate the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra depending on groundwater transit times for different ratios between exchangeable activity and α recoil see table 1 the results displayed in fig 4 show that higher α recoil supply values in comparison to the exchangeable source b f 10 2 produce ars above the equilibrium ars equation 15 and 16 for transit times lower than the characteristic equilibrium transit time these ars decrease towards the equilibrium values as groundwater transit time increases fig 4 maximum ars are indeed observed when the exchangeable activities are negligible b 0 and transit times are short as already noticed by krishnaswami et al 1982 these maximum values equal the ratio between the decay constants of the daughter and parent radionuclide for each ar λ ra 224 λ ra 228 5 8 102 for 224ra 228ra and λ rn 222 λ ra 226 1 5 10 5 for 222rn 226ra these high ars result from the faster regeneration of the short lived relative to long lived radionuclides gleeson et al 2013 rodellas et al 2017 tamborski et al 2018 and are in agreement with the high ars found in areas exposed to short scale processes such as porewater exchange or beach face recirculation e g alorda kleinglasset al 2019 charette et al 2003 moore et al 2011 conversely the ars fall below the equilibrium values when the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide is considerably higher than the α recoil b f 10 3 as already noticed in the previous section i e neglecting the role of the α recoil supply fig 3 it is also worth noting that the relevance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide relative to α recoil b f may be lower for 224ra 228ra than for 222rn 226ra this is because 232th is the first radionuclide of the decay chain and thus its mobilization from mineral lattice to exchangeable fraction adsorbed and dissolved is not affected by α recoil and may only depend on weathering processes e g dissolution breakdown of rocks or minerals porcelli 2008 conversely 230th is the fifth radionuclide of the 238u decay chain and its exchangeable activities are derived from the exchangeable content of its parent radionuclide 234u plus an additional recoil source f u 234 3 3 the effect of ra retardation factor on 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the distribution of radionuclides in groundwater is strongly affected by their retardation factors mckinley and alexander 1993 in order to model the distribution of a certain radionuclide by using the advective transport model proposed in this study appendix a the retardation factors from the target and parent radionuclides should be known r u r th r ra and r rn evaluating ar distribution is simpler since only the retardation factors of the involved radionuclides are required in the case of the 222rn 226ra ar as rn is the direct daughter of 226ra and is a noble gas r rn 1 only the retardation factor of ra is needed for the ar of 224ra 228ra the retardation factors of th and ra are required because 224ra is produced from 228th nevertheless since the retardation factor of th is commonly of orders of magnitude higher than that of ra 108 to 1010 for th and 10 to 106 for ra kumar et al 2020 thibault et al 1990 it has a negligible effect on the ar of 224ra 228ra a fixed r th of 1010 is used in this study but identical results would have been obtained using a r th of 108 in this section the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are evaluated against transit times for different ra retardation factors fig 5 a and b to do so an arbitrary ratio between exchangeable activity and α recoil sources b f of 10 is set and we consider ionic exchange as the principal mechanism of exchangeable dissolved transfer of radionuclides table 1 as already shown in previous sections both ars achieve bulk radioactive equilibrium eqs 15 and 16 after a characteristic transit time this characteristic transit time for reaching equilibrium strongly depends on the retardation factor of ra and on the decay constants of each pair of radionuclides λ ra 224 and λ ra 228 for 224ra 228ra and λ rn 222 and λ ra 226 for 222rn 226ra the characteristic transit time decreases as the retardation factor increases in other words the ra losses due to advective transport i e da d τ v a eq 7 are higher when ra is predominantly desorbed i e low retardation factors 100 than when ra is mostly associated with solid surfaces i e high retardation factors 106 however it should be noted that while the ra retardation factor does not influence the 224ra 228ra ar in equilibrium it does strongly influence the 222rn 226ra ar in equilibrium eq 16 as shown in fig 5a and b 3 4 characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit time the characteristic equilibrium transit time for the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars to reach bulk radioactive equilibrium provides key information on the determination of groundwater transit times as shown in previous sections characteristic equilibrium transit times are highly dependent on the retardation factor of ra r ra but they are independent of the relative importance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide and α recoil sources b f here the characteristic equilibrium transit times for the ars of both 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra as a function of the ra retardation factor are estimated fig 6 higher retardation factors characteristic of freshwater environments 10 6 result in shorter times for equilibrium 0 1 days for 224ra 228ra and 100 days for 222rn 226ra due to the minor effect of advection losses conversely lower retardation factors characteristic of saline environments require longer equilibrium transit times 3 years and 3000 years for 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra respectively notice that the equilibrium transit times are approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher for 222rn 226ra than for 224ra 228ra mainly as a consequence of the different decay constants of 226ra and 228ra λ ra 228 λ ra 226 see table 1 thus from fig 6 three main areas can be identified depending on whether the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra are in equilibrium or not a first evaluation of groundwater transit times can thus be easily obtained from this simple analysis when the ars are measured in groundwater samples and the retardation factor of ra is constrained 3 5 applications of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios 3 5 1 groundwater transit times determination in this section the potential applications of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars for determining transit times of groundwater flowing through an aquifer are tested the advective transport model presented in this study appendix a can be used to determine groundwater transit times in different hydrological environments including inland and coastal aquifers and for different groundwater compositions fresh brackish and saline groundwater notice that the application of these ars for determining groundwater transit times in freshwater systems is more complex since the solubility of ra isotopes in pristine groundwater is usually low however in recent years there have been many advances in the quantification of low concentrations of ra isotopes diego feliu et al 2020 molina porras et al 2017a as well as in their application to freshwater environments molina porras et al 2020 2017b the two main applications of the model are 1 the determination of groundwater transit times between two sampling points located in the same flow path where the groundwater ra and rn activities of each sample are used to set the initial inflow a 0 and the final outflow a boundary activities of ra isotopes and rn and 2 the estimation of transit times from a recharge point i e infiltration of water through the aquifer or seawater intrusion to a sampling point also known as groundwater age where the activities of the inflowing water are used to set the initial inflow activities a 0 and the sampling point is used to set the outflow boundary activities a moreover groundwater velocities can be derived from transit times if the flow path length from recharge or between the two sampling points is known eq 7 the implementation of this method requires not only the quantification of 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra ars but also requires constraining the retardation factor of ra r ra and the relation between production rates derived from the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide and α recoil b f see section 3 2 and 3 3 the retardation factor of ra can be determined from in situ measurements copenhaver et al 1992 mckinley and alexander 1993 or otherwise estimated from the distribution coefficient of ra kd eq 10 michael et al 2011 the most common techniques for determining kd are batch adsorption desorption experiments e g beck and cochran 2013 rama and moore 1996 tachi et al 2001 willett and bond 1995 adsorption desorption modelling e g copenhaver et al 1993 webster et al 1995 flow through columns tests e g meier et al 2015 relyea 1982 and chemical equilibrium calculations puigdomenech and bergstrom 1995 moreover many authors provided referential values for ra distribution coefficients under different conditions for example a recent review compiled the kds of ra from different experimental settings kumar et al 2020 beck and cochran 2013 provided new insights into the distribution coefficient of ra under different solid and solution compositions e g salinity ph bet surface and michael et al 2011 reviewed the most common kds for ra in fresh and brackish groundwater whether experimentally determined or literature based the retardation factor of ra used in this method may be one of the main sources of uncertainty especially in heterogeneous systems with strong variations in groundwater salinity see section 3 3 differentiating the production rate derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide with the production from α recoil is still challenging the reported methods are mainly based on the determination of production rates for both processes together and can be summarized in 1 experimental determination of emanation rates and the content of the parent isotope in the sediment grains hussain 1995 rama and moore 1984 semkow 1990 2 radioactive equilibration experiments tamborski et al 2019 3 theoretical calculations focused on determining the α recoil supply based on several properties of the host material e g density surface area kigoshi 1971 sun and semkow 1998 4 mathematical fitting with advective transport models krest and harvey 2003 and 5 determination via the recoil rate of 222rn copenhaver et al 1992 krishnaswami et al 1991 1982 alternatively this term can also be estimated by the concurrent determination of the sediment activity s and the surface bound activity of the target radionuclide i e adsorbed activity sun and torgersen 1998 performed multi step leaching experiments in clay sediments 20 to 60 µm particle grain size from long island sound usa estimating a surface bound 224ra activity of 10 bq kg 1 turekian et al 1996 determined the sediment 228th activity in similar sediment samples from the same location 50 bq kg 1 assuming the sediment to be in radioactive equilibrium and an α recoil factor characteristic of clays 10 1 to 10 2 see fig 3 the ratio b f for this sediment type may range from 2 to 20 once these parameters 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra ars r ra and b f ratio are constrained groundwater transit times can be determined using two different approaches the first approach consists of comparing the measured ars with the bulk radioactive equilibrium ars eqs 15 and 16 in order to determine the ranges of groundwater transit times whilst this approach only enables the estimation of wide ranges of groundwater transit times it can be applied without characterizing the ratio b f which is often the most challenging parameter to determine given a specific ra retardation factor the characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit times for both ars the transit time required for the ars to achieve the bulk radioactive equilibrium can be derived directly from fig 6 if the measured groundwater samples present ars out of equilibrium ranges from 1 0 to 2 2 and r ra to 2 r ra for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively they are indicative of groundwater transit times shorter than the characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit times conversely ars within the characteristic bulk radioactive equilibrium ranges may be indicative of longer groundwater transit times relative to the characteristic equilibrium transit times fig 6 however notice that ars within these ranges may not have reached equilibrium under some ratios for exchangeable and α recoil sources e g b f ranging from 102 to 103 see fig 4 to ensure that the ars have reached equilibrium evaluating the variation of the ars at different sampling points along the studied flow path is recommended moreover this approach can only be used for determining groundwater ages since the analysis performed to derive fig 6 considers that the inflowing water has negligible initial activities of rn and ra a 0 0 the second approach is based on adjusting numerically the model presented in the appendix appendix a to the measured ars based on the input parameters of the model which comprise the retardation factor of ra the activities of the target radionuclides at the inflow boundary a 0 and the relation between the production rate derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide and the production from α recoil b f the model can be used to determine the modeled ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra for a set of groundwater transit times e g as shown in fig 5 subsequently the results of the modeled ars are compared with the measured ars at the outflow boundary to evaluate a specific groundwater transit time the uncertainties associated with the transit time determination can be assessed through a monte carlo analysis where the errors associated with each of the model s variables are considered within the monte carlo analysis 1 model variables e g r ra and b f are generated via normally distributed random values based on the mean and standard deviation of each parameter and 2 a set of stochastic simulations are performed to determine the groundwater transit time resulting from the combination of all input parameters the distribution of groundwater transit times obtained from the monte carlo analysis can be adjusted e g least square fitting to a probability density function e g normal poisson binomial beta in order to obtain the statistics for empirical distribution e g mean median standard deviation rodellas et al 2021 in the following section section 3 6 the advective transport model is used to evaluate groundwater transit times for fresh groundwater from recharge and recirculated seawater in a coastal mediterranean aquifer 3 5 2 constraining pathways and end members of sgd submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been recognized as an important process affecting the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of coastal water bodies in most studies the magnitude of sgd is inferred from ra isotopes or rn however the accuracy of these tracer based estimations is often hampered by the difficulty of characterizing the ra or rn activities in the discharging groundwater i e the sgd end member cho and kim 2016 cook et al 2018 duque et al 2019 gonneea et al 2013 michael et al 2011 most of the tracer based sgd studies are solely focused on the quantification of the flux of water and solutes via sgd without paying attention to the discharge pathways that underlie these fluxes these pathways largely determine the extent and rates of biogeochemical reactions occurring in coastal aquifers and therefore the final chemical composition of discharging fluids rodellas et al 2020 santos et al 2012 weinstein et al 2011 a detailed evaluation of sgd driven water and solute fluxes and their consequences for coastal ecosystems requires thus both a solid understanding of the dominant sgd pathways and an accurate determination of the sgd end member the advective transport model presented in this study can be applied in sgd studies to evaluate both the predominant pathways of groundwater discharge e g porewater exchange intertidal seawater recirculation terrestrial groundwater discharge michael et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2019 and the sgd end member a evaluation of predominant sgd pathways sgd can be separated into 5 main pathways according to the groundwater origin the physical forces driving the fluxes and the spatiotemporal scale of each process terrestrial groundwater discharge density driven seawater circulation seasonal exchange of seawater intertidal circulation of seawater and porewater exchange michael et al 2011 robinson et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 considering the different spatiotemporal scales of each sgd pathway and their characteristic salinities and therefore their characteristic ra retardation factor different sgd pathways are likely to present characteristic ars fig 7 as shown in fig 7 whereas short scale processes characteristics of saline environments low retardation factors such as porewater exchange or intertidal seawater recirculation will likely present ars in disequilibrium eqs 15 and 16 long scale processes involving freshwater high retardation factors such as terrestrial groundwater discharge are expected to present ars close to the bulk radioactive equilibrium eqs 15 and 16 b selection of the sgd end member once released into coastal water by sgd the activities of the short lived isotopes 224ra and 222rn are expected to decrease at a faster rate than their parent isotopes 228ra and 226ra respectively because 1 the decay rates of 224ra and 222rn are higher relative to their parents 228ra and 226ra respectively 2 222rn exhales to the atmosphere and 3 coastal waters are mixed with offshore waters which are commonly depleted in short lived 224ra and 222rn relative to long lived 228ra and 226ra isotopes thus one possible method to evaluate the sgd end member consists in comparing the measured ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in the coastal ocean ar sw with those of groundwater samples ar gw boehm et al 2006 moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2014 at a specific site when sgd is the predominant source of ra isotopes and rn to the coastal ocean i e absence of any significant source such as diffusion from sediments or rivers the ars in the coastal ocean are expected to be comparable or lower relative to those of the discharging groundwater ar sw ar gw any groundwater sample exhibiting lower ars than those measured in the coastal waters may not be representative of the dominant sgd inflowing to the study site and thus can be discarded as a relevant sgd end member 3 6 applications of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios at the argentona experimental site western mediterranean sea the applications of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars for determining groundwater transit times and evaluating the end member and pathways of sgd were tested at an experimental site located in the coastal alluvial aquifer of the argentona ephemeral stream 40 km ne of the city of barcelona western mediterranean sea fig 8 the argentona experimental site consists of 16 piezometers distributed along a perpendicular and a parallel transect to the coastline with groundwater sampling depths ranging from 15 to 25 m see folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 for more details about the experimental site the geology of the aquifer is dominated by detrital quaternary sediments that constitute layers of gravels sands and clays which are the product of chemical weathering and rock fracture of the granitic fresh groundwater flows towards the sea in the shallow part of the aquifer the upper 15 m whereas the deep aquifer area deeper than 20 m is influenced by seawater intrusion as inferred from the application of direct measurement at the piezometers and electrical resistivity tomography folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 most of the piezometers are gathered in nests n1 n3 n2 of three piezometers with screening intervals of 2 m located at different depths 15 20 and 25 m approximately fig 8 the three remaining piezometers pp 15 pp 20 and pp 18 are the closest to the sea with sampling depths of 15 20 and 18 m respectively the physicochemical parameters and the ra isotopes activities 224ra 228ra and 226ra together with 222rn were monitored over two years 2015 and 2016 additionally the retardation factor of ra was determined via adsorption desorption experiments table c 1 on sediment samples collected from two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 detailed information on the sampling analytical techniques and the monitoring of ra isotopes and rn in the argentona experimental site are provided in appendices b and c 3 6 1 groundwater transit times the hydrogeological patterns in the argentona experimental site provide a good opportunity to use the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra for the evaluation of two different processes while in the shallower part of the aquifer the proposed method is tested to estimate the groundwater transit times of fresh groundwater from recharge in the deeper part the groundwater transit times of recirculated seawater are estimated the groundwater samples collected from the piezometer at 15 m depth in nest n2 were chosen as the referential samples to evaluate transit times from upstream recharge hereinafter fresh outflow because it is the farthest piezometer from the sea 100 m and presented the lowest average salinity 0 5 indicating a negligible mixing with intruded seawater conversely groundwater samples from nest n1 at depth 20 m that exhibit the highest average salinity 32 4 were chosen to evaluate transit times for seawater recirculation saline outflow in both cases the groundwater transit time is determined from a recharge point to an outflow boundary taking into consideration that the initial activities of ra isotopes and rn in the inflowing water are negligible a 0 0 i e the determined groundwater transit time corresponds to the groundwater age this assumption is supported in this case because the activities of 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn in coastal waters are significantly lower 2 3 orders of magnitude than those in groundwater fig c 1 indicative ranges of groundwater transit times can easily be estimated solely from the measured ars and the retardation factor of ra without any extra analysis fig 9 since both the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars from the saline outflow are in disequilibrium 5 2 2 and 4500 2 r ra respectively and the experimentally determined r ra is 170 table c 1 the derived groundwater transit times should be shorter than the characteristic equilibrium transit time for the ratio 224ra 228ra 110 days fig 9 in the case of the fresh outflow the 224ra 228ra ar is in equilibrium 1 1 but the ar of 222rn 226ra is in disequilibrium 5900 and the retardation factor of ra is 2500 table c 1 thus groundwater transit times should range from the characteristic equilibrium transit time for 224ra 228ra and that for 222rn 226ra from 10 days to 5 5 years fig 9 to constrain these ranges the transit times can be more accurately determined by numerical adjustment to the model presented in the appendix appendix a which can be coupled to a monte carlo analysis using 50 000 stochastic simulations to account for the uncertainties associated with this approach the mean and the standard deviation of each model input i e 224ra 228ra 222rn 226ra and r ra was used to generate normally distributed random values in the case of the retardation factor of ra rather than using the analytical relative uncertainty 10 a higher error 25 was assumed in order to account for the potential variability of this parameter due to heterogeneities of the geological matrix and the composition of groundwater as well as its dependency on other processes such as dissolution and precipitation since the ratio between exchangeable and α recoil sources b f is unknown in the argentona experimental site the monte carlo simulations were performed for different b f ratios ranging from 0 to 50 the resulting distributions of groundwater transit times for upstream recharge and seawater recirculation were adjusted to different probability density functions pdf by using least squares fitting scipy library for the python programming language the tested pdfs included beta binomial χ2 noncentral χ2 f noncentral f gamma negative binomial normal poisson student s t and noncentral t the pdfs which best fitted the monte carlo results were noncentral t and f for the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ar derived estimates respectively the pdf statistics derived from the best fit to the data were used to derive the expected mean standard deviation median and 1st and 3rd quartile groundwater transit times the mean and standard deviation groundwater transit times for seawater recirculation were 7 3 to 54 19 days by using 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively and 330 300 days for the upstream recharge only the ar 222rn 226ra can be used since 224ra 228ra is in equilibrium notice that the relative standard deviation of the upstream recharge estimate 100 may result from 1 the high relative standard deviation of 222rn 226ra in the fresh outflow 40 and 2 the closeness of the 222rn 226ra ar to the retardation factor of ra 5900 2300 and 2500 200 respectively however 50 of the generated data via monte carlo simulations for upstream recharge fluctuate from 180 to 390 days 1st and 3rd quartile respectively the discrepancy between the groundwater transit times derived from the 224ra 228ra 7 days and 222rn 226ra 54 days ars in the saline outflow can be induced by many factors first the experimental retardation factor of ra used for the calculations was derived from adsorption desorption experiments which only consider ionic exchange thus this approach neglects the role of other processes involved in the solid solution distribution of ra isotopes such as dissolution or precipitation secondly whilst the assumption of steady state a t 0 may be a good approximation for shorter lived ra isotopes 224ra and 228ra the activities of 226ra may be more influenced by non periodical forcing such as waves strong precipitation events and sea level variability due to its longer half life robinson et al 2018 thirdly the saline outflow contains 15 of meteoric groundwater salinity of 32 4 with a different signal of radionuclides that can interfere with final estimates despite the above mentioned assumptions this assessment enables easy constraint of the temporal scales of fresh groundwater advection and seawater intrusion thereby providing thus key information for understanding the hydrological functioning of the coastal aquifer in addition to transit times in the argentona experimental site conservative groundwater velocities for the groundwater recharge and seawater recirculation can be calculated by considering that the recharge point of the ephemeral stream occurs at the midpoint between its source and the sampling piezometer n2 15 3 km inland and that the recirculation of seawater occurs at the shoreline 60 m the linear velocities estimated for the shallow fresh groundwater part 9 m d 1 are one order of magnitude higher than the ones derived from a numerical model implemented at the alluvial aquifer of the argentona ephemeral stream in 2009 0 24 m d 1 catalan water agency 2010 this discrepancy could be attributed to the assumption that the recharge point occurs at the midpoint of the aquifer since recharge in ephemeral streams commonly occurs after flood events that are more intense in the lower part of the aquifer the groundwater velocities of the intruded seawater 1 to 8 m d 1 derived from the ars are in agreement with those determined by the tidal response method at the experimental site from 10 2 to 101 m d 1 t goyetche personal communication reinforcing the validity of the developed approach 3 6 2 pathways and end members of sgd in the argentona experimental site the 12 sampling locations across the perpendicular transect to the coastline provide an appropriate framework to investigate the pathways of sgd occurring at the site following the classification based on the temporal scale and the characteristic retardation factor of ra for each pathway fig 7 three main sgd pathways can be identified by using the distribution of salinity and ars 1 terrestrial groundwater discharge derived from the lower salinities 0 5 1 7 and 224ra 228ra ars close to the equilibrium in the upper part of the aquifer n1 15 n2 15 and n3 15 2 density driven seawater circulation occurring at the deeper part of the aquifer inferred by higher salinities 28 0 32 4 and 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars in disequilibrium n1 20 n2 25 and n3 25 and 3 intertidal seawater circulation occurring at the nearshore piezometers pp 20 t and pp 15 which present intermediate salinities 1 6 9 1 and ars see table c 1 the coastal seawater collected in front of the argentona experimental site presented a 224ra 228ra ar value of 3 0 table c 1 which is above the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the 224ra 228ra ar 1 0 2 2 eqs 15 and 16 this indicates that the predominant sgd pathways may be density driven seawater circulation and or intertidal seawater circulation with a minor contribution from terrestrial groundwater discharge these results are in agreement with those obtained through the application of cross hole electrical resistivity tomography which enabled the identification of two different mixing zones near the piezometer pp 20 that may be indicative of shallower wave storm induced and deeper groundwater discharge areas folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 the ar of 222rn 226ra is not used in this case due to the low activities of 226ra in the coastal waters 12 1 dpm 100l 1 that indicate a lack of relevant sgd driven 226ra inputs in order to evaluate the appropriate sgd end member in the argentona experimental site the measured ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in the coastal ocean ar sw are compared with those from groundwater samples ar gw fig 10 the samples that were taken at the upper part of the aquifer presented lower 224ra 228ra ars 1 1 2 5 relative to the coastal seawater sample ar sw 3 0 indicating that they may not be representative end members of the dominant sgd inflowing to the study site in contrast the 224ra 228ra ars of samples from the deeper part of the aquifer 15 m were higher relative to the ar sw table c 1 and thus they could be representative samples for the sgd end member a common method of estimating the sgd end member consists in averaging the tracer concentration from several groundwater samples collected at different locations e g beck et al 2007 rapaglia et al 2010 without any ancillary information all the collected groundwater samples are usually incorporated into the average to determine the ra or rn activities of the sgd end member however this averaged activity is usually skewed by the number of groundwater samples that are not representative of the dominant discharge process using only those groundwater samples presenting comparable or higher ars relative to the coastal ocean sample ar sw ar gw enables discarding the non representative samples and thus better constrain the sgd end member in the case of the argentona experimental site for instance the average 224ra activity considering all the samples collected is 210 bq m 3 whereas this average is 320 bq m 3 if only the representative groundwater samples are included in the average this example illustrates that 224ra based sgd estimates may vary by a factor of 1 5 when the sgd end member is not appropriately constrained using these ars to better select the sgd end member might thus decisively contribute to producing more accurate sgd estimates 4 conclusions the groundwater activity ratios of radionuclides from the same decay chain such as 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are promising tools for obtaining key information on hydrogeological processes occurring in coastal and inland aquifers in this work the processes affecting these ars in groundwater are assessed through a new advective transport model that integrates all radionuclides in a decay chain into one formulation the analysis of the model s results indicates that the predominant parameters that affect the activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater are groundwater transit times α recoil supply and the retardation factor of ra r ra the ars evolve depending on groundwater transit times towards the radioactive equilibrium between parent and daughter radionuclide the α recoil supply increases activity ratios to above the equilibrium activity ratios 1 and r ra for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively which cannot be explained solely by considering production rates derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide the retardation factor of ra influences the characteristic groundwater transit times needed for achieving these equilibriums higher ra retardation factors characteristics of fresh groundwater 106 result in shorter transit times for equilibrium 0 1 days for 224ra 228ra and 100 days for 222rn 226ra due to the minor effect of advection losses conversely the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra require longer transit times to reach equilibrium 3 years and 3000 years for 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra respectively when the retardation factors of ra are low characteristics of saline groundwater 101 the ars and the advective transport model have several applications in the fields of hydrogeology and coastal oceanography and these were tested in a mediterranean coastal aquifer in hydrogeological studies the model can be used to determine transit times i e ages and velocities of groundwater evaluate the connectivity between coastal aquifer and ocean and distinguish the origins of groundwater whilst this study is focused on coastal systems the application of this model can be extended to aquifers inland provided that groundwater is sufficiently enriched in these pairs of radionuclides the use of ra isotopes and rn thus provides relevant information on aquifer processes which may be fundamental for the management of coastal groundwater resources the combination of the groundwater measured activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra and the advective transport model can also be applied to improve the estimation of sgd flows to the coastal ocean by constraining the predominant pathways of submarine groundwater discharge and the determination of the groundwater end member which is often one of

groundwater samplings and one seawater sampling were conducted in the argentona experimental site in september and december 2015 and january june march november and october 2016 before sampling the piezometers were purged to remove at least 3 times the volume of the stagnant water between 20 and 60 l of water was collected for ra isotopes and 250 ml for 222rn from each piezometer the groundwater and seawater samples collected for ra isotopes were filtered through mno2 impregnated acrylic fiber hereinafter mn fibers at a controlled flow rate lower than 1 l min 1 in order to quantitatively extract ra isotopes moore and reid 1973 after filtration the fibers were rinsed with ra free deionized water to wash out any particles and sea salt and partially dried to a water fiber ratio of 1 1

kev respectively the activities of 222rn were determined from 250 ml water bottles using the rad h2o system durridge inc this system enables the direct measurement of 222rn activities in water with the 222rn in air alpha spectrometer rad7 durridge inc b 2 determination of the ra retardation factor the retardation factor of ra r ra was determined through kd measurements adsorption desorption experiments for two sediment samples collected in the argentona ephemeral stream from core recovery at the piezometers n1 25 and n2 25 the depths of the selected sediment samples conform with the screened depth of the two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 in each corresponding nest table c 1 the determination of the distribution coefficient of ra kd m3 kg 1 requires the measurement of surface bound ras bq kg 1 and dissolved raw bq m 3 ra activities the sediment samples previously collected in the field were dried in the stove 40 c and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to remove gravels after drying and sieving the sediment samples were stored in hermetic plastic bags for at least 20 days to ensure the equilibrium between 224ra and its parent 228th adapting the method described by cai et al 2012 to determine the disequilibrium between 224ra and 228th in coastal sediment weighted sediment subsamples were mixed with synthetic water to form a slurry the salinity of the synthetic water was adjusted to the groundwater salinities measured at the piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 in the field since the processes of adsorption and desorption for ra are relatively fast e g beneš et al 1985 gonneea et al 2008 nathwani and phillips 1979 the contact time between sediment and water was adjusted to two hours after two hours the slurry was filtered using a filtration system that enables the separation of solid and solute phases the filtration system consists of a filtration chamber a büchner flask and a vacuum pump the slurry was spilled into the filtration chamber which contained a pre weighted 142 mm gff filter with 0 7 µm of nominal pore size in the filtration process the sediment is retained in the filter and the solution is conducted to a büchner flask the filtration terminates after adjusting the ratio water sediment filter of the sediment sample to 0 4 to 0 5 cai et al 2012 the recovered water in the büchner flask was filtered through mno2 impregnated acrylic fibers at a controlled flow rate 1 l min 1 moore and reid 1973 scholten et al 2010 both the activities of dissolved 224raw and surface bound 224ras ra were measured with the radecc system from the mn fiber and the sediment samples respectively the determination of the distribution coefficient of ra kd was then calculated as follows eq b 1 b 1 k d ra s 224 ra w 224 assuming a dry bulk density of the soil ρ b of 2 6 kg l 1 and a porosity ϕ of 0 3 the retardation factor of ra r ra was derived from eq 10 michael et al 2011 the quantification of ra activities with the radecc system accomplished the limits and guidelines provided by diego feliu et al 2020 and the associated uncertainties were calculated following garcia solsona et al 2008 the calibration of the detectors was made by repeatedly measuring 227ac and 232th mn fiber standards for water samples moore and cai 2013 scholten et al 2010 and by standard addition method following cai et al 2012 for sediment samples c radium and radon isotopes in the argentona experimental site the results of 222rn and ra isotopes activities against the salinity of each piezometer for different samplings in the argentona experimental site are shown in fig c 1 radium activities spanned a wide range from 10 to 940 10 to 550 and 1 to 50 bq m 3 for 224ra 228ra and 226ra respectively these variations in ra concentrations are mainly associated with differences in the geological context and in the groundwater salinity of each piezometer fig c 1 the shallow aquifer 15 m presents the lowest ra concentrations e g 10 to 50 bq m 3 of 224ra in agreement with the lowest salinity 0 5 to 2 2 in contrast the intermediate and deep piezometers presented higher activities e g 60 to 940 bq m 3 of 224ra correlating with the higher salinities 4 4 to 33 9 of the bottom aquifer radon activities were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than ra activities ranging from 5 103 to 45 103 bq m 3 nevertheless aside from the groundwater samples collected from deeper piezometers 20 m that presented higher rn concentrations 20 103 to 45 103 bq m 3 most of the groundwater samples presented relatively constant 222rn concentrations 5 103 20 103 bq m 3 fig c 1 the ars of 224ra 228ra ranged from 1 1 to 1 4 for the shallow piezometers and from 1 5 to 8 4 for the deeper piezometers 15 m depth the ars of 222rn 226ra ranged from 2700 to 5900 for shallow piezometers and 700 to 4 500 for deeper piezometers table c 1 the retardation factor of ra for the two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 table c 1 which were determined by reproducing the groundwater salinities measured at the site are 170 for the sample collected at depth 20 in the nest n1 piezometer n1 20 which is influenced by saline groundwater and 2500 for the sediment sample collected at the freshwater zone at nest n2 15 m these results are in concordance with the typical retardation factors of ra for saline and fresh groundwater respectively beck and

4735,the naturally occurring ra isotopes 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 226ra t1 2 1 600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 7 y and rn 222rn t1 2 3 82 d have been widely applied as environmental tracers the application of these radioactive tracers has mainly been restricted to the evaluation of oceanographic and land ocean interaction processes although in recent years their use has also been extended to the study of groundwater systems in this context the activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra can be instrumental in providing key information on groundwater transit times in aquifers and those processes governing groundwater discharge into the coastal sea often referred to as submarine groundwater discharge or sgd this work evaluates the potential use of these activity ratios as proxies for investigating groundwater systems through an advective transport model that integrates the radionuclides involved in these activity ratios 224ra 228ra 226ra and 222rn and their immediate parents into a single formulation the results provided by the transport model indicate that the main factors controlling the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios are the alpha recoil supply the retardation factor of ra and the groundwater transit times the advective transport model and the activity ratios are used to present novel applications that interrelate the disciplines of hydrogeology and coastal oceanography the main applications include the determination of groundwater transit times and the assessment of pathways and end members related to submarine groundwater discharge processes these

their use is especially significant in subsurface waters where the availability of other observational or monitoring techniques are very limited hydrogeological tracers provide key information about the characteristics of groundwater flow e g origins pathways velocities and transit times leibundgut and seibert 2011 this enables the investigation of different processes affecting the quantity and quality of groundwater resources such as climate and land use changes pollution and overexploitation of aquifers and intrusion of seawater in coastal aquifers lerner and harris 2009 werner et al 2013 any element with known geochemical behavior and present in small but measurable amounts in groundwater can be potentially used as a hydrological tracer the naturally occurring radium isotopes 223ra t1 2 11 4 d 224ra t1 2 3 66 d 226ra t1 2 1 600 y and 228ra t1 2 5 7 y and radon 222rn t1 2 3 8 d are promising hydrogeological tracers because 1 ra isotopes and rn are continuously produced by their direct parents from rocks or sediments in the aquifers resulting in measurable activities in groundwater 2 they belong to different naturally occurring decay chains u and th allowing the differentiation of origins and pathways of groundwater and 3 they have different half lives allowing the assessment of processes occurring at different temporal scales the geochemical behavior of ra isotopes and rn in groundwater systems has been studied by many researchers in recent decades in the late 70 s these radionuclides were recognized as significant mining derived contaminants of soils and groundwater international atomic energy agency 1984 later on the understanding of processes controlling their distribution in coastal aquifers became fundamental for the application of these isotopes as tracers of submarine groundwater discharge sgd e g gonneea et al 2008 michael et al 2011 whilst ra isotopes and rn are widely applied by marine scientific communities interested in quantifying groundwater derived inputs of solutes to the coastal ocean e g moore 2006 taniguchi et al 2019 their use is still limited in coastal and inland hydrogeological studies only a few applications have been carried out to evaluate velocities of groundwater and groundwater seawater residence times in coastal aquifers most of these studies have used single radionuclides or the activity ratios of radionuclides from different decay chains e g duque et al 2019 kiro et al 2013 2014 2015 luo and jiao 2019 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2017 in contrast the application of the activity ratios ars of radionuclides from the same decay chain which only requires the evaluation of the parent daughter relationship has been underexploited in hydrogeology this is mainly because the classical analysis of ra isotopes and rn in groundwater is commonly performed by using advective transport models that deal separately with each radionuclide e g krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2019 consequently these models do not account for the dependency of the production rates on the temporal distribution of parent radionuclide activities the development of transport models that include not only the target radionuclide but also the direct parent in the formulation is thus fundamental for the application of these radionuclides and their activity ratios in groundwater studies in this study we propose the use of the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra which are pairs of radionuclides belonging to the same decay chain as proxies of hydrogeological processes the aim of this study is thus to provide a comprehensive analysis of the processes that exert a control on the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater e g production rates retardation and transit times and to present novel applications which interrelate the disciplines of hydrogeology determination of groundwater transit times and coastal oceanography evaluating pathways and end members of sgd to this aim an improved advective transport model that integrates all radionuclides from the same decay chain into a single formulation was developed the advective transport model and the applications of the ars were tested at the experimental site of argentona a mediterranean coastal aquifer 2 advective transport model of radionuclides the activities of radionuclides in groundwater are controlled by their production and decay rates their geochemical behavior and the characteristics of the groundwater flow e g groundwater velocity and transit times swarzenski 2007 the production rates of radionuclides depend on the activities of their parent radionuclide dissolved in groundwater and adsorbed on aquifer solids the radionuclides produced by the α decay of their parent radionuclides e g 224ra 228ra and 222rn from 228th 232th and 226ra respectively are additionally supplied by a process commonly known as α recoil sun and semkow 1998 this process consists of the mobilization of the daughter radionuclide from the outer mineral lattice the effective α recoil zone of the sediment grains to groundwater due to the energy of an α decay mehta and kocar 2018 sun and semkow 1998 the effective α recoil zone comprises the area of the mineral lattice where an α decay may potentially result in the mobilization of the generated target radionuclide from solid to groundwater sun and semkow 1998 different u and th decay chain radionuclides have specific geochemical properties that determine their enrichment in groundwater thorium is mainly associated with solid phases due to its particle reactive behavior and its activities are therefore commonly negligible in groundwater swarzenski 2007 radium is produced by the decay from th and its distribution is governed by a set of geochemical processes such as adsorption desorption precipitation and weathering porcelli 2008 these geochemical processes depend on both the characteristics of the geological matrix e g mineralogy grain size cationic exchange capacity beck and cochran 2013 krishnaswami et al 1982 swarzenski 2007 and the geochemical signature of the groundwater e g ph fe and

reaction e g precipitation adsorption or cationic exchange due to its unreactive nature however in the surficial part of unconfined aquifers first cm to m where groundwater is in contact with air the evasion of rn may represent a relevant sink term that needs to be accounted for rn losses to the atmosphere chiefly depend on groundwater temperature and salinity atmospheric pressure and sediment porosity or rock permeability barberio et al 2018 in order to evaluate all the possible sources and sinks of radionuclides in groundwater we formulate two types of mass balances for all radionuclides in a decay chain one for the radionuclides contained in the sediment grains of the aquifer which we refer to as the solid part and another one for the radionuclides dissolved in groundwater and adsorbed onto solid surfaces which we refer to as the exchangeable part solid part for the mass balance in the solid part we assume that 1 it is not affected by the processes occurring at the surface groundwater interface i e exchangeable part such as ionic exchange or weathering and 2 it is in steady state conditions that is the activities do not change with time the model considers the radioactive decay and production of the target radionuclide including the process of α recoil the α recoil process is included by a parameter α recoil factor μ that represents the fraction of α decays occurring in the solid part that are transferred to the exchangeable part 0 μ 1 the activities in the solid part can be formulated as 1 s i c o n s t a n t i 1 s i 1 μ i 1 s i 1 i 2 n where i is the radionuclide number in the decay chain e g i 1 for 232th and i 2 for 228ra and s bq m 3 of aquifer is the sediment or solid activity the activity produced by the mobilization from the solid mineral lattice of the sediment grains to the exchangeable part via α recoil f bq m 3 of water can be expressed as follows 2 f i 0 i 1 f i μ i 1 s i 1 ϕ 1 i 2 n where ϕ is the aquifer porosity notice that by substituting equation 1 into equation 2 we can express the α recoil f without the α recoil factor μ 3 f i 0 i 1 f i s i 1 s i ϕ 1 i 2 n moreover the sum of the α recoil of all radionuclides in a decay chain must equal the sediment activity of the first isotope s 1 minus that of the last isotope s n eq 4 provided that the sediment activity of an isotope is always lower than that of its parent s i s i 1 eq 1 and that α recoil is the only process that produces this disequilibrium within sediment grains 4 i 2 n f i s 1 s 2 s 2 s 3 s 3 s n ϕ 1 s 1 s n ϕ 1 equations 2 and 3 may be used to establish the α recoil of the various radionuclides exchangeable part the mass balance of the exchangeable part considers 1 the transport of radionuclides in groundwater 2 the decay of the dissolved and adsorbed target radionuclide and 3 the production from the parent radionuclide content in groundwater on the solid surfaces and in the alpha recoil zone the model assumes that the dissolved and adsorbed radionuclides are in chemical equilibrium and can be expressed as follows 5 ϕ b i t l a i ϕ λ i b i i 1 ϕ b i t l a i ϕ λ i b i ϕ λ i b i 1 ϕ λ i f i i 2 n where a bq m 3 of water is the activity in the water hereinafter dissolved activities b bq m 3 of water is the activity in the exchangeable part dissolved and adsorbed t s is time λ s 1 is the decay constant and l a bq m 3 s 1 is a linear operator for transport which may include terms for advection diffusion and dispersion bear 1972 6 l a q a ϕ d a where q m s 1 is the darcy flux vector and d is a tensor for diffusion dispersion coefficients the transport equation eq 5 is a general equation that can be simplified by assuming steady state conditions b t 0 neglecting the effect of dispersive and diffusive transport relative to advective one l a q a and defining a travel time hereinafter transit time τ s along a flow path x m such that 7 x t τ t 0 v d t d a d τ v a where v m s 1 is the groundwater velocity vector v ϕ 1 q subsequently the transport equation eq 5 becomes 8 a i τ λ i r i a i i 1 a i τ λ i r i a i λ i r i 1 a i 1 λ i f i i 2 n or 9 b i τ λ i r i b i i 1 b i τ λ i r i b i λ i r i b i 1 λ i r i f i i 2 n for dissolved eq 8 and exchangeable eq 9 activities where r is a linear retardation factor r b i r i a i retardation is considered to be the reduction of the average velocity of a solute relative to

groundwater composition e g salinity ph the characteristics of the geological matrix e g cationic exchange capacity grain size and the geochemistry and half life of each radionuclide thus in a homogeneous system i e no changes in geology or groundwater composition the retardation factor is unique for each isotope in the decay chain and can take values from 1 for unreactive elements such as rn to infinite krishnaswami et al 1982 when the main process of exchange between solid surfaces and solution is ionic exchange the retardation factor can be directly related to the distribution coefficient michael et al 2011 10 r 1 k d ρ b ϕ where k d m3 kg 1 is the distribution coefficient the ratio of solid phase to solute concentrations of radionuclide and ρ b kg m 3 is the sediment dry bulk mass density michael et al 2011 under this assumption all isotopes from a certain element have the same retardation factor provided that the adsorption desorption processes are faster than the decay rates of the considered isotopes krishnaswami et al 1982 a particular case of the transport equation eq 9 would be when the exchangeable and dissolved activities do not change with groundwater transit times r i a i τ b i τ 0 we refer to this particular case as bulk radioactive equilibrium which considers the production and decay of a radionuclide in its dissolved and adsorbed form plus the α recoil supply from the solid in this case eq 9 becomes 11 b i 0 i 1 b i b i 1 f i i 2 n the use of the transport model presented here has some limitations and considerations that should be taken into account before its application the model neglects two processes that might influence the activities of radionuclides in groundwater weathering and chemical precipitation whilst these processes might be relevant in specific areas e g co precipitation of ra under high concentrations of barite or carbonates or in the presence of fe and mn hydro oxides beneš et al 1984 gonneea et al 2013 they are often assumed to play a minor role in the distribution of ra isotopes in groundwaters in comparison to the production decay and adsorption desorption terms porcelli 2008 the model also neglects potential rn losses to the atmosphere which are expected to be negligible in aquifers however if weathering precipitation and or evasion rates are hypothesized as relevant in the studied system a source sink term can be factored into the model s formulation i e eq 5 to account for these processes the assumption of steady state conditions i e activities not varying with time b t 0 which is a common assumption for most of the advective transport models e g krest and harvey 2003 michael et al 2011 tamborski et al 2019 2017 may not be valid for systems subjected to non periodical forcing such as waves strong precipitation events i e variable recharge sea level variability or sea level rise robinson et al 2018 therefore a proper characterization of the processes affecting the study site and the activities of radionuclides is needed to apply the model presented in this study it should be noted however that the average time that the radium isotopes reside in the system a t 0 depends on both the decay constant and the retardation factor of each radionuclide i e 1 λ r the assumption of steady state should thus be validated on this temporal scale rodellas et al 2021 for instance the dissolved activities of 226ra may reach steady state in 8 days and 23 years for fresh r ra 10 5 and saline r ra 10 2 groundwater respectively the model also considers that groundwater is flowing through a homogeneous aquifer i e constant r and b f and thus neglects potential heterogeneities of the aquifer matrix that can influence the parameters of the model finally the model neglects dispersion and other mixing processes this is particularly relevant for the saltwater freshwater interphase in coastal aquifers where the different end members mix therefore the model may only be applicable to either the fresh or the saline part of an aquifer provided that groundwater is sufficiently enriched in ra and rn isotopes in the appendices appendix a a simple analytical solution for equation 9 was deduced by using vector matrix notation the analytical solution is used in the following sections to assess the behavior of th ra and rn in groundwater section 3 1 and to evaluate the role of α recoil and retardation of ra in the distribution of ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater section 3 2 and 3 3 respectively it should be noted that the analysis of the model parameters assumes that the activities of the inflowing water into the aquifer are negligible compared to those in groundwater this assumption may be valid for most of the groundwater systems since the activities of surficial waters are commonly of orders of magnitude lower than those in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 however this assumption may not be valid in sites where inflowing water is highly enriched in long lived radionuclides e g mining waters dias da cunha et al 2014 the input parameters used for the model in each section are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 thorium radium and radon enrichment in groundwater in this section we use the advective transport model see appendix a to evaluate the different enrichment rates of th ra and rn in groundwater flowing through an aquifer for this purpose a particular case is considered in which the groundwater flowing through the aquifer is saline and the production rate only depends on the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide b i 1 i e there is no α recoil f 0 therefore typical retardation factors for th and ra in saline groundwater were used 1010 and 103 respectively kumar et al 2020 michael et al 2011 and an arbitrary exchangeable activity for the parent radionuclides 232th and 230th of 104 bq m 3 was imposed as exchangeable activity at the inflow boundary of the flow path b0 see table 1 notice that the selected b 0 has no influence on the different radionuclide enrichment rates the evolution of the activities for the different radionuclides as a function of groundwater transit times is shown in fig 1 the results indicate that the effect of groundwater transit times on the activities of 232th and 230th is negligible due to its large retardation factor fig 1a and c nevertheless the exchangeable activities for 228th may be lower than those of 232th this is because the production rate of 228th depends on the activities of 228ra which is partially dissolved in groundwater and can be removed by advective flow fig 1a the activities of rn isotopes in groundwater increase with transit time reaching the equilibrium with the exchangeable activity of its parent ra at a specific groundwater transit time fig 1a and c since rn is a noble gas i e not affected by chemical reactions the characteristic groundwater transit time for achieving the equilibrium with its parent corresponds to the time to reach secular equilibrium with ra 7 t1 2 7 min and 27 days for 220rn and 222rn respectively because it only depends on the half live of each isotope r rn 1 similarly the activities of ra isotopes increase with groundwater transit times in this case however the rate of increase and the specific time at which ra isotopes achieve equilibrium with the exchangeable activities of their parent th not only depend on their half lives but also on the retardation factor of ra consequently ra isotopes require shorter groundwater transit times for achieving their equilibrium activities i e a τ 0 in groundwater minutes hours and months for 224ra with 228th 228ra with 232th and 226ra with 230th respectively than those needed to achieve radioactive secular equilibrium with their parents 25 days 40 years and 10 000 years for 224ra 228ra and 226ra respectively notice that the exchangeable activities of the daughter radionuclides are always lower than the exchangeable activities of their direct parents until they reach equilibrium b i b i 1 at a specific transit time fig 1a and c once this equilibrium is reached the dissolved ars between daughter and parent radionuclides can be described by a i a i 1 r i 1 r i since b i a i r i thus the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra under these conditions are 1 and r ra respectively as shown in fig 2 notably these ars for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are sometimes lower than those found in natural groundwaters e g copenhaver et al 1993 1992 krishnaswami et al 1991 moise et al 2000 vinson et al 2013 2009 this is because in this analysis the production rate is assumed to depend solely on the exchangeable activity b i 1 of the parent radionuclide implicitly neglecting the role of the supply from the effective α recoil zone therefore ars found in natural groundwater samples cannot be explained without explicit consideration of the α recoil supply 3 2 the effect of alpha recoil supply on 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the mobilization of radionuclides from the solid to groundwater due to the energy of an α decay commonly known as α recoil may be an important source of rn and ra isotopes to groundwater e g kigoshi 1971 sun and semkow 1998 swarzenski 2007 in this section the models of the solid part and exchangeable part see section 2 are used to evaluate 1 the role of the grain size in the α recoil 2 the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars and 3 the importance of the α recoil supply relative to the source from the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide 3 2 1 the role of grain size in the supply from alpha recoil the supply from α recoil to groundwater depends on the activity of the parent radionuclide in the sediment grains or solids s as well as on the fraction of α decays occurring in the sediment grains that recoil into groundwater i e α recoil factor μ to evaluate the α recoil factor a similar analysis to the one presented by porcelli 2008 is proposed this analysis is based on the determination of the fraction of α derived nuclides recoiling into groundwater from the volume ratio of the effective α recoil zone to the total sediment grain for this approach it is assumed that 1 the sediment grains are spherical 2 the volume of the effective α recoil zone depends on the characteristic travel distance of the generated α decay daughter radionuclide d α µm 3 the parent radionuclide is uniformly distributed in the sediment grain 4 only half of the α decays occurring in the α recoil zone effectively recoil in groundwater and 5 only α emitters produce the mobilization of the daughter radionuclide this gives the following relation between the α recoil factor μ and grain diameter d µm 12 μ 1 2 1 d 2 d α 3 d 2 3 3 d α d 6 d α 2 d 2 4 d α 3 d 3 notice that if the grain diameter is much higher than the α recoil travel distance d d α eq 12 can be simplified to μ 3 d α d in fig 3 a the α recoil factor μ is evaluated for different grain diameters as expected the α recoil factor decreases as the diameter of the sediment grain increases e g the α recoil supply from sandy sediments is thus expected to be lower relative to muddy sediments the ratio between the α recoil supply of daughter and parent radionuclides for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs can be derived from equation 1 and 2 as follows 13 f ra 224 f ra 228 μ th 228 μ th 232 1 μ th 232 14 f rn 222 f ra 226 μ ra 226 μ th 230 1 μ th 230 considering the average α recoil distances reported by sun and semkow 1998 407 381 370 and 331 å for 224ra 222rn 226ra and 228ra respectively and the derived α recoil vs grain diameter relationship fig 3a the α recoil pair ratios increase with grain diameter towards the values 1 2 and 1 0 for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs respectively these values result from the ratio between average α recoil distances for daughter radionuclides relative to the parent radionuclides 3 2 2 the bulk radioactive equilibrium of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the bulk radioactive equilibrium is a particular situation in which the activity of a radionuclide does not change with groundwater transit time r i a i τ b i τ 0 since its production rate both from exchangeable and α recoil sources equals its decay rate the radioactive equilibrium of dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra including the supply by α recoil can be derived from equation 11 a τ 0 taking into consideration that the exchangeable activities of 228th are in equilibrium with its parent bth 228 bra 228 see fig 1 15 a ra 224 a ra 228 1 f ra 224 b th 232 f ra 228 16 a rn 222 a ra 226 r ra 1 f rn 222 b th 230 f ra 226 these equilibriums depend on 1 the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide b th 232 for 224ra 228ra and b th 230 for 222rn 226ra 2 the retardation factor of ra in the case of the 222rn 226ra ar and 3 the successive α recoil inputs eqs 1 3 the α recoil supply strongly influences the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the ars actually the equilibrium of the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra derived from equation 15 and 16 range from 1 0 and r ra when α recoil is negligible b f to 2 2 and 2 r ra when α recoil is the dominant source term f b respectively notice that the maximum equilibrium for dissolved ars is obtained when using the maximum recoil supply ratios of 1 2 and 1 0 for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra pairs respectively the estimated ranges of ars are similar to those already suggested by porcelli 2008 therefore groundwaters presenting ars outside of these ranges are indicative of transit times shorter than those needed to achieve the bulk radioactive equilibrium hereinafter characteristic equilibrium transit times 3 2 3 alpha recoil vs exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide the relative importance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide b and α recoil f sources not only influences the equilibrium ars when a τ 0 but also their concentration in groundwater it should be noted however that this relative importance b f has no influence on the characteristic equilibrium transit times the advective transport model is used in this section to evaluate the dissolved ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra depending on groundwater transit times for different ratios between exchangeable activity and α recoil see table 1 the results displayed in fig 4 show that higher α recoil supply values in comparison to the exchangeable source b f 10 2 produce ars above the equilibrium ars equation 15 and 16 for transit times lower than the characteristic equilibrium transit time these ars decrease towards the equilibrium values as groundwater transit time increases fig 4 maximum ars are indeed observed when the exchangeable activities are negligible b 0 and transit times are short as already noticed by krishnaswami et al 1982 these maximum values equal the ratio between the decay constants of the daughter and parent radionuclide for each ar λ ra 224 λ ra 228 5 8 102 for 224ra 228ra and λ rn 222 λ ra 226 1 5 10 5 for 222rn 226ra these high ars result from the faster regeneration of the short lived relative to long lived radionuclides gleeson et al 2013 rodellas et al 2017 tamborski et al 2018 and are in agreement with the high ars found in areas exposed to short scale processes such as porewater exchange or beach face recirculation e g alorda kleinglasset al 2019 charette et al 2003 moore et al 2011 conversely the ars fall below the equilibrium values when the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide is considerably higher than the α recoil b f 10 3 as already noticed in the previous section i e neglecting the role of the α recoil supply fig 3 it is also worth noting that the relevance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide relative to α recoil b f may be lower for 224ra 228ra than for 222rn 226ra this is because 232th is the first radionuclide of the decay chain and thus its mobilization from mineral lattice to exchangeable fraction adsorbed and dissolved is not affected by α recoil and may only depend on weathering processes e g dissolution breakdown of rocks or minerals porcelli 2008 conversely 230th is the fifth radionuclide of the 238u decay chain and its exchangeable activities are derived from the exchangeable content of its parent radionuclide 234u plus an additional recoil source f u 234 3 3 the effect of ra retardation factor on 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios the distribution of radionuclides in groundwater is strongly affected by their retardation factors mckinley and alexander 1993 in order to model the distribution of a certain radionuclide by using the advective transport model proposed in this study appendix a the retardation factors from the target and parent radionuclides should be known r u r th r ra and r rn evaluating ar distribution is simpler since only the retardation factors of the involved radionuclides are required in the case of the 222rn 226ra ar as rn is the direct daughter of 226ra and is a noble gas r rn 1 only the retardation factor of ra is needed for the ar of 224ra 228ra the retardation factors of th and ra are required because 224ra is produced from 228th nevertheless since the retardation factor of th is commonly of orders of magnitude higher than that of ra 108 to 1010 for th and 10 to 106 for ra kumar et al 2020 thibault et al 1990 it has a negligible effect on the ar of 224ra 228ra a fixed r th of 1010 is used in this study but identical results would have been obtained using a r th of 108 in this section the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are evaluated against transit times for different ra retardation factors fig 5 a and b to do so an arbitrary ratio between exchangeable activity and α recoil sources b f of 10 is set and we consider ionic exchange as the principal mechanism of exchangeable dissolved transfer of radionuclides table 1 as already shown in previous sections both ars achieve bulk radioactive equilibrium eqs 15 and 16 after a characteristic transit time this characteristic transit time for reaching equilibrium strongly depends on the retardation factor of ra and on the decay constants of each pair of radionuclides λ ra 224 and λ ra 228 for 224ra 228ra and λ rn 222 and λ ra 226 for 222rn 226ra the characteristic transit time decreases as the retardation factor increases in other words the ra losses due to advective transport i e da d τ v a eq 7 are higher when ra is predominantly desorbed i e low retardation factors 100 than when ra is mostly associated with solid surfaces i e high retardation factors 106 however it should be noted that while the ra retardation factor does not influence the 224ra 228ra ar in equilibrium it does strongly influence the 222rn 226ra ar in equilibrium eq 16 as shown in fig 5a and b 3 4 characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit time the characteristic equilibrium transit time for the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars to reach bulk radioactive equilibrium provides key information on the determination of groundwater transit times as shown in previous sections characteristic equilibrium transit times are highly dependent on the retardation factor of ra r ra but they are independent of the relative importance of the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide and α recoil sources b f here the characteristic equilibrium transit times for the ars of both 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra as a function of the ra retardation factor are estimated fig 6 higher retardation factors characteristic of freshwater environments 10 6 result in shorter times for equilibrium 0 1 days for 224ra 228ra and 100 days for 222rn 226ra due to the minor effect of advection losses conversely lower retardation factors characteristic of saline environments require longer equilibrium transit times 3 years and 3000 years for 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra respectively notice that the equilibrium transit times are approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher for 222rn 226ra than for 224ra 228ra mainly as a consequence of the different decay constants of 226ra and 228ra λ ra 228 λ ra 226 see table 1 thus from fig 6 three main areas can be identified depending on whether the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra are in equilibrium or not a first evaluation of groundwater transit times can thus be easily obtained from this simple analysis when the ars are measured in groundwater samples and the retardation factor of ra is constrained 3 5 applications of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios 3 5 1 groundwater transit times determination in this section the potential applications of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars for determining transit times of groundwater flowing through an aquifer are tested the advective transport model presented in this study appendix a can be used to determine groundwater transit times in different hydrological environments including inland and coastal aquifers and for different groundwater compositions fresh brackish and saline groundwater notice that the application of these ars for determining groundwater transit times in freshwater systems is more complex since the solubility of ra isotopes in pristine groundwater is usually low however in recent years there have been many advances in the quantification of low concentrations of ra isotopes diego feliu et al 2020 molina porras et al 2017a as well as in their application to freshwater environments molina porras et al 2020 2017b the two main applications of the model are 1 the determination of groundwater transit times between two sampling points located in the same flow path where the groundwater ra and rn activities of each sample are used to set the initial inflow a 0 and the final outflow a boundary activities of ra isotopes and rn and 2 the estimation of transit times from a recharge point i e infiltration of water through the aquifer or seawater intrusion to a sampling point also known as groundwater age where the activities of the inflowing water are used to set the initial inflow activities a 0 and the sampling point is used to set the outflow boundary activities a moreover groundwater velocities can be derived from transit times if the flow path length from recharge or between the two sampling points is known eq 7 the implementation of this method requires not only the quantification of 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra ars but also requires constraining the retardation factor of ra r ra and the relation between production rates derived from the exchangeable activities of the parent radionuclide and α recoil b f see section 3 2 and 3 3 the retardation factor of ra can be determined from in situ measurements copenhaver et al 1992 mckinley and alexander 1993 or otherwise estimated from the distribution coefficient of ra kd eq 10 michael et al 2011 the most common techniques for determining kd are batch adsorption desorption experiments e g beck and cochran 2013 rama and moore 1996 tachi et al 2001 willett and bond 1995 adsorption desorption modelling e g copenhaver et al 1993 webster et al 1995 flow through columns tests e g meier et al 2015 relyea 1982 and chemical equilibrium calculations puigdomenech and bergstrom 1995 moreover many authors provided referential values for ra distribution coefficients under different conditions for example a recent review compiled the kds of ra from different experimental settings kumar et al 2020 beck and cochran 2013 provided new insights into the distribution coefficient of ra under different solid and solution compositions e g salinity ph bet surface and michael et al 2011 reviewed the most common kds for ra in fresh and brackish groundwater whether experimentally determined or literature based the retardation factor of ra used in this method may be one of the main sources of uncertainty especially in heterogeneous systems with strong variations in groundwater salinity see section 3 3 differentiating the production rate derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide with the production from α recoil is still challenging the reported methods are mainly based on the determination of production rates for both processes together and can be summarized in 1 experimental determination of emanation rates and the content of the parent isotope in the sediment grains hussain 1995 rama and moore 1984 semkow 1990 2 radioactive equilibration experiments tamborski et al 2019 3 theoretical calculations focused on determining the α recoil supply based on several properties of the host material e g density surface area kigoshi 1971 sun and semkow 1998 4 mathematical fitting with advective transport models krest and harvey 2003 and 5 determination via the recoil rate of 222rn copenhaver et al 1992 krishnaswami et al 1991 1982 alternatively this term can also be estimated by the concurrent determination of the sediment activity s and the surface bound activity of the target radionuclide i e adsorbed activity sun and torgersen 1998 performed multi step leaching experiments in clay sediments 20 to 60 µm particle grain size from long island sound usa estimating a surface bound 224ra activity of 10 bq kg 1 turekian et al 1996 determined the sediment 228th activity in similar sediment samples from the same location 50 bq kg 1 assuming the sediment to be in radioactive equilibrium and an α recoil factor characteristic of clays 10 1 to 10 2 see fig 3 the ratio b f for this sediment type may range from 2 to 20 once these parameters 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra ars r ra and b f ratio are constrained groundwater transit times can be determined using two different approaches the first approach consists of comparing the measured ars with the bulk radioactive equilibrium ars eqs 15 and 16 in order to determine the ranges of groundwater transit times whilst this approach only enables the estimation of wide ranges of groundwater transit times it can be applied without characterizing the ratio b f which is often the most challenging parameter to determine given a specific ra retardation factor the characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit times for both ars the transit time required for the ars to achieve the bulk radioactive equilibrium can be derived directly from fig 6 if the measured groundwater samples present ars out of equilibrium ranges from 1 0 to 2 2 and r ra to 2 r ra for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively they are indicative of groundwater transit times shorter than the characteristic equilibrium groundwater transit times conversely ars within the characteristic bulk radioactive equilibrium ranges may be indicative of longer groundwater transit times relative to the characteristic equilibrium transit times fig 6 however notice that ars within these ranges may not have reached equilibrium under some ratios for exchangeable and α recoil sources e g b f ranging from 102 to 103 see fig 4 to ensure that the ars have reached equilibrium evaluating the variation of the ars at different sampling points along the studied flow path is recommended moreover this approach can only be used for determining groundwater ages since the analysis performed to derive fig 6 considers that the inflowing water has negligible initial activities of rn and ra a 0 0 the second approach is based on adjusting numerically the model presented in the appendix appendix a to the measured ars based on the input parameters of the model which comprise the retardation factor of ra the activities of the target radionuclides at the inflow boundary a 0 and the relation between the production rate derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide and the production from α recoil b f the model can be used to determine the modeled ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra for a set of groundwater transit times e g as shown in fig 5 subsequently the results of the modeled ars are compared with the measured ars at the outflow boundary to evaluate a specific groundwater transit time the uncertainties associated with the transit time determination can be assessed through a monte carlo analysis where the errors associated with each of the model s variables are considered within the monte carlo analysis 1 model variables e g r ra and b f are generated via normally distributed random values based on the mean and standard deviation of each parameter and 2 a set of stochastic simulations are performed to determine the groundwater transit time resulting from the combination of all input parameters the distribution of groundwater transit times obtained from the monte carlo analysis can be adjusted e g least square fitting to a probability density function e g normal poisson binomial beta in order to obtain the statistics for empirical distribution e g mean median standard deviation rodellas et al 2021 in the following section section 3 6 the advective transport model is used to evaluate groundwater transit times for fresh groundwater from recharge and recirculated seawater in a coastal mediterranean aquifer 3 5 2 constraining pathways and end members of sgd submarine groundwater discharge sgd has been recognized as an important process affecting the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of coastal water bodies in most studies the magnitude of sgd is inferred from ra isotopes or rn however the accuracy of these tracer based estimations is often hampered by the difficulty of characterizing the ra or rn activities in the discharging groundwater i e the sgd end member cho and kim 2016 cook et al 2018 duque et al 2019 gonneea et al 2013 michael et al 2011 most of the tracer based sgd studies are solely focused on the quantification of the flux of water and solutes via sgd without paying attention to the discharge pathways that underlie these fluxes these pathways largely determine the extent and rates of biogeochemical reactions occurring in coastal aquifers and therefore the final chemical composition of discharging fluids rodellas et al 2020 santos et al 2012 weinstein et al 2011 a detailed evaluation of sgd driven water and solute fluxes and their consequences for coastal ecosystems requires thus both a solid understanding of the dominant sgd pathways and an accurate determination of the sgd end member the advective transport model presented in this study can be applied in sgd studies to evaluate both the predominant pathways of groundwater discharge e g porewater exchange intertidal seawater recirculation terrestrial groundwater discharge michael et al 2011 taniguchi et al 2019 and the sgd end member a evaluation of predominant sgd pathways sgd can be separated into 5 main pathways according to the groundwater origin the physical forces driving the fluxes and the spatiotemporal scale of each process terrestrial groundwater discharge density driven seawater circulation seasonal exchange of seawater intertidal circulation of seawater and porewater exchange michael et al 2011 robinson et al 2018 taniguchi et al 2019 considering the different spatiotemporal scales of each sgd pathway and their characteristic salinities and therefore their characteristic ra retardation factor different sgd pathways are likely to present characteristic ars fig 7 as shown in fig 7 whereas short scale processes characteristics of saline environments low retardation factors such as porewater exchange or intertidal seawater recirculation will likely present ars in disequilibrium eqs 15 and 16 long scale processes involving freshwater high retardation factors such as terrestrial groundwater discharge are expected to present ars close to the bulk radioactive equilibrium eqs 15 and 16 b selection of the sgd end member once released into coastal water by sgd the activities of the short lived isotopes 224ra and 222rn are expected to decrease at a faster rate than their parent isotopes 228ra and 226ra respectively because 1 the decay rates of 224ra and 222rn are higher relative to their parents 228ra and 226ra respectively 2 222rn exhales to the atmosphere and 3 coastal waters are mixed with offshore waters which are commonly depleted in short lived 224ra and 222rn relative to long lived 228ra and 226ra isotopes thus one possible method to evaluate the sgd end member consists in comparing the measured ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in the coastal ocean ar sw with those of groundwater samples ar gw boehm et al 2006 moore et al 2006 rodellas et al 2014 at a specific site when sgd is the predominant source of ra isotopes and rn to the coastal ocean i e absence of any significant source such as diffusion from sediments or rivers the ars in the coastal ocean are expected to be comparable or lower relative to those of the discharging groundwater ar sw ar gw any groundwater sample exhibiting lower ars than those measured in the coastal waters may not be representative of the dominant sgd inflowing to the study site and thus can be discarded as a relevant sgd end member 3 6 applications of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra activity ratios at the argentona experimental site western mediterranean sea the applications of the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars for determining groundwater transit times and evaluating the end member and pathways of sgd were tested at an experimental site located in the coastal alluvial aquifer of the argentona ephemeral stream 40 km ne of the city of barcelona western mediterranean sea fig 8 the argentona experimental site consists of 16 piezometers distributed along a perpendicular and a parallel transect to the coastline with groundwater sampling depths ranging from 15 to 25 m see folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 for more details about the experimental site the geology of the aquifer is dominated by detrital quaternary sediments that constitute layers of gravels sands and clays which are the product of chemical weathering and rock fracture of the granitic fresh groundwater flows towards the sea in the shallow part of the aquifer the upper 15 m whereas the deep aquifer area deeper than 20 m is influenced by seawater intrusion as inferred from the application of direct measurement at the piezometers and electrical resistivity tomography folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 most of the piezometers are gathered in nests n1 n3 n2 of three piezometers with screening intervals of 2 m located at different depths 15 20 and 25 m approximately fig 8 the three remaining piezometers pp 15 pp 20 and pp 18 are the closest to the sea with sampling depths of 15 20 and 18 m respectively the physicochemical parameters and the ra isotopes activities 224ra 228ra and 226ra together with 222rn were monitored over two years 2015 and 2016 additionally the retardation factor of ra was determined via adsorption desorption experiments table c 1 on sediment samples collected from two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 detailed information on the sampling analytical techniques and the monitoring of ra isotopes and rn in the argentona experimental site are provided in appendices b and c 3 6 1 groundwater transit times the hydrogeological patterns in the argentona experimental site provide a good opportunity to use the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra for the evaluation of two different processes while in the shallower part of the aquifer the proposed method is tested to estimate the groundwater transit times of fresh groundwater from recharge in the deeper part the groundwater transit times of recirculated seawater are estimated the groundwater samples collected from the piezometer at 15 m depth in nest n2 were chosen as the referential samples to evaluate transit times from upstream recharge hereinafter fresh outflow because it is the farthest piezometer from the sea 100 m and presented the lowest average salinity 0 5 indicating a negligible mixing with intruded seawater conversely groundwater samples from nest n1 at depth 20 m that exhibit the highest average salinity 32 4 were chosen to evaluate transit times for seawater recirculation saline outflow in both cases the groundwater transit time is determined from a recharge point to an outflow boundary taking into consideration that the initial activities of ra isotopes and rn in the inflowing water are negligible a 0 0 i e the determined groundwater transit time corresponds to the groundwater age this assumption is supported in this case because the activities of 224ra 226ra 228ra and 222rn in coastal waters are significantly lower 2 3 orders of magnitude than those in groundwater fig c 1 indicative ranges of groundwater transit times can easily be estimated solely from the measured ars and the retardation factor of ra without any extra analysis fig 9 since both the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars from the saline outflow are in disequilibrium 5 2 2 and 4500 2 r ra respectively and the experimentally determined r ra is 170 table c 1 the derived groundwater transit times should be shorter than the characteristic equilibrium transit time for the ratio 224ra 228ra 110 days fig 9 in the case of the fresh outflow the 224ra 228ra ar is in equilibrium 1 1 but the ar of 222rn 226ra is in disequilibrium 5900 and the retardation factor of ra is 2500 table c 1 thus groundwater transit times should range from the characteristic equilibrium transit time for 224ra 228ra and that for 222rn 226ra from 10 days to 5 5 years fig 9 to constrain these ranges the transit times can be more accurately determined by numerical adjustment to the model presented in the appendix appendix a which can be coupled to a monte carlo analysis using 50 000 stochastic simulations to account for the uncertainties associated with this approach the mean and the standard deviation of each model input i e 224ra 228ra 222rn 226ra and r ra was used to generate normally distributed random values in the case of the retardation factor of ra rather than using the analytical relative uncertainty 10 a higher error 25 was assumed in order to account for the potential variability of this parameter due to heterogeneities of the geological matrix and the composition of groundwater as well as its dependency on other processes such as dissolution and precipitation since the ratio between exchangeable and α recoil sources b f is unknown in the argentona experimental site the monte carlo simulations were performed for different b f ratios ranging from 0 to 50 the resulting distributions of groundwater transit times for upstream recharge and seawater recirculation were adjusted to different probability density functions pdf by using least squares fitting scipy library for the python programming language the tested pdfs included beta binomial χ2 noncentral χ2 f noncentral f gamma negative binomial normal poisson student s t and noncentral t the pdfs which best fitted the monte carlo results were noncentral t and f for the 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ar derived estimates respectively the pdf statistics derived from the best fit to the data were used to derive the expected mean standard deviation median and 1st and 3rd quartile groundwater transit times the mean and standard deviation groundwater transit times for seawater recirculation were 7 3 to 54 19 days by using 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively and 330 300 days for the upstream recharge only the ar 222rn 226ra can be used since 224ra 228ra is in equilibrium notice that the relative standard deviation of the upstream recharge estimate 100 may result from 1 the high relative standard deviation of 222rn 226ra in the fresh outflow 40 and 2 the closeness of the 222rn 226ra ar to the retardation factor of ra 5900 2300 and 2500 200 respectively however 50 of the generated data via monte carlo simulations for upstream recharge fluctuate from 180 to 390 days 1st and 3rd quartile respectively the discrepancy between the groundwater transit times derived from the 224ra 228ra 7 days and 222rn 226ra 54 days ars in the saline outflow can be induced by many factors first the experimental retardation factor of ra used for the calculations was derived from adsorption desorption experiments which only consider ionic exchange thus this approach neglects the role of other processes involved in the solid solution distribution of ra isotopes such as dissolution or precipitation secondly whilst the assumption of steady state a t 0 may be a good approximation for shorter lived ra isotopes 224ra and 228ra the activities of 226ra may be more influenced by non periodical forcing such as waves strong precipitation events and sea level variability due to its longer half life robinson et al 2018 thirdly the saline outflow contains 15 of meteoric groundwater salinity of 32 4 with a different signal of radionuclides that can interfere with final estimates despite the above mentioned assumptions this assessment enables easy constraint of the temporal scales of fresh groundwater advection and seawater intrusion thereby providing thus key information for understanding the hydrological functioning of the coastal aquifer in addition to transit times in the argentona experimental site conservative groundwater velocities for the groundwater recharge and seawater recirculation can be calculated by considering that the recharge point of the ephemeral stream occurs at the midpoint between its source and the sampling piezometer n2 15 3 km inland and that the recirculation of seawater occurs at the shoreline 60 m the linear velocities estimated for the shallow fresh groundwater part 9 m d 1 are one order of magnitude higher than the ones derived from a numerical model implemented at the alluvial aquifer of the argentona ephemeral stream in 2009 0 24 m d 1 catalan water agency 2010 this discrepancy could be attributed to the assumption that the recharge point occurs at the midpoint of the aquifer since recharge in ephemeral streams commonly occurs after flood events that are more intense in the lower part of the aquifer the groundwater velocities of the intruded seawater 1 to 8 m d 1 derived from the ars are in agreement with those determined by the tidal response method at the experimental site from 10 2 to 101 m d 1 t goyetche personal communication reinforcing the validity of the developed approach 3 6 2 pathways and end members of sgd in the argentona experimental site the 12 sampling locations across the perpendicular transect to the coastline provide an appropriate framework to investigate the pathways of sgd occurring at the site following the classification based on the temporal scale and the characteristic retardation factor of ra for each pathway fig 7 three main sgd pathways can be identified by using the distribution of salinity and ars 1 terrestrial groundwater discharge derived from the lower salinities 0 5 1 7 and 224ra 228ra ars close to the equilibrium in the upper part of the aquifer n1 15 n2 15 and n3 15 2 density driven seawater circulation occurring at the deeper part of the aquifer inferred by higher salinities 28 0 32 4 and 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra ars in disequilibrium n1 20 n2 25 and n3 25 and 3 intertidal seawater circulation occurring at the nearshore piezometers pp 20 t and pp 15 which present intermediate salinities 1 6 9 1 and ars see table c 1 the coastal seawater collected in front of the argentona experimental site presented a 224ra 228ra ar value of 3 0 table c 1 which is above the bulk radioactive equilibrium of the 224ra 228ra ar 1 0 2 2 eqs 15 and 16 this indicates that the predominant sgd pathways may be density driven seawater circulation and or intertidal seawater circulation with a minor contribution from terrestrial groundwater discharge these results are in agreement with those obtained through the application of cross hole electrical resistivity tomography which enabled the identification of two different mixing zones near the piezometer pp 20 that may be indicative of shallower wave storm induced and deeper groundwater discharge areas folch et al 2020 palacios et al 2019 the ar of 222rn 226ra is not used in this case due to the low activities of 226ra in the coastal waters 12 1 dpm 100l 1 that indicate a lack of relevant sgd driven 226ra inputs in order to evaluate the appropriate sgd end member in the argentona experimental site the measured ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in the coastal ocean ar sw are compared with those from groundwater samples ar gw fig 10 the samples that were taken at the upper part of the aquifer presented lower 224ra 228ra ars 1 1 2 5 relative to the coastal seawater sample ar sw 3 0 indicating that they may not be representative end members of the dominant sgd inflowing to the study site in contrast the 224ra 228ra ars of samples from the deeper part of the aquifer 15 m were higher relative to the ar sw table c 1 and thus they could be representative samples for the sgd end member a common method of estimating the sgd end member consists in averaging the tracer concentration from several groundwater samples collected at different locations e g beck et al 2007 rapaglia et al 2010 without any ancillary information all the collected groundwater samples are usually incorporated into the average to determine the ra or rn activities of the sgd end member however this averaged activity is usually skewed by the number of groundwater samples that are not representative of the dominant discharge process using only those groundwater samples presenting comparable or higher ars relative to the coastal ocean sample ar sw ar gw enables discarding the non representative samples and thus better constrain the sgd end member in the case of the argentona experimental site for instance the average 224ra activity considering all the samples collected is 210 bq m 3 whereas this average is 320 bq m 3 if only the representative groundwater samples are included in the average this example illustrates that 224ra based sgd estimates may vary by a factor of 1 5 when the sgd end member is not appropriately constrained using these ars to better select the sgd end member might thus decisively contribute to producing more accurate sgd estimates 4 conclusions the groundwater activity ratios of radionuclides from the same decay chain such as 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra are promising tools for obtaining key information on hydrogeological processes occurring in coastal and inland aquifers in this work the processes affecting these ars in groundwater are assessed through a new advective transport model that integrates all radionuclides in a decay chain into one formulation the analysis of the model s results indicates that the predominant parameters that affect the activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra in groundwater are groundwater transit times α recoil supply and the retardation factor of ra r ra the ars evolve depending on groundwater transit times towards the radioactive equilibrium between parent and daughter radionuclide the α recoil supply increases activity ratios to above the equilibrium activity ratios 1 and r ra for 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra respectively which cannot be explained solely by considering production rates derived from the exchangeable activity of the parent radionuclide the retardation factor of ra influences the characteristic groundwater transit times needed for achieving these equilibriums higher ra retardation factors characteristics of fresh groundwater 106 result in shorter transit times for equilibrium 0 1 days for 224ra 228ra and 100 days for 222rn 226ra due to the minor effect of advection losses conversely the ars of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra require longer transit times to reach equilibrium 3 years and 3000 years for 224ra 228ra and 222ra 226ra respectively when the retardation factors of ra are low characteristics of saline groundwater 101 the ars and the advective transport model have several applications in the fields of hydrogeology and coastal oceanography and these were tested in a mediterranean coastal aquifer in hydrogeological studies the model can be used to determine transit times i e ages and velocities of groundwater evaluate the connectivity between coastal aquifer and ocean and distinguish the origins of groundwater whilst this study is focused on coastal systems the application of this model can be extended to aquifers inland provided that groundwater is sufficiently enriched in these pairs of radionuclides the use of ra isotopes and rn thus provides relevant information on aquifer processes which may be fundamental for the management of coastal groundwater resources the combination of the groundwater measured activity ratios of 224ra 228ra and 222rn 226ra and the advective transport model can also be applied to improve

groundwater samplings and one seawater sampling were conducted in the argentona experimental site in september and december 2015 and january june march november and october 2016 before sampling the piezometers were purged to remove at least 3 times the volume of the stagnant water between 20 and 60 l of water was collected for ra isotopes and 250 ml for 222rn from each piezometer the groundwater and seawater samples collected for ra isotopes were filtered through mno2 impregnated acrylic fiber hereinafter mn fibers at a controlled flow rate lower than 1 l min 1 in order to quantitatively extract ra isotopes moore and reid 1973 after filtration the fibers were rinsed with ra free deionized water to wash out any particles and sea salt and partially dried to a water fiber ratio of 1 1 sun and torgersen 1998 moore 2008 the short lived ra isotopes 223ra and 224ra were counted using the radium delayed coincidence counter radecc moore and arnold 1996 the quantification of the activities was performed according to the limits and guidelines provided by diego feliu et al 2020 and the associated uncertainties were calculated following garcia solsona et al 2008 the detectors were calibrated by repeatedly measuring 227ac and 232th standards moore and cai 2013 scholten et al 2010 the long lived ra isotopes 226ra and 228ra were measured by gamma spectrometry using a well type hpge detector after incinerating grounding and transferring the mn fibers to counting vials the activities of 228ra and 226ra were calculated through the 228ac and 214pb photopeaks at 911 and 352 kev respectively the activities of 222rn were determined from 250 ml water bottles using the rad h2o system durridge inc this system enables the direct measurement of 222rn activities in water with the 222rn in air alpha spectrometer rad7 durridge inc b 2 determination of the ra retardation factor the retardation factor of ra r ra was determined through kd measurements adsorption desorption experiments for two sediment samples collected in the argentona ephemeral stream from core recovery at the piezometers n1 25 and n2 25 the depths of the selected sediment samples conform with the screened depth of the two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 in each corresponding nest table c 1 the determination of the distribution coefficient of ra kd m3 kg 1 requires the measurement of surface bound ras bq kg 1 and dissolved raw bq m 3 ra activities the sediment samples previously collected in the field were dried in the stove 40 c and sieved through a 2 mm sieve to remove gravels after drying and sieving the sediment samples were stored in hermetic plastic bags for at least 20 days to ensure the equilibrium between 224ra and its parent 228th adapting the method described by cai et al 2012 to determine the disequilibrium between 224ra and 228th in coastal sediment weighted sediment subsamples were mixed with synthetic water to form a slurry the salinity of the synthetic water was adjusted to the groundwater salinities measured at the piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 in the field since the processes of adsorption and desorption for ra are relatively fast e g beneš et al 1985 gonneea et al 2008 nathwani and phillips 1979 the contact time between sediment and water was adjusted to two hours after two hours the slurry was filtered using a filtration system that enables the separation of solid and solute phases the filtration system consists of a filtration chamber a büchner flask and a vacuum pump the slurry was spilled into the filtration chamber which contained a pre weighted 142 mm gff filter with 0 7 µm of nominal pore size in the filtration process the sediment is retained in the filter and the solution is conducted to a büchner flask the filtration terminates after adjusting the ratio water sediment filter of the sediment sample to 0 4 to 0 5 cai et al 2012 the recovered water in the büchner flask was filtered through mno2 impregnated acrylic fibers at a controlled flow rate 1 l min 1 moore and reid 1973 scholten et al 2010 both the activities of dissolved 224raw and surface bound 224ras ra were measured with the radecc system from the mn fiber and the sediment samples respectively the determination of the distribution coefficient of ra kd was then calculated as follows eq b 1 b 1 k d ra s 224 ra w 224 assuming a dry bulk density of the soil ρ b of 2 6 kg l 1 and a porosity ϕ of 0 3 the retardation factor of ra r ra was derived from eq 10 michael et al 2011 the quantification of ra activities with the radecc system accomplished the limits and guidelines provided by diego feliu et al 2020 and the associated uncertainties were calculated following garcia solsona et al 2008 the calibration of the detectors was made by repeatedly measuring 227ac and 232th mn fiber standards for water samples moore and cai 2013 scholten et al 2010 and by standard addition method following cai et al 2012 for sediment samples c radium and radon isotopes in the argentona experimental site the results of 222rn and ra isotopes activities against the salinity of each piezometer for different samplings in the argentona experimental site are shown in fig c 1 radium activities spanned a wide range from 10 to 940 10 to 550 and 1 to 50 bq m 3 for 224ra 228ra and 226ra respectively these variations in ra concentrations are mainly associated with differences in the geological context and in the groundwater salinity of each piezometer fig c 1 the shallow aquifer 15 m presents the lowest ra concentrations e g 10 to 50 bq m 3 of 224ra in agreement with the lowest salinity 0 5 to 2 2 in contrast the intermediate and deep piezometers presented higher activities e g 60 to 940 bq m 3 of 224ra correlating with the higher salinities 4 4 to 33 9 of the bottom aquifer radon activities were 1 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than ra activities ranging from 5 103 to 45 103 bq m 3 nevertheless aside from the groundwater samples collected from deeper piezometers 20 m that presented higher rn concentrations 20 103 to 45 103 bq m 3 most of the groundwater samples presented relatively constant 222rn concentrations 5 103 20 103 bq m 3 fig c 1 the ars of 224ra 228ra ranged from 1 1 to 1 4 for the shallow piezometers and from 1 5 to 8 4 for the deeper piezometers 15 m depth the ars of 222rn 226ra ranged from 2700 to 5900 for shallow piezometers and 700 to 4 500 for deeper piezometers table c 1 the retardation factor of ra for the two selected piezometers n1 20 and n2 15 table c 1 which were determined by reproducing the groundwater salinities measured at the site are 170 for the sample collected at depth 20 in the nest n1 piezometer n1 20 which is influenced by saline groundwater and 2500 for the sediment sample collected at the freshwater zone at nest n2 15 m these results are in concordance with the typical retardation factors of ra for saline and fresh groundwater respectively beck and

4736,whether carbonate weathering on land represents an important terrestrial carbon sink has long been debated as the co2 sequestered by the dissolution of carbonate may return to the atmosphere through co2 outgassing from groundwater feeding surface waters in headwater area of karst terrain the co2 outgassing frequently happens in spring fed streams but its flux and influencing factors still remain under researched in this study we conducted a monthly monitoring of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water along a karst spring fed creek at changliushui sw china that has a steep gradient and in which tufa deposition occurs in order to explore the process of co2 outgassing and elucidate the outgassing flux across space and time and its influencing factors the analyses of downstream geochemical evolution have revealed that two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing exist along the flow path i outgassing of physically dissolved soil co2 during the process of carbonate dissolution as the primary co2 outgassing and ii an additional outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite at a short distance from the spring the aqueous co2 escapes from water to a large degree through molecular diffusion driven by high gradient of partial pressure of co2 pco2 between the water and the atmosphere such co2 outgassing concomitantly causes the saturation index with respect to calcite sic to rise resulting in subsequent calcite precipitation and thus more co2 outgassing spatiotemporal variations in the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing flux show that the rates of both types of co2 outgassing are significantly influenced by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology in particular lower rates of co2 outgassing are observed at higher flow discharge and vice versa in the studied reach of stream the primary and additional co2 outgassing have caused about 21 35 and 4 20 of the total soil co2 sequestered in dic of the feeding spring water to be released back to the atmosphere respectively and the higher flow discharge the less co2 return based on these findings we postulate that the co2 outgassing especially that induced by calcite precipitation should be relatively smaller in streams which have a lower gradient and elevated discharge rate and where the mixing or dilution of tributaries and increased in stream metabolism occur this provides more evidence for the previous conclusion that the h2o carbonate co2 aquatic phototroph interaction could represent a net carbon sink at least over short timescales keywords hydrochemistry stable carbon isotope calcite precipitation hydrodynamic conditions changliushui 1 introduction about 15 of the global ice free continental surface is underlain by karstifiable carbonate rocks goldscheider et al 2020 these carbonate rocks constitute the largest carbon reservoir on earth martin 2017 due to high solubility of carbonate minerals extensive water co2 carbonate interactions occur in karst watersheds and aquifers eqs 1 3 1 co2 h2o h2co3 2 h2co3 h hco3 3 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 such chemical weathering of carbonate involves considerable uptake of co2 mainly soil co2 that is also of atmospheric origin which is converted to dissolved inorganic carbon dic and then exported to rivers lakes and the ocean acting as an atmospheric co2 sink jiang and yuan 1999 liu et al 2010 previous studies have reported that the action of carbonate weathering on land coupled with global water cycle and photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic organisms in both terrestrial and marine environments could yield a great carbon sink about 0 11 0 8 pg c yr accounting for 7 25 of the estimated terrestrial carbon sink gombert 2002 liu et al 2010 2018 liu and zhao 2000 martin 2017 yuan 1997 thus the carbonate weathering should represent an important terrestrial carbon sink liu and dreybrodt 2015 liu et al 2010 however it has long been debated by geologists that the co2 sequestered by the dissolution of carbonate could return to the atmosphere through carbonate precipitation and associated co2 outgassing see the reverse reaction of eq 3 berner 1992 berner et al 1983 curl 2012 this reminds us to check the stability of carbonate weathering related carbon sink and evaluate its magnitude variations and at which timescales it may act the occurrence of co2 outgassing from karst groundwater that normally has much high partial pressure of co2 pco2 several tens to over one hundred times that of ambient atmosphere is common in karst terrain also it often results in calcite precipitation when subsequent supersaturation with respect to caco3 has reached the critical threshold for calcite nucleation forming speleothems in caves fairchild et al 2006 and tufa deposits along groundwater feeding surface streams drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing have been found to exist in flowing water systems e g dripping water on the top of speleothem one is outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 driven by the initial difference gradient between the pco2 in water and the pco2 in the atmosphere and the other is outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite dreybrodt 2019 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 hansen et al 2013 both types of co2 outgassing can remove the dic in water and result in the release of soil co2 sequestered during the process of carbonate dissolution back to the atmosphere thereby counteracting the carbonate weathering related carbon sink to date the fluxes of co2 outgassing from stream water especially that induced by the calcite precipitation and the proportion of them relative to that of the total uptake of co2 by carbonate weathering still remain under researched in a headwater area of carbonate terrain the co2 outgassing widely happens when the karst groundwater emerges at the earth s surface and flows to a low elevation area particularly in the reach with abrupt changes in streambed morphology such as cascades or waterfalls drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 along the flow path of surface streams the co2 outgassing can result in apparent downstream changes in hydrochemical and isotopic compositions as revealed by many studies of tufa travertine depositing streams including those fed by hydrothermal springs or groundwaters of endogenic origin drysdale 2001 drysdale et al 2002 herman and lorah 1987 1988 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 1995 kele et al 2011 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 in addition many factors including variations in water chemistry of the feeding groundwater flow discharge streambed morphology in stream metabolism and other environmental factors could affect the downstream geochemical evolution of stream water drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 zhou et al 2013 by investigating the hydrochemical and isotopic variations along the longitudinal profile of a stream therefore it will allow us to explore the process of co2 outgassing determine its flux and elucidate the influencing factors in this study we conducted a monthly investigation into the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions of karst spring water and spring fed surface stream water at changliushui guilin southwest china in order to explore the processes of co2 outgassing particularly that induced by the precipitation of calcite and determine the flux of individual types of co2 outgassing across space and time furthermore the proportion of the flux of co2 outgassing relative to that of the uptake of soil co2 by carbonate weathering was estimated so as to better understand the dynamic stability of carbonate weathering related carbon sink the influencing factors of co2 outgassing flux were elucidated based on which the co2 outgassing in the lower reach of streams and in rivers located in areas with a low gradient were discussed this study is of significance for the reason that it provides an extreme case with significant co2 outgassing along a karst groundwater feeding stream where considerable calcite precipitation occurs and the results will provide more insights into the fate of dic exported into terrestrial water bodies and lay the foundations for assessing the role of carbonate weathering in the global carbon cycle 2 descriptions of the study site the changliushui springs are located near the changliushui village guilin southwest china coordinates 25 01 41 n 110 22 16 e fig 1 a this site is situated in the core area of guilin karst which is one part of the world heritage property of south china karst spectacular conical karst hills with deep depressions are typical of karst landscape in this area today the region of guilin has a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate with an annual mean air temperature of 19 c and an annual mean precipitation of 1890 mm in which 60 of rainfall occurs during the season of plum rain between april to july data obtained from the china meteorological data service center the catchment of changliushui springs is small typical karst watershed with a large depression surrounded by peak clusters fig 1b the total area of the watershed is about 1 5 km2 host rocks in the watershed are mainly composed of pure limestones of middle to upper devonian age two small perennial springs sites s1 and s2 1 3 l s emerge in the east of the watershed issuing along an approximately north south trending fault fig 1b also ephemeral epikarst springs e g at s3 and s4 sites are often found at the foot of hillslopes surrounding the depression within the watershed a surface creek fed by these springs flows westward and sinks underground at the foot of a hill note that this creek often dries up before reaching site d1 in the period with little rainfall fig 1b within the catchment a majority of hillslope areas are covered by high density evergreen shrubs fig 1c the main spring is discharged on the middle slope of a hill in the west of the watershed at site c1 and then flows downslope from an elevation of 240 m to 190 m above sea level a s l at site c7 fig 1b and d monitoring data show that the discharge rate of this spring exhibits great temporal change in response to rainfall variability higher flow rates are observed in the rainy season with a baseflow of 5 10 l s and a flood flow of 20 l s up to 160 l s whereas less flow 1 l s is generated in the dry season when there is little rainfall this study li 2006 the investigated course of the creek c1 c7 is about 240 m in length a gradient of 3 23 mean 10 is observed along this reach studied fig 1d the channel of stream has a width of about 30 50 cm with a water flow thickness of about 1 2 cm to several centimeters at a baseflow level but up to several tens of centimeters during high flow regimes stream flow velocity is variable along the channel mostly ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 m s but can reach up to 3 4 m s several small waterholes rimstone dams and cascades are developed along the channel abundant fossil tufa deposits are observed within the channel from site c2 which is about 30 m far away from the spring to site c7 fig 1d weeds bryophytes algae and bacteria are widespread at the bottom and on both flanks of the channel fig 1e and f 3 sampling and analytical methods the spring water at site c1 and spring fed stream waters along the flow path incl sites c2 c7 at an interval of 20 30 m fig 1d were sampled from august 2017 and september 2019 basically based on a monthly sampling strategy the discharge rate of the spring was monitored by a weir with two cross sections a digital level instrument trimble was used to measure the streambed gradient in the field water temperature ph value and electric conductivity ec were measured using a portable multi parameter analyzer ponsel with a precision of 0 1 c 0 01 ph and 1 μs cm respectively also alkalinity and ca2 concentration were determined on the spot using the merck kgaa titration test kits with a precision of 0 1 mmol l and 2 mg l respectively duplicate titrations were performed at each site water samples for chemical and stable isotopic analyses were passed through a membrane filter 0 45 μm in pore size and placed in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in different sizes ultrapure hno3 1 1 was added to the aliquot for cation analysis to acidify the sample to ph 2 and 2 3 drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to bottles for the analysis of carbon isotope to avoid any influence of microbial activity all samples were stored in the fridge at 4 c before measurement concentrations of k na mg2 and ca2 were determined by an icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermofisher scientific usa and so4 2 cl no3 concentrations by an ion chromatography instrument metrohm the analytical uncertainties are within 5 both ca2 concentrations measured in the field and laboratory were compared and the values generally agree to within 1 2 the analyses of δd and δ18o of water were conducted using the pt assisted h2 h2o equilibration coplen et al 1991 and co2 water equilibration methods epstein and mayeda 1953 respectively the δ13c of dic was analyzed using the phosphoric acid analytical method described in torres et al 2005 all the measurements of 2h h 18o 16o and 13c 12c ratios were performed by a gasbench ii device interfaced with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms thermofisher scientific mat 253 and the results were reported on the vsmow scale for δd and δ18o with precisions of 0 2 and 0 1 respectively and the vpdb scale for δ13c with a precision of 0 1 based on the measured data of water chemistry concentrations of individual dic species including aqueous co2 hco3 and co3 2 saturation index with respect to calcite sic and pco2 in water were calculated using the program phreeqc 3 0 and phreeqc dat database parkhurst and appelo 2013 ca2 ion was adapted to obtain charge balance 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of the spring water the spring at site c1 has a water chemistry characterized by the dominance of ca2 and hco3 table 1 the concentrations of them hereafter denoted by square brackets ca2 and hco3 are remarkably high and range from 2 5 mmol l to 2 9 mmol l mean 2 7 mmol l and from 4 8 mmol l to 5 8 mmol l mean 5 3 respectively other ions are present at a very low concentration mg2 0 19 mmol l na 0 02 mmol l k 0 01 mmol l cl 0 03 mmol l so4 2 0 06 mmol l and no3 0 09 mmol l the spring water is slightly alkaline with a ph of 6 9 7 3 it has a high pco2 which ranging from 10 1 4 atm to 10 2 0 atm mean 10 1 6 atm the sic of the water is about 0 1 table 1 the δ13c of dic in spring water varies between 16 and 14 4 with an average of 15 3 the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of spring water exhibit temporal variations to different degrees table 1 fig 2 it can be observed that both ca2 and hco3 often decline at higher flow discharge also evident seasonal changes in the isotopic compositions of spring water are observed e g δ18o in fig 3 4 2 downstream variations in water geochemistry of the spring fed streams water chemistry of the spring fed stream shows marked downstream variations along the reach of c1 c7 table 2 fig 3 adjusting to the ambient air temperature the water temperature of stream displays a decrease trend along the flow path in winter season but an increase trend in other seasons fig 3 commonly the ec ca2 hco3 and pco2 all decline progressively downstream whereas the ph sic and δ13cdic exhibit an increase pattern during the studied periods smaller amplitude of downstream variations for all these parameters were often observed at higher flow discharge for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 fig 3 and vice versa spatially both δd and δ18o of stream water show very small variation along the flow path table 2 5 discussion 5 1 interpretation of the geochemistry of spring water at changliushui the spring at site c1 has a mean water temperature of 19 6 c throughout the year which is close to the local mean annual air temperature high concentrations of ca2 and dic in spring water indicate that a strong chemical dissolution of limestones has occurred within the aquifer as shown by the sic of 0 1 the limestones have been dissolved to the point of calcite saturation values of pco2 in this spring water ranging from 10 2 0 atm to 10 1 4 atm are close to the pco2 in the soil atmosphere in the region of guilin up to 10 1 6 10 1 4 atm wu et al 2012 suggesting that the dissolution of limestones likely takes place under an open system condition with respect to co2 this is supported by data of ph value 7 1 as well as ca2 concentration 2 7 mmol l that are close to the theoretically predicted values for limestone dissolution under an open system condition around 10 1 5 atm of soil pco2 at 19 c temporally the dissolution of carbonate in the aquifer exhibits seasonal variation as shown by relatively lower ca2 and hco3 of spring water observed in the rainy summer season fig 2 this contradicts to the fact that higher soil co2 production should occur due to enhanced biological activities in summer season wang et al 2019 wu et al 2012 since the lowest ca2 and hco3 are often observed at higher flow discharge we infer that the intensified infiltration of fresh rainwater through large fissures and conduits might have caused dilution effects on the concentration of solutes in groundwater in the rainy season especially during heavy rainfall events this behavior is common for springs in many subtropical karst watersheds and aquifers of sw china where the karst hydrosystems are highly dynamic in response to rainfall variability liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 due to the strong permeability of karst hydrosystem the seasonal variation of water isotopes of spring water e g δ18o fig 3 should be related to changes in precipitation isotopes for the δ13c of dic in spring water its values are dependent on the δ13c of soil co2 and the openness of the system for carbonate dissolution clark and fritz 1997 thus we infer that the slightly lower δ13cdic of spring water in winter seasons might be related to less production and infiltration of soil co2 into groundwater wang et al 2020 by using the relative proportions of individual dic species and their δ13c values which calculated based on the δ13c value of local soil co2 23 cao et al 2011 and respective isotopic enrichment factors clark and fritz 1997 we also obtain a theoretic value δ13cdic of around 15 9 for the open system dissolution of limestones our data of samples from changliushui are very close to this value again suggesting an open system condition for the dissolution of carbonate within the aquifer 5 2 processes of co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation along the stream during the infiltration of meteoric water across the soil zone downward to the vadose and saturated zones a large amount of soil co2 can be dissolved and transported into groundwater this commonly results in a high pco2 in karst spring water that is often several tens to over one hundred times that of the ambient atmosphere liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 driven by such a high pco2 gradient between stream water and the atmosphere the aqueous co2 will easily escape from water into the surrounding air through molecular diffusion as the aqueous h has been removed and the solution should be chemically equilibrated with a lowered pco2 water this co2 outgassing process concomitantly causes water ph sic to rise when the sic of stream water reaches or surpasses the critical threshold for crystal nucleation the calcite will start to precipitate in the channel it was reported that the calcite precipitation does not occur until the solution attains nearly five times supersaturation that is high enough to overcome kinetic inhibition dreybrodt et al 1992 hoffer french and herman 1989 at changliushui the pco2 in the spring water is 30 120 times of that in the atmosphere 10 3 5 atm at a short distance from the spring the pco2 water commonly decreases significantly fig 3 it can be observed that the pco2 water falls quickly by about 30 70 mean 50 between sites c1 and c2 followed by an increase of water ph and sic both by 0 2 to 0 5 units mean 0 3 unit after site c2 the pco2 water continues to decline and becomes 10 2 4 atm at site c3 or c4 and then keeps at a low level in the lower reach of the stream fig 3 this progressive co2 outgassing further increases the water ph and sic it can be observed that high degrees of calcite supersaturation sic 0 5 1 2 are often attained in the reach after site c2 or c2a fig 3 also the ca2 usually starts to decrease at site c2 or c2a implying the commencement of calcite precipitation this is in agreement with the field observation the calcite precipitation can simultaneously lead to the generation of gaseous co2 see the reverse reaction of eq 3 and for each molecule of caco3 deposited one molecule of co2 must be released into the solution via hco3 dehydration dehydroxylation in a turbulent stream flow like the changliushui stream such gaseous co2 produced by the calcite precipitation can be easily removed from the water and the conversion of it into aqueous hco3 should not occur hence we can distinguish two different types of co2 outgassing existing along the flow path i outgassing of physically dissolved co2 during the process of carbonate weathering as the primary co2 outgassing and ii outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite as an additional co2 outgassing both types of co2 outgassing govern the downstream evolution of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water 5 3 carbon isotopic fractionation associated with co2 outgassing along a fast flowing surface stream the stable isotopes of stream water often experiences kinetic isotopic fractionation to various degrees at changliushui the downstream variations of water isotopes of stream water are very small table 2 fig 3 this may suggest little influence of evaporation and other physiochemical evolution in such a fast flowing system in contrast the δ13cdic values of stream water show an evident increase pattern along the stream fig 3 downstream enrichment in 13c of dic in water has been observed in many tufa travertine depositing streams kele et al 2011 usdowski et al 1979 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2020 both outgassing of aqueous co2 and calcite precipitation induced co2 outgassing could cause kinetic isotope fractionation for the remaining hco3 reservoir in the water for the diffusive outgassing of aqueous co2 small isotope fractionation between gaseous co2 and aqueous co2 can be obtained i e the enrichment factor for the reaction from co2 g to co2 aq ε13cco2 g co2 aq 1 1 clark and fritz 1997 however there is a much larger isotope fractionation during the hco3 dehydration dehydroxylation and the enrichment factor ε13cco2 g hco3 ranges about 10 1 to 7 3 at 5 25 c or is even higher up to 20 caused by fast calcite precipitation yan et al 2020 from the spring till site c7 the dic of stream water undergoes progressive 13c enrichment along the flow path fig 3 and the δ13cdic value of stream water has increased by 1 1 to 5 6 with an average of 2 7 table 2 it can also be observed that there is just a small increase in δ13cdic about 0 35 in the reach from the spring till site c2 or c2a where significant outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 takes place this confirms the small influence of diffusive co2 outgassing on the δ13cdic of stream water dreybrodt 2019 usdowski et al 1979 yan et al 2020 also the increase of δ13cdic might be partly associated with the loss of isotopically depleted aqueous co2 from the water cross plot of δ13cdic and ca2 shows that there is a negatively linear relationship between them fig 4 which proving that the additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation has caused a large isotopic enrichment for the remaining dic in stream water the amplitude of downstream isotope enrichment is dependent on the mass transfer co2 associated with calcite precipitation fig 5 a biological activities for example the photosynthetic uptake of dic from the water can potentially modify the δ13cdic too however this may be true in the lower reach of stream with low flow velocity or spring fed ponds jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 spiro and pentecost 1991 in a fast flowing stream like the changliushui the influence of metabolic process on the δ13cdic of bulk stream water should be minor because of the high flow velocity 1 m s and relatively large pool of hco3 4 mmol l in water 5 4 flux and influencing factors of co2 outgassing along the stream 5 4 1 estimates of co2 outgassing flux in this section we attempt to quantify the flux of co2 outgassing along the investigated reach of stream at changliushui and elucidate the affecting factors first of all mass both co2 and caco3 transfer along the stream was determined by calculation on the difference in solute concentrations of samples from the upstream and downstream monitoring sites for co2 the downstream change of total inorganic carbon concentration tic calculated with phreeqc 3 0 was used to obtain the total mass transfer of co2 in stream water i e δ tic in units of mmol l the net mass transfer of caco3 δ caco3 in water equals to the difference of measured ca2 concentration between each pair of monitoring sites δ ca2 because during calcite precipitation for each molecule of caco3 deposited one molecule of co2 must be released to the air we used the remaining difference in tic concentration between upstream and downstream sites after correcting for the portion of inorganic carbon involved in the calcite precipitation to give the mass transfer of co2 during the diffusive outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 δ co2 d 4 δ c o 2 d δ t i c 2 δ c a 2 along the investigated course of stream the fluxes of co2 outgassing f d and f p for the primary co2 outgassing and the additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation respectively were then estimated based on the mass transfer of co2 and flow discharge q 5 f δ c o 2 q the calculated results of mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing fluxes along the entire studied reach c1 c7 of stream are listed in table 3 it can be seen that the δ co2 d is 0 65 1 51 mmol l mean 1 0 mmol l accounting for 52 6 85 2 mean 70 7 of the total mass transfer of co2 along the reach of c1 c7 by using the equation 5 the flux of this primary co2 outgassing f d in the reach between sites c1 and c7 ranging from 3 34 mmol s to 131 02 mmol s with an average of 21 16 mmol s table 3 was obtained along the flow path particularly from site c2 till c7 the δ co2 p i e ca2 has progressively decreased by 0 15 0 75 mmol l mean 0 41 mmol l and accordingly the calculated flux of co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation f p ranges from 2 09 mmol s to 22 80 mmol s with an average of 5 48 mmol l table 3 5 4 2 influencing factors of co2 outgassing in stream in the course from the spring orifice to site c2 the mass transfer of co2 caused by the primary co2 outgassing δ co2 d displays temporal variations to some degree which might be mainly linked to the change in the rate of co2 outgassing along the stream it was reported that the rate of diffusive co2 outgassing in thin film water for example the dripping water on top of speleothem is independent of the difference gradient between the pco2 in the water and the pco2 in the surrounding atmosphere dreybrodt 2019 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 hansen et al 2013 alternatively it primarily depends on the thickness of water flow sheet more relevantly the evolution of the exponential decay of aqueous co2 in equilibrium towards a lower pco2 can be described by a characteristic time constant for outgassing τout dreybrodt 1988 6 τ out 4 δ 2 π d m where dm is the coefficient of molecular diffusion for aqueous co2 1 10 5 cm2 s and δ is the depth of the water flow sheet a thinner sheet of water flow in the channel would yield a smaller time constant of co2 outgassing and thus be of utmost favorable for rapid co2 outgassing in a stream channel the flow discharge directly controls the thickness of water flow sheet i e width to depth ratios of the flow and hence the time constant for diffusive co2 outgassing thus the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing rate in the studied reach of stream got reduced greatly at higher discharge for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 at changliushui table 3 and vice versa also the discharge controlled flow velocity in a steep channel can affect the mass transfer of co2 in a reach with at a defined distance too in general the pco2 in spring water can depict the initial amount of aqueous co2 in stream water and thus affect the mass transfer of co2 as well especially in the upstream reach fig 5c this also indirectly means that at the same level of discharge rate it will take longer time or distance for stream water with higher pco2 to become completely equilibrated with the pco2 in the surrounding atmosphere the mass transfer of caco3 and associated co2 δ co2 p are closely linked to the hydrodynamic conditions too fig 5b under high flow conditions for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 the downstream decrease of ca2 was minor generating less mass transfer of co2 associated with the precipitation of calcite table 3 in contrast higher mass transfer of co2 was obtained at lower discharge e g jun 8 2018 there are two explanations for these observations on one hand a thinner water flow sheet was attained as the discharge rate got reduced and thus the time constant for diffusive outgassing of co2 became smaller causing rapid outgassing of aqueous co2 exported by spring water as a result the sic rose more quickly along the stream leading to the commencement of calcite precipitation at more upstream location consequently greater calcite precipitation occurred along the investigated reach of stream on the other hand the calcite precipitation and associated co2 outgassing could be affected by the rate of precipitation previous studies have found that in natural flowing waters the ion transport of ca2 and hco3 proceeds across a laminar diffusion boundary layer dbl between the bulk solution and solid surface and higher flow velocity of stream water could reduce the dbl thickness thereby facilitating calcite precipitation and causing more co2 outgassing dreybrodt et al 1992 liu et al 1995 due to the change of streambed morphology the mass transfer of co2 could be variable along the stream more mass transfer of co2 is often found in the reach with thinnest water flow sheet and strong turbulence the turbulent flow condition resembles to a thinner water flow sheet and thus could reduce the decay time constant of pco2 resulting in rapid co2 outgassing particularly the turbulence and dispersion of flow across rimstone dams and cascades in the channel can significantly enhance the co2 outgassing drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 in contrast the water column gets increased in thickness in waterholes or ponds within the channel where less co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation would occur drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 wang et al 2014 the longitudinal profile of the investigated stream reach at changliushui shows that from site c2 the gradient of streambed increases greatly fig 1d and the channel gets wider resulting in elevated flow velocity and dispersion of flow such hydrological condition is favorable for the co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation in the channel larger mass transfer of co2 produced by calcite precipitation is often found in the course where the streambed is more rugged with stronger turbulence e g the c2b c3a segment and or steeper with higher flow velocity e g the c4 c7 segment fig 6 the co2 outgassing can also be influenced by downstream change of water temperature which could modify the constants of both co2 solubility in water and calcite precipitation liu et al 1995 theoretically higher solubility constant of co2 would be obtained at low temperature prohibiting molecular co2 from outgassing from the water at changliushui except for the first quick increase between c1 and c2 sites less downstream increase of ph and sic was observed in winter when the air temperature was lower than that of spring water e g jan 26 2018 fig 3 an indicative of temperature effects on the outgassing of aqueous co2 however the ca2 hco3 ec and δ13cdic displayed larger downstream changes on jan 26 2018 when the discharge rate was smaller than that on jul 19 2018 fig 3 this suggests that the hydrodynamic conditions have greater impacts on the calcite precipitation and associated co2 outgassing than the temperature besides the control of physiochemical abiotic process biotic process can affect the calcite precipitation in tufa travertine depositing environments too it was reported that the growth of biota including submerged plants mosses algae and bacteria could induce or influence calcite precipitation by modifying the chemistry of the bulk solution through metabolic activities e g photosynthetic uptake of aqueous co2 or hco3 and or passively providing nucleation or growth sites for calcite crystals arenas et al 2019 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 2006 merz preiß and riding 1999 pentecost 2005 at changliushui organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria e g oscillatoria are ubiquitous in the channel fig 1f so these organisms should inevitably affect the calcite precipitation in such a steep channel however the influence of metabolic process on water chemistry and associated calcite precipitation is often limited due to the high flow velocity and relatively large pool of dic in water yan et al 2020 the main role played by organisms is likely to be that they provide fresh surface for crystal nucleation or particle trapping hoffer french and herman 1989 hence the growth of organisms in the channel might be able to affect the calcite precipitation and thus its associated co2 outgassing to some degree in a way of promoting calcite nucleation as well 5 5 implications for carbonate weathering associated carbon sink assessment 5 5 1 proportion of the co2 released from water to that sequestered by carbonate weathering carbon cycling is one of the most active biogeochemical processes in karst watersheds and aquifers meteoric water seeps through the soil and adsorbs soil co2 producing carbonic acids eqs 1 and 2 after this corrosive water comes into contact with carbonate rocks within the aquifer it dissolves carbonates see eq 3 during these processes considerable soil co2 can be consumed and converted into dic which is then exported by groundwater although the soil co2 is derived from root respiration and the decay of organic matter the sequestration of it by carbonate dissolution decreases the direct release of soil co2 to the atmosphere thus such chemical weathering of carbonate can be regarded as a sink of atmospheric co2 jiang and yuan 1999 liu et al 2010 for the dissolution of carbonate under an open system condition the resulting dic in groundwater mainly consists of i physically dissolved aqueous co2 and ii hco3 produced by carbonate dissolution in which one half comes from calcite and the other half from soil co2 here the calcium concentration was subtracted from the dic concentration calculated by the program phreeqc 3 0 to determine the concentration of the portion of dic in spring water derived from soil co2 dic s the data are given in table 4 it can be found that 57 of dic in the spring water at site c1 is derived from soil co2 while 43 from calcite these values are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for open system dissolution of limestones the flux of carbonate weathering associated carbon sink f s was estimated using the calculated dic s and discharge rate of the spring q 7 f s dic s q based on these fluxes of carbon sink in the spring water and co2 outgassing both the primary and additional ones along the spring fed stream the proportion of the co2 released back to the atmosphere relative to that of the soil co2 uptake by carbonate weathering was estimated finally we obtain that at changliushui the flux of total co2 release along the stream between c1 and c7 sites accounts for 29 0 47 3 mean 39 0 of that of the soil co2 fixed in the dic of spring water the outgassing of aqueous co2 has caused 20 6 35 2 mean 27 4 of the uptake of co2 to return to the atmosphere while the calcite precipitation induced outgassing has resulted in an additional proportion of 4 3 20 1 mean 11 6 for the co2 return we also estimated the flux of diffusive outgassing of aqueous co2 along the spring fed stream when the stream water has completely equilibrated with the pco2 in the atmosphere 10 3 5 atm and if no any calcite precipitation has occurred the results show that a maximum of 29 2 48 9 of the co2 fixed in the dic of spring water could be released back to the atmosphere however the complete of this diffusive co2 outgassing process may need to take a much long time and at a long distance temporally the release of physically dissolved aqueous co2 displays relatively smaller variation along the reach of c1 c7 as a majority of aqueous co2 can be released at a short distance after the spring and the flux of this primary outgassing is mainly related to the initial pco2 in stream water however the co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation is closely associated with hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology see sect 5 4 2 more specifically higher flow discharge could result in much smaller flux of precipitation associated co2 outgassing and hence less release of soil co2 sequestered by carbonate weathering and vice versa 5 5 2 wider discussion in karst terrain karst springs and underground streams are widespread for example tens of thousands of karst springs and subterranean streams have been found in the region of southwest china karst 5 4 105 km2 which is one of largest world s karst regions guo et al 2013 these karst springs and subterranean streams are often the headwater of many large rivers and contribute a large quantity of dic loads to the river water due to the high pco2 in karst groundwater and usually steep gradient heterogeneous stream landscape for the drainage of surface streams in such a headwater area the co2 fixed in dic of stream water is likely to be re emitted back to the atmosphere through outgassing of both physically dissolved aqueous co2 and that arising from calcite precipitation in stream channel strong outgassing of co2 has been often found at cascades waterfalls dams and along steep rugged slopes this study drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 zhou et al 2013 assessing the flux of different types of co2 outgassing and dic evolution in these surface streams is critical for a fully understanding of the stability and magnitude of carbonate weathering related carbon sink in this study we show an extreme case of co2 outgassing at changliushui where the high gradient of stream channel has significantly enhanced co2 degassing from the water of stream fed by karst groundwater including the primary outgassing of aqueous co2 and additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation along the flow path generally speaking the outgassing of aqueous co2 could not stop until the establishment of equilibrium with the pco2 in the atmosphere thus such portion of dic is much unstable in surface waters although the hco3 in water changes with ph theoretical simulation shows that only a few of it 1 mmol l will be converted to co2 aq 0 5 mmol l and co3 2 0 5 mmol l when the solution is completely chemically equilibrated with the atmospheric pco2 10 3 5 atm and if no calcite precipitation occurs in contrast the precipitation of calcite can remove hco3 to a large degree and cause more co2 outgassing from the water however the co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation has just caused an additional 4 3 20 1 of soil co2 release relative to that sequestered by carbonate weathering along a 250 m long steep course of stream at changliushui our unpublished data show that from site c7 to a further downstream site c12 about 320 m far away from c7 streambed gradient 1 2 fig 1a at changliushui the ph pco2 sic and ca2 and dic all exhibit relatively small downstream change when this creek flows to the plain area both ca2 and hco3 show very small changes along an investigated reach that is 2 5 km in length too these observations indicate that much smaller rates of co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation are likely to occur in streams with low gradients furthermore the rates of co2 outgassing can be greatly declined with the increase of flow discharge this study drysdale et al 2002 zhou et al 2013 in many cases the karst springs and underground streams have much high discharge rates often 100 l s and some of them are discharged directly into large rivers reservoirs and lakes pu et al 2017 2020 under these hydrological conditions both the rate and flux of co2 outgassing should be relatively smaller furthermore the water mixing or dilution of tributaries that have different pco2 would occur when the groundwater feeding stream flows into the main course of river or converges with tributaries because the thermodynamic equilibrium of carbonate mineral phases is controlled by a power law while solute concentrations vary linearly as the solutes mix the calcite saturation level of stream water can greatly decrease runnells 1969 therefore we can suspect that the rate of co2 outgassing will get reduced and calcite precipitation associated co2 outgassing would be significantly restricted in low order rivers e g in the guijiang river and xijiang river south china yao et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 2019 the reduced water residence time in headwater streams does not allow significant in stream biological processes to occur however an increasing body of evidence from laboratory experiments and field observations has shown that a proportion of dic both aqueous co2 and hco3 can be consumed by aquatic organisms for metabolism and converted into organic carbon which could then move or settle down through the water column and be buried in sediments leading to a net carbon sink in rivers reservoirs lakes and the ocean so called biological carbon pump fig 7 chen et al 2017 huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2015 2017 pu et al 2017 such biological carbon pump effect on the dic in water could stabilize the atmospheric co2 sink caused by rock weathering although the co2 sequestration by carbonate weathering might be fully balanced by co2 release during calcite bioprecipitation in the ocean during much long time periods 105 yr amiotte suchet et al 2003 berner 1992 martin 2017 over shorter at least decadal to centennial timescales the carbonate co2 h2o aquatic phototroph interaction could be expected to represent a net carbon sink liu and dreybrodt 2015 liu et al 2010 2018 due to its large quantity and the characteristics of sensitive responding to climate change and changes in land use and land cover the carbonate weathering carbon sink needs to be included in the current global carbon budget he et al 2020 liu and dreybrodt 2015 zeng et al 2019 6 conclusions at the changliushui catchment large amounts of dic hco3 and co2 aq included produced by the dissolution of carbonate within the aquifers are transported by groundwater when the groundwater emerges at the earth s surface and flows a high gradient heterogeneous landscape significant co2 outgassing from water takes place along the flow path downstream our investigations into the downstream geochemical evolution have revealed that two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing exist along the karst spring fed creek with a steep gradient including i outgassing of physically dissolved co2 during carbonate dissolution as the primary co2 outgassing and ii outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite as an additional co2 outgassing both types of co2 outgassing have led to a continuum of changes in hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water at a short distance from the spring the physically dissolved aqueous co2 in stream water escapes rapidly and this process causes the ph and sic to rise resulting in subsequent calcite precipitation and more co2 outgassing along the stream this precipitation induced co2 outgassing has also caused great downstream enrichment in 13c for the remaining dic in stream water spatiotemporal variations in the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing flux show that the rates of both the primary and additional outgassing of co2 are affected by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology in particular lower rates of co2 outgassing are observed at higher flow discharge and vice versa along the studied reach from the spring till site c7 the primary co2 outgassing has caused about 21 35 of the total amount of soil co2 sequestered in dic of the feeding spring water to be released back to the atmosphere in addition more release of soil co2 sequestered in dic accounting for 4 20 of the total uptake of soil co2 has been generated by the precipitation induced co2 outgassing it can also be found that much less return of co2 occurs at higher flow discharge this study has provided an extreme case of co2 outgassing in a creek with steep gradient and relatively low discharge in many cases with higher flow discharge e g 100 l s and low gradient landscape however less co2 outgassing from the water especially that induced by calcite precipitation would occur also the precipitation associated co2 outgassing should be significantly restricted in low order rivers where mixing or dilution of tributaries and increased in stream metabolism occur these findings shed more light on the fate of dic in karst groundwater feeding surface streams and can provide more evidence for the previous conclusion that the h2o carbonate co2 aquatic phototroph interaction represents a net carbon sink at least over short timescales credit

4736,whether carbonate weathering on land represents an important terrestrial carbon sink has long been debated as the co2 sequestered by the dissolution of carbonate may return to the atmosphere through co2 outgassing from groundwater feeding surface waters in headwater area of karst terrain the co2 outgassing frequently happens in spring fed streams but its flux and influencing factors still remain under researched in this study we conducted a monthly monitoring of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water along a karst spring fed creek at changliushui sw china that has a steep gradient and in which tufa deposition occurs in order to explore the process of co2 outgassing and elucidate the outgassing flux across space and time and its influencing factors the analyses of downstream geochemical evolution have revealed that two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing exist along the flow path i outgassing of physically dissolved soil co2 during the process of carbonate dissolution as the primary co2 outgassing and ii an additional outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite at a short distance from the spring the aqueous co2 escapes from water to a large degree through molecular diffusion driven by high gradient of partial pressure of co2 pco2 between the water and the atmosphere such co2 outgassing concomitantly causes the saturation index with respect to calcite sic to rise resulting in subsequent calcite precipitation and thus more co2 outgassing spatiotemporal variations in the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing flux show that the rates of both types of co2 outgassing are significantly influenced by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology in particular lower rates of co2 outgassing are observed at higher flow discharge and vice versa in the studied reach of stream the primary and additional co2 outgassing have caused about 21 35 and 4 20 of the total soil co2 sequestered in dic of the feeding spring water to be released back to the atmosphere respectively and the higher flow discharge the less co2 return based on these findings we postulate that the co2 outgassing especially that induced by calcite precipitation should be relatively smaller in streams which have a lower gradient and elevated discharge rate and where the mixing or dilution of tributaries and increased in stream metabolism occur this provides more evidence for the previous conclusion that the h2o carbonate co2 aquatic phototroph interaction could represent a net carbon sink at least over short timescales keywords hydrochemistry stable carbon isotope calcite precipitation hydrodynamic conditions changliushui 1 introduction about 15 of the global ice free continental surface is underlain by karstifiable carbonate rocks goldscheider et al 2020 these carbonate rocks constitute the largest carbon reservoir on earth martin 2017 due to high solubility of carbonate minerals extensive water co2 carbonate interactions occur in karst watersheds and aquifers eqs 1 3 1 co2 h2o h2co3 2 h2co3 h hco3 3 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 such chemical weathering of carbonate involves considerable uptake of co2 mainly soil co2 that is also of atmospheric origin which is converted to dissolved inorganic carbon dic and then exported to rivers lakes and the ocean acting as an atmospheric co2 sink jiang and yuan 1999 liu et al 2010 previous studies have reported that the action of carbonate weathering on land coupled with global water cycle and photosynthetic uptake of dic by aquatic organisms in both terrestrial and marine environments could yield a great carbon sink about 0 11 0 8 pg c yr accounting for 7 25 of the estimated terrestrial carbon sink gombert 2002 liu et al 2010 2018 liu and zhao 2000 martin 2017 yuan 1997 thus the carbonate weathering should represent an important terrestrial carbon sink liu and dreybrodt 2015 liu et al 2010 however it has long been debated by geologists that the co2 sequestered by the dissolution of carbonate could return to the atmosphere through carbonate precipitation and associated co2 outgassing see the reverse reaction of eq 3 berner 1992 berner et al 1983 curl 2012 this reminds us to check the stability of carbonate weathering related carbon sink and evaluate its magnitude variations and at which timescales it may act the occurrence of co2 outgassing from karst groundwater that normally has much high partial pressure of co2 pco2 several tens to over one hundred times that of ambient atmosphere is common in karst terrain also it often results in calcite precipitation when subsequent supersaturation with respect to caco3 has reached the critical threshold for calcite nucleation forming speleothems in caves fairchild et al 2006 and tufa deposits along groundwater feeding surface streams drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing have been found to exist in flowing water systems e g dripping water on the top of speleothem one is outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 driven by the initial difference gradient between the pco2 in water and the pco2 in the atmosphere and the other is outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite dreybrodt 2019 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 hansen et al 2013 both types of co2 outgassing can remove the dic in water and result in the release of soil co2 sequestered during the process of carbonate dissolution back to the atmosphere thereby counteracting the carbonate weathering related carbon sink to date the fluxes of co2 outgassing from stream water especially that induced by the calcite precipitation and the proportion of them relative to that of the total uptake of co2 by carbonate weathering still remain under researched in a headwater area of carbonate terrain the co2 outgassing widely happens when the karst groundwater emerges at the earth s surface and flows to a low elevation area particularly in the reach with abrupt changes in streambed morphology such as cascades or waterfalls drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 along the flow path of surface streams the co2 outgassing can result in apparent downstream changes in hydrochemical and isotopic compositions as revealed by many studies of tufa travertine depositing streams including those fed by hydrothermal springs or groundwaters of endogenic origin drysdale 2001 drysdale et al 2002 herman and lorah 1987 1988 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 1995 kele et al 2011 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2020 zhou et al 2013 in addition many factors including variations in water chemistry of the feeding groundwater flow discharge streambed morphology in stream metabolism and other environmental factors could affect the downstream geochemical evolution of stream water drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 zhou et al 2013 by investigating the hydrochemical and isotopic variations along the longitudinal profile of a stream therefore it will allow us to explore the process of co2 outgassing determine its flux and elucidate the influencing factors in this study we conducted a monthly investigation into the hydrochemical and stable isotopic compositions of karst spring water and spring fed surface stream water at changliushui guilin southwest china in order to explore the processes of co2 outgassing particularly that induced by the precipitation of calcite and determine the flux of individual types of co2 outgassing across space and time furthermore the proportion of the flux of co2 outgassing relative to that of the uptake of soil co2 by carbonate weathering was estimated so as to better understand the dynamic stability of carbonate weathering related carbon sink the influencing factors of co2 outgassing flux were elucidated based on which the co2 outgassing in the lower reach of streams and in rivers located in areas with a low gradient were discussed this study is of significance for the reason that it provides an extreme case with significant co2 outgassing along a karst groundwater feeding stream where considerable calcite precipitation occurs and the results will provide more insights into the fate of dic exported into terrestrial water bodies and lay the foundations for assessing the role of carbonate weathering in the global carbon cycle 2

area of guilin karst which is one part of the world heritage property of south china karst spectacular conical karst hills with deep depressions are typical of karst landscape in this area today the region of guilin has a monsoon influenced humid subtropical climate with an annual mean air temperature of 19 c and an annual mean precipitation of 1890 mm in which 60 of rainfall occurs during the season of plum rain between april to july data obtained from the china meteorological data service center the catchment of changliushui springs is small typical karst watershed with a large depression surrounded by peak clusters fig 1b the total area of the watershed is about 1 5 km2 host rocks in the watershed are mainly composed of pure limestones of middle to upper devonian age two small perennial springs sites s1 and s2 1 3 l s emerge in the east of the watershed issuing along an approximately north south trending fault fig 1b also ephemeral epikarst springs e g at s3 and s4 sites

creek often dries up before reaching site d1 in the period with little rainfall fig 1b within the catchment a majority of hillslope areas are covered by high density evergreen shrubs fig 1c the main spring is discharged on the middle slope of a hill in the west of the watershed at site c1 and then flows downslope from an elevation of 240 m to 190 m above sea level a s l at site c7 fig 1b and d monitoring data show that the discharge rate of this spring exhibits great temporal change in response to rainfall variability higher flow rates are observed in the rainy season with a baseflow of 5 10 l s and a flood flow of 20 l s up to 160 l s whereas less flow 1 l s is generated in the dry season when there is little rainfall this study li 2006 the investigated course of the creek c1 c7 is about 240 m in length a gradient of 3 23 mean 10 is observed along this reach studied fig 1d the channel of stream has a width of about 30 50 cm with a water flow thickness of about 1 2 cm to several centimeters at a baseflow level but up to several tens of centimeters during high flow regimes stream flow velocity is variable along the channel mostly ranging from 0 5 m s to 2 m s but can reach up to 3 4 m s several small waterholes rimstone dams and cascades are developed along the channel abundant fossil tufa deposits are observed within the channel from site c2 which is about 30 m far away from the spring to site c7 fig 1d weeds bryophytes algae and bacteria are widespread at the bottom and on both flanks of the channel fig 1e and f 3 sampling and analytical methods the spring water at site c1 and spring fed stream waters along the flow path incl sites c2 c7 at an interval of 20 30 m fig 1d were sampled from august 2017 and september 2019 basically based on a monthly sampling strategy the discharge rate of the spring was monitored by a weir with two cross sections a digital level instrument trimble was used to measure the streambed gradient in the field water temperature ph value and electric conductivity ec were measured using a portable multi parameter analyzer ponsel with a precision of 0 1 c 0 01 ph and 1 μs cm respectively also alkalinity and ca2 concentration were determined on the spot using the merck kgaa titration test kits with a precision of 0 1 mmol l and 2 mg l respectively duplicate titrations were performed at each site water samples for chemical and stable isotopic analyses were passed through a membrane filter 0 45 μm in pore size and placed in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in different sizes ultrapure hno3 1 1 was added to the aliquot for cation analysis to acidify the sample to ph 2 and 2 3 drops of saturated hgcl2 were added to bottles for the analysis of carbon isotope to avoid any influence of microbial activity all samples were stored in the fridge at 4 c before measurement concentrations of k na mg2 and ca2 were determined by an icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermofisher scientific usa and so4 2 cl no3 concentrations by

dic was analyzed using the phosphoric acid analytical method described in torres et al 2005 all the measurements of 2h h 18o 16o and 13c 12c ratios were performed by a gasbench ii device interfaced with an isotopic ratio mass spectrometer irms thermofisher scientific mat 253 and the results were reported on the vsmow scale for δd and δ18o with precisions of 0 2 and 0 1 respectively and the vpdb scale for δ13c with a precision of 0 1 based on the measured data of water chemistry concentrations of individual dic species including aqueous co2 hco3 and co3 2 saturation index with respect to calcite sic and pco2 in water were calculated using the program phreeqc 3 0 and phreeqc dat database parkhurst and appelo 2013 ca2 ion was adapted to obtain charge balance 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of the spring water the spring at site c1 has a water chemistry characterized by the dominance of ca2 and hco3 table 1 the concentrations of them hereafter denoted by square brackets ca2 and hco3 are remarkably high and range from 2 5 mmol l to 2 9 mmol l mean 2 7 mmol l and from 4 8 mmol l to 5 8 mmol l mean 5 3 respectively other ions are present at a very low concentration mg2 0 19 mmol l na 0 02 mmol l k 0 01 mmol l cl 0 03 mmol l so4 2 0 06 mmol l and no3 0 09 mmol l the spring water is slightly alkaline with a ph of 6 9 7 3 it has a high pco2 which ranging from 10 1 4 atm to 10 2 0 atm mean 10 1 6 atm the sic of the water is about 0 1 table 1 the δ13c of dic in spring water varies between 16 and 14 4 with an average of 15 3 the hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of spring water exhibit temporal variations to different degrees table 1 fig 2 it can be observed that both ca2 and hco3 often decline at higher flow discharge also evident seasonal changes in the isotopic compositions of spring water are observed e g δ18o in fig 3 4 2 downstream variations in water geochemistry of the spring fed streams water chemistry of the spring fed stream shows marked downstream variations along the reach of c1 c7 table 2 fig 3 adjusting to the ambient air temperature the water temperature of stream displays a decrease trend along the flow path in winter season but an increase trend in other seasons fig 3 commonly the ec ca2 hco3 and pco2 all decline progressively downstream whereas the ph sic and δ13cdic exhibit an increase pattern during the studied periods smaller amplitude of downstream variations for all these parameters were often observed at higher flow discharge for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 fig 3 and vice versa spatially both δd and δ18o of stream water show very small variation along the flow path table 2 5 discussion 5 1 interpretation of the geochemistry of spring water at changliushui the spring at site c1 has a mean water temperature of 19 6 c throughout the year which is close to the local mean annual air temperature high concentrations of ca2 and dic in spring water indicate that a strong chemical dissolution of limestones has occurred within the aquifer as shown by the sic of 0 1 the limestones have been dissolved to the point of calcite saturation values of pco2 in this spring water ranging from 10 2 0 atm to 10 1 4 atm are close to the pco2 in the soil atmosphere in the region of guilin up to 10 1 6 10 1 4 atm wu et al 2012 suggesting that the dissolution of limestones likely takes place under an open system condition with respect to co2 this is supported by data of ph value 7 1 as well as ca2 concentration 2 7 mmol l that are close to the theoretically predicted values for limestone dissolution under an open system condition around 10 1 5 atm of soil pco2 at 19 c temporally the dissolution of carbonate in the aquifer exhibits seasonal variation as shown by relatively lower ca2 and hco3 of spring water observed in the rainy summer season fig 2 this contradicts to the fact that higher soil co2 production should occur due to enhanced biological activities in summer season wang et al 2019 wu et al 2012 since the lowest ca2 and hco3 are often observed at higher flow discharge we infer that the intensified infiltration of fresh rainwater through large fissures and conduits might have caused dilution effects on the concentration of solutes in groundwater in the rainy season especially during heavy rainfall events this behavior is common for springs in many subtropical karst watersheds and aquifers of sw china where the karst hydrosystems are highly dynamic in response to rainfall variability liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 due to the strong permeability of karst hydrosystem the seasonal variation of water isotopes of spring water e g δ18o fig 3 should be related to changes in precipitation isotopes for the δ13c of dic in spring water its values are dependent on the δ13c of soil co2 and the openness of the system for carbonate dissolution clark and fritz 1997 thus we infer that the slightly lower δ13cdic of spring water in winter seasons might be related to less production and infiltration of soil co2 into groundwater wang et al 2020 by using the relative proportions of individual dic species and their δ13c values which calculated based on the δ13c value of local soil co2 23 cao et al 2011 and respective isotopic enrichment factors clark and fritz 1997 we also obtain a theoretic value δ13cdic of around 15 9 for the open system dissolution of limestones our data of samples from changliushui are very close to this value again suggesting an open system condition for the dissolution of carbonate within the aquifer 5 2 processes of co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation along the stream during the infiltration of meteoric water across the soil zone downward to the vadose and saturated zones a large amount of soil co2 can be dissolved and transported into groundwater this commonly results in a high pco2 in karst spring water that is often several tens to over one hundred times that of the ambient atmosphere liu et al 2007 wang et al 2020 driven by such a high pco2 gradient between stream water and the atmosphere the aqueous co2 will easily escape from water into the surrounding air through molecular diffusion as the aqueous h has been removed and the solution should be chemically equilibrated with a lowered pco2 water this co2 outgassing process concomitantly causes water ph sic to rise when the sic of stream water reaches or surpasses the critical threshold for crystal nucleation the calcite will start to precipitate in the channel it was reported that the calcite precipitation does not occur until the solution attains nearly five times supersaturation that is high enough to overcome kinetic inhibition dreybrodt et al 1992 hoffer french and herman 1989 at changliushui the pco2 in the spring water is 30 120 times of that in the atmosphere 10 3 5 atm at a short distance from the spring the pco2 water commonly decreases significantly fig 3 it can be observed that the pco2 water falls quickly by about 30 70 mean 50 between sites c1 and c2 followed by an increase of water ph and sic both by 0 2 to 0 5 units mean 0 3 unit after site c2 the pco2 water continues to decline and becomes 10 2 4 atm at site c3 or c4 and then keeps at a low level in the lower reach of the stream fig 3 this progressive co2 outgassing further increases the water ph and sic it can be observed that high degrees of calcite supersaturation sic 0 5 1 2 are often attained in the reach after site c2 or c2a fig 3 also the ca2 usually starts to decrease at site c2 or c2a implying the commencement of calcite precipitation this is in agreement with the field observation the calcite precipitation can simultaneously lead to the generation of gaseous co2 see the reverse reaction of eq 3 and for each molecule of caco3 deposited one molecule of co2 must be released into the solution via hco3 dehydration dehydroxylation in a turbulent stream flow like the changliushui stream such gaseous co2 produced by the calcite precipitation can be easily removed from the water and the conversion of it into aqueous hco3 should not occur hence we can distinguish two different types of co2 outgassing existing along the flow path i outgassing of physically dissolved co2 during the process of carbonate weathering as the primary co2 outgassing and ii outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite as an additional co2 outgassing both types of co2 outgassing govern the downstream evolution of hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water 5 3 carbon isotopic fractionation associated with co2 outgassing along a fast flowing surface stream the stable isotopes of stream water often experiences kinetic isotopic fractionation to various degrees at changliushui the downstream variations of water isotopes of stream water are very small table 2 fig 3 this may suggest little influence of evaporation and other physiochemical evolution in such a fast flowing system in contrast the δ13cdic values of stream water show an evident increase pattern along the stream fig 3 downstream enrichment in 13c of dic in water has been observed in many tufa travertine depositing streams kele et al 2011 usdowski et al 1979 wang et al 2014 yan et al 2020 both outgassing of aqueous co2 and calcite precipitation induced co2 outgassing could cause kinetic isotope fractionation for the remaining hco3 reservoir in the water for the diffusive outgassing of aqueous co2 small isotope fractionation between gaseous co2 and aqueous co2 can be obtained i e the enrichment factor for the reaction from co2 g to co2 aq ε13cco2 g co2 aq 1 1 clark and fritz 1997 however there is a much larger isotope fractionation during the hco3 dehydration dehydroxylation and the enrichment factor ε13cco2 g hco3 ranges about 10 1 to 7 3 at 5 25 c or is even higher up to 20 caused by fast calcite precipitation yan et al 2020 from the spring till site c7 the dic of stream water undergoes progressive 13c enrichment along the flow path fig 3 and the δ13cdic value of stream water has increased by 1 1 to 5 6 with an average of 2 7 table 2 it can also be observed that there is just a small increase in δ13cdic about 0 35 in the reach from the spring till site c2 or c2a where significant outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 takes place this confirms the small influence of diffusive co2 outgassing on the δ13cdic of stream water dreybrodt 2019 usdowski et al 1979 yan et al 2020 also the increase of δ13cdic might be partly associated with the loss of isotopically depleted aqueous co2 from the water cross plot of δ13cdic and ca2 shows that there is a negatively linear relationship between them fig 4 which proving that the additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation has caused a large isotopic enrichment for the remaining dic in stream water the amplitude of downstream isotope enrichment is dependent on the mass transfer co2 associated with calcite precipitation fig 5 a biological activities for example the photosynthetic uptake of dic from the water can potentially modify the δ13cdic too however this may be true in the lower reach of stream with low flow velocity or spring fed ponds jiang et al 2013 liu et al 2015 spiro and pentecost 1991 in a fast flowing stream like the changliushui the influence of metabolic process on the δ13cdic of bulk stream water should be minor because of the high flow velocity 1 m s and relatively large pool of hco3 4 mmol l in water 5 4 flux and influencing factors of co2 outgassing along the stream 5 4 1 estimates of co2 outgassing flux in this section we attempt to quantify the flux of co2 outgassing along the investigated reach of stream at changliushui and elucidate the affecting factors first of all mass both co2 and caco3 transfer along the stream was determined by calculation on the difference in solute concentrations of samples from the upstream and downstream monitoring sites for co2 the downstream change of total inorganic carbon concentration tic calculated with phreeqc 3 0 was used to obtain the total mass transfer of co2 in stream water i e δ tic in units of mmol l the net mass transfer of caco3 δ caco3 in water equals to the difference of measured ca2 concentration between each pair of monitoring sites δ ca2 because during calcite precipitation for each molecule of caco3 deposited one molecule of co2 must be released to the air we used the remaining difference in tic concentration between upstream and downstream sites after correcting for the portion of inorganic carbon involved in the calcite precipitation to give the mass transfer of co2 during the diffusive outgassing of physically dissolved aqueous co2 δ co2 d 4 δ c o 2 d δ t i c 2 δ c a 2 along the investigated course of stream the fluxes of co2 outgassing f d and f p for the primary co2 outgassing and the additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation respectively were then estimated based on the mass transfer of co2 and flow discharge q 5 f δ c o 2 q the calculated results of mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing fluxes along the entire studied reach c1 c7 of stream are listed in table 3 it can be seen that the δ co2 d is 0 65 1 51 mmol l mean 1 0 mmol l accounting for 52 6 85 2 mean 70 7 of the total mass transfer of co2 along the reach of c1 c7 by using the equation 5 the flux of this primary co2 outgassing f d in the reach between sites c1 and c7 ranging from 3 34 mmol s to 131 02 mmol s with an average of 21 16 mmol s table 3 was obtained along the flow path particularly from site c2 till c7 the δ co2 p i e ca2 has progressively decreased by 0 15 0 75 mmol l mean 0 41 mmol l and accordingly the calculated flux of co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation f p ranges from 2 09 mmol s to 22 80 mmol s with an average of 5 48 mmol l table 3 5 4 2 influencing factors of co2 outgassing in stream in the course from the spring orifice to site c2 the mass transfer of co2 caused by the primary co2 outgassing δ co2 d displays temporal variations to some degree which might be mainly linked to the change in the rate of co2 outgassing along the stream it was reported that the rate of diffusive co2 outgassing in thin film water for example the dripping water on top of speleothem is independent of the difference gradient between the pco2 in the water and the pco2 in the surrounding atmosphere dreybrodt 2019 dreybrodt and scholz 2011 hansen et al 2013 alternatively it primarily depends on the thickness of water flow sheet more relevantly the evolution of the exponential decay of aqueous co2 in equilibrium towards a lower pco2 can be described by a characteristic time constant for outgassing τout dreybrodt 1988 6 τ out 4 δ 2 π d m where dm is the coefficient of molecular diffusion for aqueous co2 1 10 5 cm2 s and δ is the depth of the water flow sheet a thinner sheet of water flow in the channel would yield a smaller time constant of co2 outgassing and thus be of utmost favorable for rapid co2 outgassing in a stream channel the flow discharge directly controls the thickness of water flow sheet i e width to depth ratios of the flow and hence the time constant for diffusive co2 outgassing thus the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing rate in the studied reach of stream got reduced greatly at higher discharge for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 at changliushui table 3 and vice versa also the discharge controlled flow velocity in a steep channel can affect the mass transfer of co2 in a reach with at a defined distance too in general the pco2 in spring water can depict the initial amount of aqueous co2 in stream water and thus affect the mass transfer of co2 as well especially in the upstream reach fig 5c this also indirectly means that at the same level of discharge rate it will take longer time or distance for stream water with higher pco2 to become completely equilibrated with the pco2 in the surrounding atmosphere the mass transfer of caco3 and associated co2 δ co2 p are closely linked to the hydrodynamic conditions too fig 5b under high flow conditions for example up to 150 l s on may 10 2018 the downstream decrease of ca2 was minor generating less mass transfer of co2 associated with the precipitation of calcite table 3 in contrast higher mass transfer of co2 was obtained at lower discharge e g jun 8 2018 there are two explanations for these observations on one hand a thinner water flow sheet was attained as the discharge rate got reduced and thus the time constant for diffusive outgassing of co2 became smaller causing rapid outgassing of aqueous co2 exported by spring water as a result the sic rose more quickly along the stream leading to the commencement of calcite precipitation at more upstream location consequently greater calcite precipitation occurred along the investigated reach of stream on the other hand the calcite precipitation and associated co2 outgassing could be affected by the rate of precipitation previous studies have found that in natural flowing waters the ion transport of ca2 and hco3 proceeds across a laminar diffusion boundary layer dbl between the bulk solution and solid surface and higher flow velocity of stream water could reduce the dbl thickness thereby facilitating calcite precipitation and causing more co2 outgassing dreybrodt et al 1992 liu et al 1995 due to the change of streambed morphology the mass transfer of co2 could be variable along the stream more mass transfer of co2 is often found in the reach with thinnest water flow sheet and strong turbulence the turbulent flow condition resembles to a thinner water flow sheet and thus could reduce the decay time constant of pco2 resulting in rapid co2 outgassing particularly the turbulence and dispersion of flow across rimstone dams and cascades in the channel can significantly enhance the co2 outgassing drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 in contrast the water column gets increased in thickness in waterholes or ponds within the channel where less co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation would occur drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 wang et al 2014 the longitudinal profile of the investigated stream reach at changliushui shows that from site c2 the gradient of streambed increases greatly fig 1d and the channel gets wider resulting in elevated flow velocity and dispersion of flow such hydrological condition is favorable for the co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation in the channel larger mass transfer of co2 produced by calcite precipitation is often found in the course where the streambed is more rugged with stronger turbulence e g the c2b c3a segment and or steeper with higher flow velocity e g the c4 c7 segment fig 6 the co2 outgassing can also be influenced by downstream change of water temperature which could modify the constants of both co2 solubility in water and calcite precipitation liu et al 1995 theoretically higher solubility constant of co2 would be obtained at low temperature prohibiting molecular co2 from outgassing from the water at changliushui except for the first quick increase between c1 and c2 sites less downstream increase of ph and sic was observed in winter when the air temperature was lower than that of spring water e g jan 26 2018 fig 3 an indicative of temperature effects on the outgassing of aqueous co2 however the ca2 hco3 ec and δ13cdic displayed larger downstream changes on jan 26 2018 when the discharge rate was smaller than that on jul 19 2018 fig 3 this suggests that the hydrodynamic conditions have greater impacts on the calcite precipitation and associated co2 outgassing than the temperature besides the control of physiochemical abiotic process biotic process can affect the calcite precipitation in tufa travertine depositing environments too it was reported that the growth of biota including submerged plants mosses algae and bacteria could induce or influence calcite precipitation by modifying the chemistry of the bulk solution through metabolic activities e g photosynthetic uptake of aqueous co2 or hco3 and or passively providing nucleation or growth sites for calcite crystals arenas et al 2019 hoffer french and herman 1989 liu et al 2006 merz preiß and riding 1999 pentecost 2005 at changliushui organisms such as algae and cyanobacteria e g oscillatoria are ubiquitous in the channel fig 1f so these organisms should inevitably affect the calcite precipitation in such a steep channel however the influence of metabolic process on water chemistry and associated calcite precipitation is often limited due to the high flow velocity and relatively large pool of dic in water yan et al 2020 the main role played by organisms is likely to be that they provide fresh surface for crystal nucleation or particle trapping hoffer french and herman 1989 hence the growth of organisms in the channel might be able to affect the calcite precipitation and thus its associated co2 outgassing to some degree in a way of promoting calcite nucleation as well 5 5 implications for carbonate weathering associated carbon sink assessment 5 5 1 proportion of the co2 released from water to that sequestered by carbonate weathering carbon cycling is one of the most active biogeochemical processes in karst watersheds and aquifers meteoric water seeps through the soil and adsorbs soil co2 producing carbonic acids eqs 1 and 2 after this corrosive water comes into contact with carbonate rocks within the aquifer it dissolves carbonates see eq 3 during these processes considerable soil co2 can be consumed and converted into dic which is then exported by groundwater although the soil co2 is derived from root respiration and the decay of organic matter the sequestration of it by carbonate dissolution decreases the direct release of soil co2 to the atmosphere thus such chemical weathering of carbonate can be regarded as a sink of atmospheric co2 jiang and yuan 1999 liu et al 2010 for the dissolution of carbonate under an open system condition the resulting dic in groundwater mainly consists of i physically dissolved aqueous co2 and ii hco3 produced by carbonate dissolution in which one half comes from calcite and the other half from soil co2 here the calcium concentration was subtracted from the dic concentration calculated by the program phreeqc 3 0 to determine the concentration of the portion of dic in spring water derived from soil co2 dic s the data are given in table 4 it can be found that 57 of dic in the spring water at site c1 is derived from soil co2 while 43 from calcite these values are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions for open system dissolution of limestones the flux of carbonate weathering associated carbon sink f s was estimated using the calculated dic s and discharge rate of the spring q 7 f s dic s q based on these fluxes of carbon sink in the spring water and co2 outgassing both the primary and additional ones along the spring fed stream the proportion of the co2 released back to the atmosphere relative to that of the soil co2 uptake by carbonate weathering was estimated finally we obtain that at changliushui the flux of total co2 release along the stream between c1 and c7 sites accounts for 29 0 47 3 mean 39 0 of that of the soil co2 fixed in the dic of spring water the outgassing of aqueous co2 has caused 20 6 35 2 mean 27 4 of the uptake of co2 to return to the atmosphere while the calcite precipitation induced outgassing has resulted in an additional proportion of 4 3 20 1 mean 11 6 for the co2 return we also estimated the flux of diffusive outgassing of aqueous co2 along the spring fed stream when the stream water has completely equilibrated with the pco2 in the atmosphere 10 3 5 atm and if no any calcite precipitation has occurred the results show that a maximum of 29 2 48 9 of the co2 fixed in the dic of spring water could be released back to the atmosphere however the complete of this diffusive co2 outgassing process may need to take a much long time and at a long distance temporally the release of physically dissolved aqueous co2 displays relatively smaller variation along the reach of c1 c7 as a majority of aqueous co2 can be released at a short distance after the spring and the flux of this primary outgassing is mainly related to the initial pco2 in stream water however the co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation is closely associated with hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology see sect 5 4 2 more specifically higher flow discharge could result in much smaller flux of precipitation associated co2 outgassing and hence less release of soil co2 sequestered by carbonate weathering and vice versa 5 5 2 wider discussion in karst terrain karst springs and underground streams are widespread for example tens of thousands of karst springs and subterranean streams have been found in the region of southwest china karst 5 4 105 km2 which is one of largest world s karst regions guo et al 2013 these karst springs and subterranean streams are often the headwater of many large rivers and contribute a large quantity of dic loads to the river water due to the high pco2 in karst groundwater and usually steep gradient heterogeneous stream landscape for the drainage of surface streams in such a headwater area the co2 fixed in dic of stream water is likely to be re emitted back to the atmosphere through outgassing of both physically dissolved aqueous co2 and that arising from calcite precipitation in stream channel strong outgassing of co2 has been often found at cascades waterfalls dams and along steep rugged slopes this study drysdale et al 2002 hoffer french and herman 1989 zhou et al 2013 assessing the flux of different types of co2 outgassing and dic evolution in these surface streams is critical for a fully understanding of the stability and magnitude of carbonate weathering related carbon sink in this study we show an extreme case of co2 outgassing at changliushui where the high gradient of stream channel has significantly enhanced co2 degassing from the water of stream fed by karst groundwater including the primary outgassing of aqueous co2 and additional co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation along the flow path generally speaking the outgassing of aqueous co2 could not stop until the establishment of equilibrium with the pco2 in the atmosphere thus such portion of dic is much unstable in surface waters although the hco3 in water changes with ph theoretical simulation shows that only a few of it 1 mmol l will be converted to co2 aq 0 5 mmol l and co3 2 0 5 mmol l when the solution is completely chemically equilibrated with the atmospheric pco2 10 3 5 atm and if no calcite precipitation occurs in contrast the precipitation of calcite can remove hco3 to a large degree and cause more co2 outgassing from the water however the co2 outgassing induced by calcite precipitation has just caused an additional 4 3 20 1 of soil co2 release relative to that sequestered by carbonate weathering along a 250 m long steep course of stream at changliushui our unpublished data show that from site c7 to a further downstream site c12 about 320 m far away from c7 streambed gradient 1 2 fig 1a at changliushui the ph pco2 sic and ca2 and dic all exhibit relatively small downstream change when this creek flows to the plain area both ca2 and hco3 show very small changes along an investigated reach that is 2 5 km in length too these observations indicate that much smaller rates of co2 outgassing and calcite precipitation are likely to occur in streams with low gradients furthermore the rates of co2 outgassing can be greatly declined with the increase of flow discharge this study drysdale et al 2002 zhou et al 2013 in many cases the karst springs and underground streams have much high discharge rates often 100 l s and some of them are discharged directly into large rivers reservoirs and lakes pu et al 2017 2020 under these hydrological conditions both the rate and flux of co2 outgassing should be relatively smaller furthermore the water mixing or dilution of tributaries that have different pco2 would occur when the groundwater feeding stream flows into the main course of river or converges with tributaries because the thermodynamic equilibrium of carbonate mineral phases is controlled by a power law while solute concentrations vary linearly as the solutes mix the calcite saturation level of stream water can greatly decrease runnells 1969 therefore we can suspect that the rate of co2 outgassing will get reduced and calcite precipitation associated co2 outgassing would be significantly restricted in low order rivers e g in the guijiang river and xijiang river south china yao et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 2019 the reduced water residence time in headwater streams does not allow significant in stream biological processes to occur however an increasing body of evidence from laboratory experiments and field observations has shown that a proportion of dic both aqueous co2 and hco3 can be consumed by aquatic organisms for metabolism and converted into organic carbon which could then move or settle down through the water column and be buried in sediments leading to a net carbon sink in rivers reservoirs lakes and the ocean so called biological carbon pump fig 7 chen et al 2017 huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 jiao et al 2010 liu et al 2015 2017 pu et al 2017 such biological carbon pump effect on the dic in water could stabilize the atmospheric co2 sink caused by rock weathering although the co2 sequestration by carbonate weathering might be fully balanced by co2 release during calcite bioprecipitation in the ocean during much long time periods 105 yr amiotte suchet et al 2003 berner 1992 martin 2017 over shorter at least decadal to centennial timescales the carbonate co2 h2o aquatic phototroph interaction could be expected to represent a net carbon sink liu and dreybrodt 2015 liu et al 2010 2018 due to its large quantity and the characteristics of sensitive responding to climate change and changes in land use and land cover the carbonate weathering carbon sink needs to be included in the current global carbon budget he et al 2020 liu and dreybrodt 2015 zeng et al 2019 6 conclusions at the changliushui catchment large amounts of dic hco3 and co2 aq included produced by the dissolution of carbonate within the aquifers are transported by groundwater when the groundwater emerges at the earth s surface and flows a high gradient heterogeneous landscape significant co2 outgassing from water takes place along the flow path downstream our investigations into the downstream geochemical evolution have revealed that two distinguishable types of co2 outgassing exist along the karst spring fed creek with a steep gradient including i outgassing of physically dissolved co2 during carbonate dissolution as the primary co2 outgassing and ii outgassing of the co2 arising from the precipitation of calcite as an additional co2 outgassing both types of co2 outgassing have led to a continuum of changes in hydrochemical and isotopic compositions of stream water at a short distance from the spring the physically dissolved aqueous co2 in stream water escapes rapidly and this process causes the ph and sic to rise resulting in subsequent calcite precipitation and more co2 outgassing along the stream this precipitation induced co2 outgassing has also caused great downstream enrichment in 13c for the remaining dic in stream water spatiotemporal variations in the mass transfer of co2 and co2 outgassing flux show that the rates of both the primary and additional outgassing of co2 are affected by hydrodynamic conditions such as flow discharge and streambed morphology in particular lower rates of co2 outgassing are observed at higher flow discharge and vice versa along the studied reach from the spring till site c7 the primary co2 outgassing has caused about 21 35 of the total amount of soil co2 sequestered in dic of the feeding spring water to be released back to the atmosphere in addition more release of soil co2 sequestered in dic accounting for 4 20 of the total uptake of soil co2 has been generated by the precipitation induced co2 outgassing it can also be found that much less return of co2 occurs at higher flow discharge this study has provided an extreme case of co2 outgassing in a creek with steep gradient and relatively low discharge in many cases with higher flow discharge e g 100 l s and low gradient landscape however less co2 outgassing from the water especially that induced by calcite precipitation would occur also the precipitation associated co2 outgassing should be significantly restricted in low order rivers where mixing or dilution of tributaries and increased in stream metabolism occur these findings shed more light on the fate of dic in karst groundwater feeding surface streams and can provide more evidence for the previous conclusion that the h2o carbonate co2 aquatic phototroph interaction represents a net carbon sink at least over short timescales credit

4737,water colloid and suspended particulate matter spm samples were collected during one given year at two sites from the laolongdong lld underground river in southwest china and analyzed for 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc the concentrations of the spm associated colloid associated freely dissolved and dissolved organic matter dom associated pahs varied from 202 to 1731 ng l 142 to 956 ng l 228 to 1280 ng l and 7 3 to 173 ng l respectively the mean percentages of 4 and 5 6 ring pahs showed increasing trends along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase the behavior and fate of pahs influence by doc and poc were examined overall organic carbon was the primary factor controlling the environmental behaviors and fates of the 16 pah species in the lld underground river poc in underground river has more lipophilicity to pahs in this study the correlation analysis suggested that the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had important contribution during the rainy season however pahs mainly transferred through soil seepage water in the form of dissolved pahs during the dry season keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons speciation partitioning migration pathways underground river system 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous in various environmental systems and have been considered a group of persistent organic priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency us epa because of their carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic characters ball and truskewycz 2013 bolden et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the fate and transport of pahs in the environment depends on their physico chemical phase distribution it is well known that pahs are hydrophobic and considerably insoluble these species prefer to associate with colloids dissolved organic matter dom or suspended particulate matter spm in water and they finally deposit in sediments in fact pahs in water exist as dissolved pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs xia et al 2013 and the dissolved pahs in aqueous environments include freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs shi et al 2007 moeckel et al 2014 the speciation and distribution of pahs in aquatic systems is primarily controlled by the physico chemical properties of individual species such as vapor pressure solubility and sorption coefficient as well as the characteristics of each phase shi et al 2007 the sorption of pahs to spm colloids or dom markedly impact the transport fate and ecological effects of pahs many studies have indicated that the bioavailability and toxicity of pahs are related to the speciation of pahs dong et al 2013 xia et al 2013 the spm can remove hydrophobic organic contaminants from solution and decrease the bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms dong et al 2013 due to the high organic carbon content and surface area majumder et al 2014 colloids have played an important role in the distribution fate and behavior of these hydrophobic organic contaminants in aquatic environments yan et al 2015 sun and zhou 2015 because of the high affinity of colloids toward pahs some studies have demonstrated that colloid associated pahs are not bioavailable gustafsson and gschwend 1997 xia et al 2013 dom can interact with pahs through hydrophobic binding and form humic solute complexes in an aqueous environment sabbah et al 2004 thus pahs tightly bound to dom may have reduced bioavailability because their uptake by organisms is prevented cornelissen et al 2009 freely dissolved pah concentrations represent an important aspect of bioavailability and risk assessment for pahs in aquatic environments many studies have demonstrated that the bioavailability and toxicity of pahs are directly proportional to freely dissolved pahs concentrations bao and zeng 2011 xia et al 2013 thus measuring the total concentration of pahs present in natural waters means overestimating the ecological risk as only the bioavailable fractions can cause toxic effects therefore it is necessary to accurately measure the speciation and distribution of pahs in natural waters to quantify contaminant transport and evaluate their chemical behavior in aquatic systems middelboe and sondergaard 1995 suggested that organic matter in water could be classified as dom 0 22 μm colloidal organic matter 0 7 μm and 0 22 μm and particulate organic matter pom 0 7 μm therefore according to the study of middelboe and sondergaard 1995 pahs in water in this study can be classified as dissolved pahs 0 22 μm colloid associated pahs 0 7 μm and 0 22 μm and spm associated pahs 0 7 μm karst terrains cover over 30 of chinese land mass yuan et al 1994 these terrains are known for the thin soil cover that overlies soluble carbonate possessing enormous interconnected fissures which means poor pre purification poor filtration and rapid infiltration yuan 2000 thus contaminants can directly infiltrate underground water through sinkholes fissures or other karst features schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 hence groundwater in karst terrains is particularly vulnerable to contamination schwarz et al 2011 suggested that pahs were effectively retained in soils even in highly vulnerable karst terrains nevertheless during early spring e g snowmelt particle facilitated transport leads to elevated pah concentration in groundwater that is above the safe drinking water limits therefore spm associated pahs can be mobilized from the surface water and soil to karst underground river through sinkholes lan et al 2018 groundwater in karst terrains is an important resource and approximately 25 of the world s population use it for a domestic water supply ford and williams 2007 there are approximately 2836 underground streams and rivers in the karst terrains in southern china and the total length is approximately 13919 km the multiannual mean discharge of these underground rivers is approximately 1482 m3 s and they provide approximately 1808 108 m3 a of water yang 1985 the contamination of pahs in groundwater has drawn much attention around the world schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 however a clearer understanding of the current trajectories and future threats of pahs to groundwater quality can only be achievable through the introduction of the low scale monitoring of representative karst underground river systems therefore this study chooses the laolongdong lld karst underground river in chongqing southwest china as our study area the lld karst underground river catchment is typical of many karst terrains moreover the lld underground river is an origin point for water sources used for agriculture drinking water and recreational activities our previous studies quantitatively provided the sources levels and transport of pahs during rainfall in the lld underground river system lan et al 2016 2018 in karst underground rivers suspended organic and inorganic particles are ubiquitous and are important vectors for the transport and distribution of contaminants schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 the speciation and distribution of pahs in groundwater is of great importance for risk assessment and contaminant remediation but to date little is known about the speciation and distribution of pahs and the transport of different pahs fractions in underground river therefore it is essential to quantify the concentrations of different pahs fractions determine their distribution among water components freely dissolved dom associated colloid associated and spm associated and to understand their behavior of pahs in underground river systems the objectives of the present study were as follows 1 variation and composition of different pahs fractions freely dissolved pahs dom associated pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs in the lld underground river 2 partitioning of the pahs between spm and water 3 transfer of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river system 4 establish a conceptual model for the transport of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample sites and collection the outlet of the lld underground river is a tourist location including a cave that occurs at an elevation of 379 m and is about 1700 m in length water samples were collected from sidengzi sdz and dixiahe dxh fig 1 dhx is located at the entrance of the cave and sdz is located at the cave end individuals can row from dxh to sdz through the underground river the study area was reported in detail in our previous paper lan et al 2018 samples were collected monthly from may 2015 to april 2016 all wetted surfaces were of glass or stainless steel to avoid contamination spm samples were isolated by filtration through pre combusted glass fiber filters gf f whatman 0 7 μm colloid samples were collected from fine grained particles 0 22 μm and 0 7 μm with a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter membrane each filter was wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at approximately 26 c until further analysis in the laboratory the dissolved phase operationally defined as the fraction that passes through the filters 0 22 μm was stored in pre cleaned 1 25 l brown glass containers with airtight caps the samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within three days 2 2 sample preparation and pah analysis sample extraction and instrument analysis were reported in detail in our previous paper sun et al 2019 and will be briefly described here after freeze drying the spm and colloid samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction ase350 thermo scientific cleaned via aluminum oxides and silica gel column chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gc 5975c msd in selected ion monitoring sim modes with internal pah standards filtered water samples were extracted by an automatic solid phase extraction system spe dex 4790 horizon technology and then analyzed by gc ms in sim modes with internal standards the 16 priority pahs that were monitored in this study were naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr chrysene chry benzo a anthracene baa benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo a pyrene bap dibenzo a h anthracene daa and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene inp the 16 pah mixed stock standard was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh inc germany the surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 perylene d12 and internal standard hexamehylbenzene were purchased from the supelco usa 2 3 quality control and quality assurance method blanks solvent and spiked blanks standards spiked into the solvent were analyzed and no interference was observed in these blanks the instrument was calibrated every day with calibration standards and the relative percent differences between the six point calibration and the daily calibrations were less than 20 for all target analytes the limit of detection of 16 individual pahs and the mean recoveries of surrogate standards were showed in tables s1 and s2 respectively all results were recovery corrected 2 4 doc and poc analysis doc and poc in the lld underground river were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer jena 3100 toc meter the doc and poc were determined in triplicate with a relative standard deviation less than 1 2 5 estimation of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pah content due to the high affinity of the pahs to dom the freely dissolved pah concentrations depend not only on the water flux but also on the partitioning between the dom and aqueous phase xia et al 2013 moeckel et al 2014 therefore it is difficult to measure the freely dissolved pah concentration with traditional methods that require complicated phase separations some new techniques e g fluorescence quenching purging or sparging techniques solid phase microextraction spme equilibrium dialysis solubility enhancement ultrafiltration reverse phase hplc separation size exclusion chromatography and liquid liquid extraction have been used to determine the freely dissolved concentrations of chemicals in solutions containing doc gustafson and dickhut 1997 cornelissen et al 2009 bao et al 2012 xia et al 2013 however all of these methods for measuring freely dissolved pahs in water have some type of limitation bao et al 2012 xia et al 2013 according to the studies of shi et al 2007 and moeckel et al 2014 the freely dissolved pah concentrations can be estimated if there is the proper knowledge of the kdoc partition coefficients in this study only the total dissolved pah concentrations and doc concentrations were measured and the freely dissolved pah concentrations can be calculated based on the measured doc concentrations and the partition coefficient kdoc which was calculated as follows k doc 10 6 c total c free c doc c free where ctotal is the concentration of total dissolved pahs ng l cfree is the concentration of freely dissolved pahs ng l and cdoc is the doc concentration mg l kdoc values were taken from the literature li and lee 2000 burkhard 2000 and could be affected by various factors such as sorbent characteristics or ionic strength shi et al 2007 thus the calculated freely dissolved pah content was only a rough approximation the concentrations of dom associated pahs were equal to the total dissolved pah concentrations minus the free dissolved pah concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river all pahs were detected except ant and daa in the particulate phase at sdz and dxh all pahs were detected except ant baa inp and daa in the colloidal phase at dxh and sdz in contrast ant baa chry bap daa and bgp were not detected in the total dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh table s3 the dominant compounds in the total dissolved and colloid associated pah profiles at sdz and dxh were phe followed by nap and flu phe flu and nap contributed to 34 5 100 of the total dissolved pahs 50 4 90 8 of the colloidal pahs at dxh and contributed to 13 8 61 2 of the total dissolved pahs 38 6 81 4 of the colloidal pahs at sdz however in the particulate phase the dominant compounds at sdz and dxh were phe followed by nap bbf flu and fla phe nap bbf flu and fla contributed 35 3 93 8 in particulate pahs at dxh and 26 93 3 at sdz table s3 the pah distributions in particulate dissolved and colloidal phases in the lld underground river are shown in fig 2 a fairly high variation in values ranging between 211 and 1730 ng l was observed for spm associated pahs at dxh and the mean value was 538 ng l the highest concentration was observed in february 2016 colloid associated pahs at dxh varied from 157 to 956 ng l with a mean value of 332 ng l the highest concentration was observed in may 2015 the total dissolved pahs at dxh spanned a range from 234 to 1397 ng l with a mean value of 513 ng l the highest concentration was observed in april 2016 spm associated pahs at sdz varied from 202 to 827 ng l with a mean value of 489 ng l colloidal pahs at sdz varied from 142 to 930 ng l with a mean value of 255 ng l the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs at sdz varied from 292 to 1269 ng l with a mean value of 526 ng l fig 2 and table s3 the highest concentrations of spm associated colloid associated and total dissolved pahs at sdz were all observed in february 2016 the most pronounced events were connected to snowmelts in february 2016 the concentration of the spm associated pahs at dxh was higher than that at sdz at sdz the mean concentration of the total dissolved pahs was the highest followed by spm associated and colloid associated pahs while at dxh the mean concentration of spm associated pahs was the highest followed by total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs the concentrations of different pahs fractions at sdz and dxh exhibited different seasonal variations fig 2 at sdz the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs fluctuated greatly during the dry season from november 2015 to april 2016 and were relatively stable during the rainy season from may 2015 to october 2015 at sdz the mean concentration of the spm associated pahs was the highest followed by the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the rainy season however the mean concentration of the total dissolved pahs was the highest followed by the spm associated pahs and colloid associated pahs except february 2016 during the dry season the above results indicated that pahs in water at sdz were dominated by the spm associated pahs during the rainy season and dominated by the total dissolved pahs during the dry season at dxh the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs were relatively stable during the rainy season but fluctuated greatly during the dry season similar to that at sdz the concentrations of the spm associated pahs fluctuated greatly during a given year from may 2015 to april 2016 the concentrations of the colloid associated pahs remained relatively stable during a given year at sdz the mean concentrations of the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the dry season 610 and 309 ng l respectively were higher than those during the rainy season 442 and 201 ng l respectively however the mean concentration of the spm associated pahs during the dry season 417 ng l was lower than the rainy season 562 ng l at dxh the mean concentrations of the total dissolved pahs and the spm associated pahs during the dry season 648 and 595 ng l respectively were higher than those during the rainy season 378 and 482 ng l respectively however the mean concentration of the colloid associated pahs during the dry season 281 ng l was lower than the rainy season 384 ng l the distribution of the freely dissolved dom associated and total dissolved pahs in the lld underground river is shown in fig 2 because the concentrations of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs were calculated according to the total dissolved pahs the detection frequency of the freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs was the same as the total dissolved pahs at sdz the concentrations of the freely dissolved pahs ranged from 244 to 1104 ng l with a mean value of 450 ng l the dom associated pahs concentrations ranged from 7 34 to 165 ng l with a mean value 76 5 ng l at dxh the freely dissolved pahs concentrations ranged from 228 to 1280 ng l with a mean value of 449 ng l dom associated pahs concentrations ranged from 5 91 to 173 ng l with a mean value of 63 8 ng l fig 2 and table s4 the concentrations of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs at sdz were close to those at dxh phe was the most dominant component in the freely dissolved phase at sdz and dxh accounting for approximately 30 3 and 32 5 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively and nap ace and flu were the next dominant pahs in the freely dissolved pahs at sdz accounting for about 20 14 3 13 1 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively nap flu fla were the next dominant pahs in the freely dissolved pahs at dxh accounting for about 29 14 1 7 3 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively however bbf bkf and inp dominated the dom associated pahs at sdz and dxh accounting for about 56 1 and 56 3 of the dom associated pah concentration on average respectively as shown in fig 2 the concentrations of the dom associated pahs at sdz and dxh remained relatively stable during the given year from may 2015 to april 2016 at sdz and dxh the variation of freely dissolved pah concentrations was similar to that of the total dissolved pah concentrations freely dissolved pah concentrations also remained relatively stable during the rainy season and fluctuated greatly during the dry season at sdz the concentrations of the total dissolved pah were markedly higher than those of the freely dissolved pahs during the rainy season however the freely dissolved pah concentrations were close to the total dissolved pah concentrations during the dry season at dxh the concentrations of the freely dissolved pahs were close to those of the total dissolved pahs during the given year the concentrations of pahs at sdz and dxh exhibited an increasing tendency from january in agreement with the heaviest snowfall events reaching the highest values in february the snowfall in january 15 2016 was the strongest over the past several decades in chongqing which could scavenge abundant pahs from the atmosphere zhang et al 2015 therefore snowmelt could mobilize pahs to a maximum extent in february 2016 fig 2 3 2 composition of the different pahs fractions in the lld underground river the composition of dissolved colloid associated and spm associated pahs by ring number in the outlet of the lld underground river are shown in fig 3 the distribution pattern in the spm associated colloid associated and total dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh was kept with time through the observed periods with a predominance of 3 ring pahs followed by 2 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring pahs the contribution to pahs fractions of 3 ring pahs ranged from 38 3 to 53 4 with a mean value of 45 3 at sdz and ranged from 44 3 to 50 7 with a mean value of 47 4 at dxh the contribution of 3 ring pahs in the total dissolved phase 53 4 and 50 7 at sdz and dxh respectively was the highest followed by the colloidal phase 44 2 and 47 2 at sdz and dxh respectively and the particulate phase 38 2 and 44 3 at sdz and dxh respectively overall the more water soluble 2 and 3 ring pahs dominate over the virtually water insoluble and strongly hydrophobic 4 and 5 6 rings in the dissolved colloidal and particulate phases however the mean percentages of 4 and 5 6 rings pahs showed an increasing trend along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase at sdz 25 2 30 4 and 40 2 respectively and dxh 20 9 25 5 and 35 8 respectively while 2 3 ring pahs showed an opposite trend fig 3 these observations indicated that 2 3 ring pahs were transported chiefly via the dissolved phase followed by the colloidal phase and particulate phase however 4 and 5 6 rings pahs were transported mainly through particulate phase followed by the colloidal phase and dissolved phase the results indicate that highly hydrophobic substances strongly bind to the aquatic particulate phase and these substances are likely to have leached from the soil into the groundwater in the first place the composition of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs are shown in fig s1 the distribution pattern of the freely dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh was kept with time through the observed periods with a predominance of the 3 ring pahs followed by the 2 ring pahs 4 ring pahs and 5 ring pahs the distribution pattern in the dom associated pahs at dxh was also kept with a predominance of 3 ring pahs but followed by the 5 ring 4 ring and 2 ring pahs however the distribution pattern in the dom associated pahs at sdz was kept with a predominance of the 5 ring pahs followed by the 3 ring 4 ring and 2 ring pahs the contribution of the 2 and 3 ring pahs to the freely dissolved pahs ranged from 65 4 to 100 with a mean value of 82 6 at sdz and from 66 9 to 100 with a mean value of 86 1 at dxh however the contribution of the 4 and 5 ring pahs to the dom associated pahs ranged from 0 to 91 1 with a mean value of 62 1 at sdz and from 0 to 94 8 with a mean value of 54 2 at dxh based on the above results the dom associated phase contained relatively more abundant 4 and 5 ring pahs than the freely dissolved phase these results showed that the 4 and 5 ring pahs seemed to have higher affinity to dom than the 2 and 3 ring pahs and prefer to bind to the dom owing to their lower aqueous solubility and hydrophobic nature however the 2 and 3 ring pahs were more likely to dissolve in water due to their higher water solubility kang et al 2016 3 3 contribution of the different pahs fractions to pahs in water the contribution of the different pahs fractions to the total pahs in water at sdz was relatively constant during the given year fig 4 the freely dissolved dom associated colloid associated and spm associated pahs exhibited similar seasonal trends at sdz however there was a large variation in the contribution of the different pahs fractions to the total pahs in water at dxh during the given year the pahs in water were dominated by the spm associated pahs during the given year accounting for 39 9 6 and 37 16 2 at sdz and dxh respectively followed by freely dissolved pahs accounting for 35 9 8 3 and 33 2 12 7 colloid associated pahs accounting for 19 6 6 5 and 24 8 10 9 and dom associated pahs accounting for 5 5 3 1 and 5 4 8 respectively although the contribution of the dom associated pahs was the lowest it is clear from fig s1 that pahs with five or more rings are relatively more abundant in the dom associated fraction which imply a significant role of dom in their transport overall the freely dissolved pahs had a higher contribution 42 6 3 5 and 38 7 7 8 at sdz and dxh respectively than the spm associated pahs during the dry season 31 3 5 4 and 35 4 16 4 at sdz and dxh respectively while the spm associated pahs had a higher contribution during the rainy season 46 7 5 6 and 38 5 17 4 at sdz and dxh respectively this is because the surface runoff during the rainy season is higher than that during the dry season which can carry a considerable amount of soil particles into underground rivers through sinkholes and resuspension is strengthened owing to the high velocity and discharge in the underground rivers during the rainy season these observations indicated that pahs in the lld underground river were transported mostly via the freely dissolved pahs during the dry season and mainly in the spm associated pahs during the rainy season 3 4 factors affecting the content of different pahs fractions pahs are hydrophobic and prefer to associate with dom colloids or spm therefore doc and poc are important factors affecting the behavior fate and toxicity of dissolved phase pahs in underground water levy et al 2017 lan et al 2018 in aquatic environments the interactions between dom or spm and water are important mechanisms controlling the distribution and movement of pahs zhou et al 1999 the relationships between different pahs fractions and doc or poc are discussed according to pearson s coefficient rank correlation in this study a markedly positive correlation was observed between the total dissolved pahs and doc at sdz fig 5 the 2 and 3 ring pahs accounted for 53 100 of the total dissolved pahs so a markedly positive correlation was found between the 2 and 3 ring dissolved phase pahs and doc at sdz fig s2 due to the higher contribution of freely dissolved pahs to total dissolved pahs 75 a positive correlation can be inferred between the freely dissolved pahs and doc because the contribution of 2 and 3 ring pahs to freely dissolved pahs was 65 a markedly positive correlation was also observed between 2 3 ring freely dissolved pahs and doc fig s2 the above results indicate that the input of 2 and 3 ring pahs in the underground water seems to be linked to the input of dom however at dxh the total dissolved pahs and freely dissolved pahs had no marked correlation with doc concentration the results indicate that the relationship between the dissolved pah concentrations and doc content is complex and there might be other factors such as the poc content hydrodynamic conditions and human activities e g the disturbance of rowing affecting the concentration of the dissolved phase pahs at dxh shi et al 2007 a markedly positive correlation was observed between the dom associated pahs and doc at sdz fig s2 these results were similar to that of shi et al 2007 in tianjin rivers china although the contribution of 5 and 6 ring pahs to the total dissolved pahs average 25 1 was lower positive correlation was also observed between 5 and 6 ring pahs in dissolved phase and doc the contribution of 5 to 6 ring pahs to the dom associated pahs was more than 60 at sdz and 79 at dxh fig s2 thus it was not surprising that the statistical examination showed a positive correlation between 5 and 6 ring dom associated pahs and doc content moeckel et al 2014 reported that the concentration of individual pahs with greater than or equal to five rings was observed to be strongly correlated to the doc content this result was consistent with the results of this study at sdz and dxh the above results indicate that dom was not only an important pool for dissolved high molecular weight hmw pahs 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring but also a facilitator for the accumulation of freely dissolved low molecular weight lmw pahs 2 ring and 3 ring at sdz in the lld underground river although approximately 37 8 on average of lmw pahs were directly associated with dom the markedly positive correlation between dissolved pahs and doc at sdz indicates the input of dissolved pahs can be linked to dom inputs and it would seem intuitive that they are released simultaneously from the soil into the underground river the significantly positive correlation between the pahs associated with spm and poc at sdz and dxh indicated that the concentrations of pahs in the particulate phase were primarily controlled by poc fig 5 however the correlation coefficient at dxh is higher than that at sdz which indicates a better linear relationship formed under completely mixed steady conditions at dxh with increasing spm concentration the probability of particle collisions and particle dom interactions would increase leading to the reduction in sorption sites which would allow the competitive sorption effect to become more significant zhou et al 1999 shi et al 2007 owing to the low vapor pressure and water solubility hmw pahs tended to be preferentially adsorbed by spm the statistical examination showed a significantly positive correlation between hmw pahs in particulate phase and poc at sdz and dxh fig s2 in contrast to the freely dissolved pahs lmw pahs in the particle phase were not markedly correlated with poc at sdz however a positive correlation was found between lmw pahs in the particle phase and poc at dxh therefore the relationship between these lmw pahs and poc is complicated based on the above analysis it was clear that doc and poc were the major factors controlling the behavior and fate of dissolved pahs and particulate pahs at sdz poc was the only major factor controlling the behavior and fate of particulate pahs at dhx due to the much easier measurement of doc and poc the levels of contamination by pahs can be approximately estimated for further measurement and assessment furthermore dom or pom would markedly influence the bioavailability aqueous solubility environmental behavior and remediation of pahs 3 5 partitioning of pahs between spm and water based on the above analysis the interaction between spm and water was one of the dominant processes controlling the speciation distribution and behavior of pahs in the lld underground river pahs indicated an increasing trend in the spm water phase partitioning from 2 ring up to 6 ring compounds in lld underground river fig s3 nap acy ace flu phe fla and pyr dominated the dissolved pah assemblages on average 71 and 58 of nap acy ace flu phe fla and pyr were dissolved in the aqueous phase at sdz and dxh respectively these seven pahs were much more enriched in the particulate phase at dxh than at sdz however 5 ring and 6 ring pah showed the strongest enrichment in the particulate phase mean values up to 82 and 89 at sdz and dxh respectively similar results were reported by shi et al 2007 for pahs in tianjin s rivers where spm associated hmw pahs reached up to 99 the values of the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient koc can always be used to describe the relative affinity or attraction of pahs to spm and predict the degree of spm water partitioning fernandes et al 1997 shi et al 2007 therefore koc could help quantitatively understand the processes that control the behavior and fate of pahs in lld underground rivers the calculation details of koc are described in the literature fernandes et al 1997 shi et al 2007 in this study the increase in logkoc values of pahs corresponded to the increase in the hydrophobicity and were all close to or greater than the upper limit seth et al 1999 however the logkoc of nap was much higher than the upper limit because nap has a higher volatility than the other pahs and its concentration in water is lower which resulting in the high logkoc value this result suggests that pahs were strongly adsorbed by spm in the lld underground river linear free energy relationships were calculated to compare the partitioning of pahs in the lld underground river to the reference octanol water system significant correlations were obtained between the logarithms of our koc and kow found in the literature kang et al 2016 fig 6 the slope of this regression equation gives a measure of the lipophilicity of sorbents relative to the reference octanol water system fernandes et al 1997 the slope at sdz was close to 1 which indicated that the lipophilicity of spm at sdz was similar to octanol however the slope at dxh was higher than 1 which indicated spm at dxh was more lipophilic than octanol the slope was higher than that reported by fernandes et al 1997 for the seine river suspensions luo et al 2008 for the pearl river estuary and ou et al 2009 for the yangtze estuary these results suggest that poc in the lld underground river has more lipophilicity to pahs 3 6 migration pathways of pahs in the underground river system in karst terrains pahs are mainly transported by two migration pathways in the underground river system one pathway involves slow flowing soil seepage water in the karst fissures infiltrating into the underground river and the other involves conduit flows into the underground river schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 considering that particles can act as carriers for organic pollutants the mobilization of pahs is likely to result from the movement of particles that are flushed through the system during a strong rainfall event in particular hmw pahs present higher particle affinities and lower solubilities and they will mainly be transported by particulate phase dissolved pahs can enter the underground river with the soil percolated water outflow sun et al 2019 in order to unveil the migration pathways of different pahs fractions the relationships between pahs in the surface soil or soil seepage water and pahs in the underground river were analyzed by pearson s coefficient rank correlation a significantly positive correlation existed between the total dissolved pahs at sdz and the soil seepage water pahs at w1 in upper reaches of the lld underground river w2 in the middle reaches and w3 in the lower reaches during the observation fig s4 the above results indicated that a significant contribution of pahs in soil seepage water to the total dissolved pahs in underground river during the observation as shown in fig s4 a strongly positive correlation exists between the spm associated pahs at sdz and surface soil pahs but a weakly positive correlation was observed between the spm associated pahs at dxh and surface soil pahs in addition a positive correlation was also observed between the colloid associated pahs at sdz and dxh and pahs in surface soil the above results indicate that the pahs associated with spm and colloids at sdz mainly come from surface soil furthermore during the transport process from sdz to dxh some processes such as adsorption desorption volatilization and biodegradation will influence the spm associated pah concentration and composition at dxh especially human activities e g rowing the above analysis suggests that the transport of pahs in the lld underground river system follows the conceptual model first particulate pahs can be mobilized from the surface soil to the subsurface through the sinkholes especially during strong precipitation events that can form surface runoff shevenell and mccarthy 2002 suggested that the mobilization of colloids depends on hydrological processes such as heavy rain events therefore colloid associated pahs can be formed and transported to the underground river during the rainy season in addition atteia et al 1998 showed that the particles can be retarded by adhering to the conduit walls therefore particles that adhered to the conduit walls during the dry season will be mobilized instantaneously leading to a peak of the spm associated pah concentrations that were measured at sdz in the lld underground river during the snowmelt in february 2016 in summary particle and colloid facilitated transport is one of the dominant mechanisms of pah mobilization in this karst system however according to the above results the contribution of the colloid was minor when compared with the contribution of particle transport furthermore pahs can be mobilized in the form of dissolved pahs freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs dissolved pahs can not only be mobilized from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes but also mobilized through soil seepage water infiltrating into the underground river during the rainy season the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had an important contribution fig 7 during the dry season however dissolved pahs are mainly mobilized through soil seepage water fig 7 4 conclusions this study has provided important data on the variation in 16 priority pahs in the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particle phase of a typical karst underground river in southwest china during a given year without the disturbance of human activity in the underground river pahs in water were dominated by the total dissolved pahs followed by the spm associated pahs and colloid associated pahs during the dry season and dominated by the spm associated pahs followed by the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the rainy season the more water soluble lmw pahs dominate over the virtually water insoluble and strongly hydrophobic hmw pahs in the dissolved colloidal and particulate phases however the contribution of hmw pahs showed an increasing trend along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase the environmental behavior and fate of pahs were markedly influenced by organic content in each phase and poc has more lipophilicity to pahs in the lld underground river the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had important contribution during the rainy season dissolved pahs are mainly mobilized through soil seepage water during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement yuchuan sun

4737,water colloid and suspended particulate matter spm samples were collected during one given year at two sites from the laolongdong lld underground river in southwest china and analyzed for 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon poc the concentrations of the spm associated colloid associated freely dissolved and dissolved organic matter dom associated pahs varied from 202 to 1731 ng l 142 to 956 ng l 228 to 1280 ng l and 7 3 to 173 ng l respectively the mean percentages of 4 and 5 6 ring pahs showed increasing trends along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase the behavior and fate of pahs influence by doc and poc were examined overall organic carbon was the primary factor controlling the environmental behaviors and fates of the 16 pah species in the lld underground river poc in underground river has more lipophilicity to pahs in this study the correlation analysis suggested that the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had important contribution during the rainy season however pahs mainly transferred through soil seepage water in the form of dissolved pahs during the dry season keywords polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons speciation partitioning migration pathways underground river system 1 introduction polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are ubiquitous in various environmental systems and have been considered a group of persistent organic priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency us epa because of their carcinogenic mutagenic and toxic characters ball and truskewycz 2013 bolden et al 2017 gao et al 2018 the fate and transport of pahs in the environment depends on their physico chemical phase distribution it is well known that pahs are hydrophobic and considerably insoluble these species prefer to associate with colloids dissolved organic matter dom or suspended particulate matter spm in water and they finally deposit in sediments in fact pahs in water exist as dissolved pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs xia et al 2013 and the dissolved pahs in aqueous environments include freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs shi et al 2007 moeckel et al 2014 the speciation and distribution of pahs in aquatic systems is primarily controlled by the physico chemical properties of individual species such as vapor pressure solubility and sorption coefficient as well as the characteristics of each phase shi et al 2007 the sorption of pahs to spm colloids or dom markedly impact the transport fate and ecological effects of pahs many studies have indicated that the bioavailability and toxicity of pahs are related to the speciation of pahs dong et al 2013 xia et al 2013 the spm can remove hydrophobic organic contaminants from solution and decrease the bioavailability and toxicity to aquatic organisms dong et al 2013 due to the high organic carbon content and surface area majumder et al 2014 colloids have played an important role in the distribution fate and behavior of these hydrophobic organic contaminants in aquatic environments yan et al 2015 sun and zhou 2015 because of the high affinity of colloids toward pahs some studies have demonstrated that colloid associated pahs are not bioavailable gustafsson and gschwend 1997 xia et al 2013 dom can interact with pahs through hydrophobic binding and form humic solute complexes in an aqueous environment sabbah et al 2004 thus pahs tightly bound to dom may have reduced bioavailability because their uptake by organisms is prevented cornelissen et al 2009 freely dissolved pah concentrations represent an important aspect of bioavailability and risk assessment for pahs in aquatic environments many studies have demonstrated that the bioavailability and toxicity of pahs are directly proportional to freely dissolved pahs concentrations bao and zeng 2011 xia et al 2013 thus measuring the total concentration of pahs present in natural waters means overestimating the ecological risk as only the bioavailable fractions can cause toxic effects therefore it is necessary to accurately measure the speciation and distribution of pahs in natural waters to quantify contaminant transport and evaluate their chemical behavior in aquatic systems middelboe and sondergaard 1995 suggested that organic matter in water could be classified as dom 0 22 μm colloidal organic matter 0 7 μm and 0 22 μm and particulate organic matter pom 0 7 μm therefore according to the study of middelboe and sondergaard 1995 pahs in water in this study can be classified as dissolved pahs 0 22 μm colloid associated pahs 0 7 μm and 0 22 μm and spm associated pahs 0 7 μm karst terrains cover over 30 of chinese land mass yuan et al 1994 these terrains are known for the thin soil cover that overlies soluble carbonate possessing enormous interconnected fissures which means poor pre purification poor filtration and rapid infiltration yuan 2000 thus contaminants can directly infiltrate underground water through sinkholes fissures or other karst features schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 hence groundwater in karst terrains is particularly vulnerable to contamination schwarz et al 2011 suggested that pahs were effectively retained in soils even in highly vulnerable karst terrains nevertheless during early spring e g snowmelt particle facilitated transport leads to elevated pah concentration in groundwater that is above the safe drinking water limits therefore spm associated pahs can be mobilized from the surface water and soil to karst underground river through sinkholes lan et al 2018 groundwater in karst terrains is an important resource and approximately 25 of the world s population use it for a domestic water supply ford and williams 2007 there are approximately 2836 underground streams and rivers in the karst terrains in southern china and the total length is approximately 13919 km the multiannual mean discharge of these underground rivers is approximately 1482 m3 s and they provide approximately 1808 108 m3 a of water yang 1985 the contamination of pahs in groundwater has drawn much attention around the world schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 sun et al 2019 however a clearer understanding of the current trajectories and future threats of pahs to groundwater quality can only be achievable through the introduction of the low scale monitoring of representative karst underground river systems therefore this study chooses the laolongdong lld karst underground river in chongqing southwest china as our study area the lld karst underground river catchment is typical of many karst terrains moreover the lld underground river is an origin point for water sources used for agriculture drinking water and recreational activities our previous studies quantitatively provided the sources levels and transport of pahs during rainfall in the lld underground river system lan et al 2016 2018 in karst underground rivers suspended organic and inorganic particles are ubiquitous and are important vectors for the transport and distribution of contaminants schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 the speciation and distribution of pahs in groundwater is of great importance for risk assessment and contaminant remediation but to date little is known about the speciation and distribution of pahs and the transport of different pahs fractions in underground river therefore it is essential to quantify the concentrations of different pahs fractions determine their distribution among water components freely dissolved dom associated colloid associated and spm associated and to understand their behavior of pahs in underground river systems the objectives of the present study were as follows 1 variation and composition of different pahs fractions freely dissolved pahs dom associated pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs in the lld underground river 2 partitioning of the pahs between spm and water 3 transfer of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river system 4 establish a conceptual model for the transport of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river system 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample sites and collection the outlet of the lld underground river is a tourist location including a cave that occurs at an elevation of 379 m and is about 1700 m in length water samples were collected from sidengzi sdz and dixiahe dxh fig 1 dhx is located at the entrance of the cave and sdz is located at the cave end individuals can row from dxh to sdz through the underground river the study area was reported in detail in our previous paper lan et al 2018 samples were collected monthly from may 2015 to april 2016 all wetted surfaces were of glass or stainless steel to avoid contamination spm samples were isolated by filtration through pre combusted glass fiber filters gf f whatman 0 7 μm colloid samples were collected from fine grained particles 0 22 μm and 0 7 μm with a polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter membrane each filter was wrapped in aluminum foil and stored at approximately 26 c until further analysis in the laboratory the dissolved phase operationally defined as the fraction that passes through the filters 0 22 μm was stored in pre cleaned 1 25 l brown glass containers with airtight caps the samples were stored at 4 c and analyzed within three days 2 2 sample preparation and pah analysis sample extraction and instrument analysis were reported in detail in our previous paper sun et al 2019 and will be briefly described here after freeze drying the spm and colloid samples were extracted by accelerated solvent extraction ase350 thermo scientific cleaned via aluminum oxides and silica gel column chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms agilent 7890a gc 5975c msd in selected ion monitoring sim modes with internal pah standards filtered water samples were extracted by an automatic solid phase extraction system spe dex 4790 horizon technology and then analyzed by gc ms in sim modes with internal standards the 16 priority pahs that were monitored in this study were naphthalene nap acenaphthylene acy acenaphthene ace fluorene flu phenanthrene phe anthracene ant fluoranthene fla pyrene pyr chrysene chry benzo a anthracene baa benzo k fluoranthene bkf benzo b fluoranthene bbf benzo a pyrene bap dibenzo a h anthracene daa and indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene inp the 16 pah mixed stock standard was purchased from dr ehrenstorfer gmbh inc germany the surrogate standards naphthalene d8 acenaphthene d10 phenanthrene d10 chrysene d12 perylene d12 and internal standard hexamehylbenzene were purchased from the supelco usa 2 3 quality control and quality assurance method blanks solvent and spiked blanks standards spiked into the solvent were analyzed and no interference was observed in these blanks the instrument was calibrated every day with calibration standards and the relative percent differences between the six point calibration and the daily calibrations were less than 20 for all target analytes the limit of detection of 16 individual pahs and the mean recoveries of surrogate standards were showed in tables s1 and s2 respectively all results were recovery corrected 2 4 doc and poc analysis doc and poc in the lld underground river were measured by a total organic carbon toc analyzer jena 3100 toc meter the doc and poc were determined in triplicate with a relative standard deviation less than 1 2 5 estimation of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pah content due to the high affinity of the pahs to dom the freely dissolved pah concentrations depend not only on the water flux but also on the partitioning between the dom and aqueous phase xia et al 2013 moeckel et al 2014 therefore it is difficult to measure the freely dissolved pah concentration with traditional methods that require complicated phase separations some new techniques e g fluorescence quenching purging or sparging techniques solid phase microextraction spme equilibrium dialysis solubility enhancement ultrafiltration reverse phase hplc separation size exclusion chromatography and liquid liquid extraction have been used to determine the freely dissolved concentrations of chemicals in solutions containing doc gustafson and dickhut 1997 cornelissen et al 2009 bao et al 2012 xia et al 2013 however all of these methods for measuring freely dissolved pahs in water have some type of limitation bao et al 2012 xia et al 2013 according to the studies of shi et al 2007 and moeckel et al 2014 the freely dissolved pah concentrations can be estimated if there is the proper knowledge of the kdoc partition coefficients in this study only the total dissolved pah concentrations and doc concentrations were measured and the freely dissolved pah concentrations can be calculated based on the measured doc concentrations and the partition coefficient kdoc which was calculated as follows k doc 10 6 c total c free c doc c free where ctotal is the concentration of total dissolved pahs ng l cfree is the concentration of freely dissolved pahs ng l and cdoc is the doc concentration mg l kdoc values were taken from the literature li and lee 2000 burkhard 2000 and could be affected by various factors such as sorbent characteristics or ionic strength shi et al 2007 thus the calculated freely dissolved pah content was only a rough approximation the concentrations of dom associated pahs were equal to the total dissolved pah concentrations minus the free dissolved pah concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of different pahs fractions in the lld underground river all pahs were detected except ant and daa in the particulate phase at sdz and dxh all pahs were detected except ant baa inp and daa in the colloidal phase at dxh and sdz in contrast ant baa chry bap daa and bgp were not detected in the total dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh table s3 the dominant compounds in the total dissolved and colloid associated pah profiles at sdz and dxh were phe followed by nap and flu phe flu and nap contributed to 34 5 100 of the total dissolved pahs 50 4 90 8 of the colloidal pahs at dxh and contributed to 13 8 61 2 of the total dissolved pahs 38 6 81 4 of the colloidal pahs at sdz however in the particulate phase the dominant compounds at sdz and dxh were phe followed by nap bbf flu and fla phe nap bbf flu and fla contributed 35 3 93 8 in particulate pahs at dxh and 26 93 3 at sdz table s3 the pah distributions in particulate dissolved and colloidal phases in the lld underground river are shown in fig 2 a fairly high variation in values ranging between 211 and 1730 ng l was observed for spm associated pahs at dxh and the mean value was 538 ng l the highest concentration was observed in february 2016 colloid associated pahs at dxh varied from 157 to 956 ng l with a mean value of 332 ng l the highest concentration was observed in may 2015 the total dissolved pahs at dxh spanned a range from 234 to 1397 ng l with a mean value of 513 ng l the highest concentration was observed in april 2016 spm associated pahs at sdz varied from 202 to 827 ng l with a mean value of 489 ng l colloidal pahs at sdz varied from 142 to 930 ng l with a mean value of 255 ng l the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs at sdz varied from 292 to 1269 ng l with a mean value of 526 ng l fig 2 and table s3 the highest concentrations of spm associated colloid associated and total dissolved pahs at sdz were all observed in february 2016 the most pronounced events were connected to snowmelts in february 2016 the concentration of the spm associated pahs at dxh was higher than that at sdz at sdz the mean concentration of the total dissolved pahs was the highest followed by spm associated and colloid associated pahs while at dxh the mean concentration of spm associated pahs was the highest followed by total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs the concentrations of different pahs fractions at sdz and dxh exhibited different seasonal variations fig 2 at sdz the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs colloid associated pahs and spm associated pahs fluctuated greatly during the dry season from november 2015 to april 2016 and were relatively stable during the rainy season from may 2015 to october 2015 at sdz the mean concentration of the spm associated pahs was the highest followed by the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the rainy season however the mean concentration of the total dissolved pahs was the highest followed by the spm associated pahs and colloid associated pahs except february 2016 during the dry season the above results indicated that pahs in water at sdz were dominated by the spm associated pahs during the rainy season and dominated by the total dissolved pahs during the dry season at dxh the concentrations of the total dissolved pahs were relatively stable during the rainy season but fluctuated greatly during the dry season similar to that at sdz the concentrations of the spm associated pahs fluctuated greatly during a given year from may 2015 to april 2016 the concentrations of the colloid associated pahs remained relatively stable during a given year at sdz the mean concentrations of the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the dry season 610 and 309 ng l respectively were higher than those during the rainy season 442 and 201 ng l respectively however the mean concentration of the spm associated pahs during the dry season 417 ng l was lower than the rainy season 562 ng l at dxh the mean concentrations of the total dissolved pahs and the spm associated pahs during the dry season 648 and 595 ng l respectively were higher than those during the rainy season 378 and 482 ng l respectively however the mean concentration of the colloid associated pahs during the dry season 281 ng l was lower than the rainy season 384 ng l the distribution of the freely dissolved dom associated and total dissolved pahs in the lld underground river is shown in fig 2 because the concentrations of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs were calculated according to the total dissolved pahs the detection frequency of the freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs was the same as the total dissolved pahs at sdz the concentrations of the freely dissolved pahs ranged from 244 to 1104 ng l with a mean value of 450 ng l the dom associated pahs concentrations ranged from 7 34 to 165 ng l with a mean value 76 5 ng l at dxh the freely dissolved pahs concentrations ranged from 228 to 1280 ng l with a mean value of 449 ng l dom associated pahs concentrations ranged from 5 91 to 173 ng l with a mean value of 63 8 ng l fig 2 and table s4 the concentrations of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs at sdz were close to those at dxh phe was the most dominant component in the freely dissolved phase at sdz and dxh accounting for approximately 30 3 and 32 5 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively and nap ace and flu were the next dominant pahs in the freely dissolved pahs at sdz accounting for about 20 14 3 13 1 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively nap flu fla were the next dominant pahs in the freely dissolved pahs at dxh accounting for about 29 14 1 7 3 of the freely dissolved pah concentration on average respectively however bbf bkf and inp dominated the dom associated pahs at sdz and dxh accounting for about 56 1 and 56 3 of the dom associated pah concentration on average respectively as shown in fig 2 the concentrations of the dom associated pahs at sdz and dxh remained relatively stable during the given year from may 2015 to april 2016 at sdz and dxh the variation of freely dissolved pah concentrations was similar to that of the total dissolved pah concentrations freely dissolved pah concentrations also remained relatively stable during the rainy season and fluctuated greatly during the dry season at sdz the concentrations of the total dissolved pah were markedly higher than those of the freely dissolved pahs during the rainy season however the freely dissolved pah concentrations were close to the total dissolved pah concentrations during the dry season at dxh the concentrations of the freely dissolved pahs were close to those of the total dissolved pahs during the given year the concentrations of pahs at sdz and dxh exhibited an increasing tendency from january in agreement with the heaviest snowfall events reaching the highest values in february the snowfall in january 15 2016 was the strongest over the past several decades in chongqing which could scavenge abundant pahs from the atmosphere zhang et al 2015 therefore snowmelt could mobilize pahs to a maximum extent in february 2016 fig 2 3 2 composition of the different pahs fractions in the lld underground river the composition of dissolved colloid associated and spm associated pahs by ring number in the outlet of the lld underground river are shown in fig 3 the distribution pattern in the spm associated colloid associated and total dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh was kept with time through the observed periods with a predominance of 3 ring pahs followed by 2 ring 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring pahs the contribution to pahs fractions of 3 ring pahs ranged from 38 3 to 53 4 with a mean value of 45 3 at sdz and ranged from 44 3 to 50 7 with a mean value of 47 4 at dxh the contribution of 3 ring pahs in the total dissolved phase 53 4 and 50 7 at sdz and dxh respectively was the highest followed by the colloidal phase 44 2 and 47 2 at sdz and dxh respectively and the particulate phase 38 2 and 44 3 at sdz and dxh respectively overall the more water soluble 2 and 3 ring pahs dominate over the virtually water insoluble and strongly hydrophobic 4 and 5 6 rings in the dissolved colloidal and particulate phases however the mean percentages of 4 and 5 6 rings pahs showed an increasing trend along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase at sdz 25 2 30 4 and 40 2 respectively and dxh 20 9 25 5 and 35 8 respectively while 2 3 ring pahs showed an opposite trend fig 3 these observations indicated that 2 3 ring pahs were transported chiefly via the dissolved phase followed by the colloidal phase and particulate phase however 4 and 5 6 rings pahs were transported mainly through particulate phase followed by the colloidal phase and dissolved phase the results indicate that highly hydrophobic substances strongly bind to the aquatic particulate phase and these substances are likely to have leached from the soil into the groundwater in the first place the composition of freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs are shown in fig s1 the distribution pattern of the freely dissolved pahs at sdz and dxh was kept with time through the observed periods with a predominance of the 3 ring pahs followed by the 2 ring pahs 4 ring pahs and 5 ring pahs the distribution pattern in the dom associated pahs at dxh was also kept with a predominance of 3 ring pahs but followed by the 5 ring 4 ring and 2 ring pahs however the distribution pattern in the dom associated pahs at sdz was kept with a predominance of the 5 ring pahs followed by the 3 ring 4 ring and 2 ring pahs the contribution of the 2 and 3 ring pahs to the freely dissolved pahs ranged from 65 4 to 100 with a mean value of 82 6 at sdz and from 66 9 to 100 with a mean value of 86 1 at dxh however the contribution of the 4 and 5 ring pahs to the dom associated pahs ranged from 0 to 91 1 with a mean value of 62 1 at sdz and from 0 to 94 8 with a mean value of 54 2 at dxh based on the above results the dom associated phase contained relatively more abundant 4 and 5 ring pahs than the freely dissolved phase these results showed that the 4 and 5 ring pahs seemed to have higher affinity to dom than the 2 and 3 ring pahs and prefer to bind to the dom owing to their lower aqueous solubility and hydrophobic nature however the 2 and 3 ring pahs were more likely to dissolve in water due to their higher water solubility kang et al 2016 3 3 contribution of the different pahs fractions to pahs in water the contribution of the different pahs fractions to the total pahs in water at sdz was relatively constant during the given year fig 4 the freely dissolved dom associated colloid associated and spm associated pahs exhibited similar seasonal trends at sdz however there was a large variation in the contribution of the different pahs fractions to the total pahs in water at dxh during the given year the pahs in water were dominated by the spm associated pahs during the given year accounting for 39 9 6 and 37 16 2 at sdz and dxh respectively followed by freely dissolved pahs accounting for 35 9 8 3 and 33 2 12 7 colloid associated pahs accounting for 19 6 6 5 and 24 8 10 9 and dom associated pahs accounting for 5 5 3 1 and 5 4 8 respectively although the contribution of the dom associated pahs was the lowest it is clear from fig s1 that pahs with five or more rings are relatively more abundant in the dom associated fraction which imply a significant role of dom in their transport overall the freely dissolved pahs had a higher contribution 42 6 3 5 and 38 7 7 8 at sdz and dxh respectively than the spm associated pahs during the dry season 31 3 5 4 and 35 4 16 4 at sdz and dxh respectively while the spm associated pahs had a higher contribution during the rainy season 46 7 5 6 and 38 5 17 4 at sdz and dxh respectively this is because the surface runoff during the rainy season is higher than that during the dry season which can carry a considerable amount of soil particles into underground rivers through sinkholes and resuspension is strengthened owing to the high velocity and discharge in the underground rivers during the rainy season these observations indicated that pahs in the lld underground river were transported mostly via the freely dissolved pahs during the dry season and mainly in the spm associated pahs during the rainy season 3 4 factors affecting the content of different pahs fractions pahs are hydrophobic and prefer to associate with dom colloids or spm therefore doc and poc are important factors affecting the behavior fate and toxicity of dissolved phase pahs in underground water levy et al 2017 lan et al 2018 in aquatic environments the interactions between dom or spm and water are important mechanisms controlling the distribution and movement of pahs zhou et al 1999 the relationships between different pahs fractions and doc or poc are discussed according to pearson s coefficient rank correlation in this study a markedly positive correlation was observed between the total dissolved pahs and doc at sdz fig 5 the 2 and 3 ring pahs accounted for 53 100 of the total dissolved pahs so a markedly positive correlation was found between the 2 and 3 ring dissolved phase pahs and doc at sdz fig s2 due to the higher contribution of freely dissolved pahs to total dissolved pahs 75 a positive correlation can be inferred between the freely dissolved pahs and doc because the contribution of 2 and 3 ring pahs to freely dissolved pahs was 65 a markedly positive correlation was also observed between 2 3 ring freely dissolved pahs and doc fig s2 the above results indicate that the input of 2 and 3 ring pahs in the underground water seems to be linked to the input of dom however at dxh the total dissolved pahs and freely dissolved pahs had no marked correlation with doc concentration the results indicate that the relationship between the dissolved pah concentrations and doc content is complex and there might be other factors such as the poc content hydrodynamic conditions and human activities e g the disturbance of rowing affecting the concentration of the dissolved phase pahs at dxh shi et al 2007 a markedly positive correlation was observed between the dom associated pahs and doc at sdz fig s2 these results were similar to that of shi et al 2007 in tianjin rivers china although the contribution of 5 and 6 ring pahs to the total dissolved pahs average 25 1 was lower positive correlation was also observed between 5 and 6 ring pahs in dissolved phase and doc the contribution of 5 to 6 ring pahs to the dom associated pahs was more than 60 at sdz and 79 at dxh fig s2 thus it was not surprising that the statistical examination showed a positive correlation between 5 and 6 ring dom associated pahs and doc content moeckel et al 2014 reported that the concentration of individual pahs with greater than or equal to five rings was observed to be strongly correlated to the doc content this result was consistent with the results of this study at sdz and dxh the above results indicate that dom was not only an important pool for dissolved high molecular weight hmw pahs 4 ring 5 ring and 6 ring but also a facilitator for the accumulation of freely dissolved low molecular weight lmw pahs 2 ring and 3 ring at sdz in the lld underground river although approximately 37 8 on average of lmw pahs were directly associated with dom the markedly positive correlation between dissolved pahs and doc at sdz indicates the input of dissolved pahs can be linked to dom inputs and it would seem intuitive that they are released simultaneously from the soil into the underground river the significantly positive correlation between the pahs associated with spm and poc at sdz and dxh indicated that the concentrations of pahs in the particulate phase were primarily controlled by poc fig 5 however the correlation coefficient at dxh is higher than that at sdz which indicates a better linear relationship formed under completely mixed steady conditions at dxh with increasing spm concentration the probability of particle collisions and particle dom interactions would increase leading to the reduction in sorption sites which would allow the competitive sorption effect to become more significant zhou et al 1999 shi et al 2007 owing to the low vapor pressure and water solubility hmw pahs tended to be preferentially adsorbed by spm the statistical examination showed a significantly positive correlation between hmw pahs in particulate phase and poc at sdz and dxh fig s2 in contrast to the freely dissolved pahs lmw pahs in the particle phase were not markedly correlated with poc at sdz however a positive correlation was found between lmw pahs in the particle phase and poc at dxh therefore the relationship between these lmw pahs and poc is complicated based on the above analysis it was clear that doc and poc were the major factors controlling the behavior and fate of dissolved pahs and particulate pahs at sdz poc was the only major factor controlling the behavior and fate of particulate pahs at dhx due to the much easier measurement of doc and poc the levels of contamination by pahs can be approximately estimated for further measurement and assessment furthermore dom or pom would markedly influence the bioavailability aqueous solubility environmental behavior and remediation of pahs 3 5 partitioning of pahs between spm and water based on the above analysis the interaction between spm and water was one of the dominant processes controlling the speciation distribution and behavior of pahs in the lld underground river pahs indicated an increasing trend in the spm water phase partitioning from 2 ring up to 6 ring compounds in lld underground river fig s3 nap acy ace flu phe fla and pyr dominated the dissolved pah assemblages on average 71 and 58 of nap acy ace flu phe fla and pyr were dissolved in the aqueous phase at sdz and dxh respectively these seven pahs were much more enriched in the particulate phase at dxh than at sdz however 5 ring and 6 ring pah showed the strongest enrichment in the particulate phase mean values up to 82 and 89 at sdz and dxh respectively similar results were reported by shi et al 2007 for pahs in tianjin s rivers where spm associated hmw pahs reached up to 99 the values of the organic carbon normalized partition coefficient koc can always be used to describe the relative affinity or attraction of pahs to spm and predict the degree of spm water partitioning fernandes et al 1997 shi et al 2007 therefore koc could help quantitatively understand the processes that control the behavior and fate of pahs in lld underground rivers the calculation details of koc are described in the literature fernandes et al 1997 shi et al 2007 in this study the increase in logkoc values of pahs corresponded to the increase in the hydrophobicity and were all close to or greater than the upper limit seth et al 1999 however the logkoc of nap was much higher than the upper limit because nap has a higher volatility than the other pahs and its concentration in water is lower which resulting in the high logkoc value this result suggests that pahs were strongly adsorbed by spm in the lld underground river linear free energy relationships were calculated to compare the partitioning of pahs in the lld underground river to the reference octanol water system significant correlations were obtained between the logarithms of our koc and kow found in the literature kang et al 2016 fig 6 the slope of this regression equation gives a measure of the lipophilicity of sorbents relative to the reference octanol water system fernandes et al 1997 the slope at sdz was close to 1 which indicated that the lipophilicity of spm at sdz was similar to octanol however the slope at dxh was higher than 1 which indicated spm at dxh was more lipophilic than octanol the slope was higher than that reported by fernandes et al 1997 for the seine river suspensions luo et al 2008 for the pearl river estuary and ou et al 2009 for the yangtze estuary these results suggest that poc in the lld underground river has more lipophilicity to pahs 3 6 migration pathways of pahs in the underground river system in karst terrains pahs are mainly transported by two migration pathways in the underground river system one pathway involves slow flowing soil seepage water in the karst fissures infiltrating into the underground river and the other involves conduit flows into the underground river schwarz et al 2011 lan et al 2018 considering that particles can act as carriers for organic pollutants the mobilization of pahs is likely to result from the movement of particles that are flushed through the system during a strong rainfall event in particular hmw pahs present higher particle affinities and lower solubilities and they will mainly be transported by particulate phase dissolved pahs can enter the underground river with the soil percolated water outflow sun et al 2019 in order to unveil the migration pathways of different pahs fractions the relationships between pahs in the surface soil or soil seepage water and pahs in the underground river were analyzed by pearson s coefficient rank correlation a significantly positive correlation existed between the total dissolved pahs at sdz and the soil seepage water pahs at w1 in upper reaches of the lld underground river w2 in the middle reaches and w3 in the lower reaches during the observation fig s4 the above results indicated that a significant contribution of pahs in soil seepage water to the total dissolved pahs in underground river during the observation as shown in fig s4 a strongly positive correlation exists between the spm associated pahs at sdz and surface soil pahs but a weakly positive correlation was observed between the spm associated pahs at dxh and surface soil pahs in addition a positive correlation was also observed between the colloid associated pahs at sdz and dxh and pahs in surface soil the above results indicate that the pahs associated with spm and colloids at sdz mainly come from surface soil furthermore during the transport process from sdz to dxh some processes such as adsorption desorption volatilization and biodegradation will influence the spm associated pah concentration and composition at dxh especially human activities e g rowing the above analysis suggests that the transport of pahs in the lld underground river system follows the conceptual model first particulate pahs can be mobilized from the surface soil to the subsurface through the sinkholes especially during strong precipitation events that can form surface runoff shevenell and mccarthy 2002 suggested that the mobilization of colloids depends on hydrological processes such as heavy rain events therefore colloid associated pahs can be formed and transported to the underground river during the rainy season in addition atteia et al 1998 showed that the particles can be retarded by adhering to the conduit walls therefore particles that adhered to the conduit walls during the dry season will be mobilized instantaneously leading to a peak of the spm associated pah concentrations that were measured at sdz in the lld underground river during the snowmelt in february 2016 in summary particle and colloid facilitated transport is one of the dominant mechanisms of pah mobilization in this karst system however according to the above results the contribution of the colloid was minor when compared with the contribution of particle transport furthermore pahs can be mobilized in the form of dissolved pahs freely dissolved pahs and dom associated pahs dissolved pahs can not only be mobilized from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes but also mobilized through soil seepage water infiltrating into the underground river during the rainy season the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had an important contribution fig 7 during the dry season however dissolved pahs are mainly mobilized through soil seepage water fig 7 4 conclusions this study has provided important data on the variation in 16 priority pahs in the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particle phase of a typical karst underground river in southwest china during a given year without the disturbance of human activity in the underground river pahs in water were dominated by the total dissolved pahs followed by the spm associated pahs and colloid associated pahs during the dry season and dominated by the spm associated pahs followed by the total dissolved pahs and colloid associated pahs during the rainy season the more water soluble lmw pahs dominate over the virtually water insoluble and strongly hydrophobic hmw pahs in the dissolved colloidal and particulate phases however the contribution of hmw pahs showed an increasing trend along the order of the dissolved phase colloidal phase and particulate phase the environmental behavior and fate of pahs were markedly influenced by organic content in each phase and poc has more lipophilicity to pahs in the lld underground river the migration pathways of pahs from the surface soil to the underground river through the sinkholes and soil seepage water both had important contribution during the rainy season dissolved pahs are mainly mobilized through soil seepage water during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement yuchuan sun

4738,soils are naturally present in the form of stratified layers each being distinguishable from adjacent layers by a distinctive set of hydraulic and elasticity properties lo et al 2020 have recently presented a theoretical model of poroelasticity that provides a detailed description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid flow in a two layer soil system that is made up of upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by a vertical constant surface load under semi permeable boundary drainage conditions due to the existence of different moisture contents partial and full saturations in the upper and lower layers excess pore fluid pressure does not exhibit a symmetric distribution with respect to depth therefore an exact analytical solution for fully permeable boundary drainage conditions cannot be determined readily by applying scaling transformations and spatial translations from our recent result even though the coupled model equations possess an invariance feature in this paper a well defined boundary value problem based on the decoupled model equations of poroelasticity generalized for a two fluid system is rigorously formulated for a double layer unsaturated saturated soil profile that allows water drainage at both top and bottom surfaces using laplace time transformation we derive the closed form exact analytical solution accounting for the intricate interaction between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in such a two layer system the solution takes a more complicated form than that for the semi permeable case boundary drainage conditions indeed affect the development of excess pore water and air pressures along with the time evolution of total settlement we show that when the bottom boundary of the saturated layer overlain by the unsaturated layer with a lower hydraulic conductivity is impervious the curve describing the relationship between the depth and excess water pressure at the interface has a negative slope whereas the slope is positive when the boundary is pervious the total settlement in the lower saturated layer would thus achieve an equilibrium state faster keywords unsaturated saturated two layer soil poroelasticity 1 introduction most naturally occurring soil deposits often exhibit stratification and typically consist of fairly homogeneous distinct layers having their own physical properties these properties reflect various processes involved in water movement and matrix deformation thus strongly affecting the hydromechanical response of stratified soils to either the action of applied stress or the variation of interstitial fluid pressure behnke and bianchi 1965 the study of such time dependent coupling between applied stress solid deformation and pore fluid pressure fluid flow that occurs when an external load is exerted on two vertically contiguous soil layers has taken on a new and critical importance in the fields of hydrogeology geomechanics and soil water physics because of recent widespread interest in the development of underground infrastructure the concern of land subsidence and the maintenance of slope stability e g fallou et al 1992 burd and frydman 1997 borja 1992 2006 due to intimate interphase interactions among the solid and the interpenetrating fluids in the porous matrix a bidirectional coupling between the flow of fluids and the deformation of solid exists porous medium deformation induces interstitial fluid flow because of changes in pore volume the latter simultaneously influences the former due to excess pore fluid pressure gradients created poroelasticity theory a term coined by geertsma 1966 and originally proposed by biot 1941 biot 1956 has been developed as an effective and accurate approach for analyzing the two way coupling both fluid to solid and solid to fluid mechanical behavior of a fluid bearing porous medium nevertheless deriving a closed form analytical solution for the model equations of poroelasticity is a notoriously difficult problem owing to their complexity in featuring coupled terms inherently arising from the solid stress and fluid pressure fields schiffman and stein 1970 appeared to be the first to show the mathematical tractability of this intricate problem in an analytical framework for a double layer saturated soil with different textures in a vertical deposition since then the theoretical literature on the modeling of simultaneous solid framework deformation and pore pressure change in a two layer saturated soil subject to an external load has grown considerably in recent years e g desai and saxena 1977 huang and griffiths 2010 can ulker 2012 verruijt 2013 zhang et al 2015 fazeli et al 2018 a comprehensive review of the research on theoretical works that address relational problems can be found in lo et al 2020 in their paper the foundation of the macroscopic theory was presented and then applied to systematically quantify time dependent coupling between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in a layered soil column consisting of the upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones on the basis of laplace time transformation lo et al 2020 deduced the closed form exact analytical solution for excess pore air and water pressures as well as total settlement in such a double layer unsaturated saturated system under a time invariant total compressive force subject to the semi permeable boundary drainage condition we note in passing that for a single layer soil in the absence of body forces the analytical solutions to the boundary value problem under the fully permeable i e drainage at both top and bottom surfaces or semi permeable i e drainage only at the bottom surface or drainage only at the top surface boundary conditions are not mutually independent lo et al 2014 have indicated clearly that if one solution for any of the fully permeable and two semi permeable boundary drainage conditions is available the other two can be readily obtained by employing the technique of scaling transformations and spatial translations because of the invariance property of the coupled model equations of poroelasticity for instance it can be shown using coordinate transformation that the time evolution of the total settlement subject to the fully permeable boundary condition is indeed four times faster than that for either of the two semi permeable boundary cases yet even though gravity may be negligible the distribution of excess pore water and air pressures developed in two contiguous different soil layers with various moisture contents does not exhibit a symmetric dependence on depth and the corresponding total settlement induced in each layer is not identical consequently the scaling transformation of the analytical solutions between the fully permeable and semi permeable boundary conditions for a layered soil is not applicable thus important gaps will exist in our comprehensive understanding of the physics deriving concurrent fluid flow through the network of pores as well as mechanical deformation of the solid skeleton occurring in a two layer soil profile if the analytical solution available to describe its poroelastic responses to an external load under the fully permeable boundary drainage condition is missing therefore this paper is devoted to resolving this issue we begin with the poroelasticity model of one dimensional consolidation presented by biot 1941 for a porous medium containing a single viscous compressible fluid in conjunction with the extension of the model constructed by lo et al 2014 for a two fluid system a set of physically based initial and boundary conditions are rigorously stipulated as a well defined boundary value problem for describing the poroelastic behavior of a double layer column composed of an unsaturated soil overlying a saturated soil under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions the introduction of laplace transformation in the temporal domain enables us to make this complicated problem mathematically tractable in turn yielding the closed form analytical solution for the excess pore water and air pressures along with total settlement as an illustration of our model two very different soil textures sand and clay are selected to quantify the impact of soil texture and depositional layering on consolidation processes lastly a comparative study with our recent works lo et al 2020 obtained for the semi permeable boundary drainage condition is conducted to explore more physical insight into how changes in boundary drainage surface affect the seepage deformation behavior in a two layer soil caused by a vertical time independent compressive load 2 model equations employing the continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1984 lo et al 2014 presented the three dimensional consolidation model of poroelasticity for unsaturated soils which generalizes the classic biot 1941 consolidation model when the solid framework undergoes uniaxial deformations coupling between total stress and excess pore fluid pressures can be eliminated thus simplifying the model to the important problem of a one dimensional strain field sills 1975 lo et al 2014 this condition in turn creates a direct relation between excess pore fluid pressures and the gradient of vertical deformation of the solid framework lo et al 2020 have recently formulated the poroelastic theory of one dimensional consolidation for a double layer soil system to provide a detailed mathematical description of the deformation pressure interaction between the porous solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids generated by a time invariant total compaction stress the system with perfect depositional layering in horizontal direction has a profile of the upper unsaturated and lower saturated layers each being homogeneous in its physical property because of the existence of the interphase coupling between two interstitial fluids caused by their relative motions the model equations for a deformable porous medium bearing two immiscible fluids inherently feature coupled terms involving the excess pore air and water pressures p 1 and p 2 berryman et al 1988 corapcioglu and tuncay 1996 lo et al 2010 2013 due to the coupled form of these equations an exact separation of them into partial differential equations representing independent deformation modes is required for the development of the closed form analytical solution this has been achieved using two normal coordinates ξ and ζ the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 thus leading to two diffusion equations for the upper unsaturated soil layer 1 1 ξ t c 1 2 ξ z 2 1 2 ζ t c 2 2 ζ z 2 and one diffusion equation that governs the pore water pressure p 2 for the lower saturated soil layer 1 3 p 2 t c c 2 p 2 z 2 where the physical quantity in the lower layer is specified with the tilde such as p 2 to distinguish from the physical quantity in the upper layer that is assigned without the tilde the normal coordinates ξ and ζ as well as the diffusivities c 1 c 2 and c c are defined as 2 1 ξ p 1 d p 2

phase j the subscript j designates the two immiscible fluid phases 1 indicating the nonwetting fluid henceforth termed air and the subscript 2 indicating the wetting fluid henceforth termed water the physical representation of the elasticity coefficient q i in terms of directly measurable parameters is also detailed in appendix a for anisotropic porous media the reader is referred to zhang et al 2019 and zhao and borja 2020 it must be noted in passing that according to the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 lo et al 2005 an elastic porous medium undergoes very small deformations so that the thermodynamic process involved is reversible thus the medium behaves elastically and has linear relations between its strain and the applied stress consequently it remains accurate that the physical parameters c 1 c 2 and c c in eqs 1 1 1 3 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to the application of an external load accordingly the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration denoted by a superscript 0 plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the water saturation s 2 in the current configuration is determined by s 2 s 2 0 δ s 2 the latter is a function of capillary pressure δ s 2 d s 1 d p c p 2 p 1 lo et al 2005 lo and lee 2015 where p c p 1 p 2 denotes the capillary pressure and d s 1 d p c expresses the slope evaluated in the reference configuration of the curve relating the capillary pressure to the relative saturation of air as an aside we note that changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent in sedimentary soils may cause gravitational compaction to create an additional interphase momentum exchange in turn exerting an impact on consolidation behaviors this effect appeared to be first discussed by liakopoulos 1965 and has been recently investigated in a quantitative manner by lo et al 2017 and chao et al 2018 for an elastic porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids 3 boundary value problem let us consider a two layer system where the upper layer constitutes an unsaturated soil with thickness h 1 while the lower layer is composed of a saturated soil whose thickness is h 2 a schematic diagram of the problem geometry along with boundary conditions stipulated in the current study is illustrated in fig 1 the boundary conditions at the top z h h 1 h 2 interface z h 1 and bottom z 0 surfaces are prescribed by 4 1 p 1 h t 0 4 2 p 2 h t 0 4 3 p 1 h 1 t z 0 4 4 p 2 h 1 t p 2 h 1 t 4 5 π 2 p 2 h 1 t z π 2 p 2 h 1 t z 4 6 p 2 0 t 0 where π 2 k s η 2 upper layer and π 2 k s η 2 lower layer due to full saturation s 2 1 leading to k r 2 1 at the interface the physical interpretation of the boundary conditions in eqs 4 1 4 6 is illustrated as follows eqs 4 1 and 4 2 imply that the top boundary z h is pervious i e a drainage boundary with respect to both water and air the interface z h 1 separating two soil layers forms a barrier to air flow since the lower layer is fully saturated by water this condition is realized in eq 4 3 a continuity constraint that requires the flux and pore pressure of the water phase to remain the same at the interface z h 1 between the upper and lower layers is mathematically depicted in eqs 4 4 and 4 5 the physical implication of eq 4 6 is that the bottom surface z 0 is permeable so that water can move across it freely in reference to the initial condition an instantaneous undrained response i e no change in air or water content with respect to its value in the reference configuration occurs throughout the double layer soil system when the surface stress p is imposed on the top surface therefore the excess pore water and air pressures in the upper and lower zones under this initial undrained condition can be mathematically expressed in terms of loading efficiencies by 5 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 5 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p 5 3 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p where γ 1 and γ 2 represent the loading efficiencies for air and water in the upper soil layer and γ 2 symbolizes the loading efficiency for water in the lower soil layer the loading efficiency is a physical parameter to characterize the fraction of total compressive axial stress p initially carried by the pore fluid as the stress is applied to soils under undrained conditions lo et al 2014 by employing laplace time transformation of eqs 1 1 1 3 and performing a series of algebraic manipulations see also appendix c one

16 in lo et al 2020 for the semi permeable drainage only at the top surface boundary drainage condition clearly reveals that the fully permeable boundary drainage condition makes the analytical solution more complicated in modeling the deformation pressure response of a two layer soil system to a vertical time invariant compression stress implying that the fully permeable boundary drainage condition gives rise to additional dynamics of the hydromechanical response we note that the analytical solution presented in this paper is based on the one dimensional condition in which both solid deformation and fluid flow take place in the vertical direction for more general two dimensional and three dimensional conditions analytical solutions are far more complicated to derive and may not even be obtainable in most cases for this type of problems computational techniques such as borja 2004 borja et al 2013 borja and choo 2016 along with song and borja 2014 provide a more robust technique for solving coupled solid deformation fluid flow in variably saturated porous media 4 numerical calculations and verifications to evaluate the linear elasticity coefficient q i i 1 4 and relative mobility b j j 1 2 for the diffusivities c 1 c 2 and c c in eqs 1 1 1 3 we require information about the water retention curve that describes the relationship between the capillary pressure p c p 1 p 2 and the water saturation s 2 as well as information about the hydraulic conductivity function that illustrates the relationship between the relative permeabilities k r ξ and the water saturation s 2 the widely applied van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model is employed to depict these relationships 10 1 1 χ h c n m s 2 e θ 2 θ 2 r θ 2 s θ 2 r 10 2 k r 1 s 2 e 1 s 2 e η 1 s 2 e 1 m 2 m

data m 1 1 n η is the pore connectivity parameter and θ 2 r and θ 2 s are the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water van genuchten 1980 the former is the volumetric fraction of water that remains after drainage whereas the latter is the upper limit of water volumetric fraction reached upon imbibition at a capillary pressure of zero fetter 1999 we set the water saturation s 2 equal to the effective water saturation s 2 e in eqs 10 1 10 3 since θ 2 r is typically very small e g having the value of 0 02 and 0 09 for sand and clay respectively rawls et al 1992 when a specific water saturation s 2 is given k r1 k r2 and h c can be determined from eqs 10 1 10 3 to verify the accuracy of the closed form exact analytical solution obtained in the current study the one for the excess pore water pressure described by the biot 1941 model of consolidation under the fully permeable boundary condition eq b6 in chao et al 2018 is compared to our solution formulated in eqs 6 and 8 for a double layer saturated soil containing an entire clay texture the result for the distribution of the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p along the depth depicted by these two solutions is graphically presented in fig 2 in which the triangle and solid line correspondingly represent biot s theory and the present study evidently an excellent agreement can be found from the comparison between these two theoretical estimations as opposed to the semi permeable case see also fig 2 in lo et al 2020 the dimensionless pore water pressure in fig 2 exhibits a symmetric feature for the fully permeable case because the top and bottom boundaries are completely drainable as an illustrative example of the capability of our model numerical computations for p 1 z t p 2 z t and p 2 z t in eqs 6 and 8 as well as s t and s t in eq 9 are carried out in matlab for a double layer soil system where the lower layer consists of saturated clay and the upper layer is composed of unsaturated sand table 1 lists the elasticity coefficients and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical calculations taken from lo et al 2017 the fitting coefficients in eq 10 for the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function corresponding to unsaturated sand or clay respectively are obtained from rawls et al 1992 as summarized in table 2 one central issue in the present study is to inspect how the boundary drainage condition affects the hydromechanical interaction between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids in a two layer soil system a cross plot of the relationship between the dimensionless pore water pressure p 2 p and depth for such a system as a function of elapsed time t 1 min 1 h and 1 day and initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in the upper unsaturated sand under the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions is shown in fig 3 the former is represented by the circle whereas the solid line is used to depict the latter one can see that irrespective of whether the boundary drainage condition is semi permeable or fully permeable the excess pore water pressure dissipates almost completely in the upper layer unsaturated sand owing to its higher water hydraulic conductivity however the lower layer saturated clay under the semi permeable case still contains a sufficient amount of excess pore water pressure until t 1 hour but then the full dissipation of excess pore water pressure is almost achieved as the boundaries are fully permeable the distribution of the dimensionless pore air pressure along depth in the upper unsaturated sand under the fully permeable case is graphically illustrated in fig 4 it can be observed that the excess pore air pressurehas been quickly drained outthrough the top surface the total settlement induced in the upper and lower layers is portrayed in fig 5 with the time axis plotted logarithmically the discrepancy in total settlement in the upper layer due to changes in initial water saturation is negligible 10 3 m as shown in fig 5 a this can be physically interpreted from eq 9 that the total settlement is strongly dependent on the excess pore water and air pressures as shown in figs 3 and 4 variations in these dimensionless pore fluid pressures caused by various moisture contents are very small 0 03 the same observation holds for the lower layer in fig 5 b an additional physical implication behind it is that since the upper unsaturated soil layer has a much higher hydraulic conductivity the total settlement in the lower saturated soil exhibits the same trend as it behaves in a single layer system this is a direct consequence of the fact that the excess pore water pressure in the upper layer dissipates very fast thus allowing unrestricted drainageof water in the lower layer through the top boundary in order to gain more physical insight into the effect of soil texture on the deformation pressure response of a two layer soil system to a vertical surface constant load an opposite two layer configuration i e an upper unsaturated clay and a lower saturated sand is next investigated in figs 6 8 fig 6 presents the comparison for the dimensionless pore water pressure versus depth with respect to initial water saturation and elapsed time between the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions it is evident that the distribution of the dimensionless pore water pressure against depth is very different from that in fig 3 in fig 6 the distribution in the upper layer essentially reveals a half parabolic shape irrespective of the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions however the distribution becomes very sensitive to boundary drainage effect in the proximity above the interface and has a very apparent difference between the fully permeable and semi permeable cases as a result two distinct distributions caused by boundary drainage effect are developed in the lower layer the dimensionless pore water pressure appears as an inclined line that rises as the depth increases under the fully permeable case whereas the dimensionless pore water pressure is principally independent of the depth and remains a straight line under the semi permeable case a particular attention should be directed on the curve that describes the excess pore water pressure and depth around the interface in fig 6 for the fully permeable case where both top and bottom surfaces are pervious for water drainage the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer saturated sand is much faster than that in upper layer unsaturated clay since sand has a higher hydraulic conductivity consequently a substantial alteration in excess pore water pressure occurs across the interface thus creating a sudden change in pore water pressure gradient at the interface leading to a positive pressure slope for the curve there according to eq 4 5 that states the continuity of water flow flux the water pressure gradient right below the interface should be two orders of magnitude less than that right above the interface since the permeability in clay upper layer is two orders of magnitude less than that in sand lower layer however a reverse trend is observed in the semi permeable case the excess pore water pressure in the lower layer is greater because only the top surface permits water to drain out thus instead resulting in a negative pressure slope at the interface with elapsed time aside from the boundary drainage effect another important physical basis behind the discrepancy in figs 3 and 6 is because of the existence of different values of the loading efficiencies γ 2 and γ 2 in the upper and lower zones since clay is entirely saturated the loading efficiency takes a numerical value of around unity whereas it becomes 0 21 0 20 and 0 30 as s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 lo and lee 2015 therefore for the fully permeable case when clay resides in the lower layer with full water saturation it sustains more excess pore water pressure so that an approximately parabolic shape occurs in fig 3 at the early stage t 1 min as opposed to a half parabolic shape with less excess pore water pressure in fig 6 where it is under partial water saturation in the upper layer on the other hand sand has the loading efficiency of 0 02 0 03 0 06 and 0 99 corresponding to s 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 lo and lee 2015 a significant difference in the loading efficiency exists for sand as it is under the full or partial saturation as a consequence the excess pore water pressure dissipates very fast as sand is located in the upper unsaturated layer a straight line shape in fig 3 but it still carries certain excess pore water pressure in the lower saturated layer an inclined line shape in fig 6 under the fully permeable case the effect of boundary drainage condition is not obvious as the upper layer constitutes unsaturated sand while the lower layer is composed of saturated clay this is because the excess pore water and air pressures in figs 3 and 4 fully permeable case take very similar values to those in figs 3 and 4 in lo et al 2020 semi permeable case except at the early stages t 1 min and 1 hr accordingly it follows from eq 9 that both cases have very similar total settlement which is not really affected by changes in boundary drainage condition conversely those changes indeed give an impact on the total settlement if sand is placed in the lower layer as indicated from fig 8 b in the current study and fig 8 b in lo et al 2020 more total settlement is induced in the fully permeable case during the time we examined since more excess pores water pressure has been dissipated 5 conclusions the essential physical element underlying the present study is the unified illustration of how the intimate interactions between deformable porous framework and compressible interstitial fluids within each stratum in a natural double layer soil are affected by variations in the spatial texture stratification degree of water saturation and boundary drainage condition as the layered soil is acted upon by an external load or driven by pore fluid pressure gradient this intricate phenomenon is exactly modeled by a rigorous theoretical framework described by a well defined boundary value problem eqs 1 5 for a two layer soil system that comprises an unsaturated zone overlying a saturated zone under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions the framework that we develop is quite general which thus readily allows astraightforward extension to a multiple layer soil system under partial or full saturation subject to either semi permeable or fully permeable boundary drainage conditions we show that the closed form exact analytical solution for the boundary value problem is traceable by means of the introduction of laplace transformation in the temporal domain the solution derived for the excess pore water and air pressures along with the total settlement eq 6 takes a much longer mathematical expression than that obtained for the semi permeable case eq 16 in lo et al 2020 implying more physical mechanisms responsible for the coupling process between solid deformation and fluid flow under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions our analytical solution is of practical significance to serve as an excellent basis to validate benchmark numerical codes for the development of more robust computational models the present study makes apparent the point that the distribution of excess pore water pressure versus depth due to the stratification effect is sensitive to the boundary drainage condition the slope of the curve describing the distribution at the interface varies from negative under the semi permeable drainage at the top surface case to positive under the fully permeable case as the lower saturated layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity this gradient change is not obvious when the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer is smaller credit

4738,soils are naturally present in the form of stratified layers each being distinguishable from adjacent layers by a distinctive set of hydraulic and elasticity properties lo et al 2020 have recently presented a theoretical model of poroelasticity that provides a detailed description of simultaneous solid framework deformation and immiscible fluid flow in a two layer soil system that is made up of upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones caused by a vertical constant surface load under semi permeable boundary drainage conditions due to the existence of different moisture contents partial and full saturations in the upper and lower layers excess pore fluid pressure does not exhibit a symmetric distribution with respect to depth therefore an exact analytical solution for fully permeable boundary drainage conditions cannot be determined readily by applying scaling transformations and spatial translations from our recent result even though the coupled model equations possess an invariance feature in this paper a well defined boundary value problem based on the decoupled model equations of poroelasticity generalized for a two fluid system is rigorously formulated for a double layer unsaturated saturated soil profile that allows water drainage at both top and bottom surfaces using laplace time transformation we derive the closed form exact analytical solution accounting for the intricate interaction between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in such a two layer system the solution takes a more complicated form than that for the semi permeable case boundary drainage conditions indeed affect the development of excess pore water and air pressures along with the time evolution of total settlement we show that when the bottom boundary of the saturated layer overlain by the unsaturated layer with a lower hydraulic conductivity is impervious the curve describing the relationship between the depth and excess water pressure at the interface has a negative slope whereas the slope is positive when the boundary is pervious the total settlement in the lower saturated layer would thus achieve an equilibrium state faster keywords unsaturated saturated two layer soil poroelasticity 1 introduction most naturally occurring soil deposits often exhibit stratification and typically consist of fairly homogeneous distinct layers having their own physical properties these properties reflect various processes involved in water movement and matrix deformation thus strongly affecting the hydromechanical response of stratified soils to either the action of applied stress or the variation of interstitial fluid pressure behnke and bianchi 1965 the study of such time dependent coupling between applied stress solid deformation and pore fluid pressure fluid flow that occurs when an external load is exerted on two vertically contiguous soil layers has taken on a new and critical importance in the fields of hydrogeology geomechanics and soil water physics because of recent widespread interest in the development of underground infrastructure the concern of land subsidence and the maintenance of slope stability e g fallou et al 1992 burd and frydman 1997 borja 1992 2006 due to intimate interphase interactions among the solid and the interpenetrating fluids in the porous matrix a bidirectional coupling between the flow of fluids and the deformation of solid exists porous medium deformation induces interstitial fluid flow because of changes in pore volume the latter simultaneously influences the former due to excess pore fluid pressure gradients created poroelasticity theory a term coined by geertsma 1966 and originally proposed by biot 1941 biot 1956 has been developed as an effective and accurate approach for analyzing the two way coupling both fluid to solid and solid to fluid mechanical behavior of a fluid bearing porous medium nevertheless deriving a closed form analytical solution for the model equations of poroelasticity is a notoriously difficult problem owing to their complexity in featuring coupled terms inherently arising from the solid stress and fluid pressure fields schiffman and stein 1970 appeared to be the first to show the mathematical tractability of this intricate problem in an analytical framework for a double layer saturated soil with different textures in a vertical deposition since then the theoretical literature on the modeling of simultaneous solid framework deformation and pore pressure change in a two layer saturated soil subject to an external load has grown considerably in recent years e g desai and saxena 1977 huang and griffiths 2010 can ulker 2012 verruijt 2013 zhang et al 2015 fazeli et al 2018 a comprehensive review of the research on theoretical works that address relational problems can be found in lo et al 2020 in their paper the foundation of the macroscopic theory was presented and then applied to systematically quantify time dependent coupling between deformable solid matrix and compressible interstitial fluids in a layered soil column consisting of the upper unsaturated and lower saturated zones on the basis of laplace time transformation lo et al 2020 deduced the closed form exact analytical solution for excess pore air and water pressures as well as total settlement in such a double layer unsaturated saturated system under a time invariant total compressive force subject to the semi permeable boundary drainage condition we note in passing that for a single layer soil in the absence of body forces the analytical solutions to the boundary value problem under the fully permeable i e drainage at both top and bottom surfaces or semi permeable i e drainage only at the bottom surface or drainage only at the top surface boundary conditions are not mutually independent lo et al 2014 have indicated clearly that if one solution for any of the fully permeable and two semi permeable boundary drainage conditions is available the other two can be readily obtained by employing the technique of scaling transformations and spatial translations because of the invariance property of the coupled model equations of poroelasticity for instance it can be shown using coordinate transformation that the time evolution of the total settlement subject to the fully permeable boundary condition is indeed four times faster than that for either of the two semi permeable boundary cases yet even though gravity may be negligible the distribution of excess pore water and air pressures developed in two contiguous different soil layers with various moisture contents does not exhibit a symmetric dependence on depth and the corresponding total settlement induced in each layer is not identical consequently the scaling transformation of the analytical solutions between the fully permeable and semi permeable boundary conditions for a layered soil is not applicable thus important gaps will exist in our comprehensive understanding of the physics deriving concurrent fluid flow through the network of pores as well as mechanical deformation of the solid skeleton occurring in a two layer soil profile if the analytical solution available to describe its poroelastic responses to an external load under the fully permeable boundary drainage condition is missing therefore this paper is devoted to resolving this issue we begin with the poroelasticity model of one dimensional consolidation presented by biot 1941 for a porous medium containing a single viscous compressible fluid in conjunction with the extension of the model constructed by lo et al 2014 for a two fluid system a set of physically based initial and boundary conditions are rigorously stipulated as a well defined boundary value problem for describing the poroelastic behavior of a double layer column composed of an unsaturated soil overlying a saturated soil under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions the introduction of laplace transformation in the temporal domain enables us to make this complicated problem mathematically tractable in turn yielding the closed form analytical solution for the excess pore water and air pressures along with total settlement as an illustration of our model two very different soil textures sand and clay are selected to quantify the impact of soil texture and depositional layering on consolidation processes lastly a comparative study with our recent works lo et al 2020 obtained for the semi permeable boundary drainage condition is conducted to explore more physical insight into how changes in boundary drainage surface affect the seepage deformation behavior in a two layer soil caused by a vertical time independent compressive load 2 model equations employing the continuum mechanics of mixtures truesdell 1984 lo et al 2014 presented the three dimensional consolidation model of poroelasticity for unsaturated soils which generalizes the classic biot 1941 consolidation model when the solid framework undergoes uniaxial deformations coupling between total stress and excess pore fluid pressures can be eliminated thus simplifying the model to the important problem of a one dimensional strain field sills 1975 lo et al 2014 this condition in turn creates a direct relation between excess pore fluid pressures and the gradient of vertical deformation of the solid framework lo et al 2020 have recently formulated the poroelastic theory of one dimensional consolidation for a double layer soil system to provide a detailed mathematical description of the deformation pressure interaction between the porous solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids generated by a time invariant total compaction stress the system with perfect depositional layering in horizontal direction has a profile of the upper unsaturated and lower saturated layers each being homogeneous in its physical property because of the existence of the interphase coupling between two interstitial fluids caused by their relative motions the model equations for a deformable porous medium bearing two immiscible fluids inherently feature coupled terms involving the excess pore air and water pressures p 1 and p 2 berryman et al 1988 corapcioglu and tuncay 1996 lo et al 2010 2013 due to the coupled form of these equations an exact separation of them into partial differential equations representing independent deformation modes is required for the development of the closed form analytical solution this has been achieved using two normal coordinates ξ and ζ the linear combinations of p 1 and p 2 thus leading to two diffusion equations for the upper unsaturated soil layer 1 1 ξ t c 1 2 ξ z 2 1 2 ζ t c 2 2 ζ z 2 and one diffusion equation that governs the pore water pressure p 2 for the lower saturated soil layer 1 3 p 2 t c c 2 p 2 z 2 where the physical quantity in the lower layer is specified with the tilde such as p 2 to distinguish from the physical quantity in the upper layer that is assigned without the tilde the normal coordinates ξ and ζ as well as the diffusivities c 1 c 2 and c c are defined as 2 1 ξ p 1 d p 2

phase j the subscript j designates the two immiscible fluid phases 1 indicating the nonwetting fluid henceforth termed air and the subscript 2 indicating the wetting fluid henceforth termed water the physical representation of the elasticity coefficient q i in terms of directly measurable parameters is also detailed in appendix a for anisotropic porous media the reader is referred to zhang et al 2019 and zhao and borja 2020 it must be noted in passing that according to the theory of poroelasticity biot 1956 lo et al 2005 an elastic porous medium undergoes very small deformations so that the thermodynamic process involved is reversible thus the medium behaves elastically and has linear relations between its strain and the applied stress consequently it remains accurate that the physical parameters c 1 c 2 and c c in eqs 1 1 1 3 are evaluated in a reference configuration taken here as the unperturbed state prior to the application of an external load accordingly the value of a physical property induced in the current deformed configuration is equal to the value in the reference configuration denoted by a superscript 0 plus the difference between the current and reference values denoted by capital delta δ e g the water saturation s 2 in the current configuration is determined by s 2 s 2 0 δ s 2 the latter is a function of capillary pressure δ s 2 d s 1 d p c p 2 p 1 lo et al 2005 lo and lee 2015 where p c p 1 p 2 denotes the capillary pressure and d s 1 d p c expresses the slope evaluated in the reference configuration of the curve relating the capillary pressure to the relative saturation of air as an aside we note that changes in volumetric fraction and material density of each constituent in sedimentary soils may cause gravitational compaction to create an additional interphase momentum exchange in turn exerting an impact on consolidation behaviors this effect appeared to be first discussed by liakopoulos 1965 and has been recently investigated in a quantitative manner by lo et al 2017 and chao et al 2018 for an elastic porous medium permeated by two immiscible viscous compressible fluids 3 boundary value problem let us consider a two layer system where the upper layer constitutes an unsaturated soil with thickness h 1 while the lower layer is composed of a saturated soil whose thickness is h 2 a schematic diagram of the problem geometry along with boundary conditions stipulated in the current study is illustrated in fig 1 the boundary conditions at the top z h h 1 h 2 interface z h 1 and bottom z 0 surfaces are prescribed by 4 1 p 1 h t 0 4 2 p 2 h t 0 4 3 p 1 h 1 t z 0 4 4 p 2 h 1 t p 2 h 1 t 4 5 π 2 p 2 h 1 t z π 2 p 2 h 1 t z 4 6 p 2 0 t 0 where π 2 k s η 2 upper layer and π 2 k s η 2 lower layer due to full saturation s 2 1 leading to k r 2 1 at the interface the physical interpretation of the boundary conditions in eqs 4 1 4 6 is illustrated as follows eqs 4 1 and 4 2 imply that the top boundary z h is pervious i e a drainage boundary with respect to both water and air the interface z h 1 separating two soil layers forms a barrier to air flow since the lower layer is fully saturated by water this condition is realized in eq 4 3 a continuity constraint that requires the flux and pore pressure of the water phase to remain the same at the interface z h 1 between the upper and lower layers is mathematically depicted in eqs 4 4 and 4 5 the physical implication of eq 4 6 is that the bottom surface z 0 is permeable so that water can move across it freely in reference to the initial condition an instantaneous undrained response i e no change in air or water content with respect to its value in the reference configuration occurs throughout the double layer soil system when the surface stress p is imposed on the top surface therefore the excess pore water and air pressures in the upper and lower zones under this initial undrained condition can be mathematically expressed in terms of loading efficiencies by 5 1 p 1 z 0 γ 1 p 5 2 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p 5 3 p 2 z 0 γ 2 p where γ 1 and γ 2 represent the loading efficiencies for air and water in the upper soil layer and γ 2 symbolizes the loading efficiency for water in the lower soil layer the loading efficiency is a physical parameter to characterize the fraction of total compressive axial stress p initially carried by the pore fluid as the stress is applied to soils under undrained conditions lo et al 2014 by employing laplace time transformation of eqs 1 1 1 3 and performing a series of algebraic manipulations see also appendix c one

16 in lo et al 2020 for the semi permeable drainage only at the top surface boundary drainage condition clearly reveals that the fully permeable boundary drainage condition makes the analytical solution more complicated in modeling the deformation pressure response of a two layer soil system to a vertical time invariant compression stress implying that the fully permeable boundary drainage condition gives rise to additional dynamics of the hydromechanical response we note that the analytical solution presented in this paper is based on the one dimensional condition in which both solid deformation and fluid flow take place in the vertical direction for more general two dimensional and three dimensional conditions analytical solutions are far more complicated to derive and may not even be obtainable in most cases for this type of problems computational techniques such as borja 2004 borja et al 2013 borja and choo 2016 along with song and borja 2014 provide a more robust technique for solving coupled solid deformation fluid flow in variably saturated porous media 4 numerical calculations and verifications to evaluate the linear elasticity coefficient q i i 1 4 and relative mobility b j j 1 2 for the diffusivities c 1 c 2 and c c in eqs 1 1 1 3 we require information about the water retention curve that describes the relationship between the capillary pressure p c p 1 p 2 and the water saturation s 2 as well as information about the hydraulic conductivity function that illustrates the relationship between the relative permeabilities k r ξ and the water saturation s 2 the widely applied van genuchten 1980 mualem 1976 model is employed to depict these relationships 10 1 1 χ h c n m s 2 e θ 2 θ 2 r θ 2 s θ 2 r 10 2 k r 1 s 2 e 1 s 2 e η 1 s 2 e 1 m 2 m 10 3 k r 2 s 2 e s 2 e η 1 1 s 2 e 1 m m 2 where h c p c ρ 2 g is the matric potential head ρ 2 denoting the material density of water χ n and m are model parameters obtained by fitting experimental data m 1 1 n η is the pore connectivity parameter and θ 2 r and θ 2 s are the residual and saturated volumetric fractions of water van genuchten 1980 the former is the volumetric fraction of water that remains after drainage whereas the latter is the upper limit of water volumetric fraction reached upon imbibition at a capillary pressure of zero fetter 1999 we set the water saturation s 2 equal to the effective water saturation s 2 e in eqs 10 1 10 3 since θ 2 r is typically very small e g having the value of 0 02 and 0 09 for sand and clay respectively rawls et al 1992 when a specific water saturation s 2 is given k r1 k r2 and h c can be determined from eqs 10 1 10 3 to verify the accuracy of the closed form exact analytical solution obtained in the current study the one for the excess pore water pressure described by the biot 1941 model of consolidation under the fully permeable boundary condition eq b6 in chao et al 2018 is compared to our solution formulated in eqs 6 and 8 for a double layer saturated soil containing an entire clay texture the result for the distribution of the dimensionless pore water pressure normalized by p along the depth depicted by these two solutions is graphically presented in fig 2 in which the triangle and solid line correspondingly represent biot s theory and the present study evidently an excellent agreement can be found from the comparison between these two theoretical estimations as opposed to the semi permeable case see also fig 2 in lo et al 2020 the dimensionless pore water pressure in fig 2 exhibits a symmetric feature for the fully permeable case because the top and bottom boundaries are completely drainable as an illustrative example of the capability of our model numerical computations for p 1 z t p 2 z t and p 2 z t in eqs 6 and 8 as well as s t and s t in eq 9 are carried out in matlab for a double layer soil system where the lower layer consists of saturated clay and the upper layer is composed of unsaturated sand table 1 lists the elasticity coefficients and hydraulic parameters necessary for numerical calculations taken from lo et al 2017 the fitting coefficients in eq 10 for the water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity function corresponding to unsaturated sand or clay respectively are obtained from rawls et al 1992 as summarized in table 2 one central issue in the present study is to inspect how the boundary drainage condition affects the hydromechanical interaction between the solid skeleton and the interstitial fluids in a two layer soil system a cross plot of the relationship between the dimensionless pore water pressure p 2 p and depth for such a system as a function of elapsed time t 1 min 1 h and 1 day and initial water saturation s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 in the upper unsaturated sand under the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions is shown in fig 3 the former is represented by the circle whereas the solid line is used to depict the latter one can see that irrespective of whether the boundary drainage condition is semi permeable or fully permeable the excess pore water pressure dissipates almost completely in the upper layer unsaturated sand owing to its higher water hydraulic conductivity however the lower layer saturated clay under the semi permeable case still contains a sufficient amount of excess pore water pressure until t 1 hour but then the full dissipation of excess pore water pressure is almost achieved as the boundaries are fully permeable the distribution of the dimensionless pore air pressure along depth in the upper unsaturated sand under the fully permeable case is graphically illustrated in fig 4 it can be observed that the excess pore air pressurehas been quickly drained outthrough the top surface the total settlement induced in the upper and lower layers is portrayed in fig 5 with the time axis plotted logarithmically the discrepancy in total settlement in the upper layer due to changes in initial water saturation is negligible 10 3 m as shown in fig 5 a this can be physically interpreted from eq 9 that the total settlement is strongly dependent on the excess pore water and air pressures as shown in figs 3 and 4 variations in these dimensionless pore fluid pressures caused by various moisture contents are very small 0 03 the same observation holds for the lower layer in fig 5 b an additional physical implication behind it is that since the upper unsaturated soil layer has a much higher hydraulic conductivity the total settlement in the lower saturated soil exhibits the same trend as it behaves in a single layer system this is a direct consequence of the fact that the excess pore water pressure in the upper layer dissipates very fast thus allowing unrestricted drainageof water in the lower layer through the top boundary in order to gain more physical insight into the effect of soil texture on the deformation pressure response of a two layer soil system to a vertical surface constant load an opposite two layer configuration i e an upper unsaturated clay and a lower saturated sand is next investigated in figs 6 8 fig 6 presents the comparison for the dimensionless pore water pressure versus depth with respect to initial water saturation and elapsed time between the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions it is evident that the distribution of the dimensionless pore water pressure against depth is very different from that in fig 3 in fig 6 the distribution in the upper layer essentially reveals a half parabolic shape irrespective of the semi permeable and fully permeable boundary drainage conditions however the distribution becomes very sensitive to boundary drainage effect in the proximity above the interface and has a very apparent difference between the fully permeable and semi permeable cases as a result two distinct distributions caused by boundary drainage effect are developed in the lower layer the dimensionless pore water pressure appears as an inclined line that rises as the depth increases under the fully permeable case whereas the dimensionless pore water pressure is principally independent of the depth and remains a straight line under the semi permeable case a particular attention should be directed on the curve that describes the excess pore water pressure and depth around the interface in fig 6 for the fully permeable case where both top and bottom surfaces are pervious for water drainage the dissipation of excess pore water pressure in the lower layer saturated sand is much faster than that in upper layer unsaturated clay since sand has a higher hydraulic conductivity consequently a substantial alteration in excess pore water pressure occurs across the interface thus creating a sudden change in pore water pressure gradient at the interface leading to a positive pressure slope for the curve there according to eq 4 5 that states the continuity of water flow flux the water pressure gradient right below the interface should be two orders of magnitude less than that right above the interface since the permeability in clay upper layer is two orders of magnitude less than that in sand lower layer however a reverse trend is observed in the semi permeable case the excess pore water pressure in the lower layer is greater because only the top surface permits water to drain out thus instead resulting in a negative pressure slope at the interface with elapsed time aside from the boundary drainage effect another important physical basis behind the discrepancy in figs 3 and 6 is because of the existence of different values of the loading efficiencies γ 2 and γ 2 in the upper and lower zones since clay is entirely saturated the loading efficiency takes a numerical value of around unity whereas it becomes 0 21 0 20 and 0 30 as s 2 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 lo and lee 2015 therefore for the fully permeable case when clay resides in the lower layer with full water saturation it sustains more excess pore water pressure so that an approximately parabolic shape occurs in fig 3 at the early stage t 1 min as opposed to a half parabolic shape with less excess pore water pressure in fig 6 where it is under partial water saturation in the upper layer on the other hand sand has the loading efficiency of 0 02 0 03 0 06 and 0 99 corresponding to s 2 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 lo and lee 2015 a significant difference in the loading efficiency exists for sand as it is under the full or partial saturation as a consequence the excess pore water pressure dissipates very fast as sand is located in the upper unsaturated layer a straight line shape in fig 3 but it still carries certain excess pore water pressure in the lower saturated layer an inclined line shape in fig 6 under the fully permeable case the effect of boundary drainage condition is not obvious as the upper layer constitutes unsaturated sand while the lower layer is composed of saturated clay this is because the excess pore water and air pressures in figs 3 and 4 fully permeable case take very similar values to those in figs 3 and 4 in lo et al 2020 semi permeable case except at the early stages t 1 min and 1 hr accordingly it follows from eq 9 that both cases have very similar total settlement which is not really affected by changes in boundary drainage condition conversely those changes indeed give an impact on the total settlement if sand is placed in the lower layer as indicated from fig 8 b in the current study and fig 8 b in lo et al 2020 more total settlement is induced in the fully permeable case during the time we examined since more excess pores water pressure has been dissipated 5 conclusions the essential physical element underlying the present study is the unified illustration of how the intimate interactions between deformable porous framework and compressible interstitial fluids within each stratum in a natural double layer soil are affected by variations in the spatial texture stratification degree of water saturation and boundary drainage condition as the layered soil is acted upon by an external load or driven by pore fluid pressure gradient this intricate phenomenon is exactly modeled by a rigorous theoretical framework described by a well defined boundary value problem eqs 1 5 for a two layer soil system that comprises an unsaturated zone overlying a saturated zone under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions the framework that we develop is quite general which thus readily allows astraightforward extension to a multiple layer soil system under partial or full saturation subject to either semi permeable or fully permeable boundary drainage conditions we show that the closed form exact analytical solution for the boundary value problem is traceable by means of the introduction of laplace transformation in the temporal domain the solution derived for the excess pore water and air pressures along with the total settlement eq 6 takes a much longer mathematical expression than that obtained for the semi permeable case eq 16 in lo et al 2020 implying more physical mechanisms responsible for the coupling process between solid deformation and fluid flow under fully permeable boundary drainage conditions our analytical solution is of practical significance to serve as an excellent basis to validate benchmark numerical codes for the development of more robust computational models the present study makes apparent the point that the distribution of excess pore water pressure versus depth due to the stratification effect is sensitive to the boundary drainage condition the slope of the curve describing the distribution at the interface varies from negative under the semi permeable drainage at the top surface case to positive under the fully permeable case as the lower saturated layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity this gradient change is not obvious when the hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer is smaller credit

4739,flash flood is considered as one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide especially in tropical countries where tropical cyclones with torrential rains are recurrent problems yearly therefore an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent avoid and minimize damages associated with flash floods the aim of this research is to propose a new state of the art model based on hybridizing quantum particle swarm optimization qpso and the credal decision tree cdt ensemble namely the qpso cdtreeens model for spatial prediction of the flash flood the concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the cdt established through the random subspace ensemble therein qpso is integrated to optimize the three parameters the subspace size number of trees and the maximum depth of trees a district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north western mountainous area of vietnam was selected as a case study in this regard a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from sentinel 1 c band sar images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model the result shows that the qpso cdt ens model performed well overall accuracy 90 4 kappa coefficient 0 807 and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping among the ten factors the land use land cover lulc the slope the curvature and the twi are the most important indicators we conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision makers in sustainable land use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies keywords flash flood quantum pso decision tree random subspace tropical cyclone 1 introduction flash flooding is a common hazard and has considerable impacts on the environment and human well being its effects are increasing due to changing climate conditions such as in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation land use and land cover lulc dynamics in general as a result of a complicated interaction among meteorological berghuijs et al 2014 berghuijs and woods 2016 hydrological and hydraulic phenomena alizadeh et al 2020 flash foods are characterized by a short response time without warning they are frequently followed by other risks such as landslides and debris flows resulting in severe damage to people and property bubeck and thieken 2018 peduzzi 2017 ward et al 2017 it has previously been observed that a total loss of over 50 billion us dollars owed to flash flooding disasters in 2013 wasko and sharma 2017 with the rapid increase in extreme weather events and anthropogenic activities it is predicted that the potential damage to flash floods is expected to reach 1 trillion us dollars by 2050 bubeck and thieken 2018 hartnett and nash 2017 therefore the issue of flash floods has received considerable critical attention especially in tropical cyclone regions literature review shows that real time forecasting flood inundation maps are crucial for flood disasters managements chang et al 2018 2014 sarhadi et al 2012 however the absence of high spatial and temporal resolutions of hydro geomorphological data is an obstacle for deriving the reliability of the inundation forecasting hou et al 2020 the current literature review indicates that satellite based remote sensing derived from multispectral and synthetic aperture radar sar data have been widely used for flooding detection and flood susceptibility mapping khosravi et al 2018 kwak 2017 li et al 2018 schlaffer et al 2015 tong et al 2018 multispectral remote sensing data such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat imagery have been utilized to generate flooding maps pinheiro et al 2007 tong et al 2018 compared to optical sensors sar sensors have been proven their ability to penetrate clouds and heavy rainfall as well as to archive day night data which play an essential role under flood events mason et al 2010 pham et al 2019 schlaffer et al 2015 among a wide range number of sar data sentinel 1 sensor operated by the european space agency esa in c band sar images with a wavelength of 5 6 cm which is available free of charge on the sentinel data hub of the esa offers the possibility to acquire day and night data malenovský et al 2012 torres et al 2012 however prior studies have been mainly used the sentinel 1 data for mapping forest types and biomass chen et al 2017 pham et al 2020b monitoring lulc change whyte et al 2018 classifying crop types mansaray et al 2017 sonobe et al 2017 only several studies have been attempted to detect flash flood areas and map its change using the sentinel 1 c sar data in vietnam resulting in a complete lack of available data for mapping flash flood damage in vietnam thus selecting the best approaches using remote sensing data for mapping and detecting flash floods is highly necessary for national planning in disaster mitigation strategies vietnam is considered as one of the most vulnerable countries to weather related disasters especially flash floods extensive research has shown that the damage of flash flood disasters might cost millions of us dollars and numerous victims annually luo et al 2018 vanderlinden et al 2017 in an analysis the central steering committee on natural disaster prevention and control reported that there were 250 catastrophic flash flood events from 2000 to 2015 causing approximately 779 deaths 426 injuries damage to 109 700 houses and 75 000 ha of agriculture being severe flooding inundated to improve flash flood warnings the public and government have serious efforts to reform or establish new policies and regulations on natural disaster prevention such as law 33 2013 qh13 on natural disaster prevention 2013 directive no 19 ct ttg of the prime minister dated july 13 2018 the prevention of flash floods and landslides 2018 resolution 76 nq cp the prevention of natural disasters 2018 meanwhile data from recent studies suggest that extreme precipitation events are likely more frequently and intensely carpenter et al 2018 feng et al 2016 while lulc has undergone a significant change as a result of increased urbanization the accelerated expansion of agriculture and deforestation in flood prone regions duong et al 2018 siswanto and francés 2019 resulting in possibly increasing intensification of future flash floods in more areas in order to cope with these hazards there is a special need for flash flood estimating using free of charge earth observation eo data and cost effectiveness which could assist policymakers in the disaster prevention campaign toward the sustainable development of society our review of the current literature shows that methods used for flash floods detection are diversified ranging from the enhancements of modeling methods decision aid systems and scientific observations to non parametric approaches in other words numerous studies have applied a variety of recent modernizations in data accessibility computational sciences and algorithm improvement to more consistently map flash floods the most technological advancements are the professional involvement of eo data geographic information system gis and machine learning techniques in the cost effective prediction of spatial flood prone areas nguyen et al 2020a tien bui et al 2019 2017 recently deep neural networks have illustrated outstanding performance in different complex issues including the estimation of flash flooding probability for instance tien bui et al 2020 attempted to develop a deep learning neural network ingesting various input features for mapping flash flood susceptibility in lao cai province vietnam meanwhile it is now well established from a large number of studies that the performance of deep learning neural networks is dramatically enhanced bui et al 2019a termeh et al 2018 if they are optimized by meta heuristic approaches such as the firefly algorithm yang 2010 and the particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 meta heuristic methods are fundamental optimization due to their stability and simplistic processes these approaches can accurately and consistently map flash flood prone regions underpinning the sustainable management of flash flood disaster prevention more recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence ai domains have resulted in the development of innovative techniques such as quantum particle swarm optimization qpso and the credal decision tree cdt ensemble for classification and regression tasks however to date there is a limited number of studies explored these advanced techniques combined with the eo data for susceptibility mapping and detecting flash floods especially in tropical areas therefore in this work we aim to partially fill this gap in literature by proposing a novel hybrid qpso and cdt ensemble based method for predicting flash flood inundation in a mountainous region located in north western vietnam using geospatial data derived from sentinel 1 c band sar imagery this work may contribute to the implementation of action plans under the national strategy on climate change and the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc at the provincial and regional levels 2 theory of the algorithms used in this study 2 1 random subspace random subspace rs is a robust ensemble framework proposed by ho 1998 for separating the training dataset into several subsets and then each subset is used to generate a classifier the final model is obtained by aggregating all classifiers consider a flash flood dataset d with n sample d x i y i x i r m y i 1 0 and i 1 n x is a matrix that consists of m flash flood indicators whereas y is the output class with 1 is the flood class and 0 is the non flood class rs will generate l subsets from d and l is called a subspace of d herein each subset has m indicators m m and is called the subspace size subsequently each l will be used to build a classifier using a base machine learning algorithm through a training process in this research context we consider the cdtree as the base algorithm for the flash flood modeling the final ensemble model is derived by ensembling all cdtree classifier the performance of the ensemble model is influenced by both l and m besides because the cdtree algorithm is employed therefore the parameter of the maximum depth of the tree mdtree is required to turn as a result a total of three parameters m l and mdtree are needed to be determined and they are optimized by the quantum pso algorithm which is described in the next section 2 2 credal decision tree decision tree which is developed based on decision theory has proven to be powerful machine learning algorithms in geospatial data sciences such as flash flood bui et al 2019b costache and bui 2020 landslides dou et al 2019 tsangaratos and ilia 2016 and others ghatkar et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 both for classification and regression problems among the decision trees the c4 5 classification and regression trees cart and random forest are considered the most popular machine learning rokach 2016 however imprecise and uncertainty in geospatial data sources are issues that cause adverse effects on the model performance tavana et al 2016 credal decision tree cdtree is proposed by abellan and moral abellán and moral 2003 the key difference of this algorithm compared to the other decision tree algorithms is the criterion used to select features i e flash flood indicators for splitting at the tree nodes herein the criterion is based on the imprecise probabilities and uncertainties of the credal sets therefore the algorithm is capable of handling noisy data mantas and abellán 2014 using the flash flood dataset d the credal set k d which is a subset of d is generated as below 1 k d p k p k fl n fl n s n fl s n s where n is the sample size f l is a flash flood indicator n f l is the frequent value and s is a parameter k d is employed to build the cdtree using the maximum of entropy function as follows 2 h k d max h p k p k k d where h is the shannon entropy function shannon 1948 and h is the total uncertainty a more detailed explanation of the cdtree can be found in mantas and abellán 2014 2 3 quantum particle swarm optimization qpso algorithm the qpso algorithm proposed by coelho 2010 is a newer version of the pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 qpso is an integration of the quantum dynamics schweizer 2001 and the pso to form a new solution for machine learning optimization which has proven its validity of optimizing parameters in various problems coelho 2010 ding et al 2018 li et al 2015 however qpso has not considered for flash flood modeling the salient features of the qpso coelho 2010 are presented below step 1 establishing the searching space for three parameters m l and mdtree and initializing the population npop of the swarm then randomly placing the population in the space the three parameters become the three coordinates of each particle and are a solution for the flash flood model step 2 evaluating the fitness of each particle pbest by using a defined objective function see the objective function designed for this research in section 4 2 then comparing the pbest of all particles in the swarm to derive the global best gbest step 3 updating the position x and velocity v of each particle in the swarm using the following equations 3 v i it 1 w v i it c 1 r d 1 p i it x i it c 2 r d 2 p g it x i it 4 x i it 1 p β meanbest i x i i t l n 1 g i f k 5 x i it 1 p β meanbest i x i i t l n 1 g i f k 5 where w is the weight factor uses for updating the velocity c 1 and c 2 are learning factors g is the index of the best particle in the swarm r d 1 and r d 2 are values 0 1 p i is the best position of the i th practice in each iteration m e a n b e s t is the global point which is computed using eq 5 and g and k are values 0 1 5 meanbest 1 n p o p d 1 n p o p p g d i t where it 1 2 itmax denotes the training iteration and g is the index of the best particle in the swarm step 4 run the loop until the maximum of the iteration is reach to find the particle with the gbest value then the position of this particle with three coordinates m l and mdtree was extracted as the optimized solution of the final flash flood model 3 study area and flash flood data 3 1 descriptions of the study area the study area is located in the tran yen district 21o31 48 n 21o47 38 n 104 38 37 e 104 59 00 e belonging to yen bai province lies in the north western mountainous region of vietnam fig 1 the studied site covers an area of 629 km2 with complex topography steep slopes and narrow valleys the topography is highly heterogeneous with high mountains ranges in the north n and southwest sw and small valleys expanding from the northwest nw to the southeast se the elevation ranges from 16 1 m to 1566 2 m above sea level in this study high slope areas 15 account for more than 72 of the total area while average slopes 5 15 and lower slopes 5 cover nearly 20 and 8 respectively with complex terrain the study area has a dense and evenly distribution of streams and river systems characterizing by small narrow and steep slopes these characteristics of the river system in this area may reinforce the occurrence of extreme natural hazards especially flash floods and landslides for climatic conditions the tran yen district is located in the tropical monsoon region with a yearly average temperature and rainfall ranging from 23 24 c and 1500 2200 mm respectively the humidity is relatively high 83 87 making a good condition for forest and agriculture development the geology in this area consists of different formations dominated by van chan song hong quaternary and other geological foundations the land coverage is mainly occupied by forest lands grasslands orchard lands and croplands contributing nearly 90 of the total lulc in the study area these geographical conditions have a strong influence on the historical flash flood events in this area 3 2 flash flood data 3 2 1 flash flood inventory map generating a flash flood inventory map is the first and vital step in establishing the spatial geodatabase of flash flood susceptibility this map is often created based on historical flood events collection satellite image processing field surveying investigations and analyzing remote sensing datasets arabameri et al 2020 costache et al 2020 as flash floods generally occur in a short time with highly heterogeneous spatial distribution accuracy preparation of the flash flood inventory map requires different information in this analysis a flash flood inventory map with 1698 polygons was extracted from the inventory database of the state funded flash flood project of vietnam nguyen et al 2020a herein these flooded locations were derived using sentinel 1 c band remote sensing data from 2016 to 2019 and change detection techniques besides a collection of historical flood events from field surveys 3 2 2 flash flood indicators as a complex phenomenon the flash flood taking place in a certain watershed depends not only on different influencing factors related to hydro meteorological conditions but also on geographical characteristics khosravi et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 in order to construct accurately flash flood susceptibility maps it is often required insights into flood indicators related to historical flash flood events for this purpose we analyzed ten conditioning factors including slope aspect elevation curvature topographic wetness index twi rainfall river density soil type lithology and lulc which have associated directly or indirectly to flash flood events occurred in this study area these factors were prepared using a grid cell size of 30 m 30 m based on data collection from field surveys local authorities and sar remote sensing data slope of the ground surface influences on different hydrological processes including infiltration and runoff flow making it becomes a crucial factor in the prediction of flash floods florinsky 2016 nguyen et al 2020b the water flow originating from high slope areas usually has high energy leading to faster flow movement downward than lower slope areas therefore heavy rainfall taking place in steep slope areas may cause a high probability of flash flood occurrences for this study the slope layer was prepared using a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m which was constructed from on the topographic maps available with a scale of 1 50 000 from the yen bai province authority the slope values range from 0 to 71 5 in which high slopes are in the north and southwest areas while the lower slopes distribute along the red river following northwest southeast direction fig 2 a aspect is an angle between the north direction and the horizontal projection which measures the direction of gravity driven flows florinsky 2016 the aspect has a significant influence on soil water balance e g soil moisture ragab et al 2003 because it affects insolation and evapotranspiration shaping characteristics of flash flood flows therefore the aspect has been widely used for flash flood modeling bui et al 2019a costache and bui 2020 nhu et al 2020 norbiato et al 2008 yates et al 2000 in the study area aspect which was derived from the above dem was built throughout eight classes including north n 337 5 360 northeast ne 22 5 67 5 east e 67 5 112 5 southeast se 112 5 157 5 south s 157 5 202 5 southwest sw 202 5 247 5 west w 247 5 292 5 northwest nw 292 5 337 5 fig 2b historical flash flood events were overplayed in the aspect layer indicating more flash flood occurrences in the w the nw and the n directions the elevation often regulates microclimatic conditions and the development of vegetable coverages in specific areas having a great effect on forming runoff flows bui et al 2019b tien bui et al 2020 moreover high elevation and wide derivatives coupled with fewer forest covers will force runoff flow moving faster than low elevations nguyen et al 2020b the elevation map fig 2c in the study area was created from the dem above the elevation map shows that high mountainous areas greater than70 m above sea level are mainly in the northern and southwestern parts in contrast the lowland areas distribute along small valleys and the red river the changes in attitude sharply from high to low elevation areas along the streams and the red river may increase the probability of flash floods in these locations the curvature is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of direction of a point that moves on the curve in which larger curvature will result in the larger change rate florinsky 2016 rejith et al 2019 curvature can be concave positive convex negative and flat zero which affects differently on runoff flow system florinsky 2016 nguyen et al 2020b the curvature layer was created based on the dem model in the study area accordingly the curvature shows a relatively wide variation ranging from 26 7 to 41 3 in which most of the positive values are in tops of mountainous areas while negative values are in steep slope areas fig 2d in this study it is worth noting that most of the historical flash floods occurred in the steep slopes with positive curvature indicating these locations may have a high potentiality to take place next flash flood events topographic wetness index twi reflects terrain derived attributes which is a major factor controlling soil moisture affecting plant distribution and diversity patterns moeslund et al 2013 mohamedou et al 2019 therefore the twi is recognized as an indirect factor controlling runoff processes in a certain area the twi value was estimated based on the dem model as the following equation below beven and kirkby 1979 tehrany et al 2014 1 twi i n a s tan β where a s denotes an upslope area and β is the slope angle at the pixel as shown in fig 2e the twi varied from 2 0 to 21 6 in which the high values 10 distribute to along the lowland areas leading to high capability of flash flood occurrence flash flood often happens in a small watershed with high rainfall intensity guardiola albert et al 2020 hence rainfall is recognized as the triggering indicator for flash flood occurrence gaume et al 2004 tien bui et al 2020 the magnitude effects of rainfall on flash flood occurrences depend on intensity duration frequency and spatial distribution although each flash flood event occurring in a certain area depends not only on each rainfall event but in accordance with other factors the rainfall and its characteristics are a primary driving force behind any flash flood events similar to many mountainous areas in the northwestern region of vietnam bui et al 2019b nguyen et al 2020b pham et al 2017 this study area has heavy rainfall dominantly occurs in the rainy season coupled with complex topographical conditions leading to more flash floods and landslides for this study we prepared the rainfall layer using three days of maximum rainfall events during the last five years from the local and regional monitoring systems as presented in fig 2f rainfall amount distributes unevenly with high rainfall along the lowland area from the northwest southeast direction indicating a high probability of flash floods in these areas river density plays an essential role in the storage and transfers of water in a watershed therefore it is an important factor influencing the water flow leaving out of a watershed pallard et al 2009 in general high river density will cause more flood expansion khosravi et al 2018 for this study the river density layer was created from the river network system derived from the topographic maps 1 50 000 mentioned above accordingly high river density greater than 5 km km2 distributes along with the central parts of the study areas with a maximum of 10 6 km km2 soil type has a strong effect on infiltration holding water and formation of subsurface flow therefore it plays a vital role in runoff generation jenks et al 2017 sangati et al 2009 each type of soil has different influences on the process of runoff generation and flash flood occurrences because of its difference in textures and hydraulic properties lovat et al 2019 for example a soil type with low permeable such as clay silt loam and mixed clay silt could quickly generate overland flow compared to high permeable soil types such as sand and gravel this study area consists of nine soil types of which the ycmr soil occupies more than 85 followed by the bor and the ycr soils fig 2h these soil types were derived from the soil texture map 1 50 000 scale from nguyen et al 2020a it is widely recognized that each lithological type has a different physical characteristic e g texture grain size and composition which affects directly and indirectly on infiltration rate generation of runoff flow hence lithology is often considered as a major factor for flash flood prediction the lithology map in this study area was built using the geological and mineral resources map with a scale of 1 50 000 from the department of natural resources and environment donre yen bai province ngo et al 2018 there are nine lithological types in the study area table 1 in which van chan song chay quaternary and other formations cover for more than 90 of the total area lulc is widely accepted as a vital flood indicator controlling hydrological processes in a watershed such as infiltration base flow overland flow and the spatial distribution of flood events barasa and perera 2018 sangati et al 2009 for example high vegetable coverage may increase infiltration rates and reduce the runoff coefficient leading to slowdown overland flow and reducing flood velocity armenakis et al 2017 conversely flash flood events often occur in the less vegetable coverage areas such as bare land and urbanized areas with high flood risks therefore lulc is considered the main factor in mapping flash flood susceptibility in this study the lulc map was generated using sentinel 1 c band sar data with a random forest algorithm nguyen et al 2020b eight lulc types were classified and identified in the study area including bare land crop areas forest areas grassland orchard land paddy rice urban and built up and water fig 2j it is noted that four main lulc types forest land grassland crop areas and orchard land account for more than 80 of the total area distributing unevenly in the study area forest land is observed mainly in the mountainous areas with high slopes whilst bare land and grassland are found in the lowland areas the uneven distribution of lulc coupled with high river density may lead to a high probability of flash flood occurrences in this area 4 proposed qpso cdtreeens model for tropical cyclone induced flash flood susceptible mapping this section describes the proposed qpso cdtreeens model for tropical cyclone induced flash flood susceptible mapping it should be noted that the sentinel 1 sar images for flash flood inventories and flood indicators were processed using the sentinel application platform snap toolbox and the spatial analysis toolbox in arcgis desktop 10 7 1 respectively the qpso algorithm was developed by coelho 2010 whereas the qpso cdtreeens model was programmed by the authors in the matlab environment using the matlab weka classifiers dunham 2020 besides a python tool was written to transform the flash flood susceptibility index into a gis format for visualizing the final map in the arcgis desktop the conceptual framework of the proposed qpso cdtreeens is shown in fig 3 4 1 flash flood database the first step is to establish a flash flood database for this research which consists of 10 input indicators slope aspect elevation curvature twi rainfall river density soil type lithology and lulc and 1698 flooded locations we employed arcgis desktop 10 7 1 to construct the database utilizing the environmental systems research institute esri file geodatabase format all indicators were converted into a raster format with a spatial resolution of 30 m and transferred to numerical values using a technique described in tien bui et al 2019 since the flash flood modeling in this work was designated as two class pattern recognition therefore a total of 1698 locations were generated outside the flood polygons in the study areas then a sampling process was conducted for 3396 locations to derive values of the ten indicators above finally the results were randomly split into a ratio of 70 30 for the training and the validation datasets 4 2 objective function for the qpso cdtreeens model as mentioned above the 3 dimension searching space was established for optimizing three parameters m l and mdtree for the qpso cdtreeens model in order to assess each combined solution of m l and mdtree an objective function bui et al 2019a could be used in this research mean absolute error mae was adopted for designing the objective function as following 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y o u t y where y o u t is the output value of the qpso cdtreeens model y is the original value and n is the sample size used 4 3 setting up and training the qpso cdtreeens model the process of setting up the qpso cdtreeens model consists of two steps the first one is to integrate the cdtree algorithm into the rs framework then three parameters m l and mdtree were specified to connect the qpso the second step is to configure the qpso for optimizing these three parameters thus the searching space with three dimensions was established as the subspace size m 1 10 because the flash flood database has only ten input indicator the number of cdtree l 1 1000 and the maximum depth of the tree mdtree 1 100 the maximum number of iterations of 1000 and the swarm of 50 particles were used the other qpso parameters for the optimization were set the default as in coelho 2010 4 4 performance evaluation in order to assess the performance of the qpso cdtreeens model the widely statistical metrics for the two class pattern classification tien bui and hoang 2017 based flash flood modeling were used including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the classification accuracy acc the kappa coefficient the positive and the negative predictive values ppv and npv the sensitivity and the specificity as suggested in the prior studies because the descriptions of the above statistical metrics and the rationale explanations behind for using them for flood modeling have been well documented in the literature i e chapi et al 2017 costache and bui 2020 darabi et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 tien bui and hoang 2017 therefore these descriptions and explanations are not repeated here again 4 5 role of the flash flood indicators the contribution of the ten flash flood indicators in this analysis was accessed using the wrapper algorithm kohavi and john 1997 with 5 fold cross validation using three optimized values m l and mdtree found section 4 3 for the qpso cdtreeens model first the wrapper algorithm measured the performance of the model again called the full model with the full set of 10 indicators in the next step determining all possibilities of combined subsets of these indicators through a running loop then comparing the performance of the resulting sub model with the full model finally the role of each indicator was derived based on the performance difference between the full model and the sub models to measure the performance several statistical metrics were employed including the acc the auc and the mae besides the f measure hand and christen 2018 was also considered the reason behind the use of several metrics is to check if the ranking of the indications is influenced by the metrics used which can avoid potential bias on the conclusion of the role of the flash flood indications 4 6 the usability of the qpso cdtreeens model and compiling the flash flood susceptibility map the usability of the qpso cdtreeens for flash flood modeling was assessed and confirmed through a comparison of its performance with that of popular machine learning algorithms including the support vector machines svm the classification and regression tree cart the logistic regression lr and the best first tree bftree models in addition the performance of the standard alone cdt was also included using the flash flood training samples the svm model with the radial basis function kernel was built where its parameters gamma 0 358 and c 52 were determined using the grid search method friedrichs and igel 2005 pham et al 2020a whereas for the cdt the optimized parameter obtained in section 4 3 was used for the other algorithms the default parameters in weka were utilized when the qpso cdtreeens model was successfully trained and validated the final model was used to compute the susceptibility indices for the entire tran yen district finally these indices were used to generate the susceptibility map in arcgis desktop 5 results 5 1 model training and validating with 1000 iterations the qpso cdtreeens was successfully trained in the training phase and its three optimized parameters were found as m 6 l 69 and mdtree 19 the detailed performance of the model is shown in table 2 we observed that the overall classification accuracy acc of the qpso cdtreeens model is 87 8 indicating that the goodness of fit of the model is high the kappa coefficient is 0 755 denoting that the model performs 75 5 better than chance the detailed performance of the model table 2 on the two classes flood and non flood described by the ppv 90 7 the npv 84 9 the sensitivity 85 7 and the specificity 90 1 indicates that the proposed qpso cdtreeens model performs well in the training phase the auc of 0 948 demonstrates that the predictive performance of the proposed model reaches 94 8 to confirm whether the proposed qpso cdtreeens model works well with the remaining dataset the validation dataset which was not utilized in the training phase was used to check the prediction performance of the model it can be clearly seen from table 2 that high metrics values with an acc of 90 4 and the kappa index of 0 807 were observed using the qpso cdtreeens model showing that the proposed model performs well in the validating phase besides the proposed model achieves good performance and balance when dealing the flood and non flood classes ppv 90 8 npv 90 0 sensitivity 90 1 and specificity 90 7 overall with auc 0 949 the predictive performance capability of the model is confirmed at 94 9 5 2 the relative importance of the indicators the contribution of the ten indicators to the flash flood model was assessed using the wrapper algorithm mentioned in section 4 5 the results in table 3 show that the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi are the most important indicators for the predictive performance of the qpso cdtreeens model in all cases they are followed by the elevation the rainfall and the river density factors the three indicators the soil type the lithology and the aspect have the lowest contributions to the model in the case when using the mae it is observed that the soil type indicator 0 015 is ranked slightly higher than that of the lithology factor 0 013 however the inverse ranking is observed for the acc the auc and the f measure cases the final ranking of all indicators is depicted in table 3 5 3 the applicability of the qpso cdtreeens model the applicability of the proposed model was assessed through the comparison with the five well known ml models svm cart lr cdt and bftree it can be seen from table 2 that all ml models show satisfactory results in the training phase the highest performance is observed by the cart model acc 86 8 kappa 0 735 and auc 0 910 followed by the bftree model acc 86 1 kappa 0 722 and auc 0 876 the cdt model acc 85 8 kappa 0 716 and auc 0 916 and the svm model acc 85 1 kappa 0 702 and auc 0 851 in contrast to these models the lr model acc 83 1 kappa 0 662 and auc 0 883 has the lowest performance except the svm model ppv 90 1 npv 80 2 sensitivity 81 9 and specificity 99 0 the other ml models show a balance in handling on the flood and non flood samples overall the performance of the cart model is likely more similar to the qpso cdtreeens model whereas the performances of other ml models are relatively lower table 2 regarding the predictive performance which was assessed in the validation phase the results reveal that all five models have good prediction performances the highest one is observed by the bftree model acc 88 4 kappa 0 768 and auc 0 0 887 and the cart model acc 88 2 kappa 0 764 and auc 0 815 followed by the cdt model acc 87 0 kappa 0 741 and auc 0 926 on the other hand the svm model had the lowest performance acc 85 8 kappa 0 715 and auc 0 926 followed by the lr model acc 85 9 kappa 0 717 and auc 0 906 looking at the ppv the npv the sensitivity the specificity values in the validation phase table 2 all five models have a good balance processing the samples of the flood and non flood classes nevertheless the overall prediction performance of the five models is lower than that of the proposed qpso cdtreeens model in order to confirm whether the prediction capability of the qpso cdtreeens model is statistically better than those of the five models the paired samples sign test de muth 2014 mara and cribbie 2012 was further used the null hypothesis h0 indicates no statistical difference between the predicted values of the qpso cdtreeens and those of other ml models then z value at 5 of significance and p value were computed for each model pair if the z value is larger than 1 96 or less than 1 96 and the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected and the prediction performance of the two flash flood models is a statistically significant difference the results of the paired samples sign test for all the ml models are shown in table 4 it could be seen that the z value of all the model pairs is larger than 1 96 and the p value in all cases is less than 0 05 indicating that the performance of the qpso cdtreeens model is a statistically significant difference 5 4 flash flood susceptibility map since the qpso cdtreeens model produces the best capability of predicting flash flood the model was adopted to compute susceptibility indices for the whole area of the tran yen district the index result was used to generate the flash flood susceptibility map in fig 4 the map was interpolated and presented in six classes ranging from the extremely low to the very high classes to determine thresholds for dividing the indices into these classes a graph curve see in fig 4 was constructed by overlaying the 1698 flooded locations over the susceptibility map then the percentage of flash flood map and percentage of flooded locations were computed to build the curve the results show the very high 5 the high 5 the moderate 10 the low 15 the very low 15 and the extremely low 50 were derived table 5 6 discussions flash flood is still considered to be one of the most dangerous natural hazards worldwide due to its high speed of water runoff short time occurrence and sediment transporting which cause sudden disruptions to infrastructures property and human lives ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 forero ortiz et al 2020 li et al 2020 although various attempts have been made it is still difficult to predict accurately causing challenges for local authorities in developing measures for flash floods in this research a novel machine learning ensemble model namely the qpso cdtreeens model was proposed and tested in a high frequency flash flood area the qpso cdtreeens model is an integration of cdtree random subspace and qpso to form a powerful ensemble model in the last two decades decision tree inference models are become popular in natural hazard modeling due to the ability to handle complex geospatial data with high prediction performance however the prediction of the single decision tree can be improved if multiple trees are combined and integrated rokach 2016 the results in this research confirmed this statement where the qpso cdtreeens model yields the highest predictive performance and better than that of the single cdtree and the other well known ml models i e the svm the lr models the results in this research also indicate that the quality of the qpso cdtreeens model is heavily dependent on the three turning parameters the subspace size m the number of cdtrees l and the maximum depth of the cdtree mdtree therefore these parameters must be carefully considered to optimize these parameters the qpso was integrated to search and find the optimized values for them autonomously the qpso is a hybridization of the quantum mechanics theory and pso that has proven its efficiency in optimization problems coelho 2010 ding et al 2018 li et al 2015 consequently the high performance of the qpso cdtreeens model indicates that the qpso algorithm has successfully optimized three turning parameters thus through the training phase a total of 1000 possible combinations of m l and mdtree were explored and assessed to find the best qpso cdtreeens model this ensures that the found three parameters are optimized for the study area regarding the ten indicators their contributions to the flash flood model are clarified with the use of the wrapper algorithm the advantage of this algorithm is the ability to explore all possible combinations of indicators to evaluate their roles autonomously however this algorithm requires a pre defined statistic metrics for measuring the contribution of these indicators in this work four statistical metrics acc auc mae and f measure were used to rank these indicators indicating that the role of all indicators was objectively determined as a result the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi factors are the most important indicators in this research it is a reasonable result because deforestation nghiem 2013 in the last decade which modified the surface runoff nguyen et al 2016 has caused severe environmental problems in this district resulting in landslides pham et al 2018 and flash floods the slope the curvature and the twi are essential factors controlling the hydrological processes therefore they have a high contribution to the qpso cdtreeens model in contrast the aspect factor shows the lowest contribution to the model this is likely due to the distribution of the flooded locations in the aspect classes which is somewhat evenly 7 conclusions this research proposes a state of the art ensemble based learning model namely the qpso cdtreeens model for flash flood susceptibility mapping a geospatial database which consists of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons mainly derived from sentinel 1 c band sar images and 10 flash flood indicators computed from other sources at a high frequency tropical cyclone area in the northwest of vietnam was used to construct and to verify the proposed model based on the findings in this work some conclusions are given below the qpso cdtreeens which is integrated of the qpso the cdtree and the random subspace technique is capable of predicting flash flood with high accuracy the qpso is an efficient tool for autonomously searching the three parameters of the qpso cdtreeens model the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi factors are the essential indicators for the flash flood in this study area finally the predictive performance of the qpso cdtreeens model is statistically higher than those of the svm the cart the lr the cdt and the bftree models therefore the qpso cdtreeens provides a new tool which should be used for flash flood modeling and prediction in the tropics credit authorship contribution statement phuong thao thi ngo data curation methodology writing

4739,flash flood is considered as one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide especially in tropical countries where tropical cyclones with torrential rains are recurrent problems yearly therefore an accurate prediction of susceptible areas to flash floods is crucial for developing measures to prevent avoid and minimize damages associated with flash floods the aim of this research is to propose a new state of the art model based on hybridizing quantum particle swarm optimization qpso and the credal decision tree cdt ensemble namely the qpso cdtreeens model for spatial prediction of the flash flood the concept of the proposed model is to build a forest tree of the cdt established through the random subspace ensemble therein qpso is integrated to optimize the three parameters the subspace size number of trees and the maximum depth of trees a district suffered from a high frequency of flash floods in the north western mountainous area of vietnam was selected as a case study in this regard a geospatial database that includes a total of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons derived from sentinel 1 c band sar images and ten input indicators were used to construct and to verify the proposed model the result shows that the qpso cdt ens model performed well overall accuracy 90 4 kappa coefficient 0 807 and outperformed the five machine learning algorithms in flash flood susceptibility mapping among the ten factors the land use land cover lulc the slope the curvature and the twi are the most important indicators we conclude that the proposed model is a promising tool for flash flood susceptibility mapping in the tropics and may assist decision makers in sustainable land use planning in the national disaster mitigation strategies keywords flash flood quantum pso decision tree random subspace tropical cyclone 1 introduction flash flooding is a common hazard and has considerable impacts on the environment and human well being its effects are increasing due to changing climate conditions such as in the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation land use and land cover lulc dynamics in general as a result of a complicated interaction among meteorological berghuijs et al 2014 berghuijs and woods 2016 hydrological and hydraulic phenomena alizadeh et al 2020 flash foods are characterized by a short response time without warning they are frequently followed by other risks such as landslides and debris flows resulting in severe damage to people and property bubeck and thieken 2018 peduzzi 2017 ward et al 2017 it has previously been observed that a total loss of over 50 billion us dollars owed to flash flooding disasters in 2013 wasko and sharma 2017 with the rapid increase in extreme weather events and anthropogenic activities it is predicted that the potential damage to flash floods is expected to reach 1 trillion us dollars by 2050 bubeck and thieken 2018 hartnett and nash 2017 therefore the issue of flash floods has received considerable critical attention especially in tropical cyclone regions literature review shows that real time forecasting flood inundation maps are crucial for flood disasters managements chang et al 2018 2014 sarhadi et al 2012 however the absence of high spatial and temporal resolutions of hydro geomorphological data is an obstacle for deriving the reliability of the inundation forecasting hou et al 2020 the current literature review indicates that satellite based remote sensing derived from multispectral and synthetic aperture radar sar data have been widely used for flooding detection and flood susceptibility mapping khosravi et al 2018 kwak 2017 li et al 2018 schlaffer et al 2015 tong et al 2018 multispectral remote sensing data such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat imagery have been utilized to generate flooding maps pinheiro et al 2007 tong et al 2018 compared to optical sensors sar sensors have been proven their ability to penetrate clouds and heavy rainfall as well as to archive day night data which play an essential role under flood events mason et al 2010 pham et al 2019 schlaffer et al 2015 among a wide range number of sar data sentinel 1 sensor operated by the european space agency esa in c band sar images with a wavelength of 5 6 cm which is available free of charge on the sentinel data hub of the esa offers the possibility to acquire day and night data malenovský et al 2012 torres et al 2012 however prior studies have been mainly used the sentinel 1 data for mapping forest types and biomass chen et al 2017 pham et al 2020b monitoring lulc change whyte et al 2018 classifying crop types mansaray et al 2017 sonobe et al 2017 only several studies have been attempted to detect flash flood areas and map its change using the sentinel 1 c sar data in vietnam resulting in a complete lack of available data for mapping flash flood damage in vietnam thus selecting the best approaches using remote sensing data for mapping and detecting flash floods is highly necessary for national planning in disaster mitigation strategies vietnam is considered as one of the most vulnerable countries to weather related disasters especially flash floods extensive research has shown that the damage of flash flood disasters might cost millions of us dollars and numerous victims annually luo et al 2018 vanderlinden et al 2017 in an analysis the central steering committee on natural disaster prevention and control reported that there were 250 catastrophic flash flood events from 2000 to 2015 causing approximately 779 deaths 426 injuries damage to 109 700 houses and 75 000 ha of agriculture being severe flooding inundated to improve flash flood warnings the public and government have serious efforts to reform or establish new policies and regulations on natural disaster prevention such as law 33 2013 qh13 on natural disaster prevention 2013 directive no 19 ct ttg of the prime minister dated july 13 2018 the prevention of flash floods and landslides 2018 resolution 76 nq cp the prevention of natural disasters 2018 meanwhile data from recent studies suggest that extreme precipitation events are likely more frequently and intensely carpenter et al 2018 feng et al 2016 while lulc has undergone a significant change as a result of increased urbanization the accelerated expansion of agriculture and deforestation in flood prone regions duong et al 2018 siswanto and francés 2019 resulting in possibly increasing intensification of future flash floods in more areas in order to cope with these hazards there is a special need for flash flood estimating using free of charge earth observation eo data and cost effectiveness which could assist policymakers in the disaster prevention campaign toward the sustainable development of society our review of the current literature shows that methods used for flash floods detection are diversified ranging from the enhancements of modeling methods decision aid systems and scientific observations to non parametric approaches in other words numerous studies have applied a variety of recent modernizations in data accessibility computational sciences and algorithm improvement to more consistently map flash floods the most technological advancements are the professional involvement of eo data geographic information system gis and machine learning techniques in the cost effective prediction of spatial flood prone areas nguyen et al 2020a tien bui et al 2019 2017 recently deep neural networks have illustrated outstanding performance in different complex issues including the estimation of flash flooding probability for instance tien bui et al 2020 attempted to develop a deep learning neural network ingesting various input features for mapping flash flood susceptibility in lao cai province vietnam meanwhile it is now well established from a large number of studies that the performance of deep learning neural networks is dramatically enhanced bui et al 2019a termeh et al 2018 if they are optimized by meta heuristic approaches such as the firefly algorithm yang 2010 and the particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 meta heuristic methods are fundamental optimization due to their stability and simplistic processes these approaches can accurately and consistently map flash flood prone regions underpinning the sustainable management of flash flood disaster prevention more recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence ai domains have resulted in the development of innovative techniques such as quantum particle swarm optimization qpso and the credal decision tree cdt ensemble for classification and regression tasks however to date there is a limited number of studies explored these advanced techniques combined with the eo data for susceptibility mapping and detecting flash floods especially in tropical areas therefore in this work we aim to partially fill this gap in literature by proposing a novel hybrid qpso and cdt ensemble based method for predicting flash flood inundation in a mountainous region located in north western vietnam using geospatial data derived from sentinel 1 c band sar imagery this work may contribute to the implementation of action plans under the national strategy on climate change and the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc at the provincial and regional levels 2 theory of the algorithms used in this study 2 1 random subspace random subspace rs is a robust ensemble framework proposed by ho 1998 for separating the training dataset into several subsets and then each subset is used to generate a classifier the final model is obtained by aggregating all classifiers consider a flash flood dataset d with n sample d x i y i x i r m y i 1 0 and i 1 n x is a matrix that consists of m flash flood indicators whereas y is the output class with 1 is the flood class and 0 is the non flood class rs will generate l subsets from d and l is called a subspace of d herein each subset has m indicators m m and is called the subspace size subsequently each l will be used to build a classifier using a base machine learning algorithm through a training process in this research context we consider the cdtree as the base algorithm for the flash flood modeling the final ensemble model is derived by ensembling all cdtree classifier the performance of the ensemble model is influenced by both l and m besides because the cdtree algorithm is employed therefore the parameter of the maximum depth of the tree mdtree is required to turn as a result a total of three parameters m l and mdtree are needed to be determined and they are optimized by the quantum pso algorithm which is described in the next section 2 2 credal decision tree decision tree which is developed based on decision theory has proven to be powerful machine learning algorithms in geospatial data sciences such as flash flood bui et al 2019b costache and bui 2020 landslides dou et al 2019 tsangaratos and ilia 2016 and others ghatkar et al 2019 rahmati et al 2019 both for classification and regression problems among the decision trees the c4 5 classification and regression trees cart and random forest are considered the most popular machine learning rokach 2016 however imprecise and uncertainty in geospatial data sources are issues that cause adverse effects on the model performance tavana et al 2016 credal decision tree cdtree is proposed by abellan and moral abellán and moral 2003 the key difference of this algorithm compared to the other decision tree algorithms is the criterion used to select features i e flash flood indicators for splitting at the tree nodes herein the criterion is based on the imprecise probabilities and uncertainties of the credal sets therefore the algorithm is capable of handling noisy data mantas and abellán 2014 using the flash flood dataset d the credal set k d which is a subset of d is generated as below 1 k d p k p k fl n fl n s n fl s n s where n is the sample size f l is a flash flood indicator n f l is the frequent value and s is a parameter k d is employed to build the cdtree using the maximum of entropy function as follows 2 h k d max h p k p k k d where h is the shannon entropy function shannon 1948 and h is the total uncertainty a more detailed explanation of the cdtree can be found in mantas and abellán 2014 2 3 quantum particle swarm optimization qpso algorithm the qpso algorithm proposed by coelho 2010 is a newer version of the pso algorithm kennedy and eberhart 1995 qpso is an integration of the quantum dynamics schweizer 2001 and the pso to form a new solution for machine learning optimization which has proven its validity of optimizing parameters in various problems coelho 2010 ding et al 2018 li et al 2015 however qpso has not considered for flash flood modeling the salient features of the qpso coelho 2010 are presented below step 1 establishing the searching space for three parameters m l and mdtree and initializing the population npop of the swarm then randomly placing the population in the space the three parameters become the three coordinates of each particle and are a solution for the flash flood model step 2 evaluating the fitness of each particle pbest by using a defined objective function see the objective function designed for this research in section 4 2 then comparing the pbest of all particles in the swarm to derive the global best gbest step 3 updating the position x and velocity v of each particle in the swarm using the following equations 3 v i it 1 w v i it c 1 r d 1 p i it x i it c 2 r d 2 p g it x i it 4 x i it 1 p β meanbest i x i i t l n 1 g i f k 5 x i it 1 p β meanbest i x i i t l n 1 g i f k 5 where w is the weight factor uses for updating the velocity c 1 and c 2 are learning factors g is the index of the best particle in the swarm r d 1 and r d 2 are values 0 1 p i is the best position of the i th practice in each iteration m e a n b e s t is the global point which is computed using eq 5 and g and k are values 0 1 5 meanbest 1 n p o p d 1 n p o p p g d i t where it 1 2 itmax denotes the training iteration and g is the index of the best particle in the swarm step 4 run the loop until the maximum of the iteration is reach to find the particle with the gbest value then the position of this particle with three coordinates m l and mdtree was extracted as the optimized solution of the final flash flood model 3 study area and flash flood data 3 1 descriptions of the study area the study area is located in the tran yen district 21o31 48 n 21o47 38 n 104 38 37 e 104 59 00 e belonging to yen bai province lies in the north western mountainous region of vietnam fig 1 the studied site covers an area of 629 km2 with complex topography steep slopes and narrow valleys the topography is highly heterogeneous with high mountains ranges in the north n and southwest sw and small valleys expanding from the northwest nw to the southeast se the elevation ranges from 16 1 m to 1566 2 m above sea level in this study high slope areas 15 account for more than 72 of the total area while average slopes 5 15 and lower slopes 5 cover nearly 20 and 8 respectively with complex terrain the study area has a dense and evenly distribution of streams and river systems characterizing by small narrow and steep slopes these characteristics of the river system in this area may reinforce the occurrence of extreme natural hazards especially flash floods and landslides for climatic conditions the tran yen district is located in the tropical monsoon region with a yearly average temperature and rainfall ranging from 23 24 c and 1500 2200 mm respectively the humidity is relatively high 83 87 making a good condition for forest and agriculture development the geology in this area consists of different formations dominated by van chan song hong quaternary and other geological foundations the land coverage is mainly occupied by forest lands grasslands orchard lands and croplands contributing nearly 90 of the total lulc in the study area these geographical conditions have a strong influence on the historical flash flood events in this area 3 2 flash flood data 3 2 1 flash flood inventory map generating a flash flood inventory map is the first and vital step in establishing the spatial geodatabase of flash flood susceptibility this map is often created based on historical flood events collection satellite image processing field surveying investigations and analyzing remote sensing datasets arabameri et al 2020 costache et al 2020 as flash floods generally occur in a short time with highly heterogeneous spatial distribution accuracy preparation of the flash flood inventory map requires different information in this analysis a flash flood inventory map with 1698 polygons was extracted from the inventory database of the state funded flash flood project of vietnam nguyen et al 2020a herein these flooded locations were derived using sentinel 1 c band remote sensing data from 2016 to 2019 and change detection techniques besides a collection of historical flood events from field surveys 3 2 2 flash flood indicators as a complex phenomenon the flash flood taking place in a certain watershed depends not only on different influencing factors related to hydro meteorological conditions but also on geographical characteristics khosravi et al 2018 tien bui et al 2019 in order to construct accurately flash flood susceptibility maps it is often required insights into flood indicators related to historical flash flood events for this purpose we analyzed ten conditioning factors including slope aspect elevation curvature topographic wetness index twi rainfall river density soil type lithology and lulc which have associated directly or indirectly to flash flood events occurred in this study area these factors were prepared using a grid cell size of 30 m 30 m based on data collection from field surveys local authorities and sar remote sensing data slope of the ground surface influences on different hydrological processes including infiltration and runoff flow making it becomes a crucial factor in the prediction of flash floods florinsky 2016 nguyen et al 2020b the water flow originating from high slope areas usually has high energy leading to faster flow movement downward than lower slope areas therefore heavy rainfall taking place in steep slope areas may cause a high probability of flash flood occurrences for this study the slope layer was prepared using a digital elevation model dem with a spatial resolution of 30 m which was constructed from on the topographic maps available with a scale of 1 50 000 from the yen bai province authority the slope values range from 0 to 71 5 in which high slopes are in the north and southwest areas while the lower slopes distribute along the red river following northwest southeast direction fig 2 a aspect is an angle between the north direction and the horizontal projection which measures the direction of gravity driven flows florinsky 2016 the aspect has a significant influence on soil water balance e g soil moisture ragab et al 2003 because it affects insolation and evapotranspiration shaping characteristics of flash flood flows therefore the aspect has been widely used for flash flood modeling bui et al 2019a costache and bui 2020 nhu et al 2020 norbiato et al 2008 yates et al 2000 in the study area aspect which was derived from the above dem was built throughout eight classes including north n 337 5 360 northeast ne 22 5 67 5 east e 67 5 112 5 southeast se 112 5 157 5 south s 157 5 202 5 southwest sw 202 5 247 5 west w 247 5 292 5 northwest nw 292 5 337 5 fig 2b historical flash flood events were overplayed in the aspect layer indicating more flash flood occurrences in the w the nw and the n directions the elevation often regulates microclimatic conditions and the development of vegetable coverages in specific areas having a great effect on forming runoff flows bui et al 2019b tien bui et al 2020 moreover high elevation and wide derivatives coupled with fewer forest covers will force runoff flow moving faster than low elevations nguyen et al 2020b the elevation map fig 2c in the study area was created from the dem above the elevation map shows that high mountainous areas greater than70 m above sea level are mainly in the northern and southwestern parts in contrast the lowland areas distribute along small valleys and the red river the changes in attitude sharply from high to low elevation areas along the streams and the red river may increase the probability of flash floods in these locations the curvature is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of direction of a point that moves on the curve in which larger curvature will result in the larger change rate florinsky 2016 rejith et al 2019 curvature can be concave positive convex negative and flat zero which affects differently on runoff flow system florinsky 2016 nguyen et al 2020b the curvature layer was created based on the dem model in the study area accordingly the curvature shows a relatively wide variation ranging from 26 7 to 41 3 in which most of the positive values are in tops of mountainous areas while negative values are in steep slope areas fig 2d in this study it is worth noting that most of the historical flash floods occurred in the steep slopes with positive curvature indicating these locations may have a high potentiality to take place next flash flood events topographic wetness index twi reflects terrain derived attributes which is a major factor controlling soil moisture affecting plant distribution and diversity patterns moeslund et al 2013 mohamedou et al 2019 therefore the twi is recognized as an indirect factor controlling runoff processes in a certain area the twi value was estimated based on the dem model as the following equation below beven and kirkby 1979 tehrany et al 2014 1 twi i n a s tan β where a s denotes an upslope area and β is the slope angle at the pixel as shown in fig 2e the twi varied from 2 0 to 21 6 in which the high values 10 distribute to along the lowland areas leading to high capability of flash flood occurrence flash flood often happens in a small watershed with high rainfall intensity guardiola albert et al 2020 hence rainfall is recognized as the triggering indicator for flash flood occurrence gaume et al 2004 tien bui et al 2020 the magnitude effects of rainfall on flash flood occurrences depend on intensity duration frequency and spatial distribution although each flash flood event occurring in a certain area depends not only on each rainfall event but in accordance with other factors the rainfall and its characteristics are a primary driving force behind any flash flood events similar to many mountainous areas in the northwestern region of vietnam bui et al 2019b nguyen et al 2020b pham et al 2017 this study area has heavy rainfall dominantly occurs in the rainy season coupled with complex topographical conditions leading to more flash floods and landslides for this study we prepared the rainfall layer using three days of maximum rainfall events during the last five years from the local and regional monitoring systems as presented in fig 2f rainfall amount distributes unevenly with high rainfall along the lowland area from the northwest southeast direction indicating a high probability of flash floods in these areas river density plays an essential role in the storage and transfers of water in a watershed therefore it is an important factor influencing the water flow leaving out of a watershed pallard et al 2009 in general high river density will cause more flood expansion khosravi et al 2018 for this study the river density layer was created from the river network system derived from the topographic maps 1 50 000 mentioned above accordingly high river density greater than 5 km km2 distributes along with the central parts of the study areas with a maximum of 10 6 km km2 soil type has a strong effect on infiltration holding water and formation of subsurface flow therefore it plays a vital role in runoff generation jenks et al 2017 sangati et al 2009 each type of soil has different influences on the process of runoff generation and flash flood occurrences because of its difference in textures and hydraulic properties lovat et al 2019 for example a soil type with low permeable such as clay silt loam and mixed clay silt could quickly generate overland flow compared to high permeable soil types such as sand and gravel this study area consists of nine soil types of which the ycmr soil occupies more than 85 followed by the bor and the ycr soils fig 2h these soil types were derived from the soil texture map 1 50 000 scale from nguyen et al 2020a it is widely recognized that each lithological type has a different physical characteristic e g texture grain size and composition which affects directly and indirectly on infiltration rate generation of runoff flow hence lithology is often considered as a major factor for flash flood prediction the lithology map in this study area was built using the geological and mineral resources map with a scale of 1 50 000 from the department of natural resources and environment donre yen bai province ngo et al 2018 there are nine lithological types in the study area table 1 in which van chan song chay quaternary and other formations cover for more than 90 of the total area lulc is widely accepted as a vital flood indicator controlling hydrological processes in a watershed such as infiltration base flow overland flow and the spatial distribution of flood events barasa and perera 2018 sangati et al 2009 for example high vegetable coverage may increase infiltration rates and reduce the runoff coefficient leading to slowdown overland flow and reducing flood velocity armenakis et al 2017 conversely flash flood events often occur in the less vegetable coverage areas such as bare land and urbanized areas with high flood risks therefore lulc is considered the main factor in mapping flash flood susceptibility in this study the lulc map was generated using sentinel 1 c band sar data with a random forest algorithm nguyen et al 2020b eight lulc types were classified and identified in the study area including bare land crop areas forest areas grassland orchard land paddy rice urban and built up and water fig 2j it is noted that four main lulc types forest land grassland crop areas and orchard land account for more than 80 of the total area distributing unevenly in the study area forest land is observed mainly in the mountainous areas with high slopes whilst bare land and grassland are found in the lowland areas the uneven distribution of lulc coupled with high river density may lead to a high probability of flash flood occurrences in this area 4 proposed qpso cdtreeens model for tropical cyclone induced flash flood susceptible mapping this section describes the proposed qpso cdtreeens model for tropical cyclone induced flash flood susceptible mapping it should be noted that the sentinel 1 sar images for flash flood inventories and flood indicators were processed using the sentinel application platform snap toolbox and the spatial analysis toolbox in arcgis desktop 10 7 1 respectively the qpso algorithm was developed by coelho 2010 whereas the qpso cdtreeens model was programmed by the authors in the matlab environment using the matlab weka classifiers dunham 2020 besides a python tool was written to transform the flash flood susceptibility index into a gis format for visualizing the final map in the arcgis desktop the conceptual framework of the proposed qpso cdtreeens is shown in fig 3 4 1 flash flood database the first step is to establish a flash flood database for this research which consists of 10 input indicators slope aspect elevation curvature twi rainfall river density soil type lithology and lulc and 1698 flooded locations we employed arcgis desktop 10 7 1 to construct the database utilizing the environmental systems research institute esri file geodatabase format all indicators were converted into a raster format with a spatial resolution of 30 m and transferred to numerical values using a technique described in tien bui et al 2019 since the flash flood modeling in this work was designated as two class pattern recognition therefore a total of 1698 locations were generated outside the flood polygons in the study areas then a sampling process was conducted for 3396 locations to derive values of the ten indicators above finally the results were randomly split into a ratio of 70 30 for the training and the validation datasets 4 2 objective function for the qpso cdtreeens model as mentioned above the 3 dimension searching space was established for optimizing three parameters m l and mdtree for the qpso cdtreeens model in order to assess each combined solution of m l and mdtree an objective function bui et al 2019a could be used in this research mean absolute error mae was adopted for designing the objective function as following 5 mae 1 n i 1 n y o u t y where y o u t is the output value of the qpso cdtreeens model y is the original value and n is the sample size used 4 3 setting up and training the qpso cdtreeens model the process of setting up the qpso cdtreeens model consists of two steps the first one is to integrate the cdtree algorithm into the rs framework then three parameters m l and mdtree were specified to connect the qpso the second step is to configure the qpso for optimizing these three parameters thus the searching space with three dimensions was established as the subspace size m 1 10 because the flash flood database has only ten input indicator the number of cdtree l 1 1000 and the maximum depth of the tree mdtree 1 100 the maximum number of iterations of 1000 and the swarm of 50 particles were used the other qpso parameters for the optimization were set the default as in coelho 2010 4 4 performance evaluation in order to assess the performance of the qpso cdtreeens model the widely statistical metrics for the two class pattern classification tien bui and hoang 2017 based flash flood modeling were used including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve auc the classification accuracy acc the kappa coefficient the positive and the negative predictive values ppv and npv the sensitivity and the specificity as suggested in the prior studies because the descriptions of the above statistical metrics and the rationale explanations behind for using them for flood modeling have been well documented in the literature i e chapi et al 2017 costache and bui 2020 darabi et al 2019 tehrany et al 2019 tien bui and hoang 2017 therefore these descriptions and explanations are not repeated here again 4 5 role of the flash flood indicators the contribution of the ten flash flood indicators in this analysis was accessed using the wrapper algorithm kohavi and john 1997 with 5 fold cross validation using three optimized values m l and mdtree found section 4 3 for the qpso cdtreeens model first the wrapper algorithm measured the performance of the model again called the full model with the full set of 10 indicators in the next step determining all possibilities of combined subsets of these indicators through a running loop then comparing the performance of the resulting sub model with the full model finally the role of each indicator was derived based on the performance difference between the full model and the sub models to measure the performance several statistical metrics were employed including the acc the auc and the mae besides the f measure hand and christen 2018 was also considered the reason behind the use of several metrics is to check if the ranking of the indications is influenced by the metrics used which can avoid potential bias on the conclusion of the role of the flash flood indications 4 6 the usability of the qpso cdtreeens model and compiling the flash flood susceptibility map the usability of the qpso cdtreeens for flash flood modeling was assessed and confirmed through a comparison of its performance with that of popular machine learning algorithms including the support vector machines svm the classification and regression tree cart the logistic regression lr and the best first tree bftree models in addition the performance of the standard alone cdt was also included using the flash flood training samples the svm model with the radial basis function kernel was built where its parameters gamma 0 358 and c 52 were determined using the grid search method friedrichs and igel 2005 pham et al 2020a whereas for the cdt the optimized parameter obtained in section 4 3 was used for the other algorithms the default parameters in weka were utilized when the qpso cdtreeens model was successfully trained and validated the final model was used to compute the susceptibility indices for the entire tran yen district finally these indices were used to generate the susceptibility map in arcgis desktop 5 results 5 1 model training and validating with 1000 iterations the qpso cdtreeens was successfully trained in the training phase and its three optimized parameters were found as m 6 l 69 and mdtree 19 the detailed performance of the model is shown in table 2 we observed that the overall classification accuracy acc of the qpso cdtreeens model is 87 8 indicating that the goodness of fit of the model is high the kappa coefficient is 0 755 denoting that the model performs 75 5 better than chance the detailed performance of the model table 2 on the two classes flood and non flood described by the ppv 90 7 the npv 84 9 the sensitivity 85 7 and the specificity 90 1 indicates that the proposed qpso cdtreeens model performs well in the training phase the auc of 0 948 demonstrates that the predictive performance of the proposed model reaches 94 8 to confirm whether the proposed qpso cdtreeens model works well with the remaining dataset the validation dataset which was not utilized in the training phase was used to check the prediction performance of the model it can be clearly seen from table 2 that high metrics values with an acc of 90 4 and the kappa index of 0 807 were observed using the qpso cdtreeens model showing that the proposed model performs well in the validating phase besides the proposed model achieves good performance and balance when dealing the flood and non flood classes ppv 90 8 npv 90 0 sensitivity 90 1 and specificity 90 7 overall with auc 0 949 the predictive performance capability of the model is confirmed at 94 9 5 2 the relative importance of the indicators the contribution of the ten indicators to the flash flood model was assessed using the wrapper algorithm mentioned in section 4 5 the results in table 3 show that the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi are the most important indicators for the predictive performance of the qpso cdtreeens model in all cases they are followed by the elevation the rainfall and the river density factors the three indicators the soil type the lithology and the aspect have the lowest contributions to the model in the case when using the mae it is observed that the soil type indicator 0 015 is ranked slightly higher than that of the lithology factor 0 013 however the inverse ranking is observed for the acc the auc and the f measure cases the final ranking of all indicators is depicted in table 3 5 3 the applicability of the qpso cdtreeens model the applicability of the proposed model was assessed through the comparison with the five well known ml models svm cart lr cdt and bftree it can be seen from table 2 that all ml models show satisfactory results in the training phase the highest performance is observed by the cart model acc 86 8 kappa 0 735 and auc 0 910 followed by the bftree model acc 86 1 kappa 0 722 and auc 0 876 the cdt model acc 85 8 kappa 0 716 and auc 0 916 and the svm model acc 85 1 kappa 0 702 and auc 0 851 in contrast to these models the lr model acc 83 1 kappa 0 662 and auc 0 883 has the lowest performance except the svm model ppv 90 1 npv 80 2 sensitivity 81 9 and specificity 99 0 the other ml models show a balance in handling on the flood and non flood samples overall the performance of the cart model is likely more similar to the qpso cdtreeens model whereas the performances of other ml models are relatively lower table 2 regarding the predictive performance which was assessed in the validation phase the results reveal that all five models have good prediction performances the highest one is observed by the bftree model acc 88 4 kappa 0 768 and auc 0 0 887 and the cart model acc 88 2 kappa 0 764 and auc 0 815 followed by the cdt model acc 87 0 kappa 0 741 and auc 0 926 on the other hand the svm model had the lowest performance acc 85 8 kappa 0 715 and auc 0 926 followed by the lr model acc 85 9 kappa 0 717 and auc 0 906 looking at the ppv the npv the sensitivity the specificity values in the validation phase table 2 all five models have a good balance processing the samples of the flood and non flood classes nevertheless the overall prediction performance of the five models is lower than that of the proposed qpso cdtreeens model in order to confirm whether the prediction capability of the qpso cdtreeens model is statistically better than those of the five models the paired samples sign test de muth 2014 mara and cribbie 2012 was further used the null hypothesis h0 indicates no statistical difference between the predicted values of the qpso cdtreeens and those of other ml models then z value at 5 of significance and p value were computed for each model pair if the z value is larger than 1 96 or less than 1 96 and the p value is 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected and the prediction performance of the two flash flood models is a statistically significant difference the results of the paired samples sign test for all the ml models are shown in table 4 it could be seen that the z value of all the model pairs is larger than 1 96 and the p value in all cases is less than 0 05 indicating that the performance of the qpso cdtreeens model is a statistically significant difference 5 4 flash flood susceptibility map since the qpso cdtreeens model produces the best capability of predicting flash flood the model was adopted to compute susceptibility indices for the whole area of the tran yen district the index result was used to generate the flash flood susceptibility map in fig 4 the map was interpolated and presented in six classes ranging from the extremely low to the very high classes to determine thresholds for dividing the indices into these classes a graph curve see in fig 4 was constructed by overlaying the 1698 flooded locations over the susceptibility map then the percentage of flash flood map and percentage of flooded locations were computed to build the curve the results show the very high 5 the high 5 the moderate 10 the low 15 the very low 15 and the extremely low 50 were derived table 5 6 discussions flash flood is still considered to be one of the most dangerous natural hazards worldwide due to its high speed of water runoff short time occurrence and sediment transporting which cause sudden disruptions to infrastructures property and human lives ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 forero ortiz et al 2020 li et al 2020 although various attempts have been made it is still difficult to predict accurately causing challenges for local authorities in developing measures for flash floods in this research a novel machine learning ensemble model namely the qpso cdtreeens model was proposed and tested in a high frequency flash flood area the qpso cdtreeens model is an integration of cdtree random subspace and qpso to form a powerful ensemble model in the last two decades decision tree inference models are become popular in natural hazard modeling due to the ability to handle complex geospatial data with high prediction performance however the prediction of the single decision tree can be improved if multiple trees are combined and integrated rokach 2016 the results in this research confirmed this statement where the qpso cdtreeens model yields the highest predictive performance and better than that of the single cdtree and the other well known ml models i e the svm the lr models the results in this research also indicate that the quality of the qpso cdtreeens model is heavily dependent on the three turning parameters the subspace size m the number of cdtrees l and the maximum depth of the cdtree mdtree therefore these parameters must be carefully considered to optimize these parameters the qpso was integrated to search and find the optimized values for them autonomously the qpso is a hybridization of the quantum mechanics theory and pso that has proven its efficiency in optimization problems coelho 2010 ding et al 2018 li et al 2015 consequently the high performance of the qpso cdtreeens model indicates that the qpso algorithm has successfully optimized three turning parameters thus through the training phase a total of 1000 possible combinations of m l and mdtree were explored and assessed to find the best qpso cdtreeens model this ensures that the found three parameters are optimized for the study area regarding the ten indicators their contributions to the flash flood model are clarified with the use of the wrapper algorithm the advantage of this algorithm is the ability to explore all possible combinations of indicators to evaluate their roles autonomously however this algorithm requires a pre defined statistic metrics for measuring the contribution of these indicators in this work four statistical metrics acc auc mae and f measure were used to rank these indicators indicating that the role of all indicators was objectively determined as a result the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi factors are the most important indicators in this research it is a reasonable result because deforestation nghiem 2013 in the last decade which modified the surface runoff nguyen et al 2016 has caused severe environmental problems in this district resulting in landslides pham et al 2018 and flash floods the slope the curvature and the twi are essential factors controlling the hydrological processes therefore they have a high contribution to the qpso cdtreeens model in contrast the aspect factor shows the lowest contribution to the model this is likely due to the distribution of the flooded locations in the aspect classes which is somewhat evenly 7 conclusions this research proposes a state of the art ensemble based learning model namely the qpso cdtreeens model for flash flood susceptibility mapping a geospatial database which consists of 1698 flash flood and inundation polygons mainly derived from sentinel 1 c band sar images and 10 flash flood indicators computed from other sources at a high frequency tropical cyclone area in the northwest of vietnam was used to construct and to verify the proposed model based on the findings in this work some conclusions are given below the qpso cdtreeens which is integrated of the qpso the cdtree and the random subspace technique is capable of predicting flash flood with high accuracy the qpso is an efficient tool for autonomously searching the three parameters of the qpso cdtreeens model the lulc the slope the curvature and the twi factors are the essential indicators for the flash flood in this study area finally the predictive performance of the qpso cdtreeens model is statistically higher than those of the svm the cart the lr the cdt and the bftree models therefore the qpso cdtreeens provides a new tool which should be used for flash flood modeling and prediction in the tropics credit authorship contribution statement phuong thao thi ngo data curation methodology writing
