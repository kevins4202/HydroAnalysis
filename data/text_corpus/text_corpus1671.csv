8355,study region são paulo state southeastern brazil study focus several studies were conducted on the guarani aquifer system gas with as main focus the identification of major stratigraphic units and hydrodynamic properties governing groundwater flow geochemical assessment studies of the gas focused on hydrochemical and isotopic characterization current understanding is that progressive rock water interactions control the observed hydrochemical zonation new hydrological insights for the region based on available analyses of the overlying serra geral aquifer system sgas and the deeper permian aquifer system pas along with numerical simulation of mixing processes we concluded that the hydrochemistry of the gas is modulated by its mixing with groundwater inputs from overlying and underlying aquifers importantly our work indicates that 50 of the guarani aquifer system groundwater recharge in são paulo state comes from serra geral aquifer system seepage this finding has critical implications regarding groundwater management mass balance calculations and estimations of groundwater residence times keywords guarani aquifer system groundwater mixing hydrochemical facies 1 introduction the guarani aquifer system gas represents the third largest aquifer in the world occupying 950 000 km2 within the paraná sedimentary basin the gas represents a strategic water resource for four countries in south america brazil argentina paraguay and uruguay e g foster et al 2009 sindico et al 2018 according to foster et al 2009 90 million people are directly or indirectly benefitting from the gas exploitation because the importance of gas the water balance and estimates of groundwater recharge represents a crucial issue to water management hydrochemistry represents a useful tool to characterize the dynamics of groundwater in response to natural or anthropogenic processes e g stigter et al 2006 folch et al 2011 guggenmos et al 2011 despite an abundance of reports on the hydrochemistry of the gas e g silva 1983 meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 reis 2011 results thus far have not significantly improved our understanding of the regional hydrodynamics of the aquifer system there remains a lack of studies focusing on improvements of the basic conceptual flow model and water balance of the gas including prevailing hydrochemistry constraints to date it has been assumed that the gas aquifer system receives groundwater recharge strictly along a narrow outcrop zone along its eastern and westerns borders e g wendland et al 2007 gómez et al 2010 rodríguez et al 2013 because the outcrops zone comprises about 10 of the gas araújo et al 1999 groundwater recharge is expected to be relatively small e g rodríguez et al 2013 the gas discharge zone furthermore is conceptualized to occur along the main rivers such as paraná and uruguay rodríguez et al 2013 while some studies contend that gas represents an entire connected block e g araújo et al 1999 rodríguez et al 2013 other works hypothesize the aquifer system to have much more of a structure and compartmentalization leading to very restricted flow soares et al 2007 mira et al 2018 because of the hypothesized hydraulic isolation of the gas e g rodríguez et al 2013 the unique nature of its hydrochemical features is conceptualized to result from simple rock water interactions along the flow paths sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 still some studies suggested interactions of the gas with overlying or underlying aquifer systems e g meng and maynard 2001 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 elliot and bonotto 2017 the extent of these interactions has not been investigated quantitatively because groundwater sources and sinks provide critical information for water management we initiated an investigation of groundwater interactions in the northeast region of the gas in order to improve current understanding of regional groundwater flow dynamics quantitative evaluation of groundwater mixing is a suitable approach to determine the amount of water received and delivered by the gas thereby potentially challenging well stablished conceptual models of the gas being a more or less isolated aquifer system based on insights provided by detailed analysis of available hydrochemical and isotopic data to trace flow dynamics within the gas the present study aims to establish a new conceptual model that focuses on interactions of the gas with the overlying and underlying aquifer systems 2 geology of the paraná basin the paraná basin spans a surface area of nearly 1 5 106 km2 in the central eastern portion of south america representing the remnant of a vast intracratonic sedimentary basin milani et al 2007 the maximum thickness of the paraná basin is about 8 km with a stratigraphic record of nearly 400 million years ranging from the late ordovician to the late cretaceous period fig 1 milani and zalan 1999 recognized six large scale units or supersequencesrio ivaí ordovician silurian paraná devonian gondwana i carboniferous eotriássico gondwana ii meso a neotriassic gondwana iii neojurassic eocretace and bauru neocretaceous in the stratigraphic record of the paraná basin in são paulo state goundwana i comprises the permo carboniferous itararé and passa dois groups the total thickness of these units increases toward the center of the paraná basin with the thickness reaching a maximum of 5000 m milani et al 2007 the itararé group represents the record of post glacial sedimentation in the northeast portion of the paraná sedimentary basin soares 1972 the passa dois group encompasses the irati and corumbataí formations the itararé group is covered by the tatuí formation composed of pelites shales limestone and sandstones associated with deltaic complexes that were progressively drowned by a transgressive marine event barbosa gimenez and caetano chang 2010 the second unit from the passa dois group in são paulo state is represented by the corumbataí formation which mainly consists of reddish siliciclastic rocks both were probably deposited in an extensive shallow inland sea without connection to the ocean rohn 1994 perinotto et al 2008 the gas is composed of the pirambóia formation from gondwana ii triassic units and the botucatu formation from gondwana iii together the gas units have an average thickness of 300 400 m overlying formations ranging from an igneous basement to paleozoic sediments of the passa dois and tubarão groups deposition of the pirambóia formation has been ascribed to a wet eolian system e g donatti et al 2001 giannini et al 2004 maraschin et al 2019 while the botucatu formation is attributed to a dry eolian system donatti et al 2001 scherer and goldberg 2007 lebac 2008 buck et al 2017 d orazi porchetti et al 2018 the botucatu formation is covered by thick basalts of the serra geral formation and cretaceous sediments of the bauru group araújo et al 1999 milani et al 2007 the serra geral formation is one of the greatest continental floods representing thick sequence flows of mainly basaltic rocks with a maximum thickness of 1700 m belonging to the continental scale paraná etendeka magmatic province almeida 2018 the serra geral formation underlies the deposits of the bauru group that comprises the bauru supersequence paula e silva et al 2009 this cretaceous sedimentary succession reflects changing nonmarine environments such as eolian lacustrine fluvial and alluvial fans paula e silva et al 2009 menegazzo et al 2016 3 materials and methods 3 1 study area the study area is located in the western part of são paulo state fig 2 in southeast brazil four major aquifer systems occur in the study area permian aquifer system pas guarani aquifer system gas serra geral aquifer system sgas and bauru aquifer system bas because of the complexity of the underlying units of the gas we combined the aquifers of the tubarão and passa dois groups into a single overall aquifer system the pas because our focus was directed toward the gas and any aquifer that potentially could interact with the gas notably the sgas and pas we did not include the surficial bas in our analysis the study area covers approximately 155 800 km2 between 20 24 s and 47 52 w a narrow outcrop zone of gas in the eastern part of the study area covers only 14 415 km2 fig 2 in the remaining area the aquifer is confined by basalts of the serra geral aquifer system sgas which increase in thickness towards the center of the basin the guarani aquifer represents an important source of potable water for several densely populated regions including regionally important cities such as ribeirão preto são josé do rio preto and araraquara 3 2 hydrochemical characterization 3 2 1 chemical analysis of gas the hydrochemical evolution of the gas in the study area has been investigated in a large number of previous studies especially silva 1983 kimmelmann et al 1989 sracek and hirata 2002 frança et al 2003 rocha 2005 gastmans et al 2010 reis 2011 hirata et al 2011 and elliot and bonotto 2017 importantly the present study could use existing data of both the underlying and overlying aquifer systems thus allowing us to develop an understanding of the interactions between these aquifers and the gas previously published information for the study area was compiled to evaluate and characterize the hydrochemistry of the gas we limited our analysis to only são paulo state in the northeastern section of the gas since hydrochemical and isotopic data were available of the underlying and overlying aquifers in this region hydrochemical data for the gas have been reported in numerous studies including those by silva 1983 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 and reis 2011 because most of the samples had been reported in two or more studies we used the most complete datasets presented by gastmans et al 2010 and reis 2011 to reproduce possible reactions related to rock water interactions the mineral composition of the gas was also examined frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 gastmans et al 2010 and hirata et al 2011 provided important contributions regarding the mineralogical characterization of the deep and confined units of the gas while the detrital mineralogy of gas is comprised by quartz and k feldspar the authigenic mineralogy is composed by quartz chalcedony kaolinite montmorillonite illite and calcite frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 hirata et al 2011 3 2 2 chemical analysis of pas the compiled data pertaining to the pas hydrochemistry were subdivided in two groups shallow 500 m and deep 500 m data of the deep pas were obtained from dst drill stem testing analyses performed during oil and gas prospecting carried out in the 1980s results of these analyses were available from technical reports of the brazilian national petroleum agency anp national petroleum agency 2020 table 1 because shallow pas groundwater samples beneath the gas close to the outcrop zone were not available we used data collected in the rio claro municipality oliva and chang 2002 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 these samples should closely resemble those of the pas below the gas since they are only 8 km away from the outcrop zone 3 2 3 chemical analysis of sgas to simulate interactions of the gas and the serra geral aquifer system sgas in são paulo state we adopted the chemical analysis presented by gastmans et al 2017 to investigate the expected hydrochemical characteristics of the sgas we furthermore used the geochemical and mineralogical properties of basalts in são paulo state which were provided by squisato et al 2009 and machado et al 2018 in order to evaluate possible mixing within the wells we examined the siagas database cprm geological service of brazil 2020 by searching for well construction logs and production rates we could verify that the flow rate of gas wells in the region encompassing facies 2 e g bernardino de campos matão avaré normally exceeds 100 m3 h while the production rate of the sgas in the same region rarely exceeds 8 m3 h this means that the contribution of any possible mixing within the well borehole should be less than 10 some deep wells e g presidente epitácio presidente prudente which crossed the pas and hence cause some mixing within the boreholes were not used for the simulations 3 3 conceptual model development a conceptual model for the hydrochemical evolution of the gas groundwater was developed based on the geological framework hydraulic characteristics chemical compositions isotopic characterizations and groundwater dating the detailed analysis of available data allowed us to build a conceptual model describing interactions of the gas with the overlying and underlying aquifer units as well as studying the mechanisms governing hydrochemical changes in the groundwater along the flow paths the conceptual model was used as a reference for the geochemical simulations 3 4 geochemical simulations in order to confirm our hypothesis we performed several numerical simulations of path reactions using the react and spece8 components of the geochemist s workbench 10 package bethke and yeakel 2014 while the speciation was calculated using spece8 the mineral water reactions into the aqueous phase and mixing were simulated using react all reactions were simulated using the geochemist s workbench thermodynamic database thermo com v8 r6 dat speciation calculations involve free ions e g a and b in the mixed solution that possess a certain saturation state with respect to the set of minerals to calculate the saturation state of a mineral phase the ion activity product iap was calculated using eq 1 the log10 values of the iap divided by thermodynamic equilibrium state k of a specific mineral eq 4 defines the saturation index of this mineral si 1 i a p a b 2 s i l o g 10 i a p k when si is less than 0 the solution is unsaturated with respect to the evaluated mineral when si equals 0 the solution is saturated with respect to the mineral and when si 0 the mineral phase is supersaturated leading to precipitation of the mineral phase 3 4 1 chemical speciation and rock water interactions speciation calculations of the compiled data from the gas sgas and pas were carried out to obtain the saturation indices of dissolved minerals in the aqueous phase in the case of the sgas we simulated the water rock interaction to describe the expected groundwater composition associated with tholeiitic basalts 3 4 2 mixing simulations we hypothesized that each hydrochemical facies previously identified in the gas meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 resulted from variable proportions of mixing of the gas water with the pas and sgas under this assumption the existing gas samples were distributed along discernible mixing trends in a standard piper diagram to assess the volume of groundwater coming from both underlying and overlying aquifers into the gas we performed geochemical mixing simulations using a well stablished methodology e g han et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 beyer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 kim et al 2017 in this approach we defined the samples located at the end points of these trends further defined as the end members in our conceptual mixing model an endmember progressively transformed to another endmember by mixing with groundwater flowing from one of the adjacent aquifer systems thus we assumed sample stretching between end members in piper diagram result from a mixture of water from the initial end member and inflowing groundwater from another aquifer system in varying proportions the mixing may be described in the general form eq 3 3 c 1 2 v 1 c 1 v 2 c 2 v 1 v 2 where c 1 2 is the concentration of a mixed water sample v 1 v 2 are respectively the volumes of the initial end member and the mixing proxy of inflowing groundwater from the overlying or underlying aquifer systems in eq 1 the maximum mixing proportion of adjacent aquifer system to produce the solution close to the target end member represents the mixing ratio between gas with underlying or overlying aquifer systems for practical applications eq 3 may be rewritten as eq 4 to obtain the mixing between an initial endmember with discrete volumes of incoming groundwater from the nearby aquifer systems 4 c i δ v i n f l u x i 1 n c i g a s v 1 c 2 n δ v i n f l u x m i n δ v i n f l u x v g a s where c i δ v is the concentration of variable i for each discrete volume of incoming groundwater δ v i n f l u x is the discrete volume of incoming groundwater from the overlying or underlying aquifer systems c i g a s is the concentration of specie i in the initial endmember c i i n f l u x is the concentration of specie i in groundwater incoming from overlying or underlying aquifer systems n is the number of discrete volumes of incoming groundwater causing the mixing and m i is the mass of specie i removed from solution by precipitation of a mineral phase to identify the mixing proxies of overlying and underlying aquifer systems we did run simulations of several distinct samples to evaluate if the progressive mixing did cause overlap of the simulated solutions with the existing analysis in the piper diagram hence producing solutions similar to the target endmember with respect to hydrochemical typology composition and physical chemical parameters ph and electrical conductivity table 2 presents the end member proxies of the pas and sgas used as the mixing source in the simulations the sgas1 composition represented a groundwater sample from sgas as reported by gastmans et al 2017 pas1 represented shallow groundwater of the pas belonging to a na hco3 type solution collected in rio claro oliva and chang 2002 while pas2 is a deep pas from alto alegre obtained from the anp database table 1 using eq 2 the mixing simulations were performed by successive addition of n discrete volumes of incoming sgas1 pas1 and pas2 proxies to produce new solutions thus generating a trajectory in the piper diagram the simulated endmember 2 was produced by mixing of endmember 1 with sgas1 end member 3 was subsequently produced by mixing with pas2 while endmember 4 and 5 were produced by mixing distinct proportions of endmember 3 with pas2 to each liter of gas v g a s we progressively added discrete volume of 50 ml δ v i n f l u x of inflowing groundwater table 2 to produce solutions close to the target end members the mix of two solutions may produce a supersaturation state with respect to the distinct mineral phases which then favors their precipitation to allow the precipitation of supersaturated phases we activated the precipitation function in react a certain amount of specie i m i may then be transferred from solution to precipitated phase the number of added discrete volumes n was optimized by trial and error to produce end solutions close to the selected endmembers of each hydrochemical facies the mixing ratio of influx groundwater of sgas or pas into the gas was calculated using 5 r m i x i n g n v i n f l u x v g a s n v i n f l u x table 3 presents the upper limits of the hydrochemical facies used to calibrate the mixing simulations we also explored alternative geochemical scenarios for simulating rock water interaction to test the capability of those scenarios and to reproduce the transition of camg hco3 to na hco3 facies one scenario involved the hydrolysis of sodium rich silicates such as albite reacting with groundwater in a closed system with respect to co2 a second alternative scenario was tested by simulating cationic exchange in which clay minerals promote ca sorption while na is released as proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical characterization of pas the compiled analytical results for the shallow and deep pas indicated considerable heterogeneity with respect to their composition fig 3 demonstrating that deep samples 500 m are more homogeneous and shallow samples 500 m more diverse all groundwater samples from the deep pas exhibited high and variable salinity all being na k cl so4 na k so4 and na cl so4 types table 1 some deep groundwater samples also showed high concentrations of so4 2 cl na k and sr2 table 1 the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow samples were quite variable encompassing ca hco3 na hco3 na cl and mixed types with na hco3 being the dominant type fig 3 the dominance of cahco3 and nahco3 in the shallow portion is due to progressive dilution by inflowing groundwater recharge east of the outcrop zone of gas thereby dissolving and removing soluble salts of cl and so4 2 on other hand in the deep portion cl and so4 2 experienced less dilution causing the concentrations of these species to remain relatively high 4 2 hydrochemical characterization of the sgas the confined section of the gas is covered by basalts of the sgas in são paulo state these basalts are mainly tholeiitic and are rich in ca and mg with minor amounts of na squisato et al 2009 machado et al 2018 based on a typical tholeiitic basalt composition one may expected that the most important rock water reactions are driven by plagioclase and augite dissolution the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase represented by anorthite and augite in an open system with respect to co2 are represented by respectively 6 c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 c a 2 2 h c o 3 7 c a m g s i 2 o 6 2 c o 2 5 h 2 o c a 2 m g 2 2 h c o 3 2 s i o h 4 1 2 o 2 gastmans et al 2017 presented analytical and isotopic results of basaltic aquifers that we used in our study because the sampled data covered a large portion of the study area it was possible to identify typical hydrochemical variations in the sgas all sgas samples reported by gastmans et al 2017 were oversaturated with respect to quartz and saturated with respect to chalcedony while si concentrations showed good correlation with both ca2 and mg2 this scenario fits with groundwater interactions with augite eq 7 however we found that the composition of the samples varied between two endmembers the first being a ca mg hco3 end type and the second a na hco3 end type fig 4 the first group ca mg hco3 end type is expected to be derived from groundwater interactions with tholeiitic basalts whereas the second group na hco3 and mixed types is not entirely sourced from groundwater that underwent interactions with tholeiitic basalts in order to demonstrate that the ca mg hco3 end type of the sgas is produced by interactions with tholeiitic basalts we simulated a reaction of pure water with basalts eqs 1 and 2 in an open system with respect to co2 we adjusted the reacted mass by trial and error and verified that the groundwater of the sgas may be modeled by reacting with 0 024 g of anorthite caal2si2o8 and 0 020 g of albite naalsi3o8 to represent labradorite ca0 5 0 7na0 3 0 5al2si2o8 and 0 03 g of augite camgsi2o6 the produced solution falls within group 1 fig 4 and is supersaturated with respect to chalcedony similar to sgas samples with si 0 56 4 3 hydrochemical characterization of the gas the gas dataset of groundwater analytical results was grouped into five major hydrochemical facies named hydrochemical facies 1 2 3 4 and 5 based on their chemical composition and distance from the outcrop zones fig 5 the groundwater samples followed discernible trends in the piper diagram showing a transition of ca mg hco3 to na hco3 and then to na cl so4 fig 6 these transitions were previously associated with different stages of rock water interaction along the flow path e g silva 1983 meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 hydrochemical facies 1 encompasses groundwater of the unconfined unit of the gas and is characterized by very low salinity and a highly variable composition resembling meteoric water facies 2 is composed of groundwater of a ca mg hco3 end type in the confined unit and facies 3 is of a na hco3 end type facies 4 and 5 are both of a na cl so4 end type and discernible by their higher salinity and higher cl concentrations in facies 5 comparing so4 2 concentration fig 7 with the hydrochemical facies fig 5 we may consider so4 2 as the key diagnostic parameter for distinguishing hydrochemical facies the main hydrochemical changes in the gas are mediated by so4 2 increases that display clear trends with the concentration progressively increasing towards the western side of the study area fig 6 the distribution of δ13c values within the gas presented by gastmans et al 2010 exhibited a gradient whereby δ13c becomes more positive from the outcrop zone in the east towards the west along the groundwater flow path fig 8 in and close to the outcrop zone δ13c values ranged from 23 7 to 19 consistent with terrestrial calcite dissolution in an open system with respect to co2 in the downgradient of the outcrop zone the δ13c values rose above 12 to reach values above 8 in the west fig 8 4 4 conceptual model based on datasets compiled thus far we built a conceptual model that considers the various hydrochemistry transformations 4 4 1 hydrochemistry of the unconfined gas in the outcrop area the ph of groundwater samples from the gas reflected a buffering effect mediated by an open system with respect to co2 however the system was closed with respect to co2 in areas where the gas is covered by basalts of the sgas thus allowing rapid calcite saturation typically groundwater in the outcrop zones of the gas hydrochemical facies 1 had little mineralization i e electrical conductivities ec 50 μs cm because of limited interaction with the rocks the presence of k feldspar in the pirambóia formation has been commonly observed with authigenic clay and iron oxides frequently filling the pores whereas calcite cementation is less common caetano chang and wu 2006 the main reactions that occur in the outcrop area are k feldspar hydrolysis given by 8 2 k a l s i 3 o 8 c o 2 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 k 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 and dissolution of calcite cementation through reaction with dissolved co2 9 c a c o 3 c o 2 a q 4 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 4 4 2 water exchange with the sgas we conceptualized that hydrochemical facies 2 resulted from the mixing of facies 1 and groundwater seepage from the sgas the overlying sgas plays an important role in the geochemistry of the gas studies carried out in a watershed located in the outcropping zones of the gas indicated that groundwater recharge is readily discharged into local baseflow thus the contribution to deep recharge is low to negligible wendland et al 2007 gómez et al 2010 based on the potentiometric maps of the overlying sgas gastmans et al 2017 and the gas gastmans et al 2010 it was possible to identify regions where the hydraulic heads of the sgas are greater than those of the gas fig 9 in these regions there is a potential flux from the sgas to the gas the hydraulic heads of the confined section of the gas close to the outcrop zone are lower than those of the overlying confining layer of the sgas thus allowing potential vertical seepage of groundwater from the basalts to the gas the region of hydrochemical facies 2 overlapped with the region of potential sgas seepage fig 10 the compositional change is described by an increase of ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations to produce a ca mg hco3 water type because of the tholeiitic composition of sgas basalts dissolution of plagioclase eq 1 and especially augite eq 2 in an open system with respect to co2 are the main reactions that release ca2 mg2 hco3 and sio2 aq fluxes from the overlying basalts are most likely the source of ca2 mg2 and hco3 to groundwater of hydrochemical facies 2 in our speciation simulations the majority of sgas samples presented by gastmans et al 2017 contrary to their findings exhibited chalcedony oversaturation thus it is expected that seepage of si rich groundwater from the sgas would result in the precipitation of chalcedony in the gas as demonstrated by frança et al 2003 and hirata et al 2011 in and close to the outcropping zone which roughly coincides with hydrochemical facies 2 thereby supporting the aforementioned interpretation with increased confinement of the gas towards the basin center i e because of increased basalt thickness the potentiometry of the gas becomes higher than that of the sgas thus promoting a flux inversion whereby the ascending groundwater of the gas moves to the overlying basaltic aquifer this upward flow explains the similarity of the sgas and gas samples gastmans et al 2017 above the regions of hydrochemical facies 3 and 4 fig 3 this interpretation is also supported by the exponential decrease in 14c activity as the δ13c ratio increases this scenario fits with the mixing of older water and the isotopic enrichment of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the gas moreover evidence of mixing of water from the gas within the sgas was previously identified by gastmans et al 2016 on the basis of cluster analysis and mixing simulations using netpath 4 4 3 mixing with pas1 the ca mg hco3 type water observed in the region of hydrochemical facies 2 is replaced by na hco3 type of facies 3 at distance ranging from 20 to 100 km from the outcrop zone as the replacement of the ca hco3 solution with na hco3 was accompanied by an increase in so4 2 and hco3 mixing of groundwater within the gas with groundwater coming from the pas1 is the most likely mechanism for explaining the transition from hydrochemical facies 2 to 3 since this can explain increases in dic na and so4 2 concentrations as well as the isotopic enrichment of δ13c dic it is possible to deduce the composition and proportion of mixed groundwater from the pas1 using mass balance calculations constrained by the composition of facies 2 and the concentration and isotopic signature of dic to estimate the mixture change in the chemical composition from facies 2 to 3 encompasses the follow trends an increase in δ13c from 19 to 11 1 an increase in alkalinity from 80 5 to 172 4 mg l an increase in na from 6 8 to 54 9 mg l an increase of so4 2 from 0 67 to 5 3 mg l a decrease in ca2 from 18 3 to 5 4 mg l and maintenance of a low cl concentration in our interpretation mixing with na so4 hco3 leads to calcite oversaturation and precipitation and consequently the removal of ca2 from the solution this hypothesis is supported by hirata et al 2011 who found calcite cementation at a depth of 900 m in tubular well located in the facies 3 region furthermore our hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the pas1 type waters possess high dic concentrations with enriched δ13c characteristic of marine carbonate 4 4 4 mixing with pas2 the transition of facies 3 4 and then to 5 was generated by the mixing of facies 2 with groundwater seepage from the deeper pas we classified pas groundwater into shallow pas mainly na hco3 and deep pas mainly na so4 cl types mixing of high salinity groundwater with the gas was discussed in previous studies including those by meng and maynard 2001 cresswell and bonotto 2008 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 and elliot and bonotto 2017 fig 6 illustrates a continuous increase of so4 2 concentrations from the outcrop zone towards the center of the basin thus suggesting the input of groundwater with a high so4 2 concentration according to our conceptual model high salinity pas2 groundwater as represented by the groundwater samples in table 1 causes the increases in na cl so4 and sr2 concentrations along the flow path which reach their maximum in the western section of the gas in addition to this mixing associated with na cl and so4 there are important inputs of dissolved organic carbon dic with δ13c values close to 0 i e typical of marine environments which promote the isotopic enrichment of dic as observed in hydrochemical facies 4 and 5 we interpret the transition from facies 3 to 4 and 5 as progressive mixing with the pas2 with facies 4 representing an intermediate type based on much of evidence the conceptual model was built using the assumption that major changes in hydrochemistry as illustrated in fig 10 are mostly controlled by groundwater exchange of the gas with the sgas and pas aquifer systems 4 5 simulation results of conceptualized flow path reactions the totality of evidence put together in this study strongly indicates that the changes in water composition previously reported for the sag were modulated by mixing with both deeper and shallower aquifers to demonstrate the viability of our conceptual model we performed simulations to reproduce the transitions between the five hydrochemical facies facies 1 represents direct meteoric recharge into the gas facies 2 and 3 represent mixing with the sgas and shallow pas respectively while facies 4 and 5 represent mixing with the deep pas 4 5 1 transition from hydrochemical facies 1 to facies 2 the transition from facies 1 to facies 2 may be mediated by mixture of facies 1 here termed solution 1 with groundwater from the basalts we used data from sample asg sp 11 gastmans et al 2017 and renamed it sgas1 table 2 as a mixing proxy for the simulation the fitted mixing proportions indicated a mixing ratio of 4 1 of sgas1 with solution 1 to produce solution 2 thus indicating that 80 of the groundwater recharge to the gas comes from the sgas basalts thereby generating solution 2 table 4 our simulation results indicated the precipitation of 0 0463 g of quartz per liter of mixed solution this since sgas water was oversaturated with respect to chalcedony opal and quartz 4 5 2 transition from hydrochemical facies 2 to facies 3 sample pas1 was of a na hco3 end type and best represented by a groundwater sample collected from a depth of 199 m in the municipality of rio claro as reported by oliva and chang 2002 table 2 in our conceptual model pas1 groundwater represented the most suitable mixing source to explain the change in groundwater composition from facies 2 to facies 3 by manual optimization we found that a proportion of 3 1 of pas1 groundwater to solution 2 was required to transform facies 2 into facies 3 thus generating solution 3 table 4 mixing of these two at a ratio of 3 1 caused supersaturation leading to the precipitation of 0 0074 g per liter of solution of calcite and 0 0132 g per liter of dolomite thus indicating the removal of ca2 and mg2 from the solution 4 5 3 transition from hydrochemical facies 3 to facies 4 and 5 facies 4 and 5 may be interpreted as a continuum subject to progressive increased mixing with high salinity deep pas2 groundwater pas2 table 2 along the flow path towards the basin center leading to the change from facies 3 to 4 and later to 5 the transition from facies 3 to 4 in the simulation was achieved by mixing a 20 1 ratio of solution 3 with pas2 water to produce solution 4 this caused the precipitation of 0 00223 g of calcite and 0 0005245 g of dolomite for each liter of mixed solution the transition from hydrochemical facies 4 to 5 was simulated next by mixing a 10 1 5 ratio of solution 4 with pas2 to produce solution 5 similar as for the transition from facies 3 to 4 the simulation of the transition from facies 4 to 5 caused the precipitation of 0 00116 g per liter of solution of calcite and 0 00065 g per liter of dolomite thus reducing the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 4 5 4 path reaction of gas evolution optimization of the performed simulations showed that the selected endmembers could be generated by the mixing percentages summarized in table 4 the generated solutions as obtained with the mixing simulations are presented in table 5 comparison of these data with the end member proxies of each hydrochemical facies table 3 indicates that the simulations reasonably well reproduced the hydrochemical evolution in the gas fig 11 illustrates that the flow path of the hydrochemical evolution in the gas from the outcrop zone towards the center of basin is driven by its mixing with sgas and pas the flow path closely overlaps the groundwater samples from the gas distributed along perceptible trends this supports the feasibility of our conceptual model based on interactions of the gas with the overlying sgas and the underlying pas the concentrations of the major cations and anions of the endmember proxies of facies 2 3 4 and 5 table 3 were compared with the simulated solutions 2 3 4 and 5 table 5 in a scatterplot graph fig 12 the linear regression in the scatterplot data indicates very good agreement between the predicted and observed concentrations thus suggesting that mixing plays an important role in the hydrochemical evolution of the gas 4 5 5 alternative scenarios for the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 may be attributable to mechanisms other than simple mixing we therefore simulated two alternative scenarios to verify their feasibilities the first alternative approach involved calcite dissolution accompanied by cation exchange which was previously proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 and gastmans et al 2010 gastmans et al 2010 suggested that groundwater samples falling within the stability field of na montmorillonite are indicative of this interpretation according to this approach a pool of exchangeable cations replaces ca2 with na at the exchange sites 10 c a c o 3 c o 2 a q h 2 o n a 2 x 2 n a 2 h c o 3 c a x another alternative scenario is mediated by albite dissolution and promotion of the release of na and hco3 an increase in hco3 and the consumption of protons then leads to a higher ph thus promoting an increase in calcite saturation hence the concentration of calcite precipitates and ca2 in solution decreases while na remains unaltered the governing equations for this scenario are given by 11 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 10 h 2 o 2 n a 2 h c o 3 4 h 4 s i o 4 a l 2 s i 2 o 4 12 2 h c o 3 2 o h 2 c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 13 2 c o 3 2 c a 2 2 c a c o 3 the amounts of calcite and albite dissolution in the first and second alternative scenarios respectively were optimized by trial and error to produce a goodness of fit in the simulations the resulting solutions from all simulated scenarios are summarized in table 6 indicating that cation exchange alternative scenario 1 albite dissolution alternative scenario 2 and mixing main scenario are capable of promoting the transformation of ca mg hco3 type solution 2 table 5 to na hco3 despite the suitability of all tested scenarios alternative scenarios did not produce suitable results since the alkalinity and na concentration were too low compared to hydrochemical facies 3 in the first scenario involving calcite dissolution and cation exchange only 0 004624 g of calcite was dissolved since calcite dissolution was severely constrained by a limited concentration of aqueous co2 in the confined gas the second alternative scenario similarly involved a limited amount of aqueous co2 in the gas for hydrolyzing albite to produce hco3 followed by calcite precipitation moreover neither albite dissolution nor cation exchange could explain the significant enrichment of dic δ13c fig 8 or the increased so4 2 concentration observed in the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 fig 7 4 6 evidence of mixing by sensitive tracers besides the geochemistry mixing is also supported by isotopic evidence from sensitive tracers since different aquifer systems often possess dissimilar isotopic characteristics such tracers may complement evaluations using major cations and anions and thus resolve ambiguous responses possible flow of groundwater from sgas to gas may be also traced using high rare earth element ree concentrations including eu anomalies in gas samples elliot and bonotto 2017 gas samples with high eu and ree concentrations have been observed in bernardino de campos sarutaiá águas de santa bárbara and avaré which are cities located in the hydrochemical facies 2 area fig 10 where groundwater inflow took place from sgas according to our conceptual model because of the marine origin and the deep location 2000 m of pas any mixing with its water with gas fluids should reveal the older age including dic isotopic enrichment with respect to δ13c comparison of the δ13c and alkalinity distributions within the gas fig 13 a indeed indicated that increased alkalinity as seen in fig 8 accompanied of δ13c isotopic enrichment this pattern is perfectly explained by inflow of dic rich groundwater with high levels of δ13c dic aggarwal et al 2015 paired groundwater 81kr dating with dic δ13c data similar to the above dic concentrations fig 13b shows a trend in which δ13c ratios increases linearly with increasing age these trends suggest input of older groundwater with a high concentration of isotopically enriched dic and hence confirm the influx of groundwater from pas calcite precipitation as predicted with our geochemical simulations may promote isotopic fractionation of the remaining dic δ13c experiments of romanek et al 1992 showed that the average enrichment factor of 1 0 0 2 i e αdic calcite of 1 001 for calcite precipitation implies a decrease in δ13c dic which is contrary to the trend observed in the data we evaluated i e enrichment of δ13c dic based on the rayleigh fractionation equation if 50 of dic precipitates as calcite the δ13c of the remaining dic in the solution will present a negative deviation of 0 7 e g 14 0 to 14 7 with respect to the initial signature this shows that calcite precipitation should not promote strong fractionation of dic along the flow path the inflow of deep pas water may be characterized by an increase of na so4 2 and cl as noted by cresswell and bonotto 2008 the increase in cl concentrations in addition to the incompatibility of the 36cl 35cl ratio with respect to continental rainwater strongly suggests the inflow of formational water from deep aquifer systems the inflow of pas water is also supported by soler i gil and bonotto 2015 who demonstrated the marine origin of so4 2 dissolved in gas groundwater 5 discussion the aim of the present study was to better understand the flow conditions and geochemistry of the guarani aquifer system one of most important aquifers in the world despite the large number of studies that have been carried out about this aquifer system there is no consensus regarding most of the processes associated with groundwater recharge gas flow conditions and geochemical reactions that drive the hydrochemistry of the gas to obtain a concise and robust conceptual model we revisited previous studies about the gas the gas previously has been conceptualized mostly as a simple permeable aquifer that is confined by low permeable underlying and overlying units with limited interaction between them and the gas groundwater flow modeling water reserve estimation and management strategies have been based nearly exclusively on this simplification however the findings in our study reveal a more intricate system in which the flow paths and the interactions between the gas and the underlying and overlying aquifer systems are relatively complex consequently much uncertainly still exists about the various processes including of the exact ground recharge quantities groundwater composition can provide important information about the interactions between aquifers systems since hydrochemistry is the result of specific reactions related to rock water interactions that vary within an aquifer unit consequently interpretation of aquifer mineralogy and water chemistry data can indicate the transport of groundwater within and between aquifers the detailed mineralogical analyses carried out by frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 and hirata et al 2011 revealed varied mineralogy and diagenetic history however considerable evidence in our current study indicates that it is unlikely that rock water interactions alone did drive the changes that have been observed in the groundwater composition of the gas because of dissimilarities between the hydrochemical samples of the sgas and the pas mixing of the gas with these aquifers offers a more reasonable explanation for the hydrochemistry of the gas figs 6 and 7 show that sulfate and dic concentrations are higher in the vicinity of the structural lineament of tietê coimbra et al 1977 than farther away suggesting that regional and deep discontinuities can play a major role in the mixing of the pas and gas according chang et al 1992 the abundant nw se structural lineaments such as tietê and the ponta grossa dike swarm are associated with extensional stresses induced by the differential spreading rate of plate divergence across the walvis são paulo ridge these nw se lineaments most likely represent important conduits of groundwater mixing since they cut across the aquitards below the gas this scenario perfectly agrees with findings by hindi 2007 who demonstrated a clear structural control of hot springs discharged from the gas seated 500 m below the surface along the nw lineaments using simple mixing simulations to explain the transitions of the groundwater composition within the gas we produced a good match between modeled and observed solutions the simulations produced a rough estimate of mixing between the gas and the underlying and overlying aquifer systems much uncertainty still exists about the actual volumes of incoming groundwater from the pas the mixing proxies we used to change the composition from facies 2 to facies 3 probably represents a diluted version of the actual solution that contributed to the transformation of ca mg hco3 type facies 2 to na so4 hco3 type groundwater facies 3 all observed groundwater types in the gas were represented in the groundwaters of the underlying and overlying units the proposed mixing scenarios provide a reliable explanation for the complex distribution of ages determined by aggarwal et al 2015 via 81kr dating of the oldest samples and 14c dating of the younger samples to exemplify this complexity the determined groundwater age in the municipality of valparaíso located 234 km from the outcrop zone was found to be 567 61 ky whereas in lins located 104 km from the outcrop zone on the same theorical flow path groundwater had been dated as 834 91 ky aggarwal et al 2015 simple mixing of groundwater in the gas with the oldest groundwater from the pas may account for this aging between the two locations another case involves a comparison of groundwater from matão with that from jaú which are located 24 km and 26 km away from the outcrop zone respectively and have reported ages of 2 7 ky and 14 ky respectively aggarwal et al 2015 groundwater sampled from matão may have received relatively young groundwater from the sgas this effectively rejuvenating its groundwater cation exchange proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 as a mechanistic process provided a very feasible explanation for driving the replacement of ca by na despite the absence of mineralogical evidence to validate this assumption still the assumption of sracek and hirata 2002 may be contradicted since there is no evidence that the gas was filled by brackish water to create a pool of exchangeable sites for cation exchange furthermore the gas reportedly was flushed by fresh water between 100 cresswell and bonotto 2008 and 180 times araújo et al 1999 since deposition which should have caused much of the ca2 on all hypothetical exchange sites to be replaced by na additionally the availability of co2 in the aqueous phase serves as a threshold for calcite dissolution by restricting the dic concentration which did not reach the concentration observed in facies 3 we speculate that cation exchange represents an important process for the generation of na hco3 type groundwater in the pas whereby the ca2 produced by carbonate dissolution is replaced by cation exchange na rich silicate hydrolysis could favor ca montmorillonite precipitation thereby releasing na into solution and changing ca hco3 type groundwater to a na hco3 type in the bauru aquifer system however neither of these processes can explain the strong increases in hco3 and so4 2 accompanied by dic δ13c enrichment moreover the pco2 concentration in the confined section of the gas was very low and saturated with respect to calcite thereby preventing calcite dissolution as a mechanism for explaining the increase in hco3 calibration of geochemical simulations required a mixing proportion of 4 l of sgas to each liter of gas table 4 to produce groundwater similar to facies 2 this fact suggests that in the region of facies 2 see fig 5 seepage flow occurred from sgas to gas and that this flow represented most of the groundwater recharge 50 of gas from sgas recharge estimation based on monitoring of water levels in the unconfined section of the gas was unable to produce the actual volumes of water entering the gas our study demonstrates the importance of evaluating seepage from the sgas as a major contribution to groundwater recharge in the gas however a significant volume of water is lost to the overlying sgas where the gas potentiometry surpasses that of the sgas as evidenced by the presence of the na hco3 type groundwater in the sgas which is incompatible with the mineralogy of tholeiitic basalts in the sgas of são paulo state the isotopic analysis presented by gastmans et al 2017 showed that the dic δ13c in the sgas followed a similar trend to that in the gas in that enrichment occured towards the center of the basin the great artesian basin gab represents an important aquifer system with some similarity to gas in terms of regional extent geological framework and age interestingly a recent study presented by radke and ransley 2020 found a similar condition of groundwater exchange with both overlying and underlying aquifers in the great artesian basin the mixing of gab with underlying and overlying aquifers are spatially variable and facilitated by regional geological structures similarly to those identified for the gas our findings in this study have significant implications for conceptual flow modeling of the gas and for water resource management in general the most important outcome of our work is that most of the groundwater recharge from gas in são paulo state is derived from sgas seepage thus our study demonstrates a need to review existing conceptual flow models of the gas to achieve a more correct diagnostic of flow patterns of the aquifer system furthermore current numerical models built to estimate residence times and long term predictions of over exploitation are not particularly representative of the gas because they do not account for important sources and sinks of groundwater from the underlying and overlying aquifers additionality as pointed out by elliot and bonotto 2017 the presumed interactions of the gas and sgas indicate that the gas is far more vulnerability than assumed typically 6 conclusions our results highlight that the composition of the gas within the são paulo state is modulated by mixing with the underlying permian sandstone and overlying cretaceous basalt aquifers ca mg hco3 type groundwater in the recharge areas is altered by mixing with groundwater from the basalts whereas the na hco3 and na so4 cl types are controlled by mixing with the shallow and deep permian aquifers respectively despite the robust evidence from hydrochemical analyses that strong interactions exists between the gas and the underlying and overlying units critical issues regarding these interactions remain unanswered future studies coupling fine scale isotopic analyses robust mixing evaluations appraisals of the role of deep structures driving the mixing and numerical flow simulations for water balance assessments should lead to a better understanding of the various processes and interactions overall we conclude that most of the gas groundwater originates from adjacent aquifers the findings presented in our work very much impact current understanding of the gas hydrodynamics with implications for water management planning water balance calculations and long term predictions of groundwater use in the gas region

8355,study region são paulo state southeastern brazil study focus several studies were conducted on the guarani aquifer system gas with as main focus the identification of major stratigraphic units and hydrodynamic properties governing groundwater flow geochemical assessment studies of the gas focused on hydrochemical and isotopic characterization current understanding is that progressive rock water interactions control the observed hydrochemical zonation new hydrological insights for the region based on available analyses of the overlying serra geral aquifer system sgas and the deeper permian aquifer system pas along with numerical simulation of mixing processes we concluded that the hydrochemistry of the gas is modulated by its mixing with groundwater inputs from overlying and underlying aquifers importantly our work indicates that 50 of the guarani aquifer system groundwater recharge in são paulo state comes from serra geral aquifer system seepage this finding has critical implications regarding groundwater management mass balance calculations and estimations of groundwater residence times keywords guarani aquifer system groundwater mixing hydrochemical facies 1

benefitting from the gas exploitation because the importance of gas the water balance and estimates of groundwater recharge represents a crucial issue to water management hydrochemistry represents a useful tool to characterize the dynamics of groundwater in response to natural or anthropogenic processes e g stigter et al 2006 folch et al 2011 guggenmos et al 2011 despite an abundance of reports on the hydrochemistry of the gas e g silva 1983 meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 reis 2011 results thus far have not significantly improved our understanding of the regional hydrodynamics of the aquifer system there remains a lack of studies focusing on improvements of the basic conceptual flow model and water balance of the gas including

g meng and maynard 2001 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 elliot and bonotto 2017 the extent of these interactions has not been investigated quantitatively because groundwater sources and sinks provide critical information for water management we initiated an investigation of groundwater interactions in the northeast region of the gas in order to improve current understanding of regional groundwater flow dynamics quantitative evaluation of groundwater mixing is a suitable approach to determine the amount of water received and delivered by the gas thereby potentially challenging well stablished conceptual models of the gas being a more or less isolated aquifer system based on insights provided by detailed analysis of available hydrochemical and isotopic data to trace flow dynamics within the gas the present study aims to establish a new conceptual model that focuses on interactions of the gas with the overlying and underlying aquifer systems 2 geology of the paraná basin the paraná basin spans a surface area of nearly 1 5 106 km2 in the central eastern portion of south america representing the remnant of a vast intracratonic sedimentary basin milani et al 2007 the maximum thickness of the paraná basin is about 8 km with a stratigraphic record of nearly 400 million years ranging from the late ordovician to the late cretaceous period fig 1 milani and zalan 1999 recognized six large scale units or supersequencesrio ivaí ordovician silurian paraná devonian gondwana i carboniferous eotriássico gondwana ii meso a neotriassic gondwana iii neojurassic eocretace and bauru neocretaceous in the stratigraphic record of the paraná basin in são paulo state goundwana i comprises the permo carboniferous itararé and passa dois groups the total thickness of these units increases toward the center of the paraná basin with the thickness reaching a maximum of 5000 m milani et al 2007 the itararé group represents the record of post glacial sedimentation in the northeast portion of the paraná sedimentary basin soares 1972 the passa dois group encompasses the irati and corumbataí formations the itararé group is covered by the tatuí formation composed of pelites shales limestone and sandstones associated with deltaic complexes that were progressively drowned by a transgressive marine event barbosa gimenez and caetano chang 2010 the second unit from the passa dois group in são paulo state is represented by the corumbataí formation which mainly consists of reddish siliciclastic rocks both were probably deposited in an extensive shallow inland sea without connection to the ocean rohn 1994 perinotto et al 2008 the gas is composed of the pirambóia formation from gondwana ii triassic units and the botucatu formation from gondwana iii together the gas units have an average thickness of 300 400 m overlying formations ranging from an igneous basement to paleozoic sediments of the passa dois and tubarão groups deposition of the pirambóia formation has been ascribed to a wet eolian system e g donatti et al 2001 giannini et al 2004 maraschin et al 2019 while the botucatu formation is attributed to a dry eolian system donatti et al 2001 scherer and goldberg 2007 lebac

methods 3 1 study area the study area is located in the western part of são paulo state fig 2 in southeast brazil four major aquifer systems occur in the study area permian aquifer system pas guarani aquifer system gas serra geral aquifer system sgas and bauru aquifer system bas because of the complexity of the underlying units of the gas we combined the aquifers of the tubarão and passa dois groups into a single overall aquifer system the pas because our focus was directed toward the gas and any aquifer that potentially could interact with the gas notably the sgas and pas we did not include the surficial bas in our analysis the study area covers approximately 155 800 km2 between 20 24 s and 47 52 w a narrow outcrop zone of gas in the eastern part of the study area covers only 14 415 km2 fig 2 in the remaining area the aquifer is confined by basalts of the serra geral aquifer system sgas which increase in thickness towards the center of the basin the guarani aquifer represents an important source of potable water for several densely populated regions including regionally important cities such as ribeirão preto são josé do rio preto and araraquara 3 2 hydrochemical characterization 3 2 1 chemical analysis of gas the hydrochemical evolution of the gas in the study area has been investigated in a large number of previous studies especially silva 1983 kimmelmann et al 1989 sracek and hirata 2002 frança et al 2003 rocha 2005 gastmans et al 2010 reis 2011 hirata et al 2011 and elliot and bonotto 2017 importantly the present study could use existing data of both the underlying and overlying aquifer systems thus allowing us to develop an understanding of the interactions between these aquifers and the gas previously published information for the study area was compiled to evaluate and characterize the hydrochemistry of the gas we limited our analysis to only são paulo state in the northeastern section of the gas since hydrochemical and isotopic data were available of the underlying and overlying aquifers in this region hydrochemical data for the gas have been reported in numerous studies including those by silva 1983 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 and reis 2011 because most of the samples had been reported in two or more studies we used the most complete datasets presented by gastmans et al 2010 and reis 2011 to reproduce possible reactions related to rock water interactions the mineral composition of the gas was also examined frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 gastmans et al 2010 and hirata et al 2011 provided important contributions regarding the mineralogical characterization of the deep and confined units of the gas while the detrital mineralogy of gas is comprised by quartz and k feldspar the authigenic mineralogy is composed by quartz chalcedony kaolinite montmorillonite illite and calcite frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 hirata et al 2011 3 2 2 chemical analysis of pas the compiled data pertaining to the pas hydrochemistry were subdivided in two groups shallow 500 m and deep 500 m data of the deep pas were obtained from dst drill stem testing analyses performed during oil and gas prospecting carried out in the 1980s results of these analyses were available from technical reports of the brazilian national petroleum agency anp national petroleum agency 2020 table 1 because shallow pas groundwater samples beneath the gas close to the outcrop zone were not available we used data collected in the rio claro municipality oliva and chang 2002 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 these samples should closely resemble those of the pas below the gas since they are only 8 km away from the outcrop zone 3 2 3 chemical analysis of sgas to simulate interactions of the gas and the serra geral aquifer system sgas in são paulo state we adopted the chemical analysis presented by gastmans et al 2017 to investigate the expected hydrochemical characteristics of the sgas we furthermore used the geochemical and mineralogical properties of basalts in são paulo state which were provided by squisato et al 2009 and machado et al 2018 in order to evaluate possible mixing within the wells we examined the siagas database cprm geological service of brazil 2020 by searching for well construction logs and production rates we could verify that the flow rate of gas wells in the region encompassing facies 2 e g bernardino de campos matão avaré normally exceeds 100 m3 h while the production rate of the sgas in the same region rarely exceeds 8 m3 h this means that the contribution of any possible mixing within the well borehole should be less than 10 some deep wells e g presidente epitácio presidente prudente which crossed the pas and hence cause some mixing within the boreholes were not used for the simulations 3 3 conceptual model development a conceptual model for the hydrochemical evolution of the gas groundwater was developed based on the geological framework hydraulic characteristics chemical compositions isotopic characterizations and groundwater dating the detailed analysis of available data allowed us to build a conceptual model describing interactions of the gas with the overlying and underlying aquifer units as well as studying the mechanisms governing hydrochemical changes in the groundwater along the flow paths the conceptual model was used as a reference for the geochemical simulations 3 4 geochemical simulations in order to confirm our hypothesis we performed several numerical simulations of path reactions using the react and spece8 components of the geochemist s workbench 10 package bethke and yeakel 2014 while the speciation was calculated using spece8 the mineral water reactions into the aqueous phase and mixing were simulated using react all reactions were simulated using the geochemist s workbench thermodynamic database thermo com v8 r6 dat speciation calculations involve free ions e g a and b in the mixed solution that possess a certain saturation state with respect to the set of minerals to calculate the saturation state of a mineral phase the ion activity product iap was calculated using eq 1 the log10 values of the iap divided by thermodynamic equilibrium state k of a specific mineral eq 4 defines the saturation index of this mineral si 1 i a p a b 2 s i l o g 10 i a p k when si is less than 0 the solution is unsaturated with respect to the evaluated mineral when si equals 0 the solution is saturated with respect to the mineral and when si 0 the mineral phase is supersaturated leading to precipitation of the mineral phase 3 4 1 chemical speciation and rock water interactions speciation calculations of the compiled data from the gas sgas and pas were carried out to obtain the saturation indices of dissolved minerals in the aqueous phase in the case of the sgas we simulated the water rock interaction to describe the expected groundwater composition associated with tholeiitic basalts 3 4 2 mixing simulations we hypothesized that each hydrochemical facies previously identified in the gas meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 resulted from variable proportions of mixing of the gas water with the pas and sgas under this assumption the existing gas samples were distributed along discernible mixing trends in a standard piper diagram to assess the volume of groundwater coming from both underlying and overlying aquifers into the gas we performed geochemical mixing simulations using a well stablished methodology e g han et al 2010 tubau et al 2014 beyer et al 2016 liu et al 2017 kim et al 2017 in this approach we defined the samples located at the end points of these trends further defined as the end members in our conceptual mixing model an endmember progressively transformed to another endmember by mixing with groundwater flowing from one of the adjacent aquifer systems thus we assumed sample stretching between end members in piper diagram result from a mixture of water from the initial end member and inflowing groundwater from another aquifer system in varying proportions the mixing may be described in the general form eq 3 3 c 1 2 v 1 c 1 v 2 c 2 v 1 v 2 where c 1 2 is the concentration of a mixed water sample v 1 v 2 are respectively the volumes of the initial end member and the mixing proxy of inflowing groundwater from the overlying or underlying aquifer systems in eq 1 the maximum mixing proportion of adjacent aquifer system to produce the solution close to the target end member represents the mixing ratio between gas with underlying or overlying aquifer systems for practical applications eq 3 may be rewritten as eq 4 to obtain the mixing between an initial endmember with discrete volumes of incoming groundwater from the nearby aquifer systems 4 c i δ v i n f l u x i 1 n c i g a s v 1 c 2 n δ v i n f l u x m i n δ v i n f l u x v g a s where c i δ v is the concentration of variable i for each discrete volume of incoming groundwater δ v i n f l u x is the discrete volume of incoming groundwater from the overlying or underlying aquifer systems c i g a s is the concentration of specie i in the initial endmember c i i n f l u x is the concentration of specie i in groundwater incoming from overlying or underlying aquifer systems n is the number of discrete volumes of incoming groundwater causing the mixing and m i is the mass of specie i removed from solution by precipitation of a mineral phase to identify the mixing proxies of overlying and underlying aquifer systems we did run simulations of several distinct samples to evaluate if the progressive mixing did cause overlap of the simulated solutions with the existing analysis in the piper diagram hence producing solutions similar to the target endmember with respect to hydrochemical typology composition and physical chemical parameters ph and electrical conductivity table 2 presents the end member proxies of the pas and sgas used as the mixing source in the simulations the sgas1 composition represented a groundwater sample from sgas as reported by gastmans et al 2017 pas1 represented shallow groundwater of the pas belonging to a na hco3 type solution collected in rio claro oliva and chang 2002 while pas2 is a deep pas from alto alegre obtained from the anp database table 1 using eq 2 the mixing simulations were performed by successive addition of n discrete volumes of incoming sgas1 pas1 and pas2 proxies to produce new solutions thus generating a trajectory in the piper diagram the simulated endmember 2 was produced by mixing of endmember 1 with sgas1 end member 3 was subsequently produced by mixing with pas2 while endmember 4 and 5 were produced by mixing distinct proportions of endmember 3 with pas2 to each liter of gas v g a s we progressively added discrete volume of 50 ml δ v i n f l u x of inflowing groundwater table 2 to produce solutions close to the target end members the mix of two solutions may produce a supersaturation state with respect to the distinct mineral phases which then favors their precipitation to allow the precipitation of supersaturated phases we activated the precipitation function in react a certain amount of specie i m i may then be transferred from solution to precipitated phase the number of added discrete volumes n was optimized by trial and error to produce end solutions close to the selected endmembers of each hydrochemical facies the mixing ratio of influx groundwater of sgas or pas into the gas was calculated using 5 r m i x i n g n v i n f l u x v g a s n v i n f l u x table 3 presents the upper limits of the hydrochemical facies used to calibrate the mixing simulations we also explored alternative geochemical scenarios for simulating rock water interaction to test the capability of those scenarios and to reproduce the transition of camg hco3 to na hco3 facies one scenario involved the hydrolysis of sodium rich silicates such as albite reacting with groundwater in a closed system with respect to co2 a second alternative scenario was tested by simulating cationic exchange in which clay minerals promote ca sorption while na is released as proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 4 results 4 1 hydrochemical characterization of pas the compiled analytical results for the shallow and deep pas indicated considerable heterogeneity with respect to their composition fig 3 demonstrating that deep samples 500 m are more homogeneous and shallow samples 500 m more diverse all groundwater samples from the deep pas exhibited high and variable salinity all being na k cl so4 na k so4 and na cl so4 types table 1 some deep groundwater samples also showed high concentrations of so4 2 cl na k and sr2 table 1 the hydrochemical characteristics of shallow samples were quite variable encompassing ca hco3 na hco3 na cl and mixed types with na hco3 being the dominant type fig 3 the dominance of cahco3 and nahco3 in the shallow portion is due to progressive dilution by inflowing groundwater recharge east of the outcrop zone of gas thereby dissolving and removing soluble salts of cl and so4 2 on other hand in the deep portion cl and so4 2 experienced less dilution causing the concentrations of these species to remain relatively high 4 2 hydrochemical characterization of the sgas the confined section of the gas is covered by basalts of the sgas in são paulo state these basalts are mainly tholeiitic and are rich in ca and mg with minor amounts of na squisato et al 2009 machado et al 2018 based on a typical tholeiitic basalt composition one may expected that the most important rock water reactions are driven by plagioclase and augite dissolution the incongruent dissolution of plagioclase represented by anorthite and augite in an open system with respect to co2 are represented by respectively 6 c a a l 2 s i 2 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 c a

because the sampled data covered a large portion of the study area it was possible to identify typical hydrochemical variations in the sgas all sgas samples reported by gastmans et al 2017 were oversaturated with respect to quartz and saturated with respect to chalcedony while si concentrations showed good correlation with both ca2 and mg2 this scenario fits with groundwater interactions with augite eq 7 however we found that the composition of the samples varied between two endmembers the first being a ca mg hco3 end type and the second a na hco3 end type fig 4 the first group ca mg hco3 end type is expected to be derived from groundwater interactions with tholeiitic basalts whereas the second group na hco3 and mixed types is not entirely sourced from groundwater that underwent interactions with tholeiitic basalts in order to demonstrate that the ca mg hco3 end type of the sgas is produced by interactions with tholeiitic basalts we simulated a reaction of pure water with basalts eqs 1 and 2 in an open system with respect to co2 we adjusted the reacted mass by trial and error and verified that the groundwater of the sgas may be modeled by reacting with 0 024 g of anorthite caal2si2o8 and 0 020 g of albite naalsi3o8 to represent labradorite ca0 5 0 7na0 3 0 5al2si2o8 and 0 03 g of augite camgsi2o6 the produced solution falls within group 1 fig 4 and is supersaturated with respect to chalcedony similar to sgas samples with si 0 56 4 3 hydrochemical characterization of the gas the gas dataset of groundwater analytical results was grouped into five major hydrochemical facies named hydrochemical facies 1 2 3 4 and 5 based on their chemical composition and distance from the outcrop zones fig 5 the groundwater samples followed discernible trends in the piper diagram showing a transition of ca mg hco3 to na hco3 and then to na cl so4 fig 6 these transitions were previously associated with different stages of rock water interaction along the flow path e g silva 1983 meng and maynard 2001 sracek and hirata 2002 gastmans et al 2010 hydrochemical facies 1 encompasses groundwater of the unconfined unit of the gas and is characterized by very low salinity and a highly variable composition resembling meteoric water facies 2 is composed of groundwater of a ca mg hco3 end type in the confined unit and facies 3 is of a na hco3 end type facies 4 and 5 are both of a na cl so4 end type and discernible by their higher salinity and higher cl concentrations in facies 5 comparing so4 2 concentration fig 7 with the hydrochemical facies fig 5 we may consider so4 2 as the key diagnostic parameter for distinguishing hydrochemical facies the main hydrochemical changes in the gas are mediated by so4 2 increases that display clear trends with the concentration progressively increasing towards the western side of the study area fig 6 the distribution of δ13c values within the gas presented by gastmans et al 2010 exhibited a gradient whereby δ13c becomes more positive from the outcrop zone in the east towards the west along the groundwater flow path fig 8 in and close to the outcrop zone δ13c values ranged from 23 7 to 19 consistent with terrestrial calcite dissolution in an open system with respect to co2 in the downgradient of the outcrop zone the δ13c values rose above 12 to reach values above 8 in the west fig 8 4 4 conceptual model based on datasets compiled thus far we built a conceptual model that considers the various hydrochemistry transformations 4 4 1 hydrochemistry of the unconfined gas in the outcrop area the ph of groundwater samples from the gas reflected a buffering effect mediated by an open system with respect to co2 however the system was closed with respect to co2 in areas where the gas is covered by basalts of the sgas thus allowing rapid calcite saturation typically groundwater in the outcrop zones of the gas hydrochemical facies 1 had little mineralization i e electrical conductivities ec 50 μs cm because of limited interaction with the rocks the presence of k feldspar in the pirambóia formation has been commonly observed with authigenic clay and iron oxides frequently filling the pores whereas calcite cementation is less common caetano chang and wu 2006 the main reactions that occur in the outcrop area are k feldspar hydrolysis given by 8 2 k a l s i 3 o 8 c o 2 3 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 2 k 4 s i o 4 h c o 3 and dissolution of calcite cementation through reaction with dissolved co2 9 c a c o 3 c o 2 a q 4 h 2 o c a 2 2 h c o 3 4 4 2 water exchange with the sgas we conceptualized that hydrochemical facies 2 resulted from the mixing of facies 1 and groundwater seepage from the sgas the overlying sgas plays an important role in the geochemistry of the gas studies carried out in a watershed located in the outcropping zones of the gas indicated that groundwater recharge is readily discharged into local baseflow thus the contribution to deep recharge is low to negligible wendland et al 2007 gómez et al 2010 based on the potentiometric maps of the overlying sgas gastmans et al 2017 and the gas gastmans et al 2010 it was possible to identify regions where the hydraulic heads of the sgas are greater than those of the gas fig 9 in these regions there is a potential flux from the sgas to the gas the hydraulic heads of the confined section of the gas close to the outcrop zone are lower than those of the overlying confining layer of the sgas thus allowing potential vertical seepage of groundwater from the basalts to the gas the region of hydrochemical facies 2 overlapped with the region of potential sgas seepage fig 10 the compositional change is described by an increase of ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations to produce a ca mg hco3 water type because of the tholeiitic composition of sgas basalts dissolution of plagioclase eq 1 and especially augite eq 2 in an open system with respect to co2 are the main reactions that release ca2 mg2 hco3 and sio2 aq fluxes from the overlying basalts are most likely the source of ca2 mg2 and hco3 to groundwater of hydrochemical facies 2 in our speciation simulations the majority of sgas samples presented by gastmans et al 2017 contrary to their findings exhibited chalcedony oversaturation thus it is expected that seepage of si rich groundwater from the sgas would result in the precipitation of chalcedony in the gas as demonstrated by frança et al 2003 and hirata et al 2011 in and close to the outcropping zone which roughly coincides with hydrochemical facies 2 thereby supporting the aforementioned interpretation with increased confinement of the gas towards the basin center i e because of increased basalt thickness the potentiometry of the gas becomes higher than that of the sgas thus promoting a flux inversion whereby the ascending groundwater of the gas moves to the overlying basaltic aquifer this upward flow explains the similarity of the sgas and gas samples gastmans et al 2017 above the regions of hydrochemical facies 3 and 4 fig 3 this interpretation is also supported by the exponential decrease in 14c activity as the δ13c ratio increases this scenario fits with the mixing of older water and the isotopic enrichment of dissolved inorganic carbon dic in the gas moreover evidence of mixing of water from the gas within the sgas was previously identified by gastmans et al 2016 on the basis of cluster analysis and mixing simulations using netpath 4 4 3 mixing with pas1 the ca mg hco3 type water observed in the region of hydrochemical facies 2 is replaced by na hco3 type of facies 3 at distance ranging from 20 to 100 km from the outcrop zone as the replacement of the ca hco3 solution with na hco3 was accompanied by an increase in so4 2 and hco3 mixing of groundwater within the gas with groundwater coming from the pas1 is the most likely mechanism for explaining the transition from hydrochemical facies 2 to 3 since this can explain increases in dic na and so4 2 concentrations as well as the isotopic enrichment of δ13c dic it is possible to deduce the composition and proportion of mixed groundwater from the pas1 using mass balance calculations constrained by the composition of facies 2 and the concentration and isotopic signature of dic to estimate the mixture change in the chemical composition from facies 2 to 3 encompasses the follow trends an increase in δ13c from 19 to 11 1 an increase in alkalinity from 80 5 to 172 4 mg l an increase in na from 6 8 to 54 9 mg l an increase of so4 2 from 0 67 to 5 3 mg l a decrease in ca2 from 18 3 to 5 4 mg l and maintenance of a low cl concentration in our interpretation mixing with na so4 hco3 leads to calcite oversaturation and precipitation and consequently the removal of ca2 from the solution this hypothesis is supported by hirata et al 2011 who found calcite cementation at a depth of 900 m in tubular well located in the facies 3 region furthermore our hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the pas1 type waters possess high dic concentrations with enriched δ13c characteristic of marine carbonate 4 4 4 mixing with pas2 the transition of facies 3 4 and then to 5 was generated by the mixing of facies 2 with groundwater seepage from the deeper pas we classified pas groundwater into shallow pas mainly na hco3 and deep pas mainly na so4 cl types mixing of high salinity groundwater with the gas was discussed in previous studies including those by meng and maynard 2001 cresswell and bonotto 2008 gastmans et al 2010 hirata et al 2011 soler i gil and bonotto 2015 and elliot and bonotto 2017 fig 6 illustrates a continuous increase of so4 2 concentrations from the outcrop zone towards the center of the basin thus suggesting the input of groundwater with a high so4 2 concentration according to our conceptual model high salinity pas2 groundwater as represented by the groundwater samples in table 1 causes the increases in na cl so4 and sr2 concentrations along the flow path which reach their maximum in the western section of the gas in addition to this mixing associated with na cl and so4 there are important inputs of dissolved organic carbon dic with δ13c values close to 0 i e typical of marine environments which promote the isotopic enrichment of dic as observed in hydrochemical facies 4 and 5 we interpret the transition from facies 3 to 4 and 5 as progressive mixing with the pas2 with facies 4 representing an intermediate type based on much of evidence the conceptual model was built using the assumption that major changes in hydrochemistry as illustrated in fig 10 are mostly controlled by groundwater exchange of the gas with the sgas and pas aquifer systems 4 5 simulation results of conceptualized flow path reactions the totality of evidence put together in this study strongly indicates that the changes in water composition previously reported for the sag were modulated by mixing with both deeper and shallower aquifers to demonstrate the viability of our conceptual model we performed simulations to reproduce the transitions between the five hydrochemical facies facies 1 represents direct meteoric recharge into the gas facies 2 and 3 represent mixing with the sgas and shallow pas respectively while facies 4 and 5 represent mixing with the deep pas 4 5 1 transition from hydrochemical facies 1 to facies 2 the transition from facies 1 to facies 2 may be mediated by mixture of facies 1 here termed solution 1 with groundwater from the basalts we used data from sample asg sp 11 gastmans et al 2017 and renamed it sgas1 table 2 as a mixing proxy for the simulation the fitted mixing proportions indicated a mixing ratio of 4 1 of sgas1 with solution 1 to produce solution 2 thus indicating that 80 of the groundwater recharge to the gas comes from the sgas basalts thereby generating solution 2 table 4 our simulation results indicated the precipitation of 0 0463 g of quartz per liter of mixed solution this since sgas water was oversaturated with respect to chalcedony opal and quartz 4 5 2 transition from hydrochemical facies 2 to facies 3 sample pas1 was of a na hco3 end type and best represented by a groundwater sample collected from a depth of 199 m in the municipality of rio claro as reported by oliva and chang 2002 table 2 in our conceptual model pas1 groundwater represented the most suitable mixing source to explain the change in groundwater composition from facies 2 to facies 3 by manual optimization we found that a proportion of 3 1 of pas1 groundwater to solution 2 was required to transform facies 2 into facies 3 thus generating solution 3 table 4 mixing of these two at a ratio of 3 1 caused supersaturation leading to the precipitation of 0 0074 g per liter of solution of calcite and 0 0132 g per liter of dolomite thus indicating the removal of ca2 and mg2 from the solution 4 5 3 transition from hydrochemical facies 3 to facies 4 and 5 facies 4 and 5 may be interpreted as a continuum subject to progressive increased mixing with high salinity deep pas2 groundwater pas2 table 2 along the flow path towards the basin center leading to the change from facies 3 to 4 and later to 5 the transition from facies 3 to 4 in the simulation was achieved by mixing a 20 1 ratio of solution 3 with pas2 water to produce solution 4 this caused the precipitation of 0 00223 g of calcite and 0 0005245 g of dolomite for each liter of mixed solution the transition from hydrochemical facies 4 to 5 was simulated next by mixing a 10 1 5 ratio of solution 4 with pas2 to produce solution 5 similar as for the transition from facies 3 to 4 the simulation of the transition from facies 4 to 5 caused the precipitation of 0 00116 g per liter of solution of calcite and 0 00065 g per liter of dolomite thus reducing the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 4 5 4 path reaction of gas evolution optimization of the performed simulations showed that the selected endmembers could be generated by the mixing percentages summarized in table 4 the generated solutions as obtained with the mixing simulations are presented in table 5 comparison of these data with the end member proxies of each hydrochemical facies table 3 indicates that the simulations reasonably well reproduced the hydrochemical evolution in the gas fig 11 illustrates that the flow path of the hydrochemical evolution in the gas from the outcrop zone towards the center of basin is driven by its mixing with sgas and pas the flow path closely overlaps the groundwater samples from the gas distributed along perceptible trends this supports the feasibility of our conceptual model based on interactions of the gas with the overlying sgas and the underlying pas the concentrations of the major cations and anions of the endmember proxies of facies 2 3 4 and 5 table 3 were compared with the simulated solutions 2 3 4 and 5 table 5 in a scatterplot graph fig 12 the linear regression in the scatterplot data indicates very good agreement between the predicted and observed concentrations thus suggesting that mixing plays an important role in the hydrochemical evolution of the gas 4 5 5 alternative scenarios for the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 may be attributable to mechanisms other than simple mixing we therefore simulated two alternative scenarios to verify their feasibilities the first alternative approach involved calcite dissolution accompanied by cation exchange which was previously proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 and gastmans et al 2010 gastmans et al 2010 suggested that groundwater samples falling within the stability field of na montmorillonite are indicative of this interpretation according to this approach a pool of exchangeable cations replaces ca2 with na at the exchange sites 10 c a c o 3 c o 2 a q h 2 o n a 2 x 2 n a 2 h c o 3 c a x another alternative scenario is mediated by albite dissolution and promotion of the release of na and hco3 an increase in hco3 and the consumption of protons then leads to a higher ph thus promoting an increase in calcite saturation hence the concentration of calcite precipitates and ca2 in solution decreases while na remains unaltered the governing equations for this scenario are given by 11 2 n a a l s i 3 o 8 2 c o 2 a q 10 h 2 o 2 n a 2 h c o 3 4 h 4 s i o 4 a l 2 s i 2 o 4 12 2 h c o 3 2 o h 2 c o 3 2 2 h 2 o 13 2 c o 3 2 c a 2 2 c a c o 3 the amounts of calcite and albite dissolution in the first and second alternative scenarios respectively were optimized by trial and error to produce a goodness of fit in the simulations the resulting solutions from all simulated scenarios are summarized in table 6 indicating that cation exchange alternative scenario 1 albite dissolution alternative scenario 2 and mixing main scenario are capable of promoting the transformation of ca mg hco3 type solution 2 table 5 to na hco3 despite the suitability of all tested scenarios alternative scenarios did not produce suitable results since the alkalinity and na concentration were too low compared to hydrochemical facies 3 in the first scenario involving calcite dissolution and cation exchange only 0 004624 g of calcite was dissolved since calcite dissolution was severely constrained by a limited concentration of aqueous co2 in the confined gas the second alternative scenario similarly involved a limited amount of aqueous co2 in the gas for hydrolyzing albite to produce hco3 followed by calcite precipitation moreover neither albite dissolution nor cation exchange could explain the significant enrichment of dic δ13c fig 8 or the increased so4 2 concentration observed in the transition from facies 2 to facies 3 fig 7 4 6 evidence of mixing by sensitive tracers besides the geochemistry mixing is also supported by isotopic evidence from sensitive tracers since different aquifer systems often possess dissimilar isotopic characteristics such tracers may complement evaluations using major cations and anions and thus resolve ambiguous responses possible flow of groundwater from sgas to gas may be also traced using high rare earth element ree concentrations including eu anomalies in gas samples elliot and bonotto 2017 gas samples with high eu and ree concentrations have been observed in bernardino de campos sarutaiá águas de santa bárbara and avaré which are cities located in the hydrochemical facies 2 area fig 10 where groundwater inflow took place from sgas according to our conceptual model because of the marine origin and the deep location 2000 m of pas any mixing with its water with gas fluids should reveal the older age including dic isotopic enrichment with respect to δ13c comparison of the δ13c and alkalinity distributions within the gas fig 13 a indeed indicated that increased alkalinity as seen in fig 8 accompanied of δ13c isotopic enrichment this pattern is perfectly explained by inflow of dic rich groundwater with high levels of δ13c dic aggarwal et al 2015 paired groundwater 81kr dating with dic δ13c data similar to the above dic concentrations fig 13b shows a trend in which δ13c ratios increases linearly with increasing age these trends suggest input of older groundwater with a high concentration of isotopically enriched dic and hence confirm the influx of groundwater from pas calcite precipitation as predicted with our geochemical simulations may promote isotopic fractionation of the remaining dic δ13c experiments of romanek et al 1992 showed that the average enrichment factor of 1 0 0 2 i e αdic calcite of 1 001 for calcite precipitation implies a decrease in δ13c dic which is contrary to the trend observed in the data we evaluated i e enrichment of δ13c dic based on the rayleigh fractionation equation if 50 of dic precipitates as calcite the δ13c of the remaining dic in the solution will present a negative deviation of 0 7 e g 14 0 to 14 7 with respect to the initial signature this shows that calcite precipitation should not promote strong fractionation of dic along the flow path the inflow of deep pas water may be characterized by an increase of na so4 2 and cl as noted by cresswell and bonotto 2008 the increase in cl concentrations in addition to the incompatibility of the 36cl 35cl ratio with respect to continental rainwater strongly suggests the inflow of formational water from deep aquifer systems the inflow of pas water is also supported by soler i gil and bonotto 2015 who demonstrated the marine origin of so4 2 dissolved in gas groundwater 5 discussion the aim of the present study was to better understand the flow conditions and geochemistry of the guarani aquifer system one of most important aquifers in the world despite the large number of studies that have been carried out about this aquifer system there is no consensus regarding most of the processes associated with groundwater recharge gas flow conditions and geochemical reactions that drive the hydrochemistry of the gas to obtain a concise and robust conceptual model we revisited previous studies about the gas the gas previously has been conceptualized mostly as a simple permeable aquifer that is confined by low permeable underlying and overlying units with limited interaction between them and the gas groundwater flow modeling water reserve estimation and management strategies have been based nearly exclusively on this simplification however the findings in our study reveal a more intricate system in which the flow paths and the interactions between the gas and the underlying and overlying aquifer systems are relatively complex consequently much uncertainly still exists about the various processes including of the exact ground recharge quantities groundwater composition can provide important information about the interactions between aquifers systems since hydrochemistry is the result of specific reactions related to rock water interactions that vary within an aquifer unit consequently interpretation of aquifer mineralogy and water chemistry data can indicate the transport of groundwater within and between aquifers the detailed mineralogical analyses carried out by frança et al 2003 caetano chang and wu 2006 and hirata et al 2011 revealed varied mineralogy and diagenetic history however considerable evidence in our current study indicates that it is unlikely that rock water interactions alone did drive the changes that have been observed in the groundwater composition of the gas because of dissimilarities between the hydrochemical samples of the sgas and the pas mixing of the gas with these aquifers offers a more reasonable explanation for the hydrochemistry of the gas figs 6 and 7 show that sulfate and dic concentrations are higher in the vicinity of the structural lineament of tietê coimbra et al 1977 than farther away suggesting that regional and deep discontinuities can play a major role in the mixing of the pas and gas according chang et al 1992 the abundant nw se structural lineaments such as tietê and the ponta grossa dike swarm are associated with extensional stresses induced by the differential spreading rate of plate divergence across the walvis são paulo ridge these nw se lineaments most likely represent important conduits of groundwater mixing since they cut across the aquitards below the gas this scenario perfectly agrees with findings by hindi 2007 who demonstrated a clear structural control of hot springs discharged from the gas seated 500 m below the surface along the nw lineaments using simple mixing simulations to explain the transitions of the groundwater composition within the gas we produced a good match between modeled and observed solutions the simulations produced a rough estimate of mixing between the gas and the underlying and overlying aquifer systems much uncertainty still exists about the actual volumes of incoming groundwater from the pas the mixing proxies we used to change the composition from facies 2 to facies 3 probably represents a diluted version of the actual solution that contributed to the transformation of ca mg hco3 type facies 2 to na so4 hco3 type groundwater facies 3 all observed groundwater types in the gas were represented in the groundwaters of the underlying and overlying units the proposed mixing scenarios provide a reliable explanation for the complex distribution of ages determined by aggarwal et al 2015 via 81kr dating of the oldest samples and 14c dating of the younger samples to exemplify this complexity the determined groundwater age in the municipality of valparaíso located 234 km from the outcrop zone was found to be 567 61 ky whereas in lins located 104 km from the outcrop zone on the same theorical flow path groundwater had been dated as 834 91 ky aggarwal et al 2015 simple mixing of groundwater in the gas with the oldest groundwater from the pas may account for this aging between the two locations another case involves a comparison of groundwater from matão with that from jaú which are located 24 km and 26 km away from the outcrop zone respectively and have reported ages of 2 7 ky and 14 ky respectively aggarwal et al 2015 groundwater sampled from matão may have received relatively young groundwater from the sgas this effectively rejuvenating its groundwater cation exchange proposed by sracek and hirata 2002 as a mechanistic process provided a very feasible explanation for driving the replacement of ca by na despite the absence of mineralogical evidence to validate this assumption still the assumption of sracek and hirata 2002 may be contradicted since there is no evidence that the gas was filled by brackish water to create a pool of exchangeable sites for cation exchange furthermore the gas reportedly was flushed by fresh water between 100 cresswell and bonotto 2008 and 180 times araújo et al 1999 since deposition which should have caused much of the ca2 on all hypothetical exchange sites to be replaced by na additionally the availability of co2 in the aqueous phase serves as a threshold for calcite dissolution by restricting the dic concentration which did not reach the concentration observed in facies 3 we speculate that cation exchange represents an important process for the generation of na hco3 type groundwater in the pas whereby the ca2 produced by carbonate dissolution is replaced by cation exchange na rich silicate hydrolysis could favor ca montmorillonite precipitation thereby releasing na into solution and changing ca hco3 type groundwater to a na hco3 type in the bauru aquifer system however neither of these processes can explain the strong increases in hco3 and so4 2 accompanied by dic δ13c enrichment moreover the pco2 concentration in the confined section of the gas was very low and saturated with respect to calcite thereby preventing calcite dissolution as a mechanism for explaining the increase in hco3 calibration of geochemical simulations required a mixing proportion of 4 l of sgas to each liter of gas table 4 to produce groundwater similar to facies 2 this fact suggests that in the region of facies 2 see fig 5 seepage flow occurred from sgas to gas and that this flow represented most of the groundwater recharge 50 of gas from sgas recharge estimation based on monitoring of water levels in the unconfined section of the gas was unable to produce the actual volumes of water entering the gas our study demonstrates the importance of evaluating seepage from the sgas as a major contribution to groundwater recharge in the gas however a significant volume of water is lost to the overlying sgas where the gas potentiometry surpasses that of the sgas as evidenced by the presence of the na hco3 type groundwater in the sgas which is incompatible with the mineralogy of tholeiitic basalts in the sgas of são paulo state the isotopic analysis presented by gastmans et al 2017 showed that the dic δ13c in the sgas followed a similar trend to that in the gas in that enrichment occured towards the center of the basin the great artesian basin gab represents an important aquifer system with some similarity to gas in terms of regional extent geological framework and age interestingly a recent study presented by radke and ransley 2020 found a similar condition of groundwater exchange with both overlying and underlying aquifers in the great artesian basin the mixing of gab with underlying and overlying aquifers are spatially variable and facilitated by regional geological structures similarly to those identified for the gas our findings in this study have significant implications for conceptual flow modeling of the gas and for water resource management in general the most important outcome of our work is that most of the groundwater recharge from gas in são paulo state is derived from sgas seepage thus our study demonstrates a need to review existing conceptual flow models of the gas to achieve a more correct diagnostic of flow patterns of the aquifer system furthermore current numerical models built to estimate residence times and long term predictions of over exploitation are not particularly representative of the gas because they do not account for important sources and sinks of groundwater from the underlying and overlying aquifers additionality as pointed out by elliot and bonotto 2017 the presumed interactions of the gas and sgas indicate that the gas is far more vulnerability than assumed typically 6 conclusions our results highlight that the composition of the gas within the são paulo state is modulated by mixing with the underlying permian sandstone and overlying cretaceous basalt aquifers ca mg hco3 type groundwater in the recharge areas is altered by mixing with groundwater from the basalts whereas the na hco3 and na so4 cl types are controlled by mixing with the shallow and deep permian aquifers respectively despite the robust evidence from hydrochemical analyses that strong interactions exists between the gas and the underlying and overlying units critical issues regarding these interactions remain unanswered future studies coupling fine scale isotopic analyses robust mixing evaluations appraisals of the role of deep structures driving the mixing and numerical flow simulations for water balance assessments should lead to a better understanding of the various processes and interactions overall we conclude that most of the gas groundwater originates from adjacent aquifers the findings presented in our work very much impact current understanding of the gas hydrodynamics with implications for water management planning water balance calculations and long term predictions of groundwater use in the gas region

8356,study region the atibaia and jacaré guaçu watersheds from the tietê river basin são paulo brazil study focus this study aims to compare estimates of flow sediment yield and nutrients loads obtained from two distinct models with different structures and degree of complexity the generalized watershed loading function gwlf and the soil water assessment tool swat we are particularly interested in understanding under which conditions the use of each model is to be recommended namely when does the addition effort required to run the swat model leads to effective better results as swat s calibration procedure is cumbersome the advantage of using a more detailed and distributed model fails to materialize when detailed data are not available or when monthly estimates are enough gwlf model provides useful results with a reduced data gathering and calibration effort new hydrological insights of the region the joint calibration of both models to two watersheds offered a robust set of parameter values for prevalent conditions of tiête river basin given the existing data set although not all modelled variables are reproduced accurately the performance of both models is adequate when estimating streamflow at a monthly time but decreases when estimating daily flow sediment yield and nutrients loads the poor monitoring of sediments and nutrients concentration hinders the ability to fully calibrate the model s water quality component keywords swat gwlf parsimonious lumped hydrological model distributed hydrological model 1 introduction understanding and evaluating the natural processes occurring in a watershed are continuing challenges for scientists and engineers who often struggle with lack of data as long term watershed monitoring efforts are difficult to maintain due to its cost especially the ones aimed at sediment transport and water quality the use of mathematical models to simulate hydrological processes including water quality is a possible solution to overcome this problem and to extrapolate conclusions from the existing data mirchi et al 2010 hajigholizadeh et al 2018 historically different types of models have been applied to estimate streamflow determine pollution loads and to derive pollutant concentrations in streams and other water bodies watershed models now include these modelling components in a single computer code and can calculate the stream flow and their associated sediment and pollutant loads from meteorological data and land use data water managers use them to evaluate the impacts of climate and land use change on stream flow and water quality and to assess the efficacy of conservation practices quilbé et al 2006 devia et al 2015 the prediction accuracy of each model depends on the model structure availability and quality of input data as well as model parameter values that must be estimated physically based and distributed watershed models that detail the hydrological process occurring in the basin have the potential to be able to reproduce the space time varying fluxes of water and contaminants at various watersheds climates and hydrological environments in principle true physically based models can be used without calibration because their parameters have a physical meaning that can be measured in nature in practice calibration is usually required because measurements are not available for all parameters at all locations and because there are no completely physically based model and all have at a few empirical approximations that require calibration beven 2001 the potential robustness and accuracy of distributed physically based models have a strong appeal to water managers that need to preview future conditions and make decisions under different scenarios although these complex watershed models require a large data and parameter set to characterize the river basin and its hydrological processes the increase of computer power and the advent of geographic information systems have facilitated their use and led to a tendency of using increasingly complex models the swat model is one of such examples with more than 2100 references in scientific journals francesconi et al 2016 several authors have questioned this approach and have shown that simpler and more conceptual models requiring less data are almost as accurate as complex ones and can explain much of the observed values variance and that both simple and complex models will perform poorly in certain cases naef 1981 wilcox et al 1990 michaud and sorooshian 1994 ajami et al 2004 gupta et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 a guiding principle when selecting a model is to find the least complex model that will solve the problem under analysis with the available data this idea is a corollary of the xiii century ocham s principle that states that any unnecessary complexity should be avoided and has been reinforced by several authors that argue for the need to balance parsimony and complexity when selecting a hydrological model young et al 1996 fatichi et al 2016 another inherent problem of complex distributed watershed models with a large parameter set is their calibration and validation procedures and issues related parameter uncertainty overfitting and equifinality beven 2001 to overcome these problems large datasets are needed with a large enough amount of information to enable the identification of the appropriate values to assign to each model parameter the calibration and validation of complex distributed models becomes a cumbersome procedure that requires experienced users as unexperienced users are prone to failure or even to error in this work we compared the results from a lumped parameter model with parsimonious data requirements the generalized watershed loading function gwlf haith and shoemaker 1987 with those obtained by soil water and assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 a semi distributed model with large data requirements the literature reports several applications of gwlf namely in the united states of america haith et al 1992 swaney et al 1996 lee et al 2000 schneiderman et al 2002 tu et al 2009 li et al 2010 niraula 2013 china huang and hong 2010 du et al 2014 and in porto rico wu et al 2007 swat has more than 2100 references in scientific journals francesconi et al 2016 it is our understanding that gwlf has never been applied to brazil case studies and that the number of swat applications for sediment and nutrients load prediction is limited given the scale of the country and the scarcity of monitoring data for such large area research is needed on the implications of spatial and temporal resolution on modelling results previous studies have compared distinct watershed models with different structures and complexity wilcox et al 1990 michaud and sorooshian 1994 parajuli et al 2009 li et al 2010 li and xu 2011 caldwell et al 2015 focusing mainly on the models ability to reproduce streamflow not evaluating their performance of estimating sediment yield and nitrogen and phosphorus loads additionally although physically based models can be used in a daily step most of these papers perform and discuss the model calibration at a monthly time step and do not discuss the difficulty of reproducing daily values of flow sediment and nutrient loads parajuli et al 2009 compared the hydrology sediments and total phosphorus simulation results of annagnps annualized agricultural non point source model and swat models both models provided fair to very good estimates of the monthly streamflow and sediment yield and swat performed consistent well in reproducing total phosphorus niraula 2013 used swat and gwlf to identify the areas contributing the most to the pollution problems of 570 km2 watershed in alabama united states the authors compared the model results at a monthly time scale and concluded that while both models perform well for streamflow swat performed slightly better for sediment nitrogen and phosphorus qi et al 2017 compared swat and gwlf monthly estimates of flow sediment and nitrogen loads for two watersheds in china with different climatic conditions both models performed similarly well in reproducing streamflow and sediment but the results were inconsistent for nitrogen this study evaluates the ability gwlf and swat to predict the daily and monthly variation of streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen load and total phosphorus load in the streams of two watersheds in tietê river basin in são paulo brazil initial model runs immediately indicated that both models needed calibration a growing of published research discusses the challenges and possible solutions to calibrate distributed watershed models e g madsen 2000 gupta et al 2008 yilmaz et al 2008 the results from this research are particular important for calibrating distributed models with a high number of parameters like swat where a manual approach is a cumbersome process which often leads to poor results however as our research focus was the comparison of two models a careful manual calibration had the advantage of providing insights to the role of each parameter and identifying links between the parameters of both models both models were simultaneously calibrated and validated for two river basins using split samples from different monitoring records stations in the two watersheds klemeš 1986 swat and gwlf share some steps in their modelling approach and several parameters as the model s parameters depend on the physical characteristics of the river basin in our study shared parameters have been assigned the same values and others which measure similar concepts have been assigned compatible values the joint calibration of both models to two watersheds offers a way to find a robust set of parameter values for the prevalent conditions of tietê river basin the models ability to reproduce streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at each monitoring station was measured by three indicators computed from the result s deviations from observed measurements the main novelty of this research is the comparison of a complex distributed watershed model swat with a more parsimonious hydrological model we are particularly interested in understanding under which conditions the use of each model is to be recommended namely when does the addition effort required to run the swat model leads to effective better results the calibration of both models was performed jointly for the two case studies with the goal of obtaining consistent parameters values that lead to acceptable results in both river basins the parameters that are common to both models formulations were set to the same values to encourage the robustness and consistency of the model results this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the mathematical formulation of both models as well as the model s calibration and validation procedures section 3 describes the case studies and the available data the research results are discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are offered in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 models description 2 1 1 swat model swat is a continuous simulation model with a daily time step that includes components to simulate weather hydrology sediment soil crop nutrients pesticides agricultural management channel routing and reservoir routing the watershed is partitioned into sub basins each one being further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that have a unique land cover soil slope and management practice combination each sub basin contains at least one hydrologic response unit hru and one main channel the outputs of all hru within each sub basin are the water and mass inflow into the river network at the sub basin outlet neitsch et al 2009 this study used the swat2012 released on 2018 arnold et al 2012 and neitsch et al 2011 provide a detailed description of swat the computation of water flow through the watershed includes the land phase and the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle the first phase computes the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticides reaching the main channel in each sub basin while the second phase traces the movement of water sediments and reaching contaminants through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed neitsch et al 2009 the soil conservation service method scs cn is the default of the model for estimating runoff and was used in this study swat provides two methods for estimating the scs retention parameter and the so called alternative method was selected which allows this parameter to vary with plant evapotranspiration according to neitsch et al 2009 this alternative method was added because the traditional method may predict too much runoff which was the case in our preliminary runs the soil profile is divided into 3 zones the vadose zone and the shallow aquifer contribute to the stream flow while the deep aquifer receives deep percolation from the shallow aquifer but does not contribute to the flow at the watershed outlet the vadose zone is subdivided in soil layers with the number of the layers depending on the soil types that occur in the area the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 is used to estimate erosion and sediment yield from each hru the sediment yield carried by superficial flow on a given day can be calculated by 1 s y t 11 8 h t t t p e a k a h r u 0 56 k s c p l s c f r g where s y t is the sediment yield carried by superficial flow on a given day ton h t is the daily surface runoff volume mm t

factor ls is the usle musle topographic factor and cfrg is the coarse fragment factor the cfrg can be calculated by 2 c f r g e x p 0 053 r o c k where rock is the percentage of soil particles with a diameter larger than 2 mm in the first soil layer the total sediment load reaching the stream s t t is the sum of the sediments transported by superficial runoff s t s and by lateral and ground flow s t l g 3 s t t s t s s t l g in swat model the sediment transported by superficial runoff s t s is computed from total sediment yield from the watershed s y t assuming that part is temporarily retained in the watershed by vegetation or in ponds a lag is applied to 4 s t s s y t s y t 1 1 e x p s u r l a g t c o n c where s t s is the sediment reaching the channel in day t ton and s y t and s y t 1 are the amounts of sediment load generated in the hru on days t and t 1 ton the expression 1 e x p s u r l a g t c o n c in eq 4 represents the fraction of the total available sediment allowed to enter the reach on any one day tconc is the hru time of concentration hrs and surlag is the surface runoff lag coefficient in large subbasins with a time of concentration greater than 1 day only a portion of the surface runoff will reach the main channel on the day it is generated swat incorporates a surface runoff storage feature to lag a portion of the surface runoff release to the main channel neitsch et al 2002 swat assumes that lateral and groundwater flow transport sediment to the main channel and estimates this load by 5 s t l g l t g t a h r u s c 1000 where s t l g is the sediment loading in lateral and groundwater flow ton l t is the lateral flow for a given day mm g t is the groundwater flow for a given day mm a h r u is the area of the hru km2 and s c is the concentration of sediment in lateral and groundwater concentration specified by the user mg l the sediment reaching the channel is routed considering deposition and erosion as a function of the sediment load and flow transport capacity the model computed the sediment transport capacity using a modification of bagnold s equation bagnold 1977 swat considers two inorganic forms of nitrogen nitrate no3 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 and three organic forms of nitrogen active stable and fresh organic n as well as three organic forms of phosphorus active stable and fresh organic p and three inorganic forms of phosphorus stable active and solution mineral p ammonia and nitrate are associated with fertilizer usage the stable and active organic p pools are associated with the soil humus and fresh organic p is associated with crop residue and microbial biomass neitsch et al 2005 2 1 2 gwlf model gwlf assumes a daily time step and uses the soil conservation service method based on the curve number concept scs cn to estimate runoff ht groundwater flow gt and the total flow in the downstream section of the hydrographic basin tt calculation process were presented in santos et al 2018 the sediment yield is computed by the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and nitrogen and phosphorus loads are estimated from average nutrient concentrations based on land use the gwlf model assumes that contaminants are transported in solid or dissolved phase with the solid phase contaminants coming from rural and urban areas and the dissolved contaminants coming from point sources rural areas and groundwater as such all contaminant loads from point sources and groundwater are only in dissolved phase and the contaminant loads from urban sources are only in solid phase sediment yield s t t is calculated by considering separately the soil loss and its subsequent transport through the runoff haith et al 1992 the mean soil loss due to water erosion per unit area and time t ton ha day p s t can be estimated by the usle 6 p s t r t k s l s c p where r t is the rainfall erosivity factor mj mm h ha in time interval t k s is the soil erodibility factor of soil types ton mj mm l is the topographic factor that expresses the length of the slope km s is the topographic factor that expresses the slope of the terrain or the degree dimensionless c is the factor that expresses the use and management of the soil and culture dimensionless and p is the factor that represents the conservationist dimensionless practices the r factor was calculated from the equation developed by lombardi and moldenhauer 1980 for campinas são paulo brazil based on 22 years of rainfall records a high correlation was found between measured soil erosion data and an erosion index computed from the rainfall record based on a proposition from fournier 1960 the erosion index is estimated from the following equation 7 e m 68 730 p t m 2 p t y 0 841 where em is defined as the monthly average erosion index mj mm h year p t m is the average monthly precipitation mm e p t y is the average annual precipitation mm according to lombardi and moldenhauer 1980 the annual erosivity factor r is the sum of the erosion index monthly values for this study the equation was adapted to enable the calculation of r with a daily time step 8 r t p t d 2 t m p t d 2 e m where p t d is defined as the daily precipitation mm sediment yield stt ton is the product of soil loss and sediment delivery rate sdr 9 s t t p s t s d r sdr is the ratio between the sediment yield reaching a given river cross section and the sediment production from erosive processes occurring in the watershed upstream of the cross section vanoni 1975 proposed the following equation for the estimation of sdr 10 s r d 0 42 a 0 125 where a is the drainage area of the river basin in square miles the total of sediment yield s t t t o t a l ton was improved by the authors for implement the sediment yield product by the basin in the day before according to the eq 11 11 s t t t o t a l p s t s d r 1 s r d s t t 1 the total nitrogen n and phosphorus p load can be calculated according to the following formulations 12 n t d n t d p n t d r n t d g p t d p t d p p t d r p t d g 13 n t s n t s r n t s u p t s p t s r p t s u where n t d and n t s are respectively the dissolved and solid phase nitrogen loads and p t d and p t s are the dissolved and solid phase phosphorus loads the exponents dp dr and dg are relative to the loads of dissolved contaminants from point sources rural areas and groundwater respectively and sr and su relate to the solid phase contaminant loads from rural areas and urban areas respectively next the equations presented for the calculation of the nitrogen loads are applied in the same way for the calculation of the phosphorus loads the load of contaminants from point sources n t d p mg can be calculated according to eq 14 14 n t d p s p o p p o p n c d p 1 r 1 n 1 s p o p p o p n c d p 1 r 2 n t t where pop is the estimated population of the study area hab spop is the percentage of the population that has sewage treatment system n c d p is the concentration of nitrogen in the effluent from point sources r 1 n is the rate of nitrogen removal by the sewage treatment system and r 2 n is the rate of removal of nitrogen from areas without sewage treatment system according to abnt 2011 the composition of sanitary sewage has an average of 6 112 g hab day of total nitrogen and 1 5 g hab day of total phosphorus the load of dissolved contaminants from the rural area n t d r mg can be calculated from the following formulation 15 n t d r k n c k d r h k t a k where n c k d r is the concentration of dissolved contaminants mg l from rural areas depending on the land use k hk is the surface runoff mm on day t ak is the area of land use k m2 the average concentrations of dissolved contaminants from rural areas were adapted from haith et al 1992 and li et al 2010 and are shown in table 1 the solid phase contaminant load from the rural area n t s r g is calculated from the stt ton sediment yield and the mean sediment concentration n c k s r mg kg dependent on the land use k 16 n t s r n t s r s t t according to li et al 2010 the mean concentrations of solid phase sediments from rural sources n c k s r and p c k s r are in the ranges of 500 to 900 mg kg and 120 to 393 mg kg for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations respectively the load of contaminants from solid phase urban areas n t s u mg is calculated from the following formulation 17 n t s u w k t a k n c k s u where wkt is the first order washing coefficient a k is the area ha for land use k and n c k s u is the concentration of nitrogen in urban areas kg ha the washing coefficient expresses the relationship between the surface runoff from urban areas and the accumulation and washing of contaminants sartor and boyd 1972 amy et al 1974 this concept is used in the swmm model huber and dickinson 1988 and the storm model hydrologic engineering center 1977 and can be estimated by 18 w k t 1 e 0 181 h k t where hkt is the surface runoff mm referring to land use k on day t the values of accumulation of contaminants in urban areas n c k s u and p c k s u were adopted from haith et al 1992 in areas with a medium to a high population density the daily rate of accumulation of urban contaminants varies from 0 028 to 0 031 kg ha for nitrogen and from 0 002 to 0 007 kg ha for phosphorus the load of contaminants in groundwater n t d g mg can be obtained by 19 n t d g n c d g a g t where n c d g is the concentration of contaminants in groundwater mg l a is the river basin area m² and g t is the contribution of the groundwater flow mm to the river the concentrations of contaminants dissolved in groundwater n c d g were determined from standard values in the groundwater available in li et al 2010 in this study a range of 0 1 to 19 mg l for nitrogen concentration and a range of 0 01 to 0 1 mg l for phosphorus concentration in groundwater were considered in this study the gwlf method was programmed within microsoft excel using vba programming language to take advantage of ms excel native flexibility and functionality to manage and analyse data and model results 2 2 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of both models was performed jointly for the two case studies with the goal of obtaining consistent parameters values that lead to acceptable results in both river basins the parameters that were shared between both models were assigned the same values and the parameters measuring similar concepts were assigned compatible values to reflect their physical nature and their dependence on the watershed s characteristics it is true that as the models have a different formulation the consequences of assigning a particular value to a given parameter are different in each model however in our case that the option to assign similar values to the shared parameters did not significantly degrade the model s performance a split sample test validated the results klemeš 1986 the first 3 years 1987 1989 were used as a warmup period to minimize uncertain initial conditions two subsequent and independent periods were used for calibration 1990 2000 for jacaré guaçu river basin and 1990 2003 for atibaia river basin and for validation 2000 2009 for jacaré guaçu river basin and 2003 2015 for atibaia river basin to facilitate the comparison between the model results the same dataset of daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were used in both models for the lumped model the average precipitation and evapotranspiration over the whole watershed were computed as weighted averages of the precipitation and evapotranspiration values of each sub basin as assigned by swat the calibration considered the optimization of multiple objectives namely deviations from different aspects of the flow hydrographs sediment loads and nutrients loads all measured at multiple sites the result of multi objective optimization problem is a set of pareto optimum solutions in our case since the calibration was done manually decisions were made along the process to retain the best single parameter set that offers a good equilibrium of reaching the different objectives the calibration adopted a systematic procedure madsen 2000 which first focused on reproducing precipitation partition and the overall water balance of each basin it then proceeded to reproduce the records of high and low stream flows and their timing finally the attention focused on the sediment load data and on the nitrogen and phosphorus data the parameters that are common to both models formulations were set to the same values to encourage the robustness and consistency of the model results the calibration focused on the parameters which most affect the models results this set of parameters was identified based on literature review and in the case of swat also based on a sensitivity analysis executed prior to the calibration effort neitsch et al 2001 lenhart et al 2002 arnold et al 2012 bonumá et al 2013 strauch et al 2013 me et al 2015 malagó et al 2017 this is an important step as the number of parameters in swat hinders the possibility of manually calibrating all parameters the sensitivity analysis was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting method sufi2 offered by the swat cup program for each model parameter the sufi2 method computes the range of values that brackets most measured data within the model results abbaspour et al 2007 the parameters with the shortest range are the ones which the model results are most sensitive too the model s calibration for sediment yield nitrogen and phosphorus loads was executed by changing the parameters associated with each soil type and land use thus affecting pollutant loads and concentration in the whole watershed 2 3 indicators to evaluate the model s performance to evaluate the model s performance in reproducing the historical stream flows and water quality records the following set of indicators was used the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 computes the sum of the squared difference between the model results and historical data and normalizes the results with sum of the squared difference between the historical data and its average eq 20 20 n s e 1 t t o b s t t s i m 2 t t o b s t t o b s 2 where t t o b s is observed value t t o b s is average observed value t t s i m is computed value t t s i m is average computed value the value of nse ranges from to 1 0 with the latter being the optimal value values between 0 5 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance whereas negative indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the computed value moriasi et al 2007 the percent bias pbias measures the average difference between the computed and measured values over a specified period 21 p b i a s t t o b s t t s i m t t o b s 100 values of pbias close to 0 reveal a smaller deviation of the model results from the measured values but higher values for pbias are acceptable when the measured values accuracy is relatively poor the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the measured data variance that is explained by the model the coefficient r2 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a good adjustment as r2 only quantifies the dispersion a model which systematically overestimates or under estimations all the time will still result in good r2 values close to 1 0 even if all predictions were inexact krause et al 2005 22 r 2 t t o b s t t o b s t t s i m t t s i m 2 t t o b s t t o b s 2 t t s i m t t s i m 2 moriasi et al 2007 argued that the performance of a hydrological using a monthly time step can be considered satisfactory if nse 0 5 and r2 0 5 but that shorter time steps lead to poorer performances several authors have decided to accept the swat calibration when nse computed with daily flows is above values in the range of 0 15 to 0 3 benham et al 2006 coffey et al 2004 nejadhashemi et al 2012 showing how difficult is to model the highly variable and non linear hydrological processes at a daily time step especially when measured values may have significant measurement gaps and errors 3 study cases 3 1 watershed data the case studies are two tributary basins from the tietê river one of the largest tributaries of the paraná river basin and one of the main rivers of the state of são paulo fig 1 the first study area is the jacaré guaçu river basin upstream of cruzes river confluence with an area of 1934 km2 and the second one is the atibaia river basin with an area of 2818 km2 that covers municipalities from são paulo and minas gerais states the jacaré guaçu river basin has its sources in serra de itaqueri são carlos são paulo state brazil and flows into the ibitinga reservoir the altitude of the river basin ranges from 551 m at the outlet to 930 m in the southeast part of the basin the annual average precipitation is 1470 mm with most of the rain falling from october to march the basin relief influences the rainfall spatial distribution with higher amounts of rainfall falling in the upper parts of the basin in the southeast the jacaré guaçu river basin spreads over the guarani aquifer system gas one of the world s largest aquifer and an important source of drinkable water for several cities including campo grande ribeirão preto são josé do rio preto and araraquara among others rabelo et al 2004 the atibaia river basin spreads from its outlet at the junction of the atibainha and cachoeira rivers and to the sources of cachoeira river in minas gerais state the altitude ranges between 508 m to 1973 m at the outlet in the west a mountain range runs in the west and south of the river basin the annual average precipitation is 1520 mm with most of the rain falling from october to march agriculture crops and mixed forests are the dominant land uses in both river basins because of a trend in the recent decades in the state of são paulo that saw an intensification of the agricultural activity and the substitution of many crops by sugarcane and orange trees alkimim et al 2015 and strassburg et al 2017 reforestation is also a significant activity in the atibaia river valley near its confluence with the piracicaiba river mainly due to the proximity of the paper and pulp industries located in the municipalities of americana paulínia and campinas comitê das bacias hidrográficas dos rios piracicaba capivari e jundiaí cbh pcj 2006 3 2 input data a swat run requires a digital elevation model dem as well as soil and land use digital maps a 30 m resolution dem was obtained for both river basins from the srtm shuttle radar topography mission the soil types of both river basins were identified in a soil map produced by embrapa empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária the jacaré guaçu river basin holds eight soil types including red yellow latosol covering 55 4 of the river basin area typic quartzipsamment 13 2 typic eutrorthox 10 6 typic haplortox 6 5 typic paleudalf 5 1 litololic soils 4 6 hydromorphic soils 4 2 and argiudoll 0 4 the atibaia river basin holds three main soil types including red yellow latosol covering 61 0 of the river basin area typic haplortox 37 8 typic eutrorthox 1 2 the embrapa map shows that red yellow latosol typic haplortox and typic eutrorthox soils cover 100 of the atibaia river basin and 72 of jacaré guaçu river basin red yellow soils are deep soils with a low clay content typic haplortox soils are several meters deep and are quite rich in clay and nutrients finally typic euthorthox soils are weathered soils highly permeable and with a variable clay content and low nutrients content swat also requires data on 14 additional soil parameters which were obtained from freire et al 1978 oliveira and prado 1984 lombardi neto et al 1989 and saxton and rawls 2006 a landsat thematic mapper satellite image from the second semester of 2001 with a spatial resolution of 30 30 m was used to describe land use of jacaré guaçu river basin seven types of land use were identified in the basin agriculture covering 35 66 of the river basin area water 3 32 range grasses 3 63 forest mixed 5 02 urban areas 13 57 pasture 17 16 and sugarcane 21 64 to describe the land use of the atibaia river basin a map produced by the water resources management unit ugrhi 5 based on a visual interpretation of a spot image from 2013 with 2 5 m spatial resolution was used ugrhi 5 2013 eight types of land use were identified in the basin forest mixed covering 43 5 of the river basin area mineral transportation 0 04 sugarcane 1 4 water 1 9 range grasses 3 0 agriculture 3 8 urban area 17 0 and pasture 29 3 the meteorological and hydrological data for both river basins were obtained from the databases of two government agencies ana agência nacional de águas and daee departamento de águas e energia do estado de são paulo in the jacaré guaçu river basin 10 rain gages 3 hydrographs gages 62767500 568 km2 62760005 230 9 km2 and 62772500 1135 km2 and one water quality gage 62772500 were selected based on their location and record completeness fig 1 data on temperature data humidity wind speed and solar radiation was obtained from one gage operated by crhea centro de recursos hídricos e ecologia aplicada located in the basin in the atibaia river basin 17

on temperature data humidity wind speed and solar radiation was obtained one weather gage operated by esalq escola superior de agricultura luiz de queiroz located near to the basin missing precipitation data were completed with the records from neighbour using multi regression the coefficient of determination r2 of all regression equation was always greater than 0 6 4 results and discussion a review of the relevant literature identified 17 parameters to which swat results are most sensitive table 2 to select among these the most important ones for flow prediction two independent runs of swat cup were performed one for each case study that led to the same 10 parameters also highlighted in table 2 the table groups the parameters by model component namely groundwater flow surface retention river hydraulics soil characteristics as well as sediment and nutrients transport for each parameter the table indicates the expected range of values the default value and the final value obtained after calibration calibrated values the preliminary swat runs using the parameters default values lead to an overestimation of the observed stream flow record particularly the high flow values the calibration procedure thus proceeded to reduce these peak flows curve numbers cn2 were reduced by 20 uniformly across the watershed to promote infiltration and base flow at the expense of stormflow available water capacity of the topsoil layer sol awc was also reduced by 50 to reduce the soil holding capacity increase groundwater percolation and to delay the flow reaching the river the soil evaporation compensation factor esco was reduced to 0 4 to promote the evaporative demand from lower soil levels the parameter gw revap a coefficient reflecting the capability to move water from the shallow aquifer to the overlaying unsaturated soil zone was set to 0 12 which indicates more water is available for baseflow discharge the revapmn defining the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for return flow to the root zone to occur was set to 300 mm once the magnitude and the variability of base flow and hydrograph peaks were reproduced the overall water balance was adjusted using the rchrg dp parameter the value for rchrg dp was set to 0 04 which means that 4 of infiltrated water is lost to a deep aquifer canmx describing the storage capacity of a canopy to hold intercepted precipitation was set to 60 the value of ch k1 e ch k2 indicating the rate of water loss from streams to ground water was set to 5 mm hr and 3 2 mm hr which assumes the presence of losing streams within the watersheds gitau and chaubey 2010 according to arnold et al 2012 the threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer required for the return flow to occur gwqmn and the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf are also important in calibration at the beginning of calibration the base flow was very low so the gwqmn value was decreased from 1000 to 300 mm to regulate the movement of water inside the aquifer the variable alpha bf affects the shape of the hydrograph and it was necessary to decrease this parameter to 0 001 the groundwater delay time gw delay which reflects the time lag that it takes water in the soil to enter the shallow aquifer was decreased to 20 days the overall water balance for both river basins computed by both models is very similar and lead to an average annual outflow from the basin within 5 of observed stream flow in most cross sections water losses to deep aquifer are around 3 of precipitation the manning s n parameter for the main channel ch n1 were set to 0 03 which are assigned to normal channels with clean structure full stage no riffs or deep pools chow 1959 regarding the parameters related to soil characteristics the slope length for lateral subsurface flow slsoil related to the interflow generation was adjusted for 40 m the weighing coefficient for calculating retention dependent of plant evapotranspiration cncoef was modified to 1 6 table 3 shows the default values of scs cn and gwlf models parameters suggested by the literature haith shoemaker 1987 haith et al 1992 li et al 2010 niraula 2013 based on watershed characteristics as well as the values obtained following calibration the lumped model parameters affecting streamflow are the curve number cn the river basin water storage capacity umax the groundwater recession constant α and the deep recharge coefficient β these parameters were calibrated for each hydrometric station sub basin starting at the upstream hydrometric stations moving to the intermediate stations and finally to the downstream station in both study cases the cn values were reduced from the original value to increase infiltration the river basins water storage capacities umax were also reduced from default values to reduce evapotranspiration and increase infiltration this need was also felt calibrating the corresponding parameters of swat which are cn2 and sol awc respectively the groundwater recession constant α was set to lower values than the originals therefore reducing the response time to recharge during swat calibration the corresponding parameter alpha bf was also reduced from the default value figs 2 and 3 compare the daily and monthly measured stream flow at the downstream station of jacaré guaçu river basin 62772500 with the computed flow by swat and gwlf models figs 4 and 5 compare the daily and monthly measured stream flow at the downstream station of atibaia river basin upstream the reservoir 4009 with the computed flow data table 4 and 5 shows the obtained values for each performance indicator and study cases all figures and tables separate the calibration period october 1991 to september 2003 from the validation period october 2003 to october 2016 the results show that both models can reproduce the daily flow variability for both study cases although failing to replicate all values accurately particularly some of largest daily flow measurements which are overestimated fig 4 the gwlf model significantly overestimates the daily flow values at specific periods namely in 1994 95 1995 96 2001 02 and 2002 03 at the jacaré guaçu river basin these streamflow values are the result of high precipitation values which gwlf model formulation does not attenuated as much as the swat formulation the computed daily streamflow results show some fluctuation around the observed values which may be due the scs methodology used in both models it seems that in days of high precipitation the daily precipitation excess is probably overestimated and is not distributed as flow throughout the following days when model results are aggregated at a monthly time step the peak flows are reproduced with reasonable accuracy with the gwlf model presenting a slightly better adjustment to the observed values than swat figs 3 and 5 the observed fluctuation in daily values disappears as it is aggregated within each month the performance indicators nse pbias and r2 values presented in table 4 and table 5 corroborate these conclusions the indicators show that the models ability and particularly gwlf to reproduce streamflow at a daily time step is poor at all monitoring stations of jacaré guaçu river basin and near to satisfactory in most monitoring stations of the atibaia river basin the values obtained with daily streamflow are low but not unusual as the results from benham et al 2006 and coffey et al 2004 show as expected the values obtained for the calibration periods are usually better than the values obtained for the validation period at a monthly timestep both models have a reasonable performance with nse ranging from 0 42 to 0 89 and continue to perform better at the atibaia river basin than at jacaré guaçu river basin the worse model performance in reproducing streamflow at jacaré guaçu river basin may be due to difficulties of simulating surface water groundwater interactions as this basin spreads over the guarani aquifer system the poor model performance may also be due to the poor quality of monitoring data namely precipitation and streamflow as some authors have already pointed out e g monteiro 2016 pontes et al 2016 in particular the model performance is strongly conditioned by precipitation estimates and thus by precipitation data availability and monitoring stations location the precipitation records of jacaré guaçu river basin show 13 18 of missing data against 3 04 of missing data in the precipitation records of atibaia river basin and whereas the rain gages density in both basins is similar 1 06 gages per 100 km2 in jacaré guaçu river basin and 0 51 gages per 100 km2 in atibaia river basin some smaller watersheds are not well covered by the precipitation monitoring network a good example of this challenge is the river basin of the jacaré guaçu upstream station 62760005 which spreads over a mountainous region and is monitored by a single precipitation station the best model performance is obtained at the downstream stations of both river basins 62772500 and 4009 where nse are always above 0 55 even for the validation period the model s better performance at the downstream stations indicates that the aggregating effect arising from larger watersheds facilitates the model s calibration existing deficiencies in estimating flow at a local scale due to weak monitoring or poor representation of the watershed characteristics do not have a significant impact at a larger scale a similar aggregating effect also explain why the models results aggregated at a monthly time step compare better with observed values than when this comparison is performed at a daily time step both models and gwlf in particular have difficulty in reproducing the flow variability at shorter time periods overall the results show that although swat has a better performance in reproducing the daily flow values this comparative advantage is not evident at a monthly time step to reproduce sediment yield with swat the usle equation support practices parameters usle p was identified as the most important one and was set to 0 8 in both study cases which indicates the existence of conservation practices in the basin what is actually found in the field the coefficient in the sediment transport equation spcon calibrated was set to 0 01 which indicates a larger amount of sediment entering the channel the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 and the channel coverage factor ch cov2 are factors that also influence the transport of sediments in the channel since they determine the channel susceptibility to erosion and the channel protection to erosion both parameters were set to 0 1 indicating a low susceptibility to channel erosion in swat the nitrogen loads are mostly sensitive to the nitrogen percolation coefficient nperco and to the nitrate concentration in the shallow aquifer shallst n while the phosphorus loads are sensitive to the initial organic p concentration in soil layer sol orgp to the phosphorus percolation coefficient pperco and to the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient phoskd in gwlf the most relevant parameters are related to the dissolved contaminants in rural areas n c k d r and p c k d r the computed values of sediment yield total nitrogen and phosphorus loads were compared with bi monthly measurements performed at jacaré guaçu quality station 62776400 from january 2001 to december 2010 and at atibaia quality stations 2605 and 62691200 from january 2009 to december 2016 the comparison between the models results and the observed values is hindered due to the bimonthly sampling interval of the latter values table 6 shows the computed performance indicators for both models and for both cases studies figs 6 7 and 8 compare the sediment yield values swat sediment yield estimates present a higher variability than the gwlf estimates at times exceeding the observed peak values the gwlf model generates a smoother time series of results that underestimate both the observed values and the swat estimates during recession periods this is mostly because gwlf applies the usle equation with rainfall intensity representing the erosive factor while swat resorts to the musle equation using runoff volume and peak flow rate to compute the sediment yield the smoother variability of streamflow when compared to precipitation resulting from surface runoff storage that lags precipitation and runoff release to the main channel dampens the sediment variability swat also uses sediment transport equations to simulate erosion and deposition along the main channel from the figures both models are able to reproduce the order of magnitude and the major variations of the sediment yield although not with accuracy table 6 shows that gwlf leads to better sediment yield estimates especially in the atibaia river basin computed values where nse and r2 reach values close to 0 5 figs 9 10 and 11 compare the total nitrogen load values computed for and measured at the three monitoring stations both models can reproduce the order of magnitude of the observed values during low flows but offer highly variable estimates that significantly exceed the by monthly observed values the performance indicators values table 6 confirm this poor performance with the gwlf model showing slightly better results figs 12 13 and 14 compare the total phosphorus load values computed for and measured at the three monitoring stations the results of both models for the station located in the jacaré guaçu river basin presented a good fit for the low observed values but fail to predict the peaks fig 12 swat modelled peak values present a delay when compared with the gwlf estimates due to the runoff lag equation used by the swat the performance indicators suggest that swat performs slightly better than gwlf overall the phosphorus estimates from both models but particularly from swat are better than the nitrogen estimates the difficulties in reproducing nutrients loads and sediment transport also arise from the accumulation of estimation errors all through the computing sequence from stream flow to sediment transport and finally to nutrients loads 5 conclusions the research showed the difficulty hydrological models have to reproduce daily flows from meteorological daily data in real case situations where the existing precipitation dataset is limited and is not able to fully represent the time and space variability of this variable when the models results are aggregated at monthly time step to be compared with the corresponding observed values the models performance improves significantly the same aggregating effect also explains why the model s performance better at the downstream stations monitoring larger upstream areas the swat model has a slight better overall performance in reproducing the daily flow values than gwlf but this comparative advantage is not clearly shown at a monthly time step showing that the effort in required to calibrate validate and run more complete and distributed models may not pay off when detailed precipitation data is not available simpler lumped models may lead to equally accurate results when estimating sediment yield the models can reproduce the order of magnitude and the major variations of the sediment yield although not with significant accuracy the model s performance to reproduce n and p loads is poor in particularly the nitrogen loads as the phosphorus loads are better correlated with sediments yield the model estimates are slightly better when compared with the observed values once again the swat performance to estimate sediment nitrogen and phosphorus loads is slightly better than gwlf but this comparative advantage may not compensate the additional effort calibrate and validate it models are useful for decision making if they can capture the main signals of the hydrological processes even if they do not accurately reproduce the finer variability of some variables our research showed that gwlf model is a useful decision support tool for preliminary studies at a monthly time step given the straightforwardness to calibrate and apply the model when detailed data is available and when estimates are needed for shorter time periods and smaller and more diverse areas swat ability to simulate watershed processes in detail has the potential to lead to better results if an adequate dataset is available to calibrate and validate the model and given its more complete and physically based formulation swat is also expected to produce robust results and perform better at situations not used during its calibration the research showed that when there are weaknesses in the existing dataset for model calibration and validation both a more complete model swat and a parsimonious model gwlf fail to reproduce the finer variability of some variables at a daily time step namely streamflow sediment loads and nutrients concentration in such cases a sensitivity analysis of the input variables and the model parameters may help convey an indication of the model s results uncertainty the research also put in evidence some results than can be used to improve the model s performance swat methods to estimate areal average areal precipitation over each hru could be improved concerning gwlf the use of the original the soil conservation service method scs cn by gwlf for estimating runoff leads to a highly variable time series that often overestimates flow peaks and total flow volume and the use of the usle equation with rainfall intensity representing the erosive factor and the non consideration of erosion and deposition along the main channel also leads to highly variables sediment and phosphorus loads estimates in the future it may be possible to improve gwlf formulation to confront these problems and improve is performance while maintaining the models

8356,study region the atibaia and jacaré guaçu watersheds from the tietê river basin são paulo brazil study focus this study aims to compare estimates of flow sediment yield and nutrients loads obtained from two distinct models with different structures and degree of complexity the generalized watershed loading function gwlf and the soil water assessment tool swat we are particularly interested in understanding under which conditions the use of each model is to be recommended namely when does the addition effort required to run the swat model leads to effective better results as swat s calibration procedure is cumbersome the advantage of using a more detailed and distributed model fails to materialize when detailed data are not available or when monthly estimates are enough gwlf model provides useful results with a reduced data gathering and calibration effort new hydrological insights of the region the joint calibration of both models to two watersheds offered a robust set of parameter values for prevalent conditions of tiête river basin given the existing data set although not all modelled variables are reproduced accurately the performance of both models is adequate when estimating streamflow at a monthly time but decreases when estimating daily flow sediment yield and nutrients loads the poor monitoring of sediments and nutrients concentration hinders the ability to fully calibrate the model s water quality component keywords swat gwlf parsimonious lumped hydrological model distributed hydrological model 1 introduction understanding and evaluating the natural processes occurring in a watershed are continuing challenges for scientists and engineers who often struggle with lack of data as long term watershed monitoring efforts are difficult to maintain due to its cost especially the ones aimed at sediment transport and water quality the use of mathematical models to simulate hydrological processes including water quality is a possible solution to overcome this problem and to extrapolate conclusions from the existing data mirchi et al 2010 hajigholizadeh et al 2018 historically different types of models have been applied to estimate streamflow determine pollution loads and to derive pollutant concentrations in streams and other water bodies watershed models now include these modelling components in a single computer code and can calculate the stream flow and their associated sediment and pollutant loads from meteorological data and land use data water managers use them to evaluate the impacts of climate and land use change on stream flow and water quality and to assess the efficacy of conservation practices quilbé et al 2006 devia et al 2015 the prediction accuracy of each model depends on the model structure availability and quality of input data as well as model parameter values that must be estimated physically based and distributed watershed models that detail the hydrological process occurring in the basin have the potential to be able to reproduce the space time varying fluxes of water and contaminants at various watersheds climates and hydrological environments in principle true physically based models can be used without calibration because their parameters have a physical meaning that can be measured in nature in practice calibration is usually required because measurements are not available for all parameters at all locations and because there are no completely physically based model and all have at a few empirical approximations that require calibration beven 2001 the potential robustness and accuracy of distributed physically based models have a strong appeal to water managers that need to preview future conditions and make decisions under different scenarios although these complex watershed models require a large data and parameter set to characterize the river basin and its hydrological processes the increase of computer power and the advent of geographic information systems have facilitated their use and led to a tendency of using increasingly complex models the swat model is one of such examples with more than 2100 references in scientific journals francesconi et al 2016 several authors have questioned this approach and have shown that simpler and more conceptual models requiring less data are almost as accurate as complex ones and can explain much of the observed values variance and that both simple and complex models will perform poorly in certain cases naef 1981 wilcox et al 1990 michaud and sorooshian 1994 ajami et al 2004 gupta et al 2008 fatichi et al 2016 a guiding principle when selecting a model is to find the least complex model that will solve the problem under analysis with the available data this idea is a corollary of the xiii century ocham s principle that states that any unnecessary complexity should be avoided and has been reinforced by several authors that argue for the need to balance parsimony and complexity when selecting a hydrological model young et al 1996 fatichi et al 2016 another inherent problem of complex distributed watershed models with a large parameter set is their calibration and validation procedures and issues related parameter uncertainty overfitting and equifinality beven 2001 to overcome these problems large datasets are needed with a large enough amount of information to enable the identification of the appropriate values to assign to each model parameter the calibration and validation of complex distributed models becomes a cumbersome procedure that requires experienced users as unexperienced users are prone to failure or even to error in this work we compared the results from a lumped parameter model with parsimonious data requirements the generalized watershed loading function gwlf haith and shoemaker 1987 with those obtained by soil water and assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 a semi distributed model with large data requirements the literature reports several applications of gwlf namely in the united states of america haith et al 1992 swaney et al 1996 lee et al 2000 schneiderman et al 2002 tu et al 2009 li et al 2010 niraula 2013 china huang and hong 2010 du et al 2014 and in porto rico wu et al 2007 swat has more than 2100 references in scientific journals francesconi et al 2016 it is our understanding that gwlf has never been applied to brazil case studies and that the number of swat applications for sediment and nutrients load prediction is limited given the scale of the country and the scarcity of monitoring data for such large area research is needed on the implications of spatial and temporal resolution on modelling results previous studies have compared distinct watershed models with different structures and complexity wilcox et al 1990 michaud and sorooshian 1994 parajuli et al 2009 li et al 2010 li and xu 2011 caldwell et al 2015 focusing mainly on the models ability to reproduce streamflow not evaluating their performance of estimating sediment yield and nitrogen and phosphorus loads additionally although physically based models can be used in a daily step most of these papers perform and discuss the model calibration at a monthly time step and do not discuss the difficulty of reproducing daily values of flow sediment and nutrient loads parajuli et al 2009 compared the hydrology sediments and total phosphorus simulation results of annagnps annualized agricultural non point source model and swat models both models provided fair to very good estimates of the monthly streamflow and sediment yield and swat performed consistent well in reproducing total phosphorus niraula 2013 used swat and gwlf to identify the areas contributing the most to the pollution problems of 570 km2 watershed in alabama united states the authors compared the model results at a monthly time scale and concluded that while both models perform well for streamflow swat performed slightly better for sediment nitrogen and phosphorus qi et al 2017 compared swat and gwlf monthly estimates of flow sediment and nitrogen loads for two watersheds in china with different climatic conditions both models performed similarly well in reproducing streamflow and sediment but the results were inconsistent for nitrogen this study evaluates the ability gwlf and swat to predict the daily and monthly variation of streamflow sediment yield total nitrogen load and total phosphorus load in the streams of two watersheds in tietê river basin in são paulo brazil initial model runs immediately indicated that both models needed calibration a growing of published research discusses the challenges and possible solutions to calibrate distributed watershed models e g madsen 2000 gupta et al 2008 yilmaz et al 2008 the results from this research are particular important for calibrating distributed models with a high number of parameters like swat where a manual approach is a cumbersome process which often leads to poor results however as our research focus was the comparison of two models a careful manual calibration had the advantage of providing insights to the role of each parameter and identifying links between the parameters of both models both models were simultaneously calibrated and validated for two river basins using split samples from different monitoring records stations in the two watersheds klemeš 1986 swat and gwlf share some steps in their modelling approach and several parameters as the model s parameters depend on the physical characteristics of the river basin in our study shared parameters have been assigned the same values and others which measure similar concepts have been assigned compatible values the joint calibration of both models to two watersheds offers a way to find a robust set of parameter values for the prevalent conditions of tietê river basin the models ability to reproduce streamflow sediment and nutrient loads at each monitoring station was measured by three indicators computed from the result s deviations from observed measurements the main novelty of this research is the comparison of a complex distributed watershed model swat with a more parsimonious hydrological model we are particularly interested in understanding under which conditions the use of each model is to be recommended namely when does the addition effort required to run the swat model leads to effective better results the calibration of both models was performed jointly for the two case studies with the goal of obtaining consistent parameters values that lead to acceptable results in both river basins the parameters that are common to both models formulations were set to the same values to encourage the robustness and consistency of the model results this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the mathematical formulation of both models as well as the model s calibration and validation procedures section 3 describes the case studies and the available data the research results are discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are offered in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 models description 2 1 1 swat model swat is a continuous simulation model with a daily time step that includes components to simulate weather hydrology sediment soil crop nutrients pesticides agricultural management channel routing and reservoir routing the watershed is partitioned into sub basins each one being further subdivided into hydrologic response units hrus that have a unique land cover soil slope and management practice combination each sub basin contains at least one hydrologic response unit hru and one main channel the outputs of all hru within each sub basin are the water and mass inflow into the river network at the sub basin outlet neitsch et al 2009 this study used the swat2012 released on 2018 arnold et al 2012 and neitsch et al 2011 provide a detailed description of swat the computation of water flow through the watershed includes the land phase and the routing phase of the hydrologic cycle the first phase computes the amount of water sediment nutrients and pesticides reaching the main channel in each sub basin while the second phase traces the movement of water sediments and reaching contaminants through the channel network to the outlet of the watershed neitsch et al 2009 the soil conservation service method scs cn is the default of the model for estimating runoff and was used in this study swat provides two methods for estimating the scs retention parameter and the so called alternative method was selected which allows this parameter to vary with plant evapotranspiration according to neitsch et al 2009 this alternative method was added because the traditional method may predict too much runoff which was the case in our preliminary runs the soil profile is divided into 3 zones the vadose zone and the shallow aquifer contribute to the stream flow while the deep aquifer receives deep percolation from the shallow aquifer but does not contribute to the flow at the watershed outlet the vadose zone is subdivided in soil layers with the number of the layers depending on the soil types that occur in the area the modified universal soil loss equation musle williams 1975 is used to estimate erosion and sediment yield from each hru the sediment yield carried by superficial flow on a given day can be calculated by 1 s y t 11 8 h t t t p e a k a h r u 0 56 k s c p l s c f r g where s y t is the sediment yield carried by superficial flow on a given day ton h t is the daily surface runoff volume mm t

enter the reach on any one day tconc is the hru time of concentration hrs and surlag is the surface runoff lag coefficient in large subbasins with a time of concentration greater than 1 day only a portion of the surface runoff will reach the main channel on the day it is generated swat incorporates a surface runoff storage feature to lag a portion of the surface runoff release to the main channel neitsch et al 2002 swat assumes that lateral and groundwater flow transport sediment to the main channel and estimates this load by 5 s t l g l t g t a h r u s c 1000 where s t l g is the sediment loading in lateral and groundwater flow ton l t is the lateral flow for a given day mm g t is the groundwater flow for a given day mm a h r u is the area of the hru km2 and s c is the concentration of sediment in lateral and groundwater concentration specified by the user mg l the sediment reaching the channel is routed considering deposition and erosion as a function of the sediment load and flow transport capacity the model computed the sediment transport capacity using a modification of bagnold s equation bagnold 1977 swat considers two inorganic forms of nitrogen nitrate no3 and ammonia nitrogen nh4 and three organic forms of nitrogen active stable and fresh organic n as well as three organic forms of phosphorus active stable and fresh organic p and three inorganic forms of phosphorus stable active and solution mineral p ammonia and nitrate are associated with fertilizer usage the stable and active organic p pools are associated with the soil humus and fresh organic p is associated with crop residue and microbial biomass neitsch et al 2005 2 1 2 gwlf model gwlf assumes a daily time step and uses the soil conservation service method based on the curve number concept scs cn to estimate runoff ht groundwater flow gt and the total flow in the downstream section of the hydrographic basin tt calculation process were presented in santos et al 2018 the sediment yield is computed by the universal soil loss equation usle wischmeier and smith 1978 and nitrogen and phosphorus loads are estimated from average nutrient concentrations based on land use the gwlf model assumes that contaminants are transported in solid or dissolved phase with the solid phase contaminants coming from rural and urban areas and the dissolved contaminants coming from point sources rural areas and groundwater as such all contaminant loads from point sources and groundwater are only in dissolved phase and the contaminant loads from urban sources are only in solid phase sediment yield s t t is calculated by considering separately the soil loss and its subsequent transport through the runoff haith et al 1992 the mean soil loss due to water erosion per unit area

equation developed by lombardi and moldenhauer 1980 for campinas são paulo brazil based on 22 years of rainfall records a high correlation was found between measured soil erosion data and an erosion index computed from the rainfall record based on a proposition from fournier 1960 the erosion index is estimated from the following equation 7 e m 68 730 p t m 2 p t y 0 841 where em is defined as the monthly average erosion index mj mm h year p t m is the average monthly precipitation mm e p t y is the average annual precipitation mm according to lombardi and moldenhauer 1980 the annual erosivity

by the basin in the day before according to the eq 11 11 s t t t o t a l p s t s d r 1 s r d s t t 1 the total nitrogen n and phosphorus p load can be calculated according to the following formulations 12 n t d n t d p n t d r n t d g p t d p t d p p t d r p t d g 13 n t s n t s r n t s u p t s p t s r p t s u where n t d and n t s are respectively the dissolved and solid phase nitrogen

groundwater respectively and sr and su relate to the solid phase contaminant loads from rural areas and urban areas respectively next the equations presented for the calculation of the nitrogen loads are applied in the same way for the calculation of the phosphorus loads the load of contaminants from point sources n t d p mg can be calculated according to eq 14 14 n t d p s p o p p o p n c d p 1 r

treatment system according to abnt 2011 the composition of sanitary sewage has an average of 6 112 g hab day of total nitrogen and 1 5 g hab day of total phosphorus the load of dissolved contaminants

depending on the land use k hk is the surface runoff mm on day t ak is the area of land use k m2 the average concentrations of dissolved contaminants from rural areas were adapted from haith et al

k on day t the values of accumulation of contaminants in urban areas n c k s u and p c k s u were adopted from haith et al 1992 in areas with a medium to a high population density the daily rate of accumulation of urban contaminants varies from 0 028 to 0 031 kg ha for nitrogen and from 0 002 to 0 007 kg ha for phosphorus the load of contaminants in groundwater n t d g mg can be obtained by 19 n

concentrations of contaminants dissolved in groundwater n c d g were determined from standard values in the groundwater available in li et al 2010 in this study a range of 0 1 to 19 mg l for nitrogen concentration and a range of 0 01 to 0 1 mg l for phosphorus concentration in groundwater were considered in this study the gwlf method was programmed within microsoft excel using vba programming language to take advantage of ms excel native flexibility and functionality to manage and analyse data and model results 2 2 model calibration and validation the calibration and validation of both models was performed jointly for the two case studies with the goal of obtaining consistent parameters values that lead to acceptable results in both river basins the parameters that were shared between both models were assigned the same values and the parameters measuring similar concepts were assigned compatible values to reflect their physical nature and their dependence on the watershed s characteristics it is true that as the models have a different formulation the consequences of assigning a particular value to a given parameter are different in each model however in our case that the option to assign similar values to the shared parameters did not significantly degrade the model s performance a split sample test validated the results klemeš 1986 the first 3 years 1987 1989 were used as a warmup period to minimize uncertain initial conditions two subsequent and independent periods were used for calibration 1990 2000 for jacaré guaçu river basin and 1990 2003 for atibaia river basin and for validation 2000 2009 for jacaré guaçu river basin and 2003 2015 for atibaia river basin to facilitate the comparison between the model results the same dataset of daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were used in both models for the lumped model the average precipitation and evapotranspiration over the whole watershed were computed as weighted averages of the precipitation and evapotranspiration values of each sub basin as assigned by swat the calibration considered the optimization of multiple objectives namely deviations from different aspects of the flow hydrographs sediment loads and nutrients loads all measured at multiple sites the result of multi objective optimization problem is a set of pareto optimum solutions in our case since the calibration was done manually decisions were made along the process to retain the best single parameter set that offers a good equilibrium of reaching the different objectives the calibration adopted a systematic procedure madsen 2000 which first focused on reproducing precipitation partition and the overall water balance of each basin it then proceeded to reproduce the records of high and low stream flows and their timing finally the attention focused on the sediment load data and on the nitrogen and phosphorus data the parameters that are common to both models formulations were set to the same values to encourage the robustness and consistency of the model results the calibration focused on the parameters which most affect the models results this set of parameters was identified based on literature review and in the case of swat also based on a sensitivity analysis executed prior to the calibration effort neitsch et al 2001 lenhart et al 2002 arnold et al 2012 bonumá et al 2013 strauch et al 2013 me et al 2015 malagó et al 2017 this is an important step as the number of parameters in swat hinders the possibility of manually calibrating all parameters the sensitivity analysis was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting method sufi2 offered by the swat cup program for each model parameter the sufi2 method computes the range of values that brackets most measured data within the model results abbaspour et al 2007 the parameters with the shortest range are the ones which the model results are most sensitive too the model s calibration for sediment yield nitrogen and phosphorus loads was executed by changing the parameters associated with each soil type and land use thus affecting pollutant loads and concentration in the whole watershed 2 3 indicators to evaluate the model s performance to evaluate the model s performance in reproducing the historical stream flows and water quality records the following set of indicators was used the nash and sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 computes the sum of the squared difference between the model results and historical data and normalizes the results with sum of the squared difference between the historical data and its average eq 20 20 n s e 1 t t o b s t t s i m 2 t t o b s t t o b s 2 where t t o b s is observed value t t o b s is average observed value t t s i m is computed value t t s i m is average computed value the value of nse ranges from to 1 0 with the latter being the optimal value values between 0 5 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance whereas negative indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the computed value moriasi et al 2007 the percent bias pbias measures the average difference between the computed and measured values over a specified period 21 p b i a s t t o b s t t s i m t t o b s 100 values of pbias close to 0 reveal a smaller deviation of the model results from the measured values but higher values for pbias are acceptable when the measured values accuracy is relatively poor the coefficient of determination r2 describes the proportion of the measured data variance that is explained by the model the coefficient r2 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a good adjustment as r2 only quantifies the dispersion a model which systematically overestimates or under estimations all the time will still result in good r2 values close to 1 0 even if all predictions were inexact krause et al 2005 22 r 2 t t o b s t t o b s t t s i m t t s i m 2 t t o b s t t o b s 2

to poorer performances several authors have decided to accept the swat calibration when nse computed with daily flows is above values in the range of 0 15 to 0 3 benham et al 2006 coffey et al 2004

measurement gaps and errors 3 study cases 3 1 watershed data the case studies are two tributary basins from the tietê river one of the largest tributaries of the paraná river basin and one of the main rivers of the state of são paulo fig 1 the first study area is the jacaré guaçu river basin upstream of cruzes river confluence with an area of 1934 km2 and the second one is the atibaia river basin with an area of 2818 km2 that covers municipalities from são paulo and minas gerais states the jacaré guaçu river basin has its sources in serra de itaqueri são carlos são paulo state brazil and flows into the ibitinga reservoir the altitude of the river basin ranges from 551 m at the outlet to 930 m in the southeast part of the basin the annual average precipitation is 1470 mm with most of the rain falling from october to march the basin relief influences the rainfall spatial distribution with higher amounts of rainfall falling in the upper parts of the basin in the southeast the jacaré guaçu river basin spreads over the guarani aquifer system gas one of the world s largest aquifer and an important source of drinkable water for several cities including campo grande ribeirão preto são josé do rio preto and araraquara among others rabelo et al 2004 the atibaia river basin spreads from its outlet at the junction of the atibainha and cachoeira rivers and to the sources of cachoeira river in minas gerais state the altitude ranges between 508 m to 1973 m at the outlet in the west a mountain range runs in the west and south of the river basin the annual average precipitation is 1520 mm with most of the rain falling from october to march agriculture crops and mixed forests are the dominant land uses in both river basins because of a trend in the recent decades in the state of são paulo that saw an intensification of the agricultural activity and the substitution of many crops by sugarcane and orange trees alkimim et al 2015 and strassburg et al 2017 reforestation is also a significant activity in the atibaia river valley near its confluence with the piracicaiba river mainly due to the proximity of the paper and pulp industries located in the municipalities of americana

digital maps a 30 m resolution dem was obtained for both river basins from the srtm shuttle radar topography mission the soil types of both river basins were identified in a soil map produced by embrapa empresa brasileira de pesquisa agropecuária the jacaré guaçu river basin holds eight soil types including red yellow latosol covering 55 4 of the river basin area typic quartzipsamment 13 2 typic eutrorthox 10 6 typic haplortox 6 5 typic paleudalf 5 1 litololic soils 4 6 hydromorphic soils 4 2 and argiudoll 0 4 the atibaia river basin holds three main soil types including red yellow latosol covering 61 0 of the river basin area typic haplortox 37 8 typic eutrorthox 1 2 the embrapa map shows that red yellow latosol typic haplortox and typic eutrorthox soils cover 100 of the atibaia river basin and 72 of jacaré guaçu river basin red yellow soils are deep soils with a low clay content typic haplortox soils are several meters deep and are quite rich in clay and nutrients finally typic euthorthox soils are weathered soils highly permeable and with a variable clay content and low nutrients content swat also requires data on 14 additional soil parameters which were obtained from freire et al 1978 oliveira and prado 1984 lombardi neto et al 1989 and saxton and rawls 2006 a landsat thematic mapper satellite image from the second semester of 2001 with a spatial resolution of 30 30 m was used to describe land use of jacaré guaçu river basin seven types of land use were identified in the basin agriculture covering 35 66 of the river basin area water 3 32 range

based on a visual interpretation of a spot image from 2013 with 2 5 m spatial resolution was used ugrhi 5 2013 eight types of land use were identified in the basin forest mixed covering 43 5 of the river basin area mineral transportation 0 04 sugarcane 1 4 water 1 9 range grasses 3 0 agriculture 3 8 urban area 17 0 and pasture 29 3 the meteorological and hydrological data for both river basins were obtained from the databases of two government agencies ana agência nacional de águas and daee departamento de águas e energia do estado de são paulo in the jacaré guaçu river basin 10 rain gages 3 hydrographs gages 62767500 568 km2 62760005 230 9 km2 and 62772500 1135 km2 and one water quality gage 62772500 were selected based on their location and record completeness fig 1 data on temperature data humidity wind speed and solar radiation was obtained from one gage operated by crhea centro de recursos hídricos e ecologia aplicada located in the basin in the atibaia river basin 17 rain gages 4 hydrograph gages 4009 2738km2 3003 2490 km2 3006 1920 km2 and 3007 2152 km2 and 3 quality gages 62691200 and 2605 were selected based on their location and record completeness fig 1 data on temperature data humidity wind speed and solar radiation was obtained one weather gage operated by esalq escola superior de agricultura luiz de queiroz located near to the basin missing precipitation data were completed with the records from neighbour using multi regression the coefficient of determination r2 of all regression equation was always greater than 0 6 4 results and discussion a review of the relevant literature identified 17 parameters to which swat results are most sensitive table 2 to select among these the most important ones for flow prediction two independent runs of swat cup were performed one for each case study that led to the same 10 parameters also highlighted in table 2 the table groups the parameters by model component namely groundwater flow surface retention river hydraulics soil characteristics as well as sediment and nutrients transport for each parameter the table indicates the expected range of values the default value and the final value obtained after calibration calibrated values the preliminary swat runs using the parameters default values lead to an overestimation of the observed stream flow record particularly the high flow values the calibration procedure thus proceeded to reduce these peak flows curve numbers cn2 were reduced by 20 uniformly across the watershed to promote infiltration and base flow at the expense of stormflow available water capacity of the topsoil layer sol awc was also reduced by 50 to reduce the soil holding capacity increase groundwater percolation and to delay the flow reaching the river the soil evaporation compensation factor esco was reduced to 0 4 to promote the evaporative demand from lower soil levels the parameter gw revap a coefficient reflecting the capability to move water from the shallow aquifer to the overlaying unsaturated soil zone was set to 0 12 which indicates more water is available for baseflow discharge the revapmn defining the threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for return flow to the root zone to occur was set to 300 mm once the magnitude and the variability of base flow and hydrograph peaks were reproduced the overall water balance was adjusted using the rchrg dp parameter the value for rchrg dp was set to 0 04 which means that 4 of infiltrated water is lost to a deep aquifer canmx describing the storage capacity of a canopy to hold intercepted precipitation was set to 60 the value of ch k1 e ch k2 indicating the rate of water loss from streams to ground water was set to 5 mm hr and 3 2 mm hr which assumes the presence of losing streams within the watersheds gitau and chaubey 2010 according to arnold et al 2012 the threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer required for the return flow to occur gwqmn and the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf are also important in calibration at the beginning of calibration the base flow was very low so the gwqmn value was decreased from 1000 to 300 mm to regulate the movement of water inside the aquifer the variable alpha bf affects the shape of the hydrograph and it was necessary to decrease this parameter to 0 001 the groundwater delay time gw delay which reflects the time lag that it takes water in the soil to enter the shallow aquifer was decreased to 20 days the overall water balance for both river basins computed by both models is very similar and lead to an average annual outflow from the basin within 5 of observed stream flow in most cross sections water losses to deep aquifer are around 3 of precipitation the manning s n parameter for the main channel ch n1 were set to 0 03 which are assigned to normal channels with clean structure full stage no riffs or deep pools chow 1959 regarding the parameters related to soil characteristics the slope length for lateral subsurface flow slsoil related to the interflow generation was adjusted for 40 m the weighing coefficient for calculating retention dependent of plant evapotranspiration cncoef was modified to 1 6 table 3 shows the default values of scs cn and gwlf models parameters suggested by the literature haith shoemaker 1987 haith et al 1992 li et al 2010 niraula 2013 based on watershed characteristics as well as the values obtained following calibration the lumped model parameters affecting streamflow are the curve number cn the river basin water storage capacity umax the groundwater recession constant α and the deep recharge coefficient β these parameters were calibrated for each hydrometric station sub basin starting at the upstream hydrometric stations moving to the intermediate stations and finally to the downstream station in both study cases the cn values were reduced from the original value to increase infiltration the river basins water storage capacities umax were also reduced from default values to reduce evapotranspiration and increase infiltration this need was also felt calibrating the corresponding parameters of swat which are cn2 and sol awc respectively the groundwater recession constant α was set to lower values than the originals therefore reducing the response time to recharge during swat calibration the corresponding parameter alpha bf was also reduced from the default value figs 2 and 3 compare the daily and monthly measured stream flow at the downstream station of jacaré guaçu river basin 62772500 with the computed flow by swat and gwlf models figs 4 and 5 compare the daily and monthly measured stream flow at the downstream station of atibaia river basin upstream the reservoir 4009 with the computed flow data table 4 and 5 shows the obtained values for each performance indicator and study cases all figures and tables separate the calibration period october 1991 to september 2003 from the validation period october 2003 to october 2016 the results show that both models can reproduce the daily flow variability for both study cases although failing to replicate all values accurately particularly some of largest daily flow measurements which are overestimated fig 4 the gwlf model significantly overestimates the daily flow values at specific periods namely in 1994 95 1995 96 2001 02 and 2002 03 at the jacaré guaçu river basin these streamflow values are the result of high precipitation values which gwlf model formulation does not attenuated as much as the swat formulation the computed daily streamflow results show some fluctuation around the observed values which may be due the scs methodology used in both models it seems that in days of high precipitation the daily precipitation excess is probably overestimated and is not distributed as flow throughout the following days when model results are aggregated at a monthly time step the peak flows are reproduced with reasonable accuracy with the gwlf model presenting a slightly better adjustment to the observed values than swat figs 3 and 5 the observed fluctuation in daily values disappears as it is aggregated within each month the performance indicators nse pbias and r2 values presented in table 4 and table 5 corroborate these conclusions the indicators show that the models ability and particularly gwlf to reproduce streamflow at a daily time step is poor at all monitoring stations of jacaré guaçu river basin and near to satisfactory in most monitoring stations of the atibaia river basin the values obtained with daily streamflow are low but not unusual as the results from benham et al 2006 and coffey et al 2004 show as expected the values obtained for the calibration periods are usually better than the values obtained for the validation period at a monthly timestep both models have a reasonable performance with nse ranging from 0 42 to 0 89 and continue to perform better at the atibaia river basin than at jacaré guaçu river basin the worse model performance in reproducing streamflow at jacaré guaçu river basin may be due to difficulties of simulating surface water groundwater interactions as this basin spreads over the guarani aquifer system the poor model performance may also be due to the poor quality of monitoring data namely precipitation and streamflow as some authors have already pointed out e g monteiro 2016 pontes et al 2016 in particular the model performance is strongly conditioned by precipitation estimates and thus by precipitation data availability and monitoring stations location the precipitation records of jacaré guaçu river basin show 13 18 of missing data against 3 04 of missing data in the precipitation records of atibaia river basin and whereas the rain gages density in both basins is similar 1 06 gages per 100 km2 in jacaré guaçu river basin and 0 51 gages per 100 km2 in atibaia river basin some smaller watersheds are not well covered by the precipitation monitoring network a good example of this challenge is the river basin of the jacaré guaçu upstream station 62760005 which spreads over a mountainous region and is monitored by a single precipitation station the best model performance is obtained at the downstream stations of both river basins 62772500 and 4009 where nse are always above 0 55 even for the validation period the model s better performance at the downstream stations indicates that the aggregating effect arising from larger watersheds facilitates the model s calibration existing deficiencies in estimating flow at a local scale due to weak monitoring or poor representation of the watershed characteristics do not have a significant impact at a larger scale a similar aggregating effect also explain why the models results aggregated at a monthly time step compare better with observed values than when this comparison is performed at a daily time step both models and gwlf in particular have difficulty in reproducing the flow variability at shorter time periods overall the results show that although swat has a better performance in reproducing the daily flow values this comparative advantage is not evident at a monthly time step to reproduce sediment yield with swat the usle equation support practices parameters usle p was identified as the most important one and was set to 0 8 in both study cases which indicates the existence of conservation practices in the basin what is actually found in the field the coefficient in the sediment transport equation spcon calibrated was set to 0 01 which indicates a larger amount of sediment entering the channel the channel erodibility factor ch cov1 and the channel coverage factor ch cov2 are factors that also influence the transport of sediments in the channel since they determine the channel susceptibility to erosion and the channel protection to erosion both parameters were set to 0 1 indicating a low susceptibility to channel erosion in swat the nitrogen loads are mostly sensitive to the nitrogen percolation coefficient nperco and to the nitrate concentration in the shallow aquifer shallst n while the phosphorus loads are sensitive to the initial organic p concentration in soil layer sol orgp to the phosphorus percolation coefficient pperco and to the phosphorus soil partitioning coefficient phoskd in gwlf the most relevant parameters are related to the dissolved contaminants in rural areas n c k d r and p c k d r the computed values of sediment yield total nitrogen and phosphorus loads were compared with bi monthly measurements performed at jacaré guaçu quality station 62776400 from january 2001 to december 2010 and at atibaia quality stations 2605 and 62691200 from january 2009 to december 2016 the comparison between the models results and the observed values is hindered due to the bimonthly sampling interval of the latter values table 6 shows the computed performance indicators for both models and for both cases studies figs 6 7 and 8 compare the sediment yield values swat sediment yield estimates present a higher variability than the gwlf estimates at times exceeding the observed peak values the gwlf model generates a smoother time series of results that underestimate both the observed values and the swat estimates during recession periods this is mostly because gwlf applies the usle equation with rainfall intensity representing the erosive factor while swat resorts to the musle equation using runoff volume and peak flow rate to compute the sediment yield the smoother variability of streamflow when compared to precipitation resulting from surface runoff storage that lags precipitation and runoff release to the main channel dampens the sediment variability swat also uses sediment transport equations to simulate erosion and deposition along the main channel from the figures both models are able to reproduce the order of magnitude and the major variations of the sediment yield although not with accuracy table 6 shows that gwlf leads to better sediment yield estimates especially in the atibaia river basin computed values where nse and r2 reach values close to 0 5 figs 9 10 and 11 compare the total nitrogen load values computed for and measured at the three monitoring stations both models can reproduce the order of magnitude of the observed values during low flows but offer highly variable estimates that significantly exceed the by monthly observed values the performance indicators values table 6 confirm this poor performance with the gwlf model showing slightly better results figs 12 13 and 14 compare the total phosphorus load values computed for and measured at the three monitoring stations the results of both models for the station located in the jacaré guaçu river basin presented a good fit for the low observed values but fail to predict the peaks fig 12 swat modelled peak values present a delay when compared with the gwlf estimates due to the runoff lag equation used by the swat the performance indicators suggest that swat performs slightly better than gwlf overall the phosphorus estimates from both models but particularly from swat are better than the nitrogen estimates the difficulties in reproducing nutrients loads and sediment transport also arise from the accumulation of estimation errors all through the computing sequence from stream flow to sediment transport and finally to nutrients loads 5 conclusions the research showed the difficulty hydrological models have to reproduce daily flows from meteorological daily data in real case situations where the existing precipitation dataset is limited and is not able to fully represent the time and space variability of this variable when the models results are aggregated at monthly time step to be compared with the corresponding observed values the models performance improves significantly the same aggregating effect also explains why the model s performance better at the downstream stations monitoring larger upstream areas the swat model has a slight better overall performance in reproducing the daily flow values than gwlf but this comparative advantage is not clearly shown at a monthly time step showing that the effort in required to calibrate validate and run more complete and distributed models may not pay off when detailed precipitation data is not available simpler lumped models may lead to equally accurate results when estimating sediment yield the models can reproduce the order of magnitude and the major variations of the sediment yield although not with significant accuracy the model s performance to reproduce n and p loads is poor in particularly the nitrogen loads as the phosphorus loads are better correlated with sediments yield the model estimates are slightly better when compared with the observed values once again the swat performance to estimate sediment nitrogen and phosphorus loads is slightly better than gwlf but this comparative advantage may not compensate the additional effort calibrate and validate it models are useful for decision making if they can capture the main signals of the hydrological processes even if they do not accurately reproduce the finer variability of some variables our research showed that gwlf model is a useful decision support tool for preliminary studies at a monthly time step given the straightforwardness to calibrate and apply the model when detailed data is available and when estimates are needed for shorter time periods and smaller and more diverse areas swat ability to simulate watershed processes in detail has the potential to lead to better results if an adequate dataset is available to calibrate and validate the model and given its more complete and physically based formulation swat is also expected to produce robust results and perform better at situations not used during its calibration the research showed that when there are weaknesses in the existing dataset for model calibration and validation both a more complete model swat and a parsimonious model gwlf fail to reproduce the finer variability of some variables at a daily time step namely streamflow sediment loads and nutrients concentration in such cases a sensitivity analysis of the input variables and the model parameters may help convey an indication of the model s results uncertainty the research also put in evidence some results than can be used to improve the model s performance swat methods to estimate areal average areal precipitation over each hru could be improved concerning gwlf the use of the original the soil conservation service method scs cn by gwlf for estimating runoff leads to a highly variable time series that often overestimates flow peaks and total flow volume and the use of the usle equation with rainfall intensity representing the erosive factor and the non consideration of erosion and deposition along the main channel also leads to highly variables sediment and phosphorus loads estimates in the future it may be possible to improve gwlf formulation to confront these problems and improve is performance while maintaining the models

elements and lowland springs the sedimentary sequence from bottom to top is formed by meandering river plain deposits the distal fringe of the glacial outwash plains and proximal braid plain deposits study focus this study proposes a general approach for aquifer geometry reconstruction and hydrodynamic parametrization of hydrofacies in fluvio glacial deposits and their implementation into a 3d regional groundwater flow model this approach is based on sedimentologically defined lithofacies hydrofacies and their correlation in space to obtain nearly homogeneous subunits starting from available data i e 8628 borehole logs grain size distributions well tests and sedimentological knowledge new hydrological insights for the region the calibrated 3d fem groundwater model allows quantifying the main components of the hydrogeological budget at the regional scale and the fluxes among the different hydro stratigraphic units a sensitivity analysis of groundwater levels to the main recharge components suggests importance of anthropogenic disturbances with respect to natural recharge and that land use change may impact water resources more than climate change keywords hydrofacies fluvio glacial sediments aquifer parametrization regional groundwater flow 1 introduction most urban areas are located in alluvial plains composed of loose sedimentary deposits where large and highly productive aquifers exist favouring the settlement of large populations for example the milan metropolitan area northern italy hosts about 5 million people corresponding to 8 5 of the italian population istat 2014 such urban concentration leads to an increasing pressure on groundwater resources in terms of abstraction and contamination goutaland et al 2013 intense abstraction from

models are needed to obtain a reliable tool for groundwater resources management this requires a careful and reliable reconstruction of the aquifer geometry and proprieties which can have a significant control on groundwater simulated flow paths christensen et al 2017 for fluvio glacial aquifers understanding the heterogeneity of geological units at different scales plays a key role de marsily et al 2005 bayer et al 2011 refsgaard et al 2012 seifert et al 2012 kearsey et al 2015 approaches developed in the literature to describe fluvio glacial deposits vary as a function of the available input data and the modelling approach input data consist of hard data such as direct lithological and stratigraphic observations made on outcrops laboratory analysis on field samples or especially in urban areas borehole logs this hard data may be integrated with soft data including indirect observations produced through geophysical surveys ouellon et al 2008 mele et al 2013 comunian et al 2016 or remote sensing techniques christensen et al 2017 starting from this data the level of heterogeneity description may be different depending on the scale of the problem the difficulty of validating observation accuracy kearsey et al 2015 and the capability of extracting valuable information from the different data sources rajabi et al 2018 regarding the modelling approach deterministic and stochastic e g multiple point statistics and the transition probability approach approaches are the most used bianchi et al 2015 both allow the creation of numerical models consistent with the geological information and with the conceptual model despite the existence of problems relative to hydraulic parameterization in the first approach and to the smoothing error especially at the regional scale in the second approach watson et al 2015 caers 2000 in this research the main aim is to develop a regional scale conceptual and groundwater flow model starting from borehole data grain size distributions and well tests in order to analyse the overall groundwater flow behaviour and the main flow budget components this requires a simple model which should be able to capture the overall groundwater flow behaviour within the main aquifers without introducing complex fine resolution behaviours due to deposit heterogeneity on the other hand the conceptual and numerical models although simple need to be robust and hydro stratigraphically sound hence to meet the need of simplicity and robustness a multi dimensional approach is proposed and illustrated for the fluvio glacial deposits of the milan metropolitan area the approach relies on two main steps i the exploitation of the sedimentological knowledge of the area regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 garzanti et al 2011 scardia et al 2012 to constraint the conceptual model and ii the definition of hydrologically meaningful hydrofacies units through the analysis of borehole data and grain size distributions to assign hydraulic properties to the aquifers this approach fig 1 involves 1 the reconstruction of the aquifer geometry starting from well logs through a novel classification of the lithologies 2 the interpretation of cross sections and the interpolation of aquifer boundary surfaces 3 the definition of hydrofacies for the aquifer parametrization based on empirical relationships and validated by well test data and 4 the development of a regional steady state groundwater flow model to study the major components of the groundwater flow system for the milan metropolitan area several studies have been proposed which combine geological and geophysical data for the characterisation of the textural variations of the fluvio glacial deposits different at scales however the rigorous recognition of specific sedimentological and stratigraphic sequences the definition of hydrofacies groups and the validation by means of available datasets add meaning and robustness to this

corresponds to the distal fringe of the glacial outwash plains which transversally prograde moving southward the base of the sequence consists of clay and silt layers and locally of conglomeratic

corresponding to ps3 b semi confined aquifer ps2 and c confined aquifer ps1 regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the present study focuses on the first two aquifers a and b 3 stratigraphic modeling in the present study the hydrostratigraphic model has been delineated by using a multi dimensional approach fig 1 starting from borehole log analysis 1d to cross section interpretation 2d and spatial interpolation of aquifer limiting surfaces 3d 3 1 borehole log analysis the regional stratigraphic database caspita regione lombardia 2016 collects the borehole logs for the lombardy po plain area fig 2b the database contains information regarding the position the elevation the depth and the lithological description of the sediments for the study area 8628 borehole logs were collected and stored in a georeferenced database fig 2 together with 6 high resolution borehole logs from regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the 1d analysis consisted of grouping the lithological data according to a hierarchical order table 1 based on viable stratigraphic and hydrogeologic rules and considering the literature existing for small subdomains of the study area zappa et al 2006 mele et al 2012 cavalli 2012 comunian et al 2016 since the stratigraphic database contains 34 582 unique descriptors a preliminary analysis has been performed to properly code the information with readily accessible codified lithological descriptions using indices which represent abbreviations for typical features bayer et al 2011 a code i l was used where l denotes the prevailing texture g for gravel s for sand m for silt and c for clay or combinations and i indicates the dominant grain size c for coarse m for medium and f for fine this allowed to reduce the unique descriptors to 94 lithologies the lithologies have been further reclassified into 16 lithofacies considering only the main grain size and the subordinate components in order to allow the identification of major sedimentary sequences and to define units with assumed homogeneous hydraulic properties 3 2 cross section interpretation 150 vertical cross sections were interpreted from 1d data at the lithofacies level fig 1 table 2 to recognize the unconformities between the three fining upward depositional sequences ps1 ps2 and ps3 described by scardia et al 2012 along the 6 deep 200 m high resolution hr boreholes regione lombardia and eni agip

characterized by gravelly layers g gs in the high plain and sandy layers s sg in the low pain fig 3b the concentration of indicator ion species no3 so4 and cl at different depths has been used as a supplemental interpretation criterion fig 3c in the analysis in fact the confined aquifer c corresponding to ps1 is mostly characterized by natural conditions preserved by the effective separation from the upper aquifers a and b which are affected by pollution de caro et al 2017 therefore the concentrations of main indicator ions associated with anthropogenic pollution delineate the effective separation between the semi confined and confined aquifers roughly corresponding to the nitrate natural background level of 25 mg l fig 3c 3 3 spatial interpolation of aquifer limiting surfaces the elevations of points located on the 2d surface limits l1 l2 l3 were interpolated to obtain 3d surfaces by using ordinary kriging with trend removal and a smoothing factor to adjust the weights of the neighbouring points table 3 for each surface the interpolation parameters have been optimized on the training subset i e 80 of the points and validated on a testing subset i e 20 of the points obtaining root mean square errors of 2 75 m 3 4 m and 3 2 m for l1 l2 and l3 respectively table 3 summarizes the parameters that minimize the root mean square error e rms between interpolated and measured elevations for each surface 4 hydraulic parametrization according to the definition of the aquifer groups given by regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the aquifer limiting surfaces included in the stratigraphic model have been assumed to constitute the bottom of the semi confined aquifer b l1 the bottom of the aquitard between aquifer a and b l2 and the bottom of unconfined aquifer a l3 see table 1 4 1 hydrofacies definition since the lithofacies are defined based on sedimentological criteria they cannot be easily associated with the hydrological properties of the sediment for the purpose of hydrogeological modelling this requires the definition of hydrofacies with characteristic permeability and porosity values anderson 1989 the definition of the hydrofacies and their hydraulic properties is usually based on laboratory data field measurements and theoretical calculations on outcrop walls kostic et al 2005 bayer et al 2011 2015 this last approach is unsuitable for our case study where only core logging stratigraphic data which contain only the description of the prevailing grain size without details about texture or minor structures are available then a simple approach suitable for core logging data was required the grain size distribution of 113 borehole samples fig 4 covering all the sediment type spectra and different depth intervals in the study area have been analysed in order to assign tentative hydraulic conductivity k values through empirical models which are based on characteristic values of the grai n s ize distribution e g the effective diameter d10 the median diameter d50 and the uniformity coefficient c u supplementary table s1 the most appropriate empirical equations have been selected for each sample based the range of applicability of the methods table 4 see also supplementary table s1 the analysis revealed strong differences within the same lithofacies hence a further subdivision of the lithofacies into subclasses of different hydrofacies with similar hydraulic properties also accounting for subordinate granulometric components was required table 4 for each hydrofacies minimum maximum and mean k values were calculated fig 4 table 4 4 2 hydrodynamic parameter spatialization based on the k values of the different hydrofacies an equivalent depth averaged keq for parallel to layer flow conditions was calculated for each borehole of aquifer a above l3 surface and b between l1 and l2 surfaces by averaging the mean k values of the hydrofacies fig 4 and table 4 found along the log weighted by their relative thickness these keq values were interpolated within each aquifer by the ordinary kriging method to spatialize the single borehole log hydraulic conductivity value fig 5 shows the computed fields of hydraulic conductivity for the semi confined b and the unconfined a aquifers in order to evaluate the calculated keq values a comparison was made with hydraulic conductivity values obtained by well tests this comparison was performed by using cumulative probability plots which display the range of data on a percentile basis and allows to effectively display and compare the range of data in terms of probability edmunds and shand 2009 in particular the comparison was carried out by using different well tests for the unconfined aquifer a 21 lefranc tests fig 5a have been used which were made available by the water distribution companies for the semi confined aquifer b 525 long term steady rate pumping tests in the milan city area mm s p a historical database and 68 step drawdown well tests mainly outside the milan city area fig 5c have been used the transmissivity and the hydraulic conductivity were estimated from these tests by using the cassan method 1980 and the theis solution 1935 respectively these datasets have been considered together since no evident differences have been detected by using the bootstrap method de caro 2018 the comparison of empirical values and well test results does not reveal relevant differences in terms of probability distribution thus supporting the reliability of the interpolated keq values 4 3 definition of hydrostratigraphic units according to their hydrodynamic characteristics the two main aquifers a and b were further subdivided into relatively homogeneous subunits for the purpose of groundwater flow modelling this spatial discretization can be summarized as follows within the unconfined aquifer a three homogeneous zones have been identified fig 5a i a high conductivity zone 5 10 2 m s to 5 10 3 m s consisting of proximal gravelly fan deposits in the northern sector ii a moderate conductivity zone 5 10 3 m s to 1 10 4 m s characterized by distal sandy fringes of fan deposits in the southern sector of the fontanili belt and iii a low conductivity zone 1 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s corresponding to post lgm deposits as defined in fontana et al 2014 hence two gentle slope surfaces l4 and l5 fig 6 a linking the aquitard base of unconfined aquifer a to the ground surface fig 6a were introduced to separate these three zones within the semi confined aquifer two homogeneous zones have been distinguished i a proximal northern portion characterized by a larger variability in hydraulic conductivity values 5 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s and ii a distal southern portion showing quite homogeneous hydraulic conductivity 5 10 5 m s to 1 10 5 m s the volumetric distribution of each hydrofacies within each identified subunit i e proximal and distal fan fringes post lgm deposits and proximal and distal semi confined aquifers has been analysed fig 6 showing a good agreement with the conceptual stratigraphic model 5 groundwater modelling the hydrostratigraphic model was implemented into a 3d finite element model feflow diersch 2014 for groundwater modelling fig 6a a steady state condition was used to simulate the regional hydraulic head of three years 1994 2003 and 2014 for which groundwater level data were collected from over 447 monitoring points in the whole lombardy region 145 in the study area by the regional management and protection water plan regione lombardia 2017 in particular the steady state model was calibrated for 2014 and successively validated for 1994 and 2003 5 1 model setup the 3d finite element model includes 12 040 320 triangular prismatic finite elements divided in to 12 layers 1 003 360 elements per layer layers 1 4 represent the unconfined aquifer above the l3 surface fig 6a with a mean total thickness of about 35 m this aquifer is divided into three hydrostratigraphic units by the l4 and l5 surfaces fig 6a moreover the distal and proximal fan deposits above l5 have been further subdivided into 5 fan and megafan zones from w to e olona megafan omf lura fan lf seveso fan sf lambro megafan lmf and molgora megafan mmf according to fontana et al 2014 layer 5 represents the discontinuous aquitard between the unconfined and the semi confined aquifer with an average thickness of 3 m layers 6 11 represent the semi confined aquifer with a mean thickness of 50 m this is divided into proximal and distal portions fig 6a the thickness of each single layer of the 3d model varies between 3 m and 20 m depending on the thickness of the hydrogeological units and on the well screen length and position whereas the distance between nodes ranges from 1500 m down to 10 m near pumping wells and rivers 5 2 boundary conditions abstraction and recharge the northern boundary of the 3d finite element models is a 1st type boundary condition bc with a constant head value derived by the interpolation of groundwater levels measured in 1994 2003 and 2014 regione lombardia 2017 observed heads along that boundary were 168 1 2 m in 1994 175 0 8 m in 2003 and 178 0 6 m in 2014 the eastern western and southern boundaries are simulated as 1st type bc with head values equal to the elevation of the river stage of adda ticino and po these rivers flow at a lower elevation than the regional groundwater level behaving as gaining rivers the lowland springs fontanili are simulated as seepage faces i e flux constrained 1st type bc with hydraulic head equal to the nodal elevation with a constraint that only allows outflow diersch 2014 the groundwater abstraction from 1721 wells located in the study area was simulated via the multi layer well bc diersch 2014 the pumping rates are available for 576 wells located in the milan urban area for these wells the total abstraction changed from a maximum of about 350 106 m3 year in the middle 70 s to about 2210 106 m3 year at present from 260 106 m3 year in 1994 to about 224 106 m3 year in 2014 leading to a relevant groundwater rebound crosta and de caro 2018 for the remaining 1145 wells of the study area the pumping rate was obtained from the volume of water distributed for drinking purposes for each municipality istat 2013 2016 for these wells total groundwater abstraction has been approximately constant over the last few decades equal to 246 106 m3 year istat 2016 all the wells in the milan urban area are screened in the semi confined aquifer while the other wells extract water from both the semi confined and unconfined aquifers average monthly recharge rates for the study area were derived from a simplified penman grindley model penman 1950 grindley 1970 and the evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using thornthwaite s 1980 equation starting from meteorological data 1950 2016 measured at 23 meteorological stations located within the study area arpa 2016 annual rainfall recharge values were applied on the model surface excluding urban impervious no infiltration areas mapped from available land use maps regione lombardia 2003 2008 2012 this allowed to take into account the variation of recharge related to the land use changes in the three simulated years losses from sewer and supply networks were considered within the milan urban area giving an additional recharge rate corresponding to 15 of the total water supply according to estimates from the water suppliers mm s p a the annual irrigation recharge values for the villoresi the naviglio pavese grande and the muzza areas were estimated by dividing the total distributed water volume by the extent of farming areas and subtracted by the crop evapotranspiration etc the etc was obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by an average crop coefficient kc according to the prevalent crop types allen et al 1998 maize cereals and forages regione lombardia 2012 for the muzza and the villoresi areas an average basal crop coefficient of 0 3 was applied for the naviglio pavese grande area a basal crop coefficient of 0 475 was used since rice is the prevailing crop type regione lombardia 2012 with these coefficients annual irrigation recharge values of 464 mm year 613 mm year and 850 mm year were obtained for the villoresi the muzza and the pavese naviglio grande irrigation areas respectively fig 2 5 3 modelling results the hydrodynamic parameters of the steady state model were calibrated on the 2014 groundwater heads which are the mean values of two measurements taken on may and september 2014 the average difference between measured groundwater levels is about 0 25 m in 124 piezometers then the calibrated model was validated on the piezometric levels of 1994 217 observation points and 2003 152 observation points the steady state model calibration was performed by inverse procedure pest doherty et al 1995 by using the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm glma to iteratively optimize the model parameters to fit to observed data i e observation points in each iteration process the glma adjusts the parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and storativity in such a way that the objective function is minimized doherty 2016 the initial values of hydraulic conductivity table 5 were obtained by averaging the interpolated keq values for each model subunit during the optimization process the hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted within the maximum and minimum values one order of magnitude of estimated hydraulic conductivity furthermore different values of the anisotropy ratio kv kh in the range between 0 1 and 0 5 todd 1980 were tested the calibrated values of both hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are reported in table 5 scatter plots of differences between observed and computed groundwater levels of steady state models show mean residuals of 2 87 m 3 23 m and 3 47 m for 2014 2003 and 1994 respectively fig 7 a b and c considering the extent of the study area these results indicate a reasonable agreement between simulated and observed hydraulic heads with calibrated hydraulic conductivity values that lay within the range of the estimated values table 5 on average calibrated values for unconfined aquifers varied up to 22 as logarithm with respect to the initial values the variation decreased to 5 15 and 3 for the aquitard the aquiclude and the semi confined aquifer respectively the hydraulic heads and the flow patterns for the unconfined aquifer in 2014 2003 and 1994 are shown in fig 7 these maps show relevant groundwater level differences between 1994 and 2014 in the milan metropolitan area where an increase of about 9 m was observed fig 7d the hydrogeological budget fig 7e shows some differences in the three years due to the different amounts of rainfall among these years 2003 was the driest with an annual rainfall from 605 mm to 512 mm and 2014 was the wettest with an annual rainfall from 1639 mm to 1238 mm the total recharge for the whole model from precipitation and irrigation ranges from about 0 8 109 m3 in 2003 to 2 9 109 m3 in 2014 while the upstream inflow from mountain basins ranges from 3 6 109 m3 2003 to 6 7 109 m3 2014 groundwater outflows are represented by gaining rivers lowland springs lateral outflow excluding rivers and well abstraction estimated lowland springs outflow is about 47 m3 s 22 4 m3 s and 13 5 m3 s for 2014 2003 and1994 respectively these values agree with the 1988 2000 monitored spring outflow rates that range between 10 m3 s and 25 m3 s bischetti et al 2012 the estimated outflow rate across the gaining rivers lambro adda ticino and po river ranges between 1 13 109 m3 2003 and 2 8 109 m3 2014 indicatively ranging between 1 5 and 3 2 7 and 11 and 1 3 and 5 of the total annual discharge flow of ticino adda and po rivers respectively groundwater horizontal outflow ranges between 2 5 109 m3 2003 and 5 9 109 m3 2014 finally the vertical flow from the unconfined to the semi confined aquifer ranges between 389 106 m3 in 2003 to 413 106 m3 in 2014 the effect of changes in the sink source values i e rainfall infiltration irrigation recharge and groundwater withdrawals on the calibrated heads was assessed through a sensitivity analysis by changing these values by specific percentages 25 50 and 100 of the initial values the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 8 as difference between the calibrated hydraulic heads at the observation points and the hydraulic heads of sensitivity scenarios the groundwater system appears to be sensitive to groundwater abstraction more than to rainfall and irrigation recharge fig 8 a decrease of 25 in groundwater withdrawals leads to a mean head increase in the range between 2 m and 8 m whereas a decrease of 25 in rainfall and irrigation recharge leads to a mean head decrease in the range between 0 2 m and 2 m fig 8a the largest influence is computed for the central sectors close to the milan urban area around 110 and 125 m a s l fig 8b whereas almost no change is observed at lower elevations south of milano rainfall cause the maximum change in areas with lower groundwater depth south of milano whereas irrigation is more effective in the area north sectors where the irrigation channel density is higher 6 discussion 6 1 hydro stratigraphic modelling and parametrization for the construction of the conceptual and hydrostratigraphic models this study fully exploits the available sedimentological knowledge regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 scardia et al 2006 garzanti et al 2011 scardia et al 2012 the deposits of the study area are principally fining upward braid plain sequences with aquifers in the coarse deposits at the base of the sequence and aquitards in the fine deposits of the upper part of the sequence this conceptual model served as a main criterion for the interpretation of the lithofacies along each borehole hence to mark the levels at which transition among the different sequences and aquifers occurs moreover the sedimentological information helped to recognize the different subunits the upper sequence is characterized by post lgm fan deposits which have been subdivided in various upper unconfined aquifer sectors to account for the different clastic facies of proximal and distal fringes of 5 major alluvial fans fontana et al 2014 the attribution of hydraulic parameters following the qualitative description of single layers as from the drilling logs is often affected by a large degree of subjectivity therefore in order to reduce the uncertainty several empirical relationships based on the grain size distribution parameters together with well test results have been used to define hydrofacies groups and to attribute the aquifer properties by isolating homogeneous sediment bodies anderson 1989 characterised by narrow ranges of hydraulic conductivity values these constitute the initial values of the 3d fem regional groundwater flow model aimed at the characterization of the groundwater budget components the possibility to define units with homogeneous hydraulic conductivity is extremely useful because it allows to reduce the computational effort at the expense of a lower resolution in terms of aquifer group heterogeneity this is strengthened by the fact that the calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity from the groundwater flow model slightly vary with respect to the initial values on the other hand starting from the 16 hydrofacies it could be possible to develop more complex stratigraphic descriptions by 3d geostatistical methods i e kriging co kriging or by 3d stochastic simulations i e sequential gaussian simulation sequential indicator simulation transition probability on categorical variables such as the hydrofacies guadagnini et al 2004 zappa et al 2006 dell arciprete et al 2012 comunian et al 2016 to be used for applications that go beyond the purposes of this research 6 2 groundwater models the hydraulic head distribution fig 7 for the unconfined aquifer suggests that the groundwater level heavily depends on the distance from wells especially in the highly populated city of milano and on gaining rivers at the boundary of the models the hydrogeological budget shows that the superficial recharge significantly affects the groundwater flow pattern with total spring and river discharge strongly reduced during dry years e g 2003 and groundwater levels rise leading to higher discharge rates through springs and rivers during rainy years e g 2014 figs 7 and 8b this effect is also evident because the groundwater abstraction which is the most influential component of the budget according to the sensitivity analysis is kept constant in the three different years the results of the sensitivity analysis on input parameters i e recharge irrigation and withdrawals can be useful to evaluate the potential effects of climate change an increase of groundwater recharge may result both from wet and cold future scenarios allen et al 2004 due to additional rainfall or from a reduction of evapotranspiration respectively on the other hand a dry scenario with a decrease of recharge might need more irrigation through groundwater withdrawals which could lower the groundwater levels or an increase of channel irrigation water volume i e considering the fully gravity driven irrigation network which in turn could lead to a groundwater level increase and a decrease in the river stage a careful investigation of such possible scenarios which is beyond the scope of this research will be relevant because it is clearly demonstrated how the sensitivity of groundwater levels to the various inputs is different for instance a 50 reduction of withdrawal with respect to the baseline scenario i e 2014 would lead to an increase of the water table up to 10 m in the city of milan with possible consequences on underground infrastructure these scenarios should also include the possible decrease in river discharge due to reduced water availability at higher elevation in basins where glaciers are retreating aili et al 2019 7 conclusions aquifer modelling and prediction of response to perturbations require a reliable representation of sedimentary and hydrogeological processes in this paper it is demonstrated that a multi dimensional approach for hydrostratigraphic modelling based on available sedimentological knowledge together with different methods for estimating aquifer parameters allows a robust characterization of fluvio glacial aquifers based on this characterization a 3d numerical model of the groundwater system was developed and calibrated for the milan metropolitan area allowing to quantify the most important components of the regional groundwater system such as well withdrawals discharge to gaining rivers and springs recharge from irrigation networks and vegetated areas and flow transfer between aquifers finally the investigation of the sensitivity of the groundwater system may allow to test hypotheses about the effects of climate and socio economic changes on the groundwater levels and water budget for the case study of milan for instance it appears that the impact of climate change may be secondary with respect to anthropogenic stresses which is an important finding with significant practical implications for a densely populated area such as

8357,study region the milan metropolitan area lies on one of the most important aquifer in italy heavily exploited for public and industrial water supply the area covering 3135 km2 in the po plain northern italy with a continental climate is bounded by the po the adda and the ticino rivers and by the prealpine foothills regional hydrology is characterised by a network of natural and man made elements and lowland springs the sedimentary sequence from bottom to top is formed by meandering river plain deposits the distal fringe of the glacial outwash plains and proximal braid plain deposits study focus this study proposes a general approach for aquifer geometry reconstruction and hydrodynamic parametrization of hydrofacies in fluvio glacial deposits and their implementation into a 3d regional groundwater flow model this approach is based on sedimentologically defined lithofacies hydrofacies and their correlation in space to obtain nearly homogeneous subunits starting from available data i e 8628 borehole logs grain size distributions well tests and sedimentological knowledge new hydrological insights for the region the calibrated 3d fem groundwater model allows quantifying the main components of the hydrogeological budget at the regional scale and the fluxes among the different hydro stratigraphic units a sensitivity analysis of groundwater levels to the main recharge components suggests importance of anthropogenic disturbances with respect to natural recharge and that land use change may impact water resources more than climate change keywords hydrofacies fluvio glacial sediments aquifer parametrization regional groundwater flow 1 introduction most urban areas are located in alluvial plains composed of loose sedimentary deposits where large and highly productive aquifers exist favouring the settlement of large populations for example the milan metropolitan area northern italy hosts about 5 million people corresponding to 8 5 of the italian population istat 2014 such urban concentration leads to an increasing pressure on groundwater resources in terms of abstraction and contamination goutaland et al 2013 intense abstraction from aquifers and changes in land use modify groundwater flow by forcing new discharge and recharge patterns foster 2001 in the last few decades many cities in the world started experiencing a groundwater rebound as the water demand by the industrial sector has fallen e g milano crosta and de caro 2018 paris lamé 2013 tokyo hayashi et al 2009 barcelona vázquez suñé et al 2005 melbourne mudd et al 2004

mobilization of contaminants lelliott et al 2006 foster 2001 cheney et al 1999 heathcote and crompton 1997 greswell et al 1994 brassington 1990 in densely populated areas accurate hydrogeological models are needed to obtain a reliable tool for groundwater resources management this requires a careful and reliable reconstruction of the aquifer geometry and proprieties which can have a significant control on groundwater simulated flow paths christensen et al 2017 for fluvio glacial aquifers understanding the heterogeneity of geological units at different scales plays a key role de marsily et al 2005 bayer et al 2011 refsgaard et al 2012 seifert et al 2012 kearsey et al 2015 approaches developed in the literature to describe fluvio glacial deposits vary as a function of the available input data and the modelling approach input data consist of hard data such as direct lithological and stratigraphic observations made on outcrops laboratory analysis on field samples or especially in urban areas borehole logs this hard data may be integrated with soft data including indirect observations produced through geophysical surveys ouellon et al 2008 mele et al 2013 comunian et al 2016 or remote sensing techniques christensen et al 2017 starting from this data the level of heterogeneity description may be different depending on the scale of the problem the difficulty of validating observation accuracy kearsey et al 2015 and the capability of extracting valuable information from the different data sources rajabi et al 2018 regarding the modelling approach deterministic and stochastic e g multiple point statistics and the transition probability approach approaches are the most used bianchi et al 2015 both allow the creation of numerical models consistent with the geological information and with the conceptual model despite the existence of problems relative to hydraulic parameterization in the first approach and to the smoothing error especially at the regional scale in the second approach watson et al 2015 caers 2000 in this research the main aim is to develop a regional scale conceptual and groundwater flow model starting from borehole data grain size distributions and well tests in order to analyse the overall groundwater flow behaviour and the main flow budget components this requires a simple model which should be able to capture the overall groundwater flow behaviour within the main aquifers without introducing complex fine resolution behaviours due to deposit heterogeneity on the other hand the conceptual and numerical models although simple need to be robust and hydro stratigraphically sound hence to meet the need of simplicity and robustness a multi dimensional approach is proposed and illustrated for the fluvio glacial deposits of the milan metropolitan area the approach relies on two main steps i the exploitation of the sedimentological knowledge of the area regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 garzanti et al 2011 scardia et al 2012 to constraint the conceptual model and ii the definition of hydrologically meaningful hydrofacies units through the analysis of borehole data and grain size distributions to assign hydraulic properties to the aquifers this approach fig 1 involves 1 the reconstruction of the aquifer geometry starting from well logs through a novel classification of the lithologies 2 the interpretation of cross sections and the interpolation of aquifer boundary surfaces 3 the definition of hydrofacies for the aquifer parametrization based on empirical relationships and validated by well test data and 4 the development of a regional steady state groundwater flow model to study the major components of the groundwater flow system for the milan metropolitan area several studies have been proposed which combine geological and geophysical data for the characterisation of the textural variations of the fluvio glacial deposits different at scales however the rigorous recognition of specific sedimentological and stratigraphic sequences the definition of hydrofacies groups and the validation by means of available datasets add meaning and robustness to this work highlight the difference with previous works in this area giudici et al 2000 bonomi 2009 giudici 2010 mele et al 2012 2013 comunian et al 2016 2 study area the milan metropolitan area fig 2 a is a portion 3135 km2 of the po plain northern italy bounded by the po river to the south the adda and the ticino rivers to the east and west respectively and by the prealps foothills to the north the climate is continental and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 mm year to over 1400 mm year from south to north fig 2c the study area is located downslope of the frontal moraines at the outlets of the adda and ticino alpine valleys and consists of glacial terraces and alluvial fan deposits subdivided in to high middle and low plains with a grain size decreasing southward the hydrology of the area is characterised by a dense network fig 2a of natural and man made elements such as rivers irrigation channels and lowland springs locally called fontanili these are man modified lowland springs fig 2a observed all over the po plain within an e w trending 20 kilometer wide belt about 600 kilometer long at the transition between the high and low plains along this transition the groundwater circulating within the coarse grained sediments rises to the ground level when it meets the fine grained sediments minelli et al 2001 three main depositional sequences have been recognised scardia et al 2006 2012 garzanti et al 2011 which can be summarized as follows from bottom to top fig 3 a the deep confined sequence consists of sandy lenses within clay and silt units representing the lower pliocene continental marine facies ps1 sequence late early pleistocene 1 4 0 87 ma formed by meandering river plain deposits fed from the western and central alps and prograding axially in low subsidence settings the sequence base consists of pliocene continental marine deposits the overlying sequence consists of sands and sandy gravels ranging in thickness between 50 m and 150 m and corresponds to the distal fringe of the glacial outwash plains which transversally prograde moving southward the base of the sequence consists of clay and silt layers and locally of conglomeratic units locally known as ceppo and marks the synchronous and widespread progradation of the braid plain sequences ps2 over the previous meandering river deposits during the major pleistocene glaciations in the alps about 0 87 ma the upper sequence consists mainly of gravel with a sandy matrix this sequence with a thickness between 20 m and 100 m overlays a clayey silty layer which is continuous in the southern portion of the study area but it disappears moving northward the inferred age of this layer is about 0 45 ma regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the sequence ps3 has been developed during the middle late pleistocene and consists of proximal braid plain deposits recently the compositional variations of the upper part of this sequence have been related to the lgm last glacial maximum

et al 2018 from a hydrogeological point of view the three sedimentary sequences correspond to the aquifer groups of the northern po plain referred in the literature as a unconfined aquifer corresponding to ps3 b semi confined aquifer ps2 and c confined aquifer ps1 regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the present study focuses on the first two aquifers a and b 3 stratigraphic modeling in the present study the hydrostratigraphic model has been delineated by using a multi dimensional approach fig 1 starting from borehole log analysis 1d to cross section interpretation 2d and spatial interpolation of aquifer limiting surfaces 3d 3 1 borehole log analysis the regional stratigraphic database caspita regione lombardia 2016 collects the borehole logs for the lombardy po plain area fig 2b the database contains information regarding the position the elevation the depth and the lithological description of the sediments for the study area 8628 borehole logs were collected and stored in a georeferenced database fig 2 together with 6 high resolution borehole logs from regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the 1d analysis consisted of grouping the lithological data according to a hierarchical order table 1 based on viable stratigraphic and hydrogeologic rules and considering the literature existing for small subdomains of the study area zappa et al 2006 mele et al 2012 cavalli 2012 comunian et al 2016 since the stratigraphic database contains 34 582 unique descriptors a preliminary analysis has been performed to properly code the information with readily accessible codified lithological descriptions using indices which represent abbreviations for typical features bayer et al 2011 a code i l was used where l denotes the prevailing texture g for gravel s for sand m for silt and c for clay or combinations and i indicates the dominant grain size c for coarse m for medium and f for fine this allowed to reduce the unique descriptors to 94 lithologies the lithologies have been further reclassified into 16 lithofacies considering only the main grain size and the subordinate components in order to allow the identification of major sedimentary sequences and to define units with assumed homogeneous hydraulic properties 3 2 cross section interpretation 150 vertical cross sections were interpreted from 1d data at the lithofacies level fig 1 table 2 to recognize the unconformities between the three fining upward depositional sequences ps1 ps2 and ps3 described by scardia et al 2012 along the 6 deep 200 m high resolution hr boreholes regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 fig 2 the unconformity l1 between the lower meandering river sequence ps1 and the overlying distal braidplain sequence ps2 is marked by the presence of silty clayey and sandy layers e g m sc sm c of the upper part of ps1 below the conglomeratic sandstone r in the northern sector or sandy levels sg s characterizing the bottom of ps2 the fining upward sequence ps2 shows a clear transition l2 between coarser deposits sand and gravels and sandy clayey and silty layers c m the top of which marks the unconformity l3 between ps2 and the proximal braidplain and megafan sequence ps3 characterized by gravelly layers g gs in the high plain and sandy layers s sg in the low pain fig 3b the concentration of indicator ion species no3 so4 and cl at different depths has been used as a supplemental interpretation criterion fig 3c in the analysis in fact the confined aquifer c corresponding to ps1 is mostly characterized by natural conditions preserved by the effective separation from the upper aquifers a and b which are affected by pollution de caro et al 2017 therefore the concentrations of main indicator ions associated with anthropogenic pollution delineate the effective separation between the semi confined and confined aquifers roughly corresponding to the nitrate natural background level of 25 mg l fig 3c 3 3 spatial interpolation of aquifer limiting surfaces the elevations of points located on the 2d surface limits l1 l2 l3 were interpolated to obtain 3d surfaces by using ordinary kriging with trend removal and a smoothing factor to adjust the weights of the neighbouring points table 3 for each surface the interpolation parameters have been optimized on the training subset i e 80 of the points and validated on a testing subset i e 20 of the points obtaining root mean square errors of 2 75 m 3 4 m and 3 2 m for l1 l2 and l3 respectively table 3 summarizes the parameters that minimize the root mean square error e rms between interpolated and measured elevations for each surface 4 hydraulic parametrization according to the definition of the aquifer groups given by regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 the aquifer limiting surfaces included in the stratigraphic model have been assumed to constitute the bottom of the semi confined aquifer b l1 the bottom of the aquitard between aquifer a and b l2 and the bottom of unconfined aquifer a l3 see table 1 4 1 hydrofacies definition since the lithofacies are defined based on sedimentological criteria they cannot be easily associated with the hydrological properties of the sediment for the purpose of hydrogeological modelling this requires the definition of hydrofacies with characteristic permeability and porosity values anderson 1989 the definition of the hydrofacies and their hydraulic properties is usually based on laboratory data field measurements and theoretical calculations on outcrop walls kostic et al 2005 bayer et al 2011 2015 this last approach is unsuitable for our case study where only core logging stratigraphic data which contain only the description of the prevailing grain size without details about texture or minor structures are available then a simple approach suitable for core logging data was required the grain size distribution of 113 borehole samples fig 4 covering all the sediment type spectra and different depth intervals in the study area have been analysed in order to assign tentative hydraulic conductivity k values through empirical models which are based on characteristic values of the grai n s ize distribution e g the effective diameter d10 the median diameter d50 and the uniformity coefficient c u supplementary table s1 the most appropriate empirical equations have been selected for each sample based the range of applicability of the methods table 4 see also supplementary table s1 the analysis revealed strong differences within the same lithofacies hence a further subdivision of the lithofacies into subclasses of different hydrofacies with similar hydraulic properties also accounting for subordinate granulometric components was required table 4 for each hydrofacies minimum maximum and mean k values were calculated fig 4 table 4 4 2 hydrodynamic parameter spatialization based on the k values of the different hydrofacies an equivalent depth averaged keq for parallel to layer flow conditions was calculated for each borehole of aquifer a above l3 surface and b between l1 and l2 surfaces by averaging the mean k values of the hydrofacies fig 4 and table 4 found along the log weighted by their relative thickness these keq values were interpolated within each aquifer by the ordinary kriging method to spatialize the single borehole log hydraulic conductivity value fig 5 shows the computed fields of hydraulic conductivity for the semi confined b and the unconfined a aquifers in order to evaluate the calculated keq values a comparison was made with hydraulic conductivity values obtained by well tests this comparison was performed by using cumulative probability plots which display the range of data on a percentile basis and allows to effectively display and compare the range of data in terms of probability edmunds and shand 2009 in particular the comparison was carried out by using different well tests for the unconfined aquifer a 21 lefranc tests fig 5a have been used which were made available by the water distribution companies for the semi confined aquifer b 525 long term steady rate pumping tests in the milan city area mm s p a historical database and 68 step drawdown well tests mainly outside the milan city area fig 5c have been used the transmissivity and the hydraulic conductivity were estimated from these tests by using the cassan method 1980 and the theis solution 1935 respectively these datasets have been considered together since no evident differences have been detected by using the bootstrap method de caro 2018 the comparison of empirical values and well test results does not reveal relevant differences in terms of probability distribution thus supporting the reliability of the interpolated keq values 4 3 definition of hydrostratigraphic units according to their hydrodynamic characteristics the two main aquifers a and b were further subdivided into relatively homogeneous subunits for the purpose of groundwater flow modelling this spatial discretization can be summarized as follows within the unconfined aquifer a three homogeneous zones have been identified fig 5a i a high conductivity zone 5 10 2 m s to 5 10 3 m s consisting of proximal gravelly fan deposits in the northern sector ii a moderate conductivity zone 5 10 3 m s to 1 10 4 m s characterized by distal sandy fringes of fan deposits in the southern sector of the fontanili belt and iii a low conductivity zone 1 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s corresponding to post lgm deposits as defined in fontana et al 2014 hence two gentle slope surfaces l4 and l5 fig 6 a linking the aquitard base of unconfined aquifer a to the ground surface fig 6a were introduced to separate these three zones within the semi confined aquifer two homogeneous zones have been distinguished i a proximal northern portion characterized by a larger variability in hydraulic conductivity values 5 10 4 m s to 1 10 5 m s and ii a distal southern portion showing quite homogeneous hydraulic conductivity 5 10 5 m s to 1 10 5 m s the volumetric distribution of each hydrofacies within each identified subunit i e proximal and distal fan fringes post lgm deposits and proximal and distal semi confined aquifers has been analysed fig 6 showing a good agreement with the conceptual stratigraphic model 5 groundwater modelling the hydrostratigraphic model was implemented into a 3d finite element model feflow diersch 2014 for groundwater modelling fig 6a a steady state condition was used to simulate the regional hydraulic head of three years 1994 2003 and 2014 for which groundwater level data were collected from over 447 monitoring points in the whole lombardy region 145 in the study area by the regional management and protection water plan regione lombardia 2017 in particular the steady state model was calibrated for 2014 and successively validated for 1994 and 2003 5 1 model setup the 3d finite element model includes 12 040 320 triangular prismatic finite elements divided in to 12 layers 1 003 360 elements per layer layers 1 4 represent the unconfined aquifer above the l3 surface fig 6a with a mean total thickness of about 35 m this aquifer is divided into three hydrostratigraphic units by the l4 and l5 surfaces fig 6a moreover the distal and proximal fan deposits above l5 have been further subdivided into 5 fan and megafan zones from w to e olona megafan omf lura fan lf seveso fan sf lambro megafan lmf and molgora megafan mmf according to fontana et al 2014 layer 5 represents the discontinuous aquitard between the unconfined and the semi confined aquifer with an average thickness of 3 m layers 6 11 represent the semi confined aquifer with a mean thickness of 50 m this is divided into proximal and distal portions fig 6a the thickness of each single layer of the 3d model varies between 3 m and 20 m depending on the thickness of the hydrogeological units and on the well screen length and position whereas the distance between nodes ranges from 1500 m down to 10 m near pumping wells and rivers 5 2 boundary conditions abstraction and recharge the northern boundary of the 3d finite element models is a 1st type boundary condition bc with a constant head value derived by the interpolation of groundwater levels measured in 1994 2003 and 2014 regione lombardia 2017 observed heads along that boundary were 168 1 2 m in 1994 175 0 8 m in 2003 and 178 0 6 m in 2014 the eastern western and southern boundaries are simulated as 1st type bc with head values equal to the elevation of the river stage of adda ticino and po these rivers flow at a lower elevation than the regional groundwater level behaving as gaining rivers the lowland springs fontanili are simulated as seepage faces i e flux constrained 1st type bc with hydraulic head equal to the nodal elevation with a constraint that only allows outflow diersch 2014 the groundwater abstraction from 1721 wells located in the study area was simulated via the multi layer well bc diersch 2014 the pumping rates are available for 576 wells located in the milan urban area for these wells the total abstraction changed from a maximum of about 350 106 m3 year in the middle 70 s to about 2210 106 m3 year at present from 260 106 m3 year in 1994 to about 224 106 m3 year in 2014 leading to a relevant groundwater rebound crosta and de caro 2018 for the remaining 1145 wells of the study area the pumping rate was obtained from the volume of water distributed for drinking purposes for each municipality istat 2013 2016 for these wells total groundwater abstraction has been approximately constant over the last few decades equal to 246 106 m3 year istat 2016 all the wells in the milan urban area are screened in the semi confined aquifer while the other wells extract water from both the semi confined and unconfined aquifers average monthly recharge rates for the study area were derived from a simplified penman grindley model penman 1950 grindley 1970 and the evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using thornthwaite s 1980 equation starting from meteorological data 1950 2016 measured at 23 meteorological stations located within the study area arpa 2016 annual rainfall recharge values were applied on the model surface excluding urban impervious no infiltration areas mapped from available land use maps regione lombardia 2003 2008 2012 this allowed to take into account the variation of recharge related to the land use changes in the three simulated years losses from sewer and supply networks were considered within the milan urban area giving an additional recharge rate corresponding to 15 of the total water supply according to estimates from the water suppliers mm s p a the annual irrigation recharge values for the villoresi the naviglio pavese grande and the muzza areas were estimated by dividing the total distributed water volume by the extent of farming areas and subtracted by the crop evapotranspiration etc the etc was obtained by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration by an average crop coefficient kc according to the prevalent crop types allen et al 1998 maize cereals and forages regione lombardia 2012 for the muzza and the villoresi areas an average basal crop coefficient of 0 3 was applied for the naviglio pavese grande area a basal crop coefficient of 0 475 was used since rice is the prevailing crop type regione lombardia 2012 with these coefficients annual irrigation recharge values of 464 mm year 613 mm year and 850 mm year were obtained for the villoresi the muzza and the pavese naviglio grande irrigation areas respectively fig 2 5 3 modelling results the hydrodynamic parameters of the steady state model were calibrated on the 2014 groundwater heads which are the mean values of two measurements taken on may and september 2014 the average difference between measured groundwater levels is about 0 25 m in 124 piezometers then the calibrated model was validated on the piezometric levels of 1994 217 observation points and 2003 152 observation points the steady state model calibration was performed by inverse procedure pest doherty et al 1995 by using the gauss levenberg marquardt algorithm glma to iteratively optimize the model parameters to fit to observed data i e observation points in each iteration process the glma adjusts the parameters i e hydraulic conductivity and storativity in such a way that the objective function is minimized doherty 2016 the initial values of hydraulic conductivity table 5 were obtained by averaging the interpolated keq values for each model subunit during the optimization process the hydraulic conductivity values were adjusted within the maximum and minimum values one order of magnitude of estimated hydraulic conductivity furthermore different values of the anisotropy ratio kv kh in the range between 0 1 and 0 5 todd 1980 were tested the calibrated values of both hydraulic conductivity and specific storage are reported in table 5 scatter plots of differences between observed and computed groundwater levels of steady state models show mean residuals of 2 87 m 3 23 m and 3 47 m for 2014 2003 and 1994 respectively fig 7 a b and c considering the extent of the study area these results indicate a reasonable agreement between simulated and observed hydraulic heads with calibrated hydraulic conductivity values that lay within the range of the estimated values table 5 on average calibrated values for unconfined aquifers varied up to 22 as logarithm with respect to the initial values the variation decreased to 5 15 and 3 for the aquitard the aquiclude and the semi confined aquifer respectively the hydraulic heads and the flow patterns for the unconfined aquifer in 2014 2003 and 1994 are shown in fig 7 these maps show relevant groundwater level differences between 1994 and 2014 in the milan metropolitan area where an increase of about 9 m was observed fig 7d the hydrogeological budget fig 7e shows some differences in the three years due to the different amounts of rainfall among these years 2003 was the driest with an annual rainfall from 605 mm to 512 mm and 2014 was the wettest with an annual rainfall from 1639 mm to 1238 mm the total recharge for the whole model from precipitation and irrigation ranges from about 0 8 109 m3 in 2003 to 2 9 109 m3 in 2014 while the upstream inflow from mountain basins ranges from 3 6 109 m3 2003 to 6 7 109 m3 2014 groundwater outflows are represented by gaining rivers lowland springs lateral outflow excluding rivers and well abstraction estimated lowland springs outflow is about 47 m3 s 22 4 m3 s and 13 5 m3 s for 2014 2003 and1994 respectively these values agree with the 1988 2000 monitored spring outflow rates that range between 10 m3 s and 25 m3 s bischetti et al 2012 the estimated outflow rate across the gaining rivers lambro adda ticino and po river ranges between 1 13 109 m3 2003 and 2 8 109 m3 2014 indicatively ranging between 1 5 and 3 2 7 and 11 and 1 3 and 5 of the total annual discharge flow of ticino adda and po rivers respectively groundwater horizontal outflow ranges between 2 5 109 m3 2003 and 5 9 109 m3 2014 finally the vertical flow from the unconfined to the semi confined aquifer ranges between 389 106 m3 in 2003 to 413 106 m3 in 2014 the effect of changes in the sink source values i e rainfall infiltration irrigation recharge and groundwater withdrawals on the calibrated heads was assessed through a sensitivity analysis by changing these values by specific percentages 25 50 and 100 of the initial values the results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in fig 8 as difference between the calibrated hydraulic heads at the observation points and the hydraulic heads of sensitivity scenarios the groundwater system appears to be sensitive to groundwater abstraction more than to rainfall and irrigation recharge fig 8 a decrease of 25 in groundwater withdrawals leads to a mean head increase in the range between 2 m and 8 m whereas a decrease of 25 in rainfall and irrigation recharge leads to a mean head decrease in the range between 0 2 m and 2 m fig 8a the largest influence is computed for the central sectors close to the milan urban area around 110 and 125 m a s l fig 8b whereas almost no change is observed at lower elevations south of milano rainfall cause the maximum change in areas with lower groundwater depth south of milano whereas irrigation is more effective in the area north sectors where the irrigation channel density is higher 6 discussion 6 1 hydro stratigraphic modelling and parametrization for the construction of the conceptual and hydrostratigraphic models this study fully exploits the available sedimentological knowledge regione lombardia and eni agip 2002 scardia et al 2006 garzanti et al 2011 scardia et al 2012 the deposits of the study area are principally fining upward braid plain sequences with aquifers in the coarse deposits at the base of the sequence and aquitards in the fine deposits of the upper part of the sequence this conceptual model served as a main criterion for the interpretation of the lithofacies along each borehole hence to mark the levels at which transition among the different sequences and aquifers occurs moreover the sedimentological information helped to recognize the different subunits the upper sequence is characterized by post lgm fan deposits which have been subdivided in various upper unconfined aquifer sectors to account for the different clastic facies of proximal and distal fringes of 5 major alluvial fans fontana et al 2014 the attribution of hydraulic parameters following the qualitative description of single layers as from the drilling logs is often affected by a large degree of subjectivity therefore in order to reduce the uncertainty several empirical relationships based on the grain size distribution parameters together with well test results have been used to define hydrofacies groups and to attribute the aquifer properties by isolating homogeneous sediment bodies anderson 1989 characterised by narrow ranges of hydraulic conductivity values these constitute the initial values of the 3d fem regional groundwater flow model aimed at the characterization of the groundwater budget components the possibility to define units with homogeneous hydraulic conductivity is extremely useful because it allows to reduce the computational effort at the expense of a lower resolution in terms of aquifer group heterogeneity this is strengthened by the fact that the calibrated values of hydraulic conductivity from the groundwater flow model slightly vary with respect to the initial values on the other hand starting from the 16 hydrofacies it could be possible to develop more complex stratigraphic descriptions by 3d geostatistical methods i e kriging co kriging or by 3d stochastic simulations i e sequential gaussian simulation sequential indicator simulation transition probability on categorical variables such as the hydrofacies guadagnini et al 2004 zappa et al 2006 dell arciprete et al 2012 comunian et al 2016 to be used for applications that go beyond the purposes of this research 6 2 groundwater models the hydraulic head distribution fig 7 for the unconfined aquifer suggests that the groundwater level heavily depends on the distance from wells especially in the highly populated city of milano and on gaining rivers at the boundary of the models the hydrogeological budget shows that the superficial recharge significantly affects the groundwater flow pattern with total spring and river discharge strongly reduced during dry years e g 2003 and groundwater levels rise leading to higher discharge rates through springs and rivers during rainy years e g 2014 figs 7 and 8b this effect is also evident because the groundwater abstraction which is the most influential component of the budget according to the sensitivity analysis is kept constant in the three different years the results of the sensitivity analysis on input parameters i e recharge irrigation and withdrawals can be useful to evaluate the potential effects of climate change an increase of groundwater recharge may result both from wet and cold future scenarios allen et al 2004 due to additional rainfall or from a reduction of evapotranspiration respectively on the other hand a dry scenario with a decrease of recharge might need more irrigation through groundwater withdrawals which could lower the groundwater levels or an increase of channel irrigation water volume i e considering the fully gravity driven irrigation network which in turn could lead to a groundwater level increase and a decrease in the river stage a careful investigation of such possible scenarios which is beyond the scope of this research will be relevant because it is clearly demonstrated how the sensitivity of groundwater levels to the various inputs is different for instance a 50 reduction of withdrawal with respect to the baseline scenario i e 2014 would lead to an increase of the water table up to 10 m in the city of milan with possible consequences on underground infrastructure these scenarios should also include the possible decrease in river discharge due to reduced water availability at higher elevation in basins where glaciers are retreating aili et al 2019 7 conclusions aquifer modelling and prediction of response to perturbations require a reliable representation of sedimentary and hydrogeological processes in this paper it is demonstrated that a multi dimensional approach for hydrostratigraphic modelling based on available sedimentological knowledge together with different methods for estimating aquifer parameters allows a robust characterization of fluvio glacial aquifers based on this characterization a 3d numerical model of the groundwater system was developed and calibrated for the milan metropolitan area allowing to quantify the most important components of the regional groundwater system such as well withdrawals discharge to gaining rivers and springs recharge from irrigation networks and vegetated areas and flow transfer between aquifers finally the investigation of the sensitivity of the groundwater system may allow to test hypotheses about the effects of climate and socio economic changes on the groundwater levels and water budget for the case study of milan for instance it appears that the impact of climate change may be secondary with respect to anthropogenic stresses which is an important finding with significant practical implications for a densely populated area such as

8358,study region india study focus india boasts the largest irrigated agricultural system in the world relying on groundwater to address the strong linkages between the natural groundwater and the anthropogenic irrigated system requires innovative hydrological modeling geared at informing national policies on groundwater management and future development of irrigated agriculture for this we developed a predictive integrated hydrological and groundwater use model and evaluated the model using total water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the utility of the model was demonstrated in a case study in which the model was applied to project the groundwater balance in northwest india under four rcp representative concentration pathways scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the model shows good identifiability to grace data in northwest india and with incorporated groundwater irrigation simulation module the model can adequately replicate the declining trend in tws over this region it is concluded that by assuming a unchanged pattern of agricultural water use climate change is likely to help reduce the magnitude of the groundwater deficit but the beneficial effect is insufficient to halt the trend of groundwater depletion this result provides new evidence for the importance of groundwater conservation through changes in cropping patterns and improved groundwater governance keywords groundwater irrigation india grace gravity recovery and climate experiment swat soil and water assessment tool climate change 1 introduction hydrological research traditionally focuses on physical processes but the importance of investigating linkages between the anthroposphere and the hydrosphere has been well recognized wagener et al 2010 in this paper we developed a model that integrates groundwater use for irrigation into a national scale hydrological simulation system of india where the anthropogenic influence of groundwater irrigation has dramatically changed the country s water resource base india boasts one of the largest irrigated agricultural systems in the world with more than 60 million hectares equipped for irrigation fao aquastat furthermore more than 60 of the irrigated area is fed by groundwater fao aquastat the heavy use of groundwater for irrigation has created extensive concerns about overdraft and depletion and has made india a global hotspot for water resources studies kumar et al 2007 foster et al 2008 any hydrological model of india that is developed or used for decision support will therefore need to be able to quantify the impact of groundwater irrigation we developed the model using the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and publicly available data in particular total water storage tws variation data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 against which model performance was evaluated grace tws data provide observations of terrestrial total water storage anomalies that integrate variations of all vertical components of water storages and have been applied for groundwater resources assessments in india at a national scale by rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 and asoka et al 2017 etc they were also used by barik et al 2017 to examine the food water energy nexus in india over recent time periods what distinguishes our study from these studies is that past applications of grace tws data in india focused on using trends derived from the grace tws data to estimate historical groundwater depletion rates while our study developed a predictive model with enhanced representation of linkages between groundwater irrigation and groundwater storage modules representing anthropogenic water use have been developed and incorporated into a number of large scale hydrologic simulation models cai and rosegrant 2002 alcamo et al 2003 hanasaki et al 2008 wada et al 2012 döll et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 wada et al 2016 and grace data have been used in the validation of some of these models f ex döll 2012 and 2014 however these models have global coverage and did not include detailed results discussion and information on model uncertainty for individual countries in this study we also tested the feasibility of applying process based crop simulation techniques in the development of a large scale integrated hydrological water use model in a country with varying climate and intensive agricultural water use simulation of irrigation water demand and irrigation water use in global models is primarily based on the fao 56 crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 döll and siebert 2002 wada et al 2014 which links consumptive water use of crops to climate variables through a series of coefficients swat originally designed as a meso scale river basin model incorporates algorithms from the epic erosion productivity impact calculator crop simulation model williams et al 1989 and therefore is capable of simulating plant water uptake and irrigation water application processes in much greater detail the size of study river basins in swat applications typically range from tens to several thousand square kilometers but in recent years the model has also been applied at national and continental levels schuol et al 2008 xie et al 2012 moreover as described in section 3 with the incorporation of the groundwater irrigation simulation module the model can adequately replicate the declining trend in tws in northwest india in section 4 we applied the model developed in this study to provide a partial analysis of the impact of climate change on groundwater balances in northwest india as a demonstration of the utility of the model the prospects of extending the model to provide fuller analysis to inform policy making for groundwater management and groundwater fed irrigated agriculture under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions are also discussed 2 data and method 2 1 swat and watershed delineation swat is a semi distributed river basin model using digital elevation data from the hydrosheds hydrological data and maps based on

harvested area of each of the five crops under groundwater irrigation in each subbasin was further estimated using data on area equipped with groundwater irrigation from a global groundwater irrigation inventory developed by siebert et al 2010 fig 3 we calculated 1 a g w c a t o t a l c f r g w where a g w c is groundwater irrigated harvested area for crop c in a subbasin a t o t a l c is total irrigated harvested area of crop c in the subbasin and f r g w is the share of irrigated area equipped with groundwater irrigation in the subbasin 0 1 derived from the groundwater irrigation inventory data developed by siebert et al 2010 moreover among the five crops sugarcane is a perennial crop maize and cotton are mainly kharif summer season crops while the cultivation of wheat mainly occurs in the rabi winter season for these crops a single growing season is assumed in each year in the model with planting dates and length of the growing season estimated by sacks et al 2010 and the physical irrigated areas in each growing season are equal to the annual harvested irrigated areas as for rice india features up to three rice growing seasons kharif rabi and pre kharif the physical areas of irrigated rice in each season were estimated using data on rice cropping patterns compiled by frolking et al 2006 it is worth noting that in this study we limited our effort to simulating groundwater irrigation and viewed this as a step toward developing a more full fledged national hydrological model of india simulation of irrigation from surface water is linked to modeling storage variations and water conveyance and allocation processes in man made surface water infrastructure however there is a lack of data to support such simulations although global hydrological modeling studies simulate assumed water infrastructure operation rules for modeling human water uses including surface water irrigation f ex hanasaki et al 2006 döll et al 2012 such approaches are less justifiable at the national level the unaccounted surface water irrigation has implications for modeling groundwater balances see the discussion for eq 6 and this constitutes a major limitation of our study omitting the water storage variation from man made water infrastructure which is a component of the tws variation detected in grace also implies greater uncertainty in grace data based model evaluation in fact there is uncertainty originating from unvalidated model performance in simulating whole surface water system however national river discharge data are difficult to obtain for india in this study we left the model uncalibrated unvalidated in terms of its performance in modeling surface water hydrology the soil data used in this study were obtained from the waterbase george and leon 2008 this data set is developed based on the fao unesco soil map of the world and contains derived soil properties required for swat modeling a dominant soil type was identified in each subbasin and used for hru definition 2 3 irrigation and groundwater storage simulation swat operates at a daily time step the simulation algorithms in the model are described in detail in neitsch et al 2011 only those components that are relevant to simulating irrigation and groundwater balance are discussed here modifications were made to address limitations in the swat model in simulating irrigation for paddy rice and groundwater storage variation 2 3 1 irrigation simulation in swat the crop simulation algorithm in swat originates from the epic erosion productivity impact calculator model williams et al 1989 on each day during a growing season the model keeps track of root leaf and biomass development of crops and calculates crop water demand as well as the amount of water the plant can actually uptake from the soil swat provides functions to simulate irrigation events for this study the auto irrigation scheme was used to simulate irrigation activities related to the production of cotton maize sugarcane and wheat under this auto irrigation scheme irrigation can be triggered automatically based on water stress experienced by crops or irrigation water is applied whenever the water stress of the crop exceeds a specified threshold crop water stress is calculated as 2 w s t r 1 e a e t where w s t r is water stress on a given day with a value ranging from 0 to 1 e t is the potential transpiration or water demand of a crop on a given day mmh2o and e a is the amount of water actually taken up or transpired by the plant mmh2o once auto irrigation is invoked soil moisture will be restored to soil field capacity while the auto irrigation algorithm in swat is suitable to simulate irrigation for upland crops the model has limitations in simulating irrigated rice production pothole module in swat is often used as an option in modeling rice paddy which is designed to simulate hydrology in closed depressions with ponded water however the module cannot adequately simulate infiltration in saturated soils underlying paddy fields and tends to underestimate percolation losses sakaguchi et al 2014 furthermore the auto irrigation algorithm with crop water stress as a trigger is no longer applicable as the key decision variable for irrigated rice is ponded water depth in this study we adopted the modifications proposed by kang et al 2006 xie and cui 2011 and sakaguchi et al 2014 to improve the capacity of the swat pothole module in simulating water balances and irrigation for irrigated rice production we assumed a constant daily percolation rate for the water balance calculation when the field is flooded kang et al 2006 and sakaguchi et al 2014 second we implemented the irrigation simulation algorithm for paddy proposed by xie and cui 2011 in this algorithm the water depth in paddy varies between a predefined minimum fitting depth and a maximum ponding depth irrigation occurs when the water depth drops below the minimum fitting depth and the objective of the irrigation operation is to fill the paddy field with water to the maximum fitting depth minimum fitting depth maximum fitting depth maximum ponding depth the values of the three critical water depths vary by the growth stage of rice table 1 in xie and cui 2011 using the simulation algorithms described above the pumping rate of groundwater for irrigation was first estimated as soil moisture deficit with respect to soil field capacity for crops other than paddy rice or ponded water depth deficit with respect to maximum fitting depth of paddy fields and then adjusted for water losses in irrigation application which are unaccounted for in the simulation e g water conveyance losses by an irrigation efficiency coefficient santhi et al 2005 3 q i r r q i r r γ where q i r r is the estimated groundwater pumping rate for irrigation mmh2o q i r r is the irrigation water demand estimated without consideration of unaccounted for water losses in irrigation mmh2o and γ is the irrigation efficiency coefficient the volume of pumped groundwater for irrigation was also constrained by the water storage in aquifers irrigation stops when aquifer water is depleted 2 3 2 groundwater balance simulation in swat swat uses the soil conservation service curve number method soil conservation service scs 1972 to calculate surface runoff and the model simulates infiltration evaporation plant water uptake and interflow generation processes in the soil profile groundwater aquifers are recharged by water infiltrating through the soil in swat for each hru groundwater storage is partitioned into two components one represents shallow aquifer and the other deep aquifer either component can be assigned as the water source for irrigation from which groundwater is abstracted moreover both components can contribute to baseflow groundwater baseflow from each component is calculated as 4 q g w i q g w i 1 e x p α g w δ t q r c h r g i 1 e x p α g w δ t where q g w i is the groundwater flow on a given day i mm h2o q g w i 1 is the groundwater flow on the preceding day i 1 mmh2o α g w is the baseflow recession coefficient day 1 δ t is the time step 1 day and q r c h r g i is the amount of recharge entering aquifer on day i mmh2o water in shallow aquifers can also be removed by the revap process which is defined in swat to account for water removed from shallow aquifers through the capillary fringe that separates saturated from unseparated zones revap occurs when water storage in shallow aquifers exceeds a certain threshold and the amount of water removed by the revap process on a given day q r e v a p m a x mm h2o is calculated as 5 q r e v a p m a x β r e v a p e 0 where β r e v a p is the revap coefficient and e 0 is the potential evapotransipration for the day mm h2o in this study we substituted a new groundwater module for the module in swat the water balance for groundwater storage in the new module is 6 δ s q r c h r g q g w q i r r where δ s is groundwater storage change on a given day mmh2o q r c h r g is the recharge mmh2o q g w is groundwater flow out of the storage on a given day mmh2o and q i r r is the amount of water abstracted for irrigation or pumping rate mmh2o we chose to omit the revap process since the effect of the revap process tends to be confounded with the effect of irrigation water withdrawal a large revap coefficient can lead to similar declines of groundwater storage as irrigation water withdrawals and data to describe the revap process is lacking aquifer formations in india generally fall into two groups central ground water board cgwb 2012 unconsolidated and consolidated semi consolidated unconsolidated aquifers underlie the indo gangetic and brahmaputra plains in northern india macdonald et al 2016 fig 1 they serve as large underground reservoirs to support the intensive irrigated agriculture in the region by contrast aquifers in central and southern india are predominantly consolidated semi consolidated with limited water storage capacity in the new module we distinguish between these two types of aquifers for subbasins with unconsolidated aquifers as the dominant formation the groundwater storage is still partitioned into two components although the two components are referred to as active and inactive instead in the simulation only the active storage contributes to groundwater baseflow and when irrigation occurs water is first abstracted from the active storage as water in the active storage component is depleted no further baseflow will be discharged from the aquifer to streams and water will start to be abstracted from the inactive component the initial storage in the active component is established through a spin up see section 2 5 unlimited groundwater storage is assumed in unconsolidated aquifers a large positive value was thus assigned as initial storage of the inactive component of groundwater storage the baseflow from the active storage of the aquifer is calculated as 7 q g w k q a c t i v e where k is the groundwater flow recession constant and q a c t i v e is the volume of water in the active component of groundwater storage mmh2o this equation has been extensively applied in hydrologic modeling to estimate groundwater flow f ex chapman 1999 fenicia et al 2006 beck et al 2013 the motivation of replacing eq 4 with eq 7 is to better reflect the impact of irrigation water withdrawal on groundwater flow there is a lack of response in groundwater baseflow calculated using eq 4 to changes in groundwater storage caused by irrigation zeng and cai 2014 for river basins with consolidated semi consolidated aquifers the entire storage was assumed to be active with baseflow being calculated using eq 7 the recharge term q r c h r g in eq 6 includes contributions from precipitation and return flows from groundwater irrigation in our model in reality groundwater can also be replenished by water from surface water irrigation which includes not only percolation from fields irrigated with surface water but also seepage from irrigation canals during water conveyance macdonald et al 2016 singh 2011 irrigation canals are typically built as components of large scale surface water irrigation projects the seepage rate of water from irrigation canals is a function of canal length lining materials water residence time and wetted perimeter and effective hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium santhi et al 2005 as noted above considering limited data availability recharge from surface water irrigation was omitted and this is a primary source of uncertainty in our study the pumping rate q i r r was estimated using the irrigation simulation algorithm described in section 2 3 1 2 4 grace data and comparison of swat and grace based tws variation data the grace tws data used for this study were obtained from cnes grgs centre national d etudes spatiales groupe de recherches de géodésie spatiale rl3 v3 product which provides an improved temporal resolution 10 day means with high spatial resolution the stokes coefficients were truncated at degree 50 i e 400 km spatial resolution to address the issue of decreasing signal to noise ratio with increasing spatial resolution spherical harmonic data were recombined and projected on a 0 5 latitude longitude grid following wahr et al 1998 for model identification we compared the grace based and swat simulated tws variations during 306 10 day intervals between july 29 2002 and june 2 2011 grace tws variation data are missing for 18 10 day intervals during the periods from november 26 2002 to february 23 2003 may 25 2003 to july 3 2003 january 20 2004 to january 29 2004 and december 24 2010 to february 1 2011 the strategy applied to compare grace and swat based tws variations is discussed in detail in xie et al 2012 and is summarized below firstly we computed basin wide tws variations for each 10 day interval and disaggregated them on a 0 5 degree grid based on daily swat simulation results secondly regional model outputs were nested in a global model simulated tws variations from the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 in nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 were used as prior information to fill the regions outside the swat simulated area the global tws data were then projected on spherical harmonics using shtools https shtools oca eu shtools the projection converted the model based tws variation fields to grace resolution and allowed a comparison of the two data sets güntner 2008 2 5 climate data and spin up swat provides three options for estimating potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 the penman monteith method monteith 1965 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method was selected for this option climate data for precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed data are required in the swat simulation the gridded one degree daily 1dd data from 1997 through 2011 of these variables covering the grace tws data period were obtained through the agroclimatology portal of the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource power project original data sources include the global precipitation climate project gpcp the goddard earth observing system model version 4 and version 5 geos 4 geos 5 the release 3 of the nasa gewex surface radiation budget gewex srb 3 0 project and the nasa s fast longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes flashflux project during model development the subbasin wide estimates of these climatic variables were calculated by averaging gridded based climate data using fractions of area covered by different climate data grid cells as weights schuol and abbaspour 2007 in swat modeling initial conditions of hydrologic state variables including active groundwater storages are unknown and are established through spin up simulations given the need to initialize active groundwater storage a long spin up period 1910 2001 was used climate data obtained from isi mip which were downscaled from the noresm1 m model were used for simulation during the spin up period groundwater based irrigated agriculture in india started to take off during the 1960s as part of the green revolution groundwater irrigation activities during 1950 2001 were simulated in the spin up simulation in which sizes of groundwater irrigated crop hrus in each subbasin were adjusted dynamically by a ratio derived from historical data on state wise groundwater irrigated area reflecting the actual pathways of groundwater driven irrigation expansion bhaduri et al 2006 gandhi and namboodiri 2009 3 results of model identification figs 4 6 present

irrigation efficiency 0 7 soil evaporation compensation factor 0 95 groundwater recession coefficient 0 05 the map in fig 4 a shows the model quality on a grid basis obtained from simulation that does not consider groundwater irrigation the agreement between the observed and simulated tws data series was measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse is a coefficient extensively used in hydrologic modeling for model evaluation its value ranges from to 1 and equals unity when model output and observations are identical fig 4 partitions india into three regions the northwest region i the northeast and east region ii and the central and southern region region iii the northwest region defined in this study covers an area of 0 9 million km2 and stretches across seven indian states punjab haryana delhi himachal pradesh uttar pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir this region accounts for 40 of irrigated area of the country the northeast and east region for 28 and the central and southern region for 32 moreover approximately 70 of the irrigated area in the northwest region is irrigated by groundwater the shares are 61 and 63 in the northeast and east region and the central and southern region respectively as evident in the map the model fit is very good in the northeast and east region of india and good in the central and southern region of the country however poor values of nse can be found in northwest india indicating that the simulated tws values deviate substantially from grace observations the reasons behind the displayed model misfit over the region are revealed in fig 5 a and b and the aggregated tws time series plots in fig 6 a fig 5 a b shows the trends in gridded tws data from grace and the model simulation in filtered space without simulated groundwater use for irrigation respectively large scale depletion trends up to 70 mm h2o yr in northwest india can be seen in the trend map based on grace data fig 5a whereas such patterns cannot be seen when groundwater irrigation simulation is turned off fig 5b fig 6 a shows the aggregated grace based and simulated tws data series over northwest india the map also shows a downward trend in the grace based tws data series while such a trend is lacking in the simulated tws data series when simulations include groundwater irrigation activities model fit improves significantly in the northwest region of india and the model successfully replicates tws trends in grace data as indicated by the gridded nse map in fig 4 b and the corresponding gridded tws trend maps in fig 5 c at grace resolution and fig 5 d at full resolution and the aggregated model based tws data series in fig 6 b encouraged by the promising results obtained from the initial model evaluation further analysis was performed with quantification of parametric uncertainty in the simulation the analysis was conducted using the conceptual framework of generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 five model parameters were included in the analysis these parameters and their value ranges used for the analysis are shown in table 2 in addition to those parameters defined to characterize groundwater use processes for irrigation and groundwater flow prrp water percolation rate in rice paddy wstr threshold of upland crop water stress triggering irrigation γ irrigation efficiency and k groundwater recession coefficient we also took the soil evaporation compensation factor esco into account soil moisture variability is a major source of the simulated tws variation and esco is a key parameter defined in swat for modeling soil moisture variation the implementation of glue involved monte carlo sampling of uncertain parameters two hundred random samples were drawn uniformly from the specified parameter value space plots in fig 7 provide a comparison of pair wise nse values calculated using aggregated grace based and simulated tws data series over three regions within india in cases with and without simulated groundwater irrigation consistent with observations from figs 4 6 groundwater use for irrigation is the main process influencing tws trends in northwest india in the swat simulation by contrast nse values for the other two regions only vary slightly after groundwater irrigation is incorporated into the simulation glue is designed to accommodate parametric uncertainty in the model simulation referred to as equifinality arising from the existence of multiple behavioral parameter sets all behavioral parameter sets enable the model to fit the observation data acceptably well fig 8 presents dotted plots showing correspondence between sampled parameter values and the resultant nse values which indicates model fit over the northwest region of india obtained from monte carlo sampling based on these results and following the spirit of the glue method an nse cutoff value of 0 8 was selected and 83 out of 200 sampled parameter sets associated with nse values greater than 0 8 were accepted as behavioral the strong equifinality revealed in the glue analysis leads to large uncertainty in the simulated water balance and tws the ensemble of tws variations over northwest india simulated using the identified behavioral parameter sets are shown in fig 6 b the distributions of estimated groundwater recharge groundwater baseflow irrigation water withdrawal and annual average groundwater depletion are displayed in fig 9 modeled groundwater depletion over the region ranges from 14 km3 h2o yr to 29 km3 h2o yr with a mean value of 23 9 km3 h2o yr and the mode at 24 3 km3 h2o yr note that the uncertainty cnes grgs grace tws trend is 27 2 km3 from weighted least square regression that lays within the uncertainty interval derived from the glue analysis we also considered capturing grace uncertainty using a wider range of grace products farinotti et al 2015 when using the full range of grace products namely official products csr gfz jpl release 5 and alternative products processed by tu graz release 2016 mayer gürr et al 2016 huazhong university of science and technology release 16 zhou et al 2017 tongji university release 2 chen et al 2016 and the astronomical institute from univ bern release 2 the estimated trend is 29 2 5 km3 which still partially overlaps with the glue interval in the glue analysis model fit to grace tws data was measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency which incorporates the effect of seasonal variation of tws it might be possible to use the information on uncertainty of the grace tws trend to further narrow down the selection of the behavioral parameters in future work when more certain estimates for uncertainty bounds of grace tws trends become available as the variability in the different estimates for grace tws trend uncertainty is not fully understood we did not use such information in the glue analysis in this study 4 assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater storage in northwest india the validity of the developed hydrological agricultural groundwater use model in simulating groundwater storage variation in northwest india was established through the results of validation analysis presented in the preceding section as a demonstration of the predictive skill of the model we extended the simulation to 2050 to simulate future groundwater storage groundwater irrigation in northwest india under changed climate conditions the model developed in this study takes data on crop mix in groundwater fed irrigated agriculture as an input groundwater irrigation is expected to increase in the future in line with income and population growth and because groundwater is considered to be the most productive component of the agricultural production system at the same time concerns about groundwater depletion are counteracting factors and may lead to policies and regulations to curb the development of groundwater based irrigated agriculture india is also a major player in global agriculture markets as a result policy options and interventions which may result in major changes in food production might affect global food security and need to be carefully evaluated in the context of global agriculture trade for these reasons any future crop pattern changes would be part of a complex decision making process a tradeoff analysis that considers food security and groundwater sustainability as objectives and includes future cropping pattern as a decision variable would therefore be needed to inform a thorough discussion about policies for groundwater management and groundwater fed irrigated agriculture under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions and more integrated modeling system that couples the hydrological groundwater use model with food production agricultural economic trade modeling tool needs to be applied to support the tradeoff analysis the paper focuses on presenting the development of a hydrological model with improved representation of agricultural groundwater use processes instead of providing a full tradeoff analysis in this case study we considered a special case in which the cropping pattern of irrigated agriculture and irrigation efficiencies were kept constant the case study provides insights that could be used to inform policy discussions qualitatively on the direction and urgency of shifting agricultural groundwater use patterns the projection analysis used climate change data downscaled by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip hempel et al 2013 isi mip offers a framework for consistently assessing the impacts of climate change across sectors a large collection of food and agricultural trade models used these data nelson et al 2014 the isi mip climate data are downscaled from outputs of five general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m generated under four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 the five gcms were selected by isimip because projections from these gcms span a wide range of the space of projected global mean temperature change and relative precipitation changes warszawski et al 2014 studies evaluating the performance of gcms over india for example saha et al 2014 revealed that the majority of cmip5 gcms failed to simulate the decreasing trend of the indian monsoon in historical experiments in a more recent study gusain et al 2020 improvement was found to be made in cmip6 models which can capture indian monsoon characteristics reasonably well at the time of this study the full set results from cmip6 were not available we therefore choose to only report results from noresm1 m scenarios noresm1 m is a top rated model among a collection of cmpi5 gcms based on its performance in simulating present climate characteristics of indian summer monsoon sharmila et al 2015 changes in annual precipitation and average daily temperature between base period 2002 2011 and the last decade of the projection period 2041 2050 indicative of trends of climate change over northwest india projected by the noresm1 m are shown in table 3 the extent to which climate change will influence groundwater balances also depends on the changes of other climate variables solar radiation humidity and wind speed and temporal and spatial variability of these variables within the time horizon of the projection analysis and within the spatial extent of the study region the model developed in this study helps translate these trends and variabilities associated with climate change into quantitative estimates for the magnitude of impact on groundwater storage under the presence of intensive of agricultural groundwater water use box plots indicating distributions of projected annual average groundwater depletion rates during the projection period 2012 2050 are shown in fig 10 a the model behavioral parameter sets identified through the glue analysis were used to generate these projections the projected groundwater depletion rates vary over a wide range compared to the estimated groundwater storage depletion rates in the base period slightly accelerated groundwater depletion rates were projected under the rcp 4 5 scenario while decreased depletion rates were found under the other three scenarios the histogram in fig 10 b further summarizes the differences between groundwater depletion rates in the projection and base periods model realizations associated with all identified behavioral parameter sets and under all rcp scenarios were combined to construct the histogram and all realizations were assigned equal probability according to the histogram there is a 84 chance that the groundwater depletion rate would be lower with a reduction of up to 10 km3 h2o yr the projected increases in precipitation under climate change table 3 may lead to an anticipation that there could be amelioration in groundwater depletion the simulation results in this projection analysis confirmed the likely existence of the ameliorating effect however in all cases the depleting trend will continue even with the most optimistic forecast there will still be a deficit of 9 km3 h2o in the annual groundwater storage budget fig 10a the model results are therefore certainly not a call to sit back and relax but instead a call for more systematic efforts to measure monitor and manage the important groundwater resources of india with a focus on arresting depletion trends the variability of results across rcp scenarios furthermore highlights the challenges of managing groundwater resources in the face of uncertainty brought about by climate change 5 conclusions and discussions india is a country with intensive groundwater fed irrigated agriculture and the large extraction of groundwater for food production has created concerns about the sustainability of groundwater resources for both current and future citizens in this paper we incorporated groundwater use processes for irrigation into a national scale swat model of india the development of the model was based on publicly available data and the model was evaluated and calibrated using grace tws data the results of the model identification confirm that the integrated hydrologic groundwater use model can capture groundwater storage depletion in northwest india and therefore can serve as a promising predictive modeling tool to quantify the anthropogenic impact of irrigation on groundwater resources in the region the utility of the developed model is demonstrated in a case study presented in section 4 in which the model was applied to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater storage in northwest india under four rcp scenarios the assessment results suggest that without consideration of the effect of changes in cropping patterns and irrigation water use efficiency it is well possible that climate change will ameliorate the groundwater deficit in northwest india however the beneficial effect is not strong enough to reverse depletion trends mathematical models provide simplified representations of real world systems and processes and the modeling exercises inevitably involve uncertainties discussions of some key uncertainties and limitations arising from model development and applications have been provided in the previous sections they are summarized here with a few more added firstly in this study we used the glue approach to treat parametric uncertainty in the modeling as an additional remark from the glue analysis while grace tws data prove to provide highly informative information on spatial patterns of vertically integrated water storage variations and are of great value for understanding agricultural groundwater use processes in northwest india the large remaining uncertainty in the model parameters which were indicated by the wide ranges of estimated groundwater depletion rates suggests that it is desirable when possible to introduce observations on other hydrologic variables to provide further constraints in model identification in addition to the parametric uncertainty there are also uncertainties arising from other sources as already noted a major limitation in our study is the omission of surface water irrigation which may bias estimates for those variables in the groundwater balance additional uncertainty related to the co2 effect of plant evaporation exists in projections of the impact of climate change on groundwater balances it is well known that plant growth can benefit from co2 enrichment that helps improve the water use efficiency of plants swat incorporates an algorithm to simulate the effects of atmospheric co2 enrichment however the algorithm was formulated based on data obtained in a controlled experimental environment stockle et al 1992 on which experiments from open air field conditions long et al 2006 cast uncertainty given this uncertainty the co2 effect was not simulated in this study lastly there is also uncertainty associated with input data f ex on irrigated crop area and climate and grace tws data processing which are exemplified by the existence of multiple data products in each category sakumura et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 choosing different data products may have implications for model identification and simulation results finally as indicated in section 4 the projection analysis presented in this paper is partial because potential cropping pattern changes in groundwater fed irrigated agriculture were not considered there is a need to build more integrated modeling systems to support more comprehensive analysis for better national polices on groundwater management and development of groundwater fed irrigated agriculture we will endeavor to investigate these uncertainties and limitations in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgement this project is part of the cgiar research program on water land

8358,study region india study focus india boasts the largest irrigated agricultural system in the world relying on groundwater to address the strong linkages between the natural groundwater and the anthropogenic irrigated system requires innovative hydrological modeling geared at informing national policies on groundwater management and future development of irrigated agriculture for this we developed a predictive integrated hydrological and groundwater use model and evaluated the model using total water storage tws data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace the utility of the model was demonstrated in a case study in which the model was applied to project the groundwater balance in northwest india under four rcp representative concentration pathways scenarios new hydrological insights for the region the model shows good identifiability to grace data in northwest india and with incorporated groundwater irrigation simulation module the model can adequately replicate the declining trend in tws over this region it is concluded that by assuming a unchanged pattern of agricultural water use climate change is likely to help reduce the magnitude of the groundwater deficit but the beneficial effect is insufficient to halt the trend of groundwater depletion this result provides new evidence for the importance of groundwater conservation through changes in cropping patterns and improved groundwater governance keywords groundwater irrigation india grace gravity recovery and climate experiment swat soil and water assessment tool climate change 1 introduction hydrological research traditionally focuses on physical processes but the importance of investigating linkages between the anthroposphere and the hydrosphere has been well recognized wagener et al 2010 in this paper we developed a model that integrates groundwater use for irrigation into a national scale hydrological simulation system of india where the anthropogenic influence of groundwater irrigation has dramatically changed the country s water resource base india boasts one of the largest irrigated agricultural systems in the world with more than 60 million hectares equipped for irrigation fao aquastat furthermore more than 60 of the irrigated area is fed by groundwater fao aquastat the heavy use of groundwater for irrigation has created extensive concerns about overdraft and depletion and has made india a global hotspot for water resources studies kumar et al 2007 foster et al 2008 any hydrological model of india that is developed or used for decision support will therefore need to be able to quantify the impact of groundwater irrigation we developed the model using the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and publicly available data in particular total water storage tws variation data from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2004 against which model performance was evaluated grace tws data provide observations of terrestrial total water storage anomalies that integrate variations of all vertical components of water storages and have been applied for groundwater resources assessments in india at a national scale by rodell et al 2009 tiwari et al 2009 chen et al 2014 long et al 2016 and asoka et al 2017 etc they were also used by barik et al 2017 to examine the food water energy nexus in india over recent time periods what distinguishes our study from these studies is that past applications of grace tws data in india focused on using trends derived from the grace tws data to estimate historical groundwater depletion rates while our study developed a predictive model with enhanced representation of linkages between groundwater irrigation and groundwater storage modules representing anthropogenic water use have been developed and incorporated into a number of large scale hydrologic simulation models cai and rosegrant 2002 alcamo et al 2003 hanasaki et al 2008 wada et al 2012 döll et al 2014 pokhrel et al 2015 wada et al 2016 and grace data have been used in the validation of some of these models f ex döll 2012 and 2014 however these models have global coverage and did not include detailed results discussion and information on model uncertainty for individual countries in this study we also tested the feasibility of applying process based crop simulation techniques in the development of a large scale integrated hydrological water use model in a country with varying climate and intensive agricultural water use simulation of irrigation water demand and irrigation water use in global models is primarily based on the fao 56 crop coefficient approach allen et al 1998 döll and siebert 2002 wada et al 2014 which links consumptive water use of crops to climate variables through a series of coefficients swat originally designed as a meso scale river basin model incorporates algorithms from the epic erosion productivity impact calculator crop simulation model williams et al 1989 and therefore is capable of simulating plant water uptake and irrigation water application processes in much greater detail the size of study river basins in swat applications typically range from tens to several thousand square kilometers but in recent years the model has also been applied at national and continental levels schuol et al 2008 xie et al 2012 moreover as described in section 3 with the incorporation of the groundwater irrigation simulation module the model can adequately replicate the declining trend in tws in northwest india in section 4 we applied the model developed in this study to provide a partial analysis of the impact of climate change on groundwater balances in northwest india as a demonstration of the utility of the model the prospects of extending the model to provide fuller analysis to inform policy making for groundwater management and groundwater fed irrigated agriculture under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions are also discussed 2 data and method 2 1 swat and watershed delineation swat is a semi distributed river basin model using digital elevation data from the hydrosheds hydrological data and maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales lehner et al 2008 database the study region was partitioned into 677 subbasins fig 1 the area modeled is 3 9 million km2 and in addition to india covers nepal bangladesh bhutan as well as parts of china myanmar and pakistan 2 2 hru definition within a subbasin hydrologic response units hrus can be defined an hru in a subbasin is a land segment consisting of areas with the same soil land cover use and land management practices the definition of hrus helps reflect the heterogeneity of soil land cover use and land management practices within a subbasin winchell et al 2007 for this study we defined hrus for the main crops under groundwater irrigation to this end we harmonized land use cover data from the glc global land cover 2000 database bartholome and belward 2005 and downscaled crop harvested area data by crop and by production system from the spam spatial production allocation model database you et al 2006 glc is a comprehensive global land cover and land use database containing land cover land use data classified under the fao land cover classification system that covers the complete range of land cover and land use from natural vegetation to anthropogenic land uses in glc2000 pixels with dominant land use for agriculture are classified as irrigated agriculture intensive irrigated agriculture and rainfed agriculture more precise and detailed estimates of irrigated agricultural area by crop are obtained from the spam database in the production of the spam database national or sub national statistics are downscaled to a 5 arc minute approximately 10 km 10 km grid the spam 2000 version used in this study contains estimated harvested areas for 20 major crops around 2000 on a 5 arc minute grid in four production systems irrigated rainfed high input rainfed low input and rainfed subsistence the irrigated harvested area by crop in the study region reported by spam is summarized in table 1 we defined groundwater irrigated hrus for the five key groundwater irrigated crops in the country rice wheat cotton sugarcane and maize fig 2 they account for 84 of total irrigated harvested area in the study region the harvested area of each of the five crops under groundwater irrigation in each subbasin was further estimated using data on area equipped with groundwater irrigation from a global groundwater irrigation inventory developed by siebert et al 2010 fig 3 we calculated 1 a g w c a t o t a l c f r g w where a g w c is groundwater irrigated harvested area for crop c in a subbasin a t o t a l c is total irrigated harvested area of crop c in the subbasin and f r g w is the share of irrigated area equipped with groundwater irrigation in the subbasin 0 1 derived from the groundwater irrigation inventory data developed by siebert et al 2010 moreover among the five crops sugarcane is a perennial crop maize and cotton are mainly kharif summer season crops while the cultivation of wheat mainly occurs in the rabi winter season for these crops a single growing season is assumed in each year in the model with planting dates and length of the growing season estimated by sacks et al 2010 and the physical irrigated areas in each growing season are equal to the annual harvested irrigated areas as for rice india features up to three rice growing seasons kharif rabi and pre kharif the physical areas of irrigated rice in each season were estimated using data on rice cropping patterns compiled by frolking et al 2006 it is worth noting that in this study we limited our effort to simulating groundwater irrigation and viewed this as a step toward developing a more full fledged national hydrological model of india simulation of irrigation from surface water is linked to modeling storage variations and water conveyance and allocation processes in man made surface water infrastructure however there is a lack of data to support such simulations although global hydrological modeling studies simulate assumed water infrastructure operation rules for modeling human water uses including surface water irrigation f ex hanasaki et al 2006 döll et al 2012 such approaches are less justifiable at the national level the unaccounted surface water irrigation has implications for modeling groundwater balances see the discussion for eq 6 and this constitutes a major limitation of our study omitting the water storage variation from man made water infrastructure which is a component of the tws variation detected in grace also implies greater uncertainty in grace data based model evaluation in fact there is uncertainty originating from unvalidated model performance in simulating whole surface water system however national river discharge data are difficult to obtain for india in this study we left the model uncalibrated unvalidated in terms of its performance in modeling surface water hydrology the soil data used in this study were obtained from the waterbase george and leon 2008 this data set is developed based on the fao unesco soil map of the world and contains derived soil properties required for swat modeling a dominant soil type was identified in each subbasin and used for hru definition 2 3 irrigation and groundwater storage simulation swat operates at a daily time step the simulation algorithms in the model are described in detail in neitsch et al 2011 only those components that are relevant to simulating irrigation and groundwater balance are discussed here modifications were made to address limitations in the swat model in simulating irrigation for paddy rice and groundwater storage variation 2 3 1 irrigation simulation in swat the crop simulation algorithm in swat originates from the epic erosion productivity impact calculator model williams et al 1989 on each day during a growing season the model keeps track of root leaf and biomass development of crops and calculates crop water demand as well as the amount of water the plant can actually uptake from the soil swat provides functions to simulate irrigation events for this study the auto irrigation scheme was used to simulate irrigation activities related to the production of cotton maize sugarcane and wheat under this auto irrigation scheme irrigation can be triggered automatically based on water stress experienced by crops or irrigation water is applied whenever the water stress of the crop exceeds a specified threshold crop water stress is calculated as 2 w s t r 1 e a e t where w s t r is water stress on a given day with a value ranging from 0 to 1 e t is the potential transpiration or water demand of a crop on a given day mmh2o and e a is the amount of water actually taken up or transpired by the plant mmh2o once auto irrigation is invoked soil moisture will be restored to soil field capacity while the auto irrigation algorithm in swat is suitable to simulate irrigation for upland crops the model has limitations in simulating irrigated rice production pothole module in swat is often used as an option in modeling rice paddy which is designed to simulate hydrology in closed depressions with ponded water however the module cannot adequately simulate infiltration in saturated soils underlying paddy fields and tends to underestimate percolation losses sakaguchi et al 2014 furthermore the auto irrigation algorithm with crop water stress as a trigger is no longer applicable as the key decision variable for irrigated rice is ponded water depth in this study we adopted the modifications proposed by kang et al 2006 xie and cui 2011 and sakaguchi et al 2014 to improve the capacity of the swat pothole module in simulating water balances and irrigation for irrigated rice production we assumed a constant daily percolation rate for the water balance calculation when the field is flooded kang et al 2006 and sakaguchi et al 2014 second we implemented the irrigation simulation algorithm for paddy proposed by xie and cui 2011 in this algorithm the water depth in paddy varies between a predefined minimum fitting depth and a maximum ponding depth irrigation occurs when the water depth drops below the minimum fitting depth and the objective of the irrigation operation is to fill the paddy field with water to the maximum fitting depth minimum fitting depth maximum fitting depth maximum ponding depth the values of the three critical water depths vary by the growth stage of rice table 1 in xie and cui 2011 using the simulation algorithms described above the pumping rate of groundwater for irrigation was first estimated as soil moisture deficit with respect to soil field capacity for crops other than paddy rice or ponded water depth deficit with respect to maximum fitting depth of paddy fields and then adjusted for water losses in irrigation application which are unaccounted for in the simulation e g water conveyance losses by an irrigation efficiency coefficient santhi et al 2005 3 q i r r q i r r γ where q i r r is the estimated groundwater pumping rate for irrigation mmh2o q i r r is the irrigation water demand estimated without consideration of unaccounted for water losses in irrigation mmh2o and γ is the irrigation efficiency coefficient the volume of pumped groundwater for irrigation was also constrained by the water storage in aquifers irrigation stops when aquifer water is depleted 2 3 2 groundwater balance simulation in swat swat uses the soil conservation service curve number method soil conservation service scs 1972 to calculate surface runoff and the model simulates infiltration evaporation plant water uptake and interflow generation processes in the soil profile groundwater aquifers are recharged by water infiltrating through the soil in swat for each hru groundwater storage is partitioned into two components one represents shallow aquifer and the other deep aquifer either component can be assigned as the water source for irrigation from which groundwater is abstracted moreover both components can contribute to baseflow groundwater baseflow from each component is calculated as 4 q g w i q g w i 1 e x p α g w δ t q r c h r g i 1 e x p α g w δ t where q g w i is the groundwater flow on a given day i mm h2o q g w i 1 is the groundwater flow on the preceding day i 1 mmh2o α g w is the baseflow recession coefficient day 1 δ t is the time step 1 day and q r c h r g i is the amount of recharge entering aquifer on day i mmh2o water in shallow aquifers can also be removed by the revap process which is defined in swat to account for water removed from shallow aquifers through the capillary fringe that separates saturated from unseparated zones revap occurs when water storage in shallow aquifers exceeds a certain threshold and the amount of water removed by the revap process on a given day q r e v a p m a x mm h2o is calculated as 5 q r e v a p m a x β r e v a p e 0 where β r e v a p is the revap coefficient and e 0 is the potential evapotransipration for the day mm h2o in this study we substituted a new groundwater module for the module in swat the water balance for groundwater storage in the new module is 6 δ s q r c h r g q g w q i r r where δ s is groundwater storage change on a given day mmh2o q r c h r g is the recharge mmh2o q g w is groundwater flow out of the storage on a given day mmh2o and q i r r is the amount of water abstracted for irrigation or pumping rate mmh2o we chose to omit the revap process since the effect of the revap process tends to be confounded with the effect of irrigation water withdrawal a large revap coefficient can lead to similar declines of groundwater storage as irrigation water withdrawals and data to describe the revap process is lacking aquifer formations in india generally fall into two groups central ground water board cgwb 2012 unconsolidated and consolidated semi consolidated unconsolidated aquifers underlie the indo gangetic and brahmaputra plains in northern india macdonald et al 2016 fig 1 they serve as large underground reservoirs to support the intensive irrigated agriculture in the region by contrast aquifers in central and southern india are predominantly consolidated semi consolidated with limited water storage capacity in the new module we distinguish between these two types of aquifers for subbasins with unconsolidated aquifers as the dominant formation the groundwater storage is still partitioned into two components although the two components are referred to as active and inactive instead in the simulation only the active storage contributes to groundwater baseflow and when irrigation occurs water is first abstracted from the active storage as water in the active storage component is depleted no further baseflow will be discharged from the aquifer to streams and water will start to be abstracted from the inactive component the initial storage in the active component is established through a spin up see section 2 5 unlimited groundwater storage is assumed in unconsolidated aquifers a large positive value was thus assigned as initial storage of the inactive component of groundwater storage the baseflow from the active storage of the aquifer is calculated as 7 q g w k q a c t i v e where k is the groundwater flow recession constant and q a c t i v e is the volume of water in the active component of groundwater storage mmh2o this equation has been extensively applied in hydrologic modeling to estimate groundwater flow f ex chapman 1999 fenicia et al 2006 beck et al 2013 the motivation of replacing eq 4 with eq 7 is to better reflect the impact of irrigation water withdrawal on groundwater flow there is a lack of response in groundwater baseflow calculated using eq 4 to changes in groundwater storage caused by irrigation zeng and cai 2014 for river basins with consolidated semi consolidated aquifers the entire storage was assumed to be active with baseflow being calculated using eq 7 the recharge term q r c h r g in eq 6 includes contributions from precipitation and return flows from groundwater irrigation in our model in reality groundwater can also be replenished by water from surface water irrigation which includes not only percolation from fields irrigated with surface water but also seepage from irrigation canals during water conveyance macdonald et al 2016 singh 2011 irrigation canals are typically built as components of large scale surface water irrigation projects the seepage rate of water from irrigation canals is a function of canal length lining materials water residence time and wetted perimeter and effective hydraulic conductivity of the channel alluvium santhi et al 2005 as noted above considering limited data availability recharge from surface water irrigation was omitted and this is a primary source of uncertainty in our study the pumping rate q i r r was estimated using the irrigation simulation algorithm described in section 2 3 1 2 4 grace data and comparison of swat and grace based tws variation data the grace tws data used for this study were obtained from cnes grgs centre national d etudes spatiales groupe de recherches de géodésie spatiale rl3 v3 product which provides an improved temporal resolution 10 day means with high spatial resolution the stokes coefficients were truncated at degree 50 i e 400 km spatial resolution to address the issue of decreasing signal to noise ratio with increasing spatial resolution spherical harmonic data were recombined and projected on a 0 5 latitude longitude grid following wahr et al 1998 for model identification we compared the grace based and swat simulated tws variations during 306 10 day intervals between july 29 2002 and june 2 2011 grace tws variation data are missing for 18 10 day intervals during the periods from november 26 2002 to february 23 2003 may 25 2003 to july 3 2003 january 20 2004 to january 29 2004 and december 24 2010 to february 1 2011 the strategy applied to compare grace and swat based tws variations is discussed in detail in xie et al 2012 and is summarized below firstly we computed basin wide tws variations for each 10 day interval and disaggregated them on a 0 5 degree grid based on daily swat simulation results secondly regional model outputs were nested in a global model simulated tws variations from the noah land surface model ek et al 2003 in nasa s global land data assimilation system gldas rodell et al 2004 were used as prior information to fill the regions outside the swat simulated area the global tws data were then projected on spherical harmonics using shtools https shtools oca eu shtools the projection converted the model based tws variation fields to grace resolution and allowed a comparison of the two data sets güntner 2008 2 5 climate data and spin up swat provides three options for estimating potential evapotranspiration neitsch et al 2011 the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 the penman monteith method monteith 1965 and the hargreaves method hargreaves and samani 1985 the penman monteith method was selected for this option climate data for precipitation temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed data are required in the swat simulation the gridded one degree daily 1dd data from 1997 through 2011 of these variables covering the grace tws data period were obtained through the agroclimatology portal of the nasa prediction of worldwide energy resource power project original data sources include the global precipitation climate project gpcp the goddard earth observing system model version 4 and version 5 geos 4 geos 5 the release 3 of the nasa gewex surface radiation budget gewex srb 3 0 project and the nasa s fast longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes flashflux project during model development the subbasin wide estimates of these climatic variables were calculated by averaging gridded based climate data using fractions of area covered by different climate data grid cells as weights schuol and abbaspour 2007 in swat modeling initial conditions of hydrologic state variables including active groundwater storages are unknown and are established through spin up simulations given the need to initialize active groundwater storage a long spin up period 1910 2001 was used climate data obtained from isi mip which were downscaled from the noresm1 m model were used for simulation during the spin up period groundwater based irrigated agriculture in india started to take off during the 1960s as part of the green revolution groundwater irrigation activities during 1950 2001 were simulated in the spin up simulation in which sizes of groundwater irrigated crop hrus in each subbasin were adjusted dynamically by a ratio derived from historical data on state wise groundwater irrigated area reflecting the actual pathways of groundwater driven irrigation expansion bhaduri et al 2006 gandhi and namboodiri 2009 3 results of model identification figs 4 6 present

not consider groundwater irrigation the agreement between the observed and simulated tws data series was measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse is a coefficient extensively used in hydrologic modeling for model evaluation its value ranges from to 1 and equals unity when model output and observations are identical fig 4 partitions india into three regions the northwest region i the northeast and east region ii and the central and southern region region iii the northwest region defined in this study covers an area of 0 9 million km2 and stretches across seven indian states punjab haryana delhi himachal pradesh uttar pradesh rajasthan and jammu and kashmir this region accounts for 40 of irrigated area of the country the northeast and east region for 28 and the central and southern region for 32 moreover approximately 70 of the irrigated area in the northwest region is irrigated by groundwater the shares are 61 and 63 in the northeast and east region and the central and southern region respectively as evident in the map the model fit is very good in the northeast and east region of india and good in the central and southern region of the country however poor values of nse can be found in northwest india indicating that the simulated tws values deviate substantially from grace observations the reasons behind the displayed model misfit over the region are revealed in fig 5 a and b and the aggregated tws time series plots in fig 6 a fig 5 a b shows the trends in gridded tws data from grace and the model simulation in filtered space without simulated groundwater use for irrigation respectively large scale depletion trends up to 70 mm h2o yr in northwest india can be seen in the trend map based on grace data fig 5a whereas such patterns cannot be seen when groundwater irrigation simulation is turned off fig 5b fig 6 a shows the aggregated grace based and simulated tws data series over northwest india the map also shows a downward trend in the grace based tws data series while such a trend is lacking in the simulated tws data series when simulations include groundwater irrigation activities model fit improves significantly in the northwest region of india and the model successfully replicates tws trends in grace data as indicated by the gridded nse map in fig 4 b and the corresponding gridded tws trend maps in fig 5 c at grace resolution and fig 5 d at full resolution and the aggregated model based tws data series in fig 6 b encouraged by the promising results obtained from the initial model evaluation further analysis was performed with quantification of parametric uncertainty in the simulation the analysis was conducted using the conceptual framework of generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 five model parameters were included in the analysis these parameters and their value ranges used for the analysis are shown in table 2 in addition to those parameters defined to characterize groundwater use processes for irrigation and groundwater flow prrp water percolation rate in rice paddy wstr threshold of upland crop water stress triggering irrigation γ irrigation efficiency and k groundwater recession coefficient we also took the soil evaporation compensation factor esco into account soil moisture variability is a major source of the simulated tws variation and esco is a key parameter defined in swat for modeling soil moisture variation the implementation of glue involved monte carlo sampling of uncertain parameters two hundred random samples were drawn uniformly from the specified parameter value space plots in fig 7 provide a comparison of pair wise nse values calculated using aggregated grace based and simulated tws data series over three regions within india in cases with and without simulated groundwater irrigation consistent with observations from figs 4 6 groundwater use for irrigation is the main process influencing tws trends in northwest india in the swat simulation by contrast nse values for the other two regions only vary slightly after groundwater irrigation is incorporated into the simulation glue is designed to accommodate parametric uncertainty in the model simulation referred to as equifinality arising from the existence of multiple behavioral parameter sets all behavioral parameter sets enable the model to fit the observation data acceptably well fig 8 presents dotted plots showing correspondence between sampled parameter values and the resultant nse values which indicates model fit over the northwest region of india obtained from monte carlo sampling based on these results and following the spirit of the glue method an nse cutoff value of 0 8 was selected and 83 out of 200 sampled parameter sets associated with nse values greater than 0 8 were accepted as behavioral the strong equifinality revealed in the glue analysis leads to large uncertainty in the simulated water balance and tws the ensemble of tws variations over northwest india simulated using the identified behavioral parameter sets are shown in fig 6 b the distributions of estimated groundwater recharge groundwater baseflow irrigation water withdrawal and annual average groundwater depletion are displayed in fig 9 modeled groundwater depletion over the region ranges from 14 km3 h2o yr to 29 km3 h2o yr with a mean value of 23 9 km3 h2o yr and the mode at 24 3 km3 h2o yr note that the uncertainty cnes grgs grace tws trend is 27 2 km3 from weighted least square regression that lays within the uncertainty interval derived from the glue analysis we also considered capturing grace uncertainty using a wider range of grace products farinotti et al 2015 when using the full range of grace products namely official products csr gfz jpl release 5 and alternative products processed by tu graz release 2016 mayer gürr et al 2016 huazhong university of science and technology release 16 zhou et al 2017 tongji university release 2 chen et al 2016 and the astronomical institute from univ bern release 2 the estimated trend is 29 2 5 km3 which still partially overlaps with the glue interval in the glue analysis model fit to grace tws data was measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency which incorporates the effect of seasonal variation of tws it might be possible to use the information on uncertainty of the grace tws trend to further narrow down the selection of the behavioral parameters in future work when more certain estimates for uncertainty bounds of grace tws trends become available as the variability in the different estimates for grace tws trend uncertainty is not fully understood we did not use such information in the glue analysis in this study 4 assessing impacts of climate change on groundwater storage in northwest india the validity of the developed hydrological agricultural groundwater use model in simulating groundwater storage variation in northwest india was established through the results of validation analysis presented in the preceding section as a demonstration of the predictive skill of the model we extended the simulation to 2050 to simulate future groundwater storage groundwater irrigation in northwest india under changed climate conditions the model developed in this study takes data on crop mix in groundwater fed irrigated agriculture as an input groundwater irrigation is expected to increase in the future in line with income and population growth and because groundwater is considered to be the most productive component of the agricultural production system at the same time concerns about groundwater depletion are counteracting factors and may lead to policies and regulations to curb the development of groundwater based irrigated agriculture india is also a major player in global agriculture markets as a result policy options and interventions which may result in major changes in food production might affect global food security and need to be carefully evaluated in the context of global agriculture trade for these reasons any future crop pattern changes would be part of a complex decision making process a tradeoff analysis that considers food security and groundwater sustainability as objectives and includes future cropping pattern as a decision variable would therefore be needed to inform a thorough discussion about policies for groundwater management and groundwater fed irrigated agriculture under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions and more integrated modeling system that couples the hydrological groundwater use model with food production agricultural economic trade modeling tool needs to be applied to support the tradeoff analysis the paper focuses on presenting the development of a hydrological model with improved representation of agricultural groundwater use processes instead of providing a full tradeoff analysis in this case study we considered a special case in which the cropping pattern of irrigated agriculture and irrigation efficiencies were kept constant the case study provides insights that could be used to inform policy discussions qualitatively on the direction and urgency of shifting agricultural groundwater use patterns the projection analysis used climate change data downscaled by the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip hempel et al 2013 isi mip offers a framework for consistently assessing the impacts of climate change across sectors a large collection of food and agricultural trade models used these data nelson et al 2014 the isi mip climate data are downscaled from outputs of five general circulation models gcms from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m generated under four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 moss et al 2010 the five gcms were selected by isimip because projections from these gcms span a wide range of the space of projected global mean temperature change and relative precipitation changes warszawski et al 2014 studies evaluating the performance of gcms over india for example saha et al 2014 revealed that the majority of cmip5 gcms failed to simulate the decreasing trend of the indian monsoon in historical experiments in a more recent study gusain et al 2020 improvement was found to be made in cmip6 models which can capture indian monsoon characteristics reasonably well at the time of this study the full set results from cmip6 were not available we therefore choose to only report results from noresm1 m scenarios noresm1 m is a top rated model among a collection of cmpi5 gcms based on its performance in simulating present climate characteristics of indian summer monsoon sharmila et al 2015 changes in annual precipitation and average daily temperature between base period 2002 2011 and the last decade of the projection period 2041 2050 indicative of trends of climate change over northwest india projected by the noresm1 m are shown in table 3 the extent to which climate change will influence groundwater balances also depends on the changes of other climate variables solar radiation humidity and wind speed and temporal and spatial variability of these variables within the time horizon of the projection analysis and within the spatial extent of the study region the model developed in this study helps translate these trends and variabilities associated with climate change into quantitative estimates for the magnitude of impact on groundwater storage under the presence of intensive of agricultural groundwater water use box plots indicating distributions of projected annual average groundwater depletion rates during the projection period 2012 2050 are shown in fig 10 a the model behavioral parameter sets identified through the glue analysis were used to generate these projections the projected groundwater depletion rates vary over a wide range compared to the estimated groundwater storage depletion rates in the base period slightly accelerated groundwater depletion rates were projected under the rcp 4 5 scenario while decreased depletion rates were found under the other three scenarios the histogram in fig 10 b further summarizes the differences between groundwater depletion rates in the projection and base periods model realizations associated with all identified behavioral parameter sets and under all rcp scenarios were combined to construct the histogram and all realizations were assigned equal probability according to the histogram there is a 84 chance that the groundwater depletion rate would be lower with a reduction of up to 10 km3 h2o yr the projected increases in precipitation under climate change table 3 may lead to an anticipation that there could be amelioration in groundwater depletion the simulation results in this projection analysis confirmed the likely existence of the ameliorating effect however in all cases the depleting trend will continue even with the most optimistic forecast there will still be a deficit of 9 km3 h2o in the annual groundwater storage budget fig 10a the model results are therefore certainly not a call to sit back and relax but instead a call for more systematic efforts to measure monitor and manage the important groundwater resources of india with a focus on arresting depletion trends the variability of results across rcp scenarios furthermore highlights the challenges of managing groundwater resources in the face of uncertainty brought about by climate change 5 conclusions and discussions india is a country with intensive groundwater fed irrigated agriculture and the large extraction of groundwater for food production has created concerns about the sustainability of groundwater resources for both current and future citizens in this paper we incorporated groundwater use processes for irrigation into a national scale swat model of india the development of the model was based on publicly available data and the model was evaluated and calibrated using grace tws data the results of the model identification confirm that the integrated hydrologic groundwater use model can capture groundwater storage depletion in northwest india and therefore can serve as a promising predictive modeling tool to quantify the anthropogenic impact of irrigation on groundwater resources in the region the utility of the developed model is demonstrated in a case study presented in section 4 in which the model was applied to assess the impact of climate change on groundwater storage in northwest india under four rcp scenarios the assessment results suggest that without consideration of the effect of changes in cropping patterns and irrigation water use efficiency it is well possible that climate change will ameliorate the groundwater deficit in northwest india however the beneficial effect is not strong enough to reverse depletion trends mathematical models provide simplified representations of real world systems and processes and the modeling exercises inevitably involve uncertainties discussions of some key uncertainties and limitations arising from model development and applications have been provided in the previous sections they are summarized here with a few more added firstly in this study we used the glue approach to treat parametric uncertainty in the modeling as an additional remark from the glue analysis while grace tws data prove to provide highly informative information on spatial patterns of vertically integrated water storage variations and are of great value for understanding agricultural groundwater use processes in northwest india the large remaining uncertainty in the model parameters which were indicated by the wide ranges of estimated groundwater depletion rates suggests that it is desirable when possible to introduce observations on other hydrologic variables to provide further constraints in model identification in addition to the parametric uncertainty there are also uncertainties arising from other sources as already noted a major limitation in our study is the omission of surface water irrigation which may bias estimates for those variables in the groundwater balance additional uncertainty related to the co2 effect of plant evaporation exists in projections of the impact of climate change on groundwater balances it is well known that plant growth can benefit from co2 enrichment that helps improve the water use efficiency of plants swat incorporates an algorithm to simulate the effects of atmospheric co2 enrichment however the algorithm was formulated based on data obtained in a controlled experimental environment stockle et al 1992 on which experiments from open air field conditions long et al 2006 cast uncertainty given this uncertainty the co2 effect was not simulated in this study lastly there is also uncertainty associated with input data f ex on irrigated crop area and climate and grace tws data processing which are exemplified by the existence of multiple data products in each category sakumura et al 2014 anderson et al 2015 gehne et al 2016 choosing different data products may have implications for model identification and simulation results finally as indicated in section 4 the projection analysis presented in this paper is partial because potential cropping pattern changes in groundwater fed irrigated agriculture were not considered there is a need to build more integrated modeling systems to support more comprehensive analysis for better national polices on groundwater management and development of groundwater fed irrigated agriculture we will endeavor to investigate these uncertainties and limitations in future work declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no conflict of interest acknowledgement this project is part of the cgiar research program on water land

8359,study region semi arid regions of marathawada vidarbha and saurashtra in india study focus to understand and evaluate the impact of managed aquifer recharge mar efforts new hydrological insights for the region since 1990 the saurashtra region of gujarat india witnessed a massive community based distributed groundwater recharge movement initially catalyzed by ngos and later supported by the government the region has witnessed visible improvement in groundwater resources during recent years which was attributed by some researchers to the recharge movement a competing hypothesis holds that improvement in groundwater levels in saurashtra are a result more due to a succession of good rainfall years during 2001 2014 aided by transfer of surface water from a big dam on narmada river rather than the distributed recharge movement we develop and implement a 2 way test of these competing hypotheses first we compare groundwater recharge patterns in saurashtra during a recent period of high rainfall years with a similar period before the onset of the recharge movement second for both these high rainfall periods we also compare groundwater recharge patterns in two other comparable aquifer and terrain regions viz vidarbha and marathawada in maharastra which did not experience recharge movement on the same scale as saurashtra did our results support the hypothesis that the community supported distributed recharge movement is the key to improved groundwater recharge in saurashtra during 2004 09 keywords groundwater managed aquifer recharge impact evaluation groundwater recharge

1970s use of groundwater both as a source of irrigation and for domestic purposes has increased rapidly irrigation consumes about 90 of groundwater extracted annually and the wells used for this sector have increased from less than 1 million in 1960 to almost 24 million in 2014 saha and roy 2018 currently about 85 percent of rural water supplies and 50 percent of urban water need is extracted from aquifers shankar et al 2011 easy access year round availability even in drought spells ability to operate at will and lack of any regulations coupled with easy provision of free subsidised farm power have been major factors responsible for indiscriminate extraction of groundwater with rise in population leading to increasing water requirements competitive extraction among multiple stakeholders poses a threat of serious depletion in many parts of the country besides there are large areas facing acute quality problems both from anthropogenic and geogenic sources banerjee et al 2012 having diverse terrain geology and climate within india the groundwater condition also varies significantly from region to region the vulnerability of groundwater resource depletion is more acute in arid deserts of rajasthan rann of kutch and semi arid marathawada vidarbha saurashtra western andhra pradesh north interior karnataka etc areas covering the western central and southern peninsular parts of india saha et al 2017 as per the climatic classifications of stamp 1967 and köppen 1936 based on temperature rainfall and local vegetation the majority of gujarat maharashtra madhya pradesh telangana and north karnataka states lie in similar climate zones characterised by moderate rainfall annual rainfall 500 1000 mm with high variability coefficient of variation more than 20 percent and dry spell in winter and in hot summer out of all these regions three have been frequently hitting the headlines due to acute water shortage and drought like conditions saurashtra in gujarat and marathawada and vidarbha in maharashtra the area is marked by a thin veneer of black cotton soil followed by 8 20 m thick weathered zone further underlain by consolidated basaltic rocks saha et al 2017 fig 1 the weathered zone holds groundwater in primary porosity and sustains dug wells whereas the fractured and vesicular zones in successive basalt flows below hold groundwater that is yielded to bore wells the nature of aquifers their hydraulic characteristics recharge mechanism and storage capacities are similar in all the three regions saha and agrawal 2006 in the absence of major perennial rivers streams in any of these three regions the population is highly dependent on the aquifers for year round water needs and have been facing long term groundwater depletion due to increasing abstraction out of these three saurashtra has the highest dependence on groundwater with as high as 83 percent of irrigated land catered by the underlying aquifers versus 58 percent for marathawada and 50 percent for vidarbha fig 2 it is also important to note that almost all the districts of these regions are recommended for drought prone area development programme dpap or desert development programme ddp by hanumantha rao committee of the government of india venkateswarlu et al 2014 saurashtra with high agriculture growth even in adverse geographic and climatic condition has captured much limelight due to improving groundwater condition in the recent decade unlike marathawada and vidarbha this revival of groundwater condition for saurashtra is attributed to multifaceted policy interventions to harvest rainwater and recharge aquifers bhanja et al 2017 jain 2012 shah et al 2009 such interventions are in fact considered to be key supply side interventions to rejuvenate the depleted aquifers in india cgwb 2007 and many researchers reported their positive impact across diverse hydrogeological framework areas stiefel et al 2009 and dashora et al 2018 reported positive impact on groundwater resource and salinity in parts of rajasthan similarly bhagvan and raghu 2005 assessed the improvement of fluoride concentration by dilution through recharge from check dams in nalgonda district in andhra pradesh bhusari et al 2016 reported rise in water level upto 2 8 m in dug wells by adopting a combination of artificial recharge structures in basaltic aquifers in maharashtra the positive impact of sub surface dams in conversing groundwater resource has been assessed by raju et al 2013 from kalangi river basin semi arid region of andhra pradesh however for saurastra region there is a contrasting opinion that the improvement in groundwater resources is more due to better rainfall and distribution of narmada river water through the sardar sarovar project ssp the present analysis is an attempt to understand the reason of increase in groundwater resources in saurashtra vis a vis marathawada and vidarbha as well as critically checking the impact of policy measures with a focus on gujarat saurashtra by comparing the improvement in groundwater recharge in the three regions 1 1 groundwater in gujarat focusing the debate on semi arid regions gujarat state within its physical boundaries contains a highly diverse geography the state is classified into four regions shah 2014 1 south gujarat which experiences high rainfall 2 central and north gujarat having medium rainfall with alluvial deposits having large groundwater stock 3 saurashtra which has highly erratic rainfall with low potential hard rock basalt aquifers 4 kachchh with desert and mostly saline aquifers marked with highly capricious rainfall historically with limited groundwater resources saurashtra had relied largely on rainfall for its agricultural water requirements groundwater has been the major source of irrigation for gujarat as a whole but for saurashtra however with the advent of diesel and electric powered pumps and cheap and easy availability of drilling technology the 1970s witnessed significant increase in extraction of groundwater in india and also in saurashtra which further accelerated during 1980s as an obvious consequence of such high abstraction from low potential basalt aquifers rapid increase of seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels as well as long term decline in water level were reported causing acute water shortage during summer and salinity ingress in coastal areas particularly in gujarat kumar and perry 2018 the condition intensified even more during consecutive drought years of 1985 87 when saurashtra received just 93 mm of annual rainfall in 1987 and 40 percent less rainfall than normal in 1985 299 mm and 1986 298 mm severity of this condition led to a consensus built on an urgent need to conserve rainwater and a community led mass movement for construction of rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge structures took off at an unprecedented scale the community led movement also garnered support of local leaders merchants and religious gurus in the early 1990s and continued during the fluid rainfall period later that decade shah et al 2009 the bells went ringing again after the dry spell of the late 1990s when consecutive years of drought affected gujarat especially saurashtra resulting in major groundwater depletion during 1998 2000 the condition worsened in major parts of saurashtra with acute shortage of water even for drinking purpose nathan 2001 carrying the learnings from previous attempts the rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge movement was intensified with formal support of the government of gujarat the movement was formalised as sardar patel sahkari jal sanchay yojana spsjsy ascribed as a people participation scheme and was launched after detailed discussion with farmers beneficiaries in the year 2000 under this pan gujarat state scheme almost 500 000 structures were created 113 738 check dams 55 917 bori bandhs 1 1 bori bandh a gabion structure barrier created against the first or second order streams made by using sacks of sand 240199 farm ponds and 62532 large and small check dams as of 2008 jain 2012 making way for an estimated 808 mcm million cubic meters of storage capacity the scheme performed well in saurashtra as almost 60 percent of gujarat s distributed storage capacity 482 mcm was developed in 7 districts of saurashtra shah 2014 compilation of construction work carried out untill 2014 15 by different government agencies shows erection of several thousand water harvesting structures such as check dams bori bandhs and farm ponds nwrws 2019 an extensive field study on construction of check dams by several government agencies in saurashtra region by palrecha and verma 2012 shows the widespread reach of construction among all 75 talukas 2 2 taluka an administrative subdivision of a district in saurashtra this is supported by several other studies that indicate saurashtra had a lion s share in the recharge movement and it was taken up equally among different parts of saurashtra shingi and asopa 2002 mudrakastha 2012 shah 2012 verma and kirshnan 2012 mehta 2020 sakthivadivel 2007 contemporary to this unforeseen recharge movement change of the millennia witnessed many promising factors for sustainable development in water irrigation sector in gujarat which were ascribed as game changers for agriculture growth in gujarat one was the launch of jyotigram yojna a flagship scheme by the state government of gujarat to separate agricultural from domestic power lines and ensure better quality electricity supply for limited time for agricultural power connections which was claimed to have impacted groundwater withdrawal while limiting electricity consumption shah et al 2008 also the long delayed sardar sarovar project ssp on narmada river got an unparalleled boost while narendra modi was chief minister of gujarat and all this happened in tandem with a good rainfall spell that started in 2003 and lasted for more than a decade the confluence of many such factors caused major groundwater revival in parts of gujarat bhanja et al 2017 concluded that gujarat had groundwater storage depleting at the rate of 5 81 0 38 km3 year during 1996 2001 which was reversed and showed replenishment at a rate of 2 04 0 20 km3 year during 2003 2014 this stark reversal in the groundwater depletion during 2003 2014 as compared to 1996 2002 ha d multilateral policy implications and a favourable rainfall spell made it a vital topic of discussion among researchers shah et al 2009 and jain 2012 concluded that water harvesting and jyotigram yojna were keys to replenished groundwater level while kumar and perry 2018 opined that gujarat experienced a temporary surge in rainfall which caused better groundwater recharge and availability of water through the canal network in command areas of the ssp this argument got strength from the fact that sardar sarovar dam height was increased from 100 m in 2003 to 121 92 m in 2006 which resulted in increase in the storage capacity from 2602 2 mcm to 5265 5 mcm gupta 2012 the dam height was further increased to 138 98 m with present storage capacity of 9 5 bcm ssd 2019 in contrast chindarkar and grafton 2019 in strident disapproval to all these claims opined that jyotigram yojna debilitated groundwater storage in gujarat the aforementioned analyses and opinions look at groundwater condition and policy implications in gujarat as a whole but they fail to incorporate the nuances of saurashtra region in seclusion saurashtra peninsula having a radically different geography and climatic conditions as compared to major parts of north and south gujarat has a stark difference in the aquifer type and groundwater regime as well saurashtra is more similar to marathawada and vidarbha of maharashtra than to other regions of gujarat as discussed earlier it is also important to take cognizance of the fact that these three regions share similar challenges regarding groundwater and availability of surface water to tackle the groundwater depletion in these regions different measures have been adopted by the respective state governments maharashtra groundwater act 1993 focused more on saving the depleting sources through regulatory measures whereas gujarat emphasised a combination of rationing power for groundwater extraction and groundwater recharge investment by providing support to communities and ngos marathawada and vidarbha also embarked upon the conservation of water through implementation of an ambitious programme from year 1992 93 through water conservation department government of maharashtra gom 2019 although having the highest number of major large dams of any state in india and spending great efforts by government for water conservation unlike saurashtra where the conservation was led by people and not just government these two regions of maharashtra frequently grab attention due to drought and acute water stress jamwal 2016 this is also reflected in the planning commission 2006 report on drought impact of maharashtra which states the team expert group from planning commission recommends large scale efforts for water harvesting and popularizing participatory water harvesting and management measures so that at least one supplementary irrigation is available to the cotton crop the team also found that surprisingly only a few attempts at bori bandh programme were visible by the roadside comprehensive programme for development of harvesting structures or water shed programmes were not available it is also claimed to be one of the major discriminating factors in terms of policy intervention giving saurashtra an edge over vidarbha shah 2012 the comparison of these regions over two separate time periods of wet spells before and after major interventions when all three regions witnessed good rainfall enables us to check whether the reversal of groundwater depletion is due to policy measures unique to saurashtra or was a coincidence of favourable rainfall this will further form a base to check the outcome of people led water conservation artificial recharge efforts versus centralised government approach 2 about the analysis comparing apples with apples this analysis focuses on the assessment of groundwater recharge and its time domain variation in semi arid regions of saurashtra marathawada and vidarbha during monsoon as the focus is on groundwater recharge we consider fluctuation between pre monsoon and post monsoon water levels as an indicator of groundwater condition unlike chindarkar and grafton 2019 and bhanja et al 2017 who use the average annual groundwater level as an indicator the rise from pre to post monsoon points directly towards resource gain during monsoon which we refer to as annual recharge as the majority of rainfall is received during the monsoon more than 80 percent for all three regions in order to get a better understanding about the improved groundwater storage due to water conservation and aquifer recharge movement of saurashtra comparing the relatively wet time period of 2003 onwards with preceding dry spell of 1991 2003 average annual rainfall 469 mm 28 percent lower than 2004 09 is not appropriate to eliminate this bias we have taken 1975 84 period 1 good rainfall spell with annual average of 626 mm for suarahstra sub division which was before any major managed aquifer recharge mar interventions as a control condition and 2004 09 period 2 as post treatment we are not including year 2003 although it had above normal rainfall because there is high possibility that 2003 might have witnessed temporary surge in groundwater recharge due to preceding dry spell contemporarily vidarbha and marathawada also experienced normal rainfall during these periods of comparison making an ideal comparison for all the regions over the two separate time spells in between these two time spells saurashtra observed major investment of efforts for mar in a mission mode whereas vidarbha and marathawada regions launched such an initiative much later through the government of maharashtra as jalyukta shivar campaign a similar exercise of estimating groundwater recharge in these two regions over periods of our consideration would prove whether just a good rainfall is sufficient in replenishing the groundwater resource 3 data sources and description 3 1 rainfall indian meteorological department imd government of india prepares sub division level india is divided in 36 meteorological sub divisions by imd and district level administrative blocks monthly rainfall data series the data points for marathawada and vidarbha sub divions coincide with the exact study regions however the saurashtra sub division defined by imd includes saurahstra region and adjoining kutch district during 1975 84 period 1 p1 and 2004 2009 period 2 p2 all three regions under consideration observed near or above average rainfall continuously table 1 the variations in rainfall are also within reasonable limits for these time periods making them ideal for consideration for representation purpose the sub division level data is shown in fig 3 as the unit of analysis are districts the district level data is used for further comparison 3 2 groundwater level the central ground water board cgwb network of observation wells data for the years 1975 84 and 2004 2009 has been used the wells represent the shallow unconfined aquifer that gets immediate recharge from rainfall and also from any artificial recharge intervention adopted average groundwater level of all the observation wells within the boundaries of each district has been calculated regional average groundwater level is computed using the area weighted average of the average groundwater levels of all the districts within the region observation wells with missing data for either the pre monsoon last week of may first week of june or post monsoon first week of november periods are not considered observation wells with abnormal variation more than 50 variation from mean trend in groundwater level are not considered about 3 percent for both the periods table 2 shows the number of observation wells taken into consideration for calculation of groundwater level due to insufficient observation for the year 1981 in marathawada 1 site with valid pre monsoon and post monsoon observation this particular year is dropped from further comparison in period 1 for marathawada 4 results and discussion 4 1 understanding the rainfall behaviour saurashtra receives almost 90 percent of total annual rainfall during the monsoon season that normally starts in june and ends in late september or early october similarly marathawada and vidarbha sparsely receive any rainfall after monsoon considering the time period of 1975 2009 annual precipitation in saurashtra has seen much variation with continuous drought years of 1985 87 as well as deficit rainfall spell in 1999 2002 rainfall was above normal for most of the years during the two spells 1975 84 and 2004 09 fig 3 a depicts the monsoonal rainfall variation for the period 1975 2009 considering saurashtra sub division that includes adjoining kutch district defined by imd considering at the districts level rainfall data for saurashtra region available from imd the mean monsoonal rainfall of is 779 9 mm for periods 1 and 797 6 mm for perios 2 marathawada and vidarbha represent similar patterns fig 3 b c table 3 gives overall comparison of monsoon rainfall distribution during these two spells 4 2 gauging the water table behaviour the pre monsoon measured in may and post monsoon measured in november levels are of interest as monsoon is the main source of recharge to aquifers causing rise in water level considering the pre monsoon season groundwater levels in saurashtra went down in period 2 more in comparison to compared to vidarbha and marathawada relative to period 1 fig 4 a the average depth of the pre monsoon water level in saurashtra increased from 8 04 m to 11 04 m below ground 40 percent lower than period 1 fig 5 this suggests higher extraction of groundwater in non monsoon months in recent years in contrast the average post monsoon levels did not change much in saurashtra 5 66 m in period 1 and 6 46 m in period 2 suggesting that seasonal desaturation of the aquifer is compensated by increased recharge which almost doubled in period 2 93 percent increase figs 4 5 table 4 in case of vidarbha and marathawada depletion of groundwater resource was not as high as saurashtra this can be attributed to less draft for irrigation and domestic usage than saurashtra for saurashtra stage of groundwater development sod percentage of groundwater extraction out of net resource in a year was recorded as more than 60 percent between 2004 and 2009 cgwb 2004 2009 between 2004 and 2009 there was an increase in groundwater draft in all three regions fig 6 saurashtra witnessed an increase in groundwater draft by 15 percent from 351 772 to 403 328 ha m between 2004 and 2009 this counters the general understanding that the groundwater draft decreases during good rainfall period marathawada and vidarbha also witnessed increased draft between 2004 and 2009 19 and 37 percent respectively and the sod increased from 44 percent to 51 percent and from 29 percent to 36 percent respectively whereas in saurashtra it remained stagnant at 68 percent the fact that the sod in saurashtra remained stagnant between 2004 and 2009 even though the extraction increased by 15 percent indicated an improvement in aquifer recharge furthermore saurashtra s blocks listed under critical sod 90 100 semi critical sod 70 90 and over exploited sod 100 category have significantly gone down in successive resource estimation by cgwb from 41 all three categories combined in 2004 to 7 in 2009 2 in 2011 and 1 in 2013 fig 7 saurashtra clearly outperformed the other two regions in terms of recharge however it is important to check the fraction of rainfall reflected in the groundwater recharge to establish if there has been significant increase in the total quantum of recharge from monsoon rainfall this enables to further eliminate the factor of good rainfall during two time periods 4 3 assessing the groundwater recharge vis a vis rainfall in order to check the increase in water recharge ratio of estimated groundwater recharge and total quantum of rainfall received for a particular year is considered total quantum of rainfall received is computed using district average rainfall multiplied by area of the district 1 t r i r f i a d i tri total quantum of monsoon rainfall for the district i rfi precipitation in the district i adi area of the district i the district level volume of recharged water is estimated as follows 2 r v i s y i a w l r i a d i 1000 rvi recharge volume for the ith district km3 syi specific yield for the district 3 3 specific yield is defined as the volume percent of groundwater yielded by a saturated rock through gravity drainage specific yield for the regions in the basalt aquifers of saurashtra vidarbha and marathawada is assumed to be 2 athawale 2003 awlri average water level rise post monsoon m 4 4 average water level rise post monsoon for the district is calculated subtracting pre monsoon may for 1975 1984 and june for 2004 2009 from post monsoon november for each well and taking an average of the observation wells within a district adi area of the district km2 recharge factor is calculated using ratio of total volume recharged out of total quantum of monsoon rainfall for all the districts of the region 3 rf rvi tri the calculated rf values show that saurashtra experienced improved groundwater recharge from rainfall nearly two fold between period 1 and period 2 0 063 to 0 114 table 5 the rises in rf in marathawada 24 percent and vidarbha 13 percent were much less than saurashtra 80 percent considering there would not have been reduction in evaporation evapotranspiration and water usage the runoff must have been controlled and diverted into groundwater recharge much better in saurashtra than in marathawada or in vidarbha box and whisker plots fig 8 show clear distinction between period 1 and period 2 distributions for saurashtra and lack of such distinction in marathawada and vidarbha 4 4 regression based analysis the analysis focuses on checking the significance of the mar intervention in increasing the groundwater recharge a regression based analysis of the district average groundwater level rise m vs monsoon precipitation m for all three regions was carried out the model 1 checks correlation between gwlr and monsoon precipitation for each region whereas model 2 helps with estimated improvement for saurashtra as compared to marathawada and vidarbha null hypotheses h0 to be tested in regression analysis were model 1 h0 no significant change in groundwater recharge during monsoon season between two time periods α 2 0 model 2 h0 no significant improvement in groundwater recharge in treatment saurashtra as compared to control marathawada and vidarbha between two time periods β 4 0 if these hypotheses hold true the dummy coefficient will not be significantly different than zero in the following equations positive significant values of α2 and β2 suggest positive improvement for period 2 and support the argument of groundwater recharge model 1 region wise awlrdy α 0 α 1 rfdy α2 dummyy 4 model 2 includes all 3 regions awlrdy β 0 β 1 rfdy β 2 dummyy β 3 saurashtra β 4 dummyy x saurashtra 5 awlr average water level rise for the district d for year y m rf precipitation in the district d and year y m dummy dummy variable used for the observations of period 2 0 for period 1 1 for period 2 saurashtra 1 for districts in saurashtra region 0 for districts in other regions as expected the coefficient of rainfall for water level rise is comparable in each region this is indicative of having similar characteristics of rainfall and groundwater recharge in all three regions and supports the rationale behind comparing these regions positive dummy coefficient for period 2 is indicative of the increase in the recharge potential as compared to period 1 saurashtra shows a significant positive dummy coefficient of 2 12 vidarbha 0 46 and marathawada 1 25 show significant positive dummy values that are lower than saurashtra s table 6 vidarbha did not have noteworthy improvement in recharge during period 2 model 2 helps in estimating the improvement in groundwater recharge between periods 1 and 2 between control marathawada and vidarbha and treatment saurashtra coefficient β4 can be interpreted as the treatment main effect the treatment here is the peculiar recharge movement in saurashtra the positive significant p 0 05 value of β4 further supports the argument about the significant positive effect of the recharge movement on groundwater recharge in saurashtra it can be argued that the percolation of rainfall depends not just on the quantum of rainfall but also significantly relies on distribution of rainy days because the comparison in regression compares two distinct time periods of the same region it can be safely assumed that the rainfall events have not changed significantly during these two time periods otherwise climatic changes would have negatively impacted the results in period 2 leading to extreme events which can adversely affect the groundwater recharge kumar 2012 5 assessing the role of policy interventions for saurashtra the analyses of water level behavior rainfall pattern and groundwater extraction data for regions with similar aquifer typology and terrain conditions for periods 1 and 2 show a significant rejuvenation of groundwater in saurashtra attributing this to any specific policy outcome needs better estimation of the impacts of ssp and jyotigram yojna 5 1 impact of sardar sarovar project on saurashtra is improved recharge due to imported water kumar and perry 2018 argued that the good rainfall and the imported water from ssp with 9 5 bcm billion cubic meter total storage capacity are the reason for gujarat s groundwater rejuvenation including the saurashtra region comparison between periods 1 and 2 indicates that rainfall is not the sufficient condition for better replenishment of groundwater the argument saying ssp is a game changer is questionable in saurashtra since narmada control authority 2019 and sardar sarovar narmada nigam limited 2019 itself accepts it is a fact that a large number of areas in saurashtra and kutch could not be brought under the command of ssp because of the limited allotment of narmada waters to gujarat and the main canal being a gravity canal which has to run on falling contour to cover maximum areas gravity irrigation has limitations of the inclusion of more areas of these regions to be covered by the command the majority of the proposed command area is yet to receive ssp water to the full extent the command area of ssp in saurastra covers parts of surendranagar bhavnagar and rajkot districts fig 9 constituting 9 24 percent of cultivable land of the saurastra region narmada control authority 2019 for argument s sake even if we assume that the command area received full water during 2004 09 it is unrealistic that the infiltrated return seepage from irrigation canal seepage would spread laterally in the remaining 90 76 percent area of saurashtra considering the low permeability of the basaltic aquifer and the topographical condition which makes the aquifer discontinuous figs 10 and 11 saha and agrawal 2006 the meagre lateral flow of groundwater would end up as effluent seepage in streams and rivers which are abundant in the area further let us also consider the possible input to aquifers from infiltrated urban sewage as almost the entire urban water supply comes from ssp the state of gujarat is allocated 1 058 bcm for the entire state for drinking purposes from ssp storage narmada control authority 2019 if we assume that 25 percent reached saurashtra 265 mcm having 25 5 percent of total population of the state during period 2 and if we assume optimistically that as high as 80 percent 212 mcm of the total urban water supply recharges the aquifer the water level rise in saurashtra area 64454 km2 estimated specific yield 0 02 would have been around 15 cm eq 2 for period 2 against the observed rise of approximately 2 2 m table 4 in monsoonal water level from period 1 to period 2 this indicates that saurashtra s groundwater was rejuvenated from recharge through rainfall 5 2 impact of jyotigram scheme is rationing of energy effective in reducing the extraction of groundwater jyotigram yojna was launched in gujarat with focus on changing electricity supply to rural areas the major emphases of this policy were 1 restricting power supply to rural agriculture connections to 8 h a day to shift power load from peak hours to off peak hours and 2 reliable availability of electricity during these 8 h which enabled farmers to have uninterrupted use of electricity for withdrawal of groundwater this very policy was intended to address the problems of growing energy subsidy and groundwater overdraft shah et al 2004 shah and verma 2008 gupta 2012 as highlighted by shah and choudhary 2017 the policy initially restricted the groundwater draft due to restriction on electricity connections to a number of pump sets but the condition was altered in subsequent years with prioritized allocation of tube well connections to small farmers belonging to scheduled castes and tribes in gujarat figs 6 and 10 indicate that the draft of groundwater steadily increased even during the good rainfall years and the area under irrigation through groundwater also steadily increased during period 2 even the electricity consumption for agriculture did not significantly decrease in gujarat after full implementation of jyotigram yojna kumar and perry 2018 the steady increase in electricity consumption during period 2 when the groundwater levels were also increasing suggests that more water is being abstracted for agriculture and that this policy may not be instrumental in restoration of groundwater condition 6 conclusions today tapping run off to conserve and recharge groundwater is a major challenge faced by most of the states in india the current study aimed at investigating the much acclaimed people s participatory recharge movement of saurashtra this study provides empirical evidence that the improvement in monsoonal groundwater recharge for saurashtra was greater than in marathawada and vidarbha which have similar hydrogeological geographical and climatic characteristics during comparable wet spells the net positive impact can be attributed to enhanced recharge from the thousands of small water harvesting and artificial recharge structures this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the mean monsoon rainfall in periods 1 and 2 of saurashtra is the same and the number of rainy days were similar during periods 1 and 2 average rainy days were 31 and 30 respectively the other possible factors contributing to recharge like agricultural return seepage and canal seepage from ssp command area return seepage from urban waste water most of the urban water supply is imported from ssp and impact of controlling the pumping through jyotigram yojna have a marginal impact on saurashtra s groundwater recharge microanalysis of the two major river basins meghal 490 km2 and bhadar 7400 km2 in saurashtra has also shown significant impact of recharge structures on groundwater recharge kamboj 2011 verma and kirshnan 2012 there is a possibility that a component of rejected recharge if any in the saurashtra region has helped in building up groundwater resources in period 2 considering the average pre monsoon depth to the water level and 2 percent specific yield for the formation a component of rejected recharge 5 5 rejected recharge water that can potentially enter the groundwater but discharges because the aquifer is full and cannot accept it is possible which could not be computed because of a lack of continuous water level data for monsoon season the deeper pre monsoon water level in period 2 indicates that more space was available for recharge is accommodated more in period 2 as compared to period 1 there is no change in overall soil and terrain condition between the periods indicating that the artificial recharge structures must have played a significant role in transferring a part of rejected recharge during period 2 the hard rock region of saurashtra which is underlain by basaltic aquifers having good drainage density and conducive topography is suitable for such interventions comparing groundwater conditions in saurashtra with the rest of gujarat is inappropriate given the wide variation in characteristics of geology aquifer framework groundwater flow regime rainfall as well as the greater extent of large scale canal projects elsewhere in gujarat groundwater in marathawada and vidarbha has not equally flourished in terms of recharge even after efforts by the government of maharashtra since 2010 marathawada and vidarbha have also focused on mar with introduction of jalyukt shivar program as well as many ngos investing heavily in community based sustainable water management practices in the next couple of years it will be worthwhile to check if groundwater levels in those regions have also improved significantly as in saurashtra and whether effectiveness of mar continues to be supported by data credit authorship contribution statement

8359,study region semi arid regions of marathawada vidarbha and saurashtra in india study focus to understand and evaluate the impact of managed aquifer recharge mar efforts new hydrological insights for the region since 1990 the saurashtra region of gujarat india witnessed a massive community based distributed groundwater recharge movement initially catalyzed by ngos and later supported by the government the region has witnessed visible improvement in groundwater resources during recent years which was attributed by some researchers to the recharge movement a competing hypothesis holds that improvement in groundwater levels in saurashtra are a result more due to a succession of good rainfall years during 2001 2014 aided by transfer of surface water from a big dam on narmada river rather than the distributed recharge movement we develop and implement a 2 way test of these competing hypotheses first we compare groundwater recharge patterns in saurashtra during a recent period of high rainfall years with a similar period before the onset of the recharge movement second for both these high rainfall periods we also compare groundwater recharge patterns in two other comparable aquifer and terrain regions viz vidarbha and marathawada in maharastra which did not experience recharge movement on the same scale as saurashtra did our results support the hypothesis that the community supported distributed recharge movement is the key to improved groundwater recharge in saurashtra during 2004 09 keywords groundwater managed aquifer recharge impact evaluation groundwater recharge

power have been major factors responsible for indiscriminate extraction of groundwater with rise in population leading to increasing water requirements competitive extraction among multiple stakeholders poses a threat of serious depletion in many parts of the country besides there are large areas facing acute quality problems both from anthropogenic and geogenic sources banerjee et al 2012 having diverse terrain geology and climate within india the groundwater condition also varies significantly from region to region the vulnerability of groundwater resource depletion is more acute in arid deserts of rajasthan rann of kutch and semi arid marathawada vidarbha saurashtra western andhra pradesh north interior karnataka etc areas covering the western central and southern peninsular parts of india saha et al 2017 as per the climatic classifications of stamp 1967 and köppen 1936 based on temperature rainfall and local vegetation the majority of gujarat maharashtra madhya pradesh telangana and north karnataka states lie in similar climate zones characterised by moderate rainfall annual rainfall 500 1000 mm with high variability coefficient of variation more than 20 percent and dry spell in winter and in hot summer out of all these regions three have been frequently hitting the headlines due to acute water shortage and drought like conditions saurashtra in gujarat and marathawada and vidarbha in maharashtra the area is marked by a thin veneer of black cotton soil followed by 8 20 m thick weathered zone further underlain by consolidated basaltic rocks saha et al 2017 fig 1 the weathered zone holds groundwater in primary porosity and sustains dug wells whereas the fractured and vesicular zones in successive basalt flows below hold groundwater that is yielded to bore wells the nature of aquifers their hydraulic characteristics recharge mechanism and storage capacities are similar in all the three regions saha and agrawal 2006 in the absence of major perennial rivers streams in any of these three regions the population is highly dependent on the aquifers for year round water needs and have been facing long term groundwater depletion due to increasing abstraction out of these three saurashtra has the highest dependence on groundwater with as high as 83 percent of irrigated land catered by the underlying aquifers versus 58 percent for marathawada and 50 percent for vidarbha fig 2 it is also important to note that almost all the districts of these regions are recommended for drought prone area development programme dpap or desert development programme ddp by hanumantha rao committee of the government of india venkateswarlu et al 2014 saurashtra with high agriculture growth even in adverse geographic and climatic condition has captured much limelight due to improving groundwater condition in the recent decade unlike marathawada and vidarbha this revival of groundwater condition for saurashtra is attributed to multifaceted policy interventions to harvest rainwater and recharge aquifers bhanja et al 2017 jain 2012 shah et al 2009 such interventions are in fact considered to be key supply side interventions to rejuvenate the depleted aquifers in india cgwb 2007 and many researchers reported their positive impact across diverse hydrogeological framework areas stiefel et al 2009 and dashora et al 2018 reported positive impact on groundwater resource and salinity in parts of rajasthan similarly bhagvan and raghu 2005 assessed the improvement of fluoride concentration by dilution through recharge from check dams in nalgonda district in andhra pradesh bhusari et al 2016 reported rise in water level upto 2 8 m in dug wells by adopting a combination of artificial recharge structures in basaltic aquifers in maharashtra the positive impact of sub surface dams in conversing groundwater resource has been assessed by raju et al 2013 from kalangi river basin semi arid region of andhra pradesh however for saurastra region there is a contrasting opinion that the improvement in groundwater resources is more due to better rainfall and distribution of narmada river water through the sardar sarovar project ssp the present analysis is an attempt to understand the reason of increase in groundwater resources in saurashtra vis a vis marathawada and vidarbha as well as critically checking the impact of policy measures with a focus on gujarat saurashtra by comparing the improvement in groundwater recharge in the three regions 1 1 groundwater in gujarat focusing the debate on semi arid regions gujarat state within its physical boundaries contains a highly diverse geography the state is classified into four regions shah 2014 1 south gujarat which experiences high rainfall 2 central and north gujarat having medium rainfall with alluvial deposits having large groundwater stock 3 saurashtra which has highly erratic rainfall with low potential hard rock basalt aquifers 4 kachchh with desert and mostly saline aquifers marked with highly capricious rainfall historically with limited groundwater resources saurashtra had relied largely on rainfall for its agricultural water requirements groundwater has been the major source of irrigation for gujarat as a whole but for saurashtra however with the advent of diesel and electric powered pumps and cheap and easy availability of drilling technology the 1970s witnessed significant increase in extraction of groundwater in india and also in saurashtra which further accelerated during 1980s as an obvious consequence of such high abstraction from low potential basalt aquifers rapid increase of seasonal fluctuation of groundwater levels as well as long term decline in water level were reported causing acute water shortage during summer and salinity ingress in coastal areas particularly in gujarat kumar and perry 2018 the condition intensified even more during consecutive drought years of 1985 87 when saurashtra received just 93 mm of annual rainfall in 1987 and 40 percent less rainfall than normal in 1985 299 mm and 1986 298 mm severity of this condition led to a consensus built on an urgent need to conserve rainwater and a community led mass movement for construction of rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge structures took off at an unprecedented scale the community led movement also garnered support of local leaders merchants and religious gurus in the early 1990s and continued during the fluid rainfall period later that decade shah et al 2009 the bells went ringing again after the dry spell of the late 1990s when consecutive years of drought affected gujarat especially saurashtra resulting in major groundwater depletion during 1998 2000 the condition worsened in major parts of saurashtra with acute shortage of water even for drinking purpose nathan 2001 carrying the learnings from previous attempts the rainwater harvesting and artificial recharge movement was intensified with formal support of the government of gujarat the movement was formalised as sardar patel sahkari jal sanchay yojana spsjsy ascribed as a people participation scheme and was launched after detailed discussion with farmers beneficiaries in the year 2000 under this pan gujarat state scheme almost 500 000 structures were created 113 738 check dams 55 917 bori bandhs 1 1 bori bandh a gabion structure barrier created against the first or second order streams made by using sacks of sand 240199 farm ponds and 62532 large and small check dams as of 2008 jain 2012 making way for an estimated 808 mcm million cubic meters of storage capacity the scheme performed well in saurashtra as almost 60 percent of gujarat s distributed storage capacity 482 mcm was developed in 7 districts of saurashtra shah 2014 compilation of construction work carried out untill 2014 15 by different government agencies shows erection of several thousand water harvesting structures such as check dams bori bandhs and farm ponds nwrws 2019 an extensive field study on construction of check dams by several government agencies in saurashtra region by palrecha and verma 2012 shows the widespread reach of construction among all 75 talukas 2 2 taluka an administrative subdivision of a district in saurashtra this is supported by several other studies that indicate saurashtra had a lion s share in the recharge movement and it was taken up equally among different parts of saurashtra shingi and asopa 2002 mudrakastha 2012 shah 2012 verma and kirshnan 2012 mehta 2020 sakthivadivel 2007 contemporary to this unforeseen recharge movement change of the millennia witnessed many promising factors for sustainable development in water irrigation sector in gujarat which were ascribed as game changers for agriculture growth in gujarat one was the launch of jyotigram yojna a flagship scheme by the state government of gujarat to separate agricultural from domestic power lines and ensure better quality electricity supply for limited time for agricultural power connections which was claimed to have impacted groundwater withdrawal while limiting electricity consumption shah et al 2008 also the long delayed sardar sarovar project ssp on narmada river got an unparalleled boost while narendra modi was chief minister of gujarat and all this happened in tandem with a good rainfall spell that started in 2003 and lasted for more than a decade the confluence of many such factors caused major groundwater revival in parts of gujarat bhanja et al 2017 concluded that gujarat had groundwater storage depleting at the rate of 5 81 0 38 km3 year during 1996 2001 which was reversed and showed replenishment at a rate of 2 04 0 20 km3 year during 2003 2014 this stark reversal in the groundwater depletion during 2003 2014 as compared to 1996 2002 ha d multilateral policy implications and a favourable rainfall spell made it a vital topic of discussion among researchers shah et al 2009 and jain 2012 concluded that water harvesting and jyotigram yojna were keys to replenished groundwater level while kumar and perry 2018 opined that gujarat experienced a temporary surge in rainfall which caused better groundwater recharge and availability of water through the canal network in command areas of the ssp this argument got strength from the fact that sardar sarovar dam height was increased from 100 m in 2003 to 121 92 m in 2006 which resulted in increase in the storage capacity from 2602 2 mcm to 5265 5 mcm gupta 2012 the dam height was further increased to 138 98 m with present storage capacity of 9 5 bcm ssd 2019 in contrast chindarkar and grafton 2019 in strident disapproval to all these claims opined that jyotigram yojna debilitated groundwater storage in gujarat the aforementioned analyses and opinions look at groundwater condition and policy implications in gujarat as a whole but they fail to incorporate the nuances of saurashtra region in seclusion saurashtra peninsula having a radically different geography and climatic conditions as compared to major parts of north and south gujarat has a stark difference in the aquifer type and groundwater regime as well saurashtra is more similar to marathawada and vidarbha of maharashtra than to other regions of gujarat as discussed earlier it is also important to take cognizance of the fact that these three regions share similar challenges regarding groundwater and availability of surface water to tackle the groundwater depletion in these regions different measures have been adopted by the respective state governments maharashtra groundwater act 1993 focused more on saving the depleting sources through regulatory measures whereas gujarat emphasised a combination of rationing power for groundwater extraction and groundwater recharge investment by providing support to communities and ngos marathawada and vidarbha also embarked upon the conservation of water through implementation of an ambitious programme from year 1992 93 through water conservation department government of maharashtra gom 2019 although having the highest number of major large dams of any state in india and spending great efforts by government for water conservation unlike saurashtra where the conservation was led by people and not just government these two regions of maharashtra frequently grab attention due to drought and acute water stress jamwal 2016 this is also reflected in the planning commission 2006 report on drought impact of maharashtra which states the team expert group from planning commission recommends large scale efforts for water harvesting and popularizing participatory water harvesting and management measures so that at least one supplementary irrigation is available to the cotton crop the team also found that surprisingly only a few attempts at bori bandh programme were visible by the roadside comprehensive programme for development of harvesting structures or water shed programmes were not available it is also claimed to be one of the major discriminating factors in terms of policy intervention giving saurashtra an edge over vidarbha shah 2012 the comparison of these regions over two separate time periods of wet spells before and after major interventions when all three regions witnessed good rainfall enables us to check whether the reversal of groundwater depletion is due to policy measures unique to saurashtra or was a coincidence of favourable rainfall this will further form a base to check the outcome of people led water conservation artificial recharge efforts versus centralised government approach 2 about the analysis comparing apples with apples this analysis focuses on the assessment of groundwater recharge and its time domain variation in semi arid regions of saurashtra marathawada and vidarbha during monsoon as the focus is on groundwater recharge we consider fluctuation between pre monsoon and post monsoon water levels as an indicator of groundwater condition unlike chindarkar and grafton 2019 and bhanja et al 2017 who use the average annual groundwater level as an indicator the rise from pre to post monsoon points directly towards resource gain during monsoon which we refer to as annual recharge as the majority of rainfall is received during the monsoon more than 80 percent for all three regions in order to get a better understanding about the improved groundwater storage due to water conservation and aquifer recharge movement of saurashtra comparing the relatively wet time period of 2003 onwards with preceding dry spell of 1991 2003 average annual rainfall 469 mm 28 percent lower than 2004 09 is not appropriate to eliminate this bias we have taken 1975 84 period 1 good rainfall spell with annual average of 626 mm for suarahstra sub division which was before any major managed aquifer recharge mar interventions as a control condition and 2004 09 period 2 as post treatment we are not including year 2003 although it had above normal rainfall because there is high possibility that 2003 might have witnessed temporary surge in groundwater recharge due to preceding dry spell contemporarily vidarbha and marathawada also experienced normal rainfall during these periods of comparison making an ideal comparison for all the regions over the two separate time spells in between these two time spells saurashtra observed major investment of efforts for mar in a mission mode whereas vidarbha and marathawada regions launched such an initiative much later through the government of maharashtra as jalyukta shivar campaign a similar exercise of estimating groundwater recharge in these two regions over periods of our consideration would prove whether just a good rainfall is sufficient in replenishing the groundwater resource 3 data sources and description 3 1 rainfall indian meteorological department imd government of india prepares sub division level india is divided in 36 meteorological sub divisions by imd and district level administrative blocks monthly rainfall data series the data points for marathawada and vidarbha sub divions coincide with the exact study regions however the saurashtra sub division defined by imd includes saurahstra region and adjoining kutch district during 1975 84 period 1 p1 and 2004 2009 period 2 p2 all three regions under consideration observed near or above average rainfall continuously table 1 the variations in rainfall are also within reasonable limits for these time periods making them ideal for consideration for representation purpose the sub division level data is shown in fig 3 as the unit of analysis are districts the district level data is used for further comparison 3 2 groundwater level the central ground water board cgwb network of observation wells data for the years 1975 84 and 2004 2009 has been used the wells represent the shallow unconfined aquifer that gets immediate recharge from rainfall and also from any artificial recharge intervention adopted average groundwater level of all the observation wells within the boundaries of each district has been calculated regional average groundwater level is computed using the area weighted average of the average groundwater levels of all the districts within the region observation wells with missing data for either the pre monsoon last week of may first week of june or post monsoon first week of november periods are not considered observation wells with abnormal variation more than 50 variation from mean trend in groundwater level are not considered about 3 percent for both the periods table 2 shows the number of observation wells taken into consideration for calculation of groundwater level due to insufficient observation for the year 1981 in marathawada 1 site with valid pre monsoon and post monsoon observation this particular year is dropped from further comparison in period 1 for marathawada 4 results and discussion 4 1 understanding the rainfall behaviour saurashtra receives almost 90 percent of total annual rainfall during the monsoon season that normally starts in june and ends in late september or early october similarly marathawada and vidarbha sparsely receive any rainfall after monsoon considering the time period of 1975 2009 annual precipitation in saurashtra has seen much variation with continuous drought years of 1985 87 as well as deficit rainfall spell in 1999 2002 rainfall was above normal for most of the years during the two spells 1975 84 and 2004 09 fig 3 a depicts the monsoonal rainfall variation for the period 1975 2009 considering saurashtra sub division that includes adjoining kutch district defined by imd considering at the districts level rainfall data for saurashtra region available from imd the mean monsoonal rainfall of is 779 9 mm for periods 1 and 797 6 mm for perios 2 marathawada and vidarbha represent similar patterns fig 3 b c table 3 gives overall comparison of monsoon rainfall distribution during these two spells 4 2 gauging the water table behaviour the pre monsoon measured in may and post monsoon measured in november levels are of interest as monsoon is the main source of recharge to aquifers causing rise in water level considering the pre monsoon season groundwater levels in saurashtra went down in period 2 more in comparison to compared to vidarbha and marathawada relative to period 1 fig 4 a the average depth of the pre monsoon water level in saurashtra increased from 8 04 m to 11 04 m below ground 40 percent lower than period 1 fig 5 this suggests higher extraction of groundwater in non monsoon months in recent years in contrast the average post monsoon levels did not change much in saurashtra 5 66 m in period 1 and 6 46 m in period 2 suggesting that seasonal desaturation of the aquifer is compensated by increased recharge which almost doubled in period 2 93 percent increase figs 4 5 table 4 in case of vidarbha and marathawada depletion of groundwater resource was not as high as saurashtra this can be attributed to less draft for irrigation and domestic usage than saurashtra for saurashtra stage of groundwater development sod percentage of groundwater extraction out of net resource in a year was recorded as more than 60 percent between 2004 and 2009 cgwb 2004 2009 between 2004 and 2009 there was an increase in groundwater draft in all three regions fig 6 saurashtra witnessed an increase in groundwater draft by 15 percent from 351 772 to 403 328 ha m between 2004 and 2009 this counters the general understanding that the groundwater draft decreases during good rainfall period marathawada and vidarbha also witnessed increased draft between 2004 and 2009 19 and 37 percent respectively and the sod increased from 44 percent to 51 percent and from 29 percent to 36 percent respectively whereas in saurashtra it remained stagnant at 68 percent the fact that the sod in saurashtra remained stagnant between 2004 and 2009 even though the extraction increased by 15 percent indicated an improvement in aquifer recharge furthermore saurashtra s blocks listed under critical sod 90 100 semi critical sod 70 90 and over exploited sod 100 category have significantly gone down in successive resource estimation by cgwb from 41 all three categories combined in 2004 to 7 in 2009 2 in 2011 and 1 in 2013 fig 7 saurashtra clearly outperformed the other two regions in terms of recharge however it is important to check the fraction of rainfall reflected in the groundwater recharge to establish if there has been significant increase in the total quantum of recharge from monsoon rainfall this enables to further eliminate the factor of good rainfall during two time periods 4 3 assessing the groundwater recharge vis a vis rainfall in order to check the increase in water recharge ratio of estimated groundwater recharge and total quantum of rainfall received for a particular year is considered total quantum of rainfall received is computed using district average rainfall multiplied by area of the district 1 t r i r f i a d i tri total quantum of monsoon rainfall for the district i rfi precipitation in the district i adi area of the district i the district level volume of recharged water is estimated as follows 2 r v i s y i a w l r i a d i 1000 rvi recharge volume for the ith district km3 syi specific yield for the district 3 3 specific yield is defined as the volume percent of groundwater yielded by a saturated rock through gravity drainage specific yield for the regions in the basalt aquifers of saurashtra vidarbha and marathawada is assumed to be 2 athawale 2003 awlri average water level rise post monsoon m 4 4 average water level rise post monsoon for the district is calculated subtracting pre monsoon may for 1975 1984 and june for 2004 2009 from post monsoon november for each well and taking an average of the observation wells within a district adi area of the district km2 recharge factor is calculated using ratio of total volume recharged out of total quantum of monsoon rainfall for all the districts of the region 3 rf rvi tri the calculated rf values show that saurashtra experienced improved groundwater recharge from rainfall nearly two fold between period 1 and period 2 0 063 to 0 114 table 5 the rises in rf in marathawada 24 percent and vidarbha 13 percent were much less than saurashtra 80 percent considering there would not have been reduction in evaporation evapotranspiration and water usage the runoff must have been controlled and diverted into groundwater recharge much better in saurashtra than in marathawada or in vidarbha box and whisker plots fig 8 show clear distinction between period 1 and period 2 distributions for saurashtra and lack of such distinction in marathawada and vidarbha 4 4 regression based analysis the analysis focuses on checking the significance of the mar intervention in increasing the groundwater recharge a regression based analysis of the district average groundwater level rise m vs monsoon precipitation m for all three regions was carried out the model 1 checks correlation between gwlr and monsoon precipitation for each region whereas model 2 helps with estimated improvement for saurashtra as compared to marathawada and vidarbha null hypotheses h0 to be tested in regression analysis were model 1 h0 no significant change in groundwater recharge during monsoon season between two time periods α 2 0 model 2 h0 no significant improvement in groundwater recharge in treatment saurashtra as compared to control marathawada and vidarbha between two time periods β 4 0 if these hypotheses hold true the dummy coefficient will not be significantly different than zero in the following equations positive significant values of α2 and β2 suggest positive improvement for period 2 and support the argument of groundwater recharge model 1 region wise awlrdy α 0 α 1 rfdy α2 dummyy 4 model 2 includes all 3 regions awlrdy β 0 β 1 rfdy β 2 dummyy β 3 saurashtra β 4 dummyy x saurashtra 5 awlr average water level rise for the district d for year y m rf precipitation in the district d and year y m dummy dummy variable used for the observations of period 2 0 for period 1 1 for period 2 saurashtra 1 for districts in saurashtra region 0 for districts in other regions as expected the coefficient of rainfall for water level rise is comparable in each region this is indicative of having similar characteristics of rainfall and groundwater recharge in all three regions and supports the rationale behind comparing these regions positive dummy coefficient for period 2 is indicative of the increase in the recharge potential as compared to period 1 saurashtra shows a significant positive dummy coefficient of 2 12 vidarbha 0 46 and marathawada 1 25 show significant positive dummy values that are lower than saurashtra s table 6 vidarbha did not have noteworthy improvement in recharge during period 2 model 2 helps in estimating the improvement in groundwater recharge between periods 1 and 2 between control marathawada and vidarbha and treatment saurashtra coefficient β4 can be interpreted as the treatment main effect the treatment here is the peculiar recharge movement in saurashtra the positive significant p 0 05 value of β4 further supports the argument about the significant positive effect of the recharge movement on groundwater recharge in saurashtra it can be argued that the percolation of rainfall depends not just on the quantum of rainfall but also significantly relies on distribution of rainy days because the comparison in regression compares two distinct time periods of the same region it can be safely assumed that the rainfall events have not changed significantly during these two time periods otherwise climatic changes would have negatively impacted the results in period 2 leading to extreme events which can adversely affect the groundwater recharge kumar 2012 5 assessing the role of policy interventions for saurashtra the analyses of water level behavior rainfall pattern and groundwater extraction data for regions with similar aquifer typology and terrain conditions for periods 1 and 2 show a significant rejuvenation of groundwater in saurashtra attributing this to any specific policy outcome needs better estimation of the impacts of ssp and jyotigram yojna 5 1 impact of sardar sarovar project on saurashtra is improved recharge due to imported water kumar and perry 2018 argued that the good rainfall and the imported water from ssp with 9 5 bcm billion cubic meter total storage capacity are the reason for gujarat s groundwater rejuvenation including the saurashtra region comparison between periods 1 and 2 indicates that rainfall is not the sufficient condition for better replenishment of groundwater the argument saying ssp is a game changer is questionable in saurashtra since narmada control authority 2019 and sardar sarovar narmada nigam limited 2019 itself accepts it is a fact that a large number of areas in saurashtra and kutch could not be brought under the command of ssp because of the limited allotment of narmada waters to gujarat and the main canal being a gravity canal which has to run on falling contour to cover maximum areas gravity irrigation has limitations of the inclusion of more areas of these regions to be covered by the command the majority of the proposed command area is yet to receive ssp water to the full extent the command area of ssp in saurastra covers parts of surendranagar bhavnagar and rajkot districts fig 9 constituting 9 24 percent of cultivable land of the saurastra region narmada control authority 2019 for argument s sake even if we assume that the command area received full water during 2004 09 it is unrealistic that the infiltrated return seepage from irrigation canal seepage would spread laterally in the remaining 90 76 percent area of saurashtra considering the low permeability of the basaltic aquifer and the topographical condition which makes the aquifer discontinuous figs 10 and 11 saha and agrawal 2006 the meagre lateral flow of groundwater would end up as effluent seepage in streams and rivers which are abundant in the area further let us also consider the possible input to aquifers from infiltrated urban sewage as almost the entire urban water supply comes from ssp the state of gujarat is allocated 1 058 bcm for the entire state for drinking purposes from ssp storage narmada control authority 2019 if we assume that 25 percent reached saurashtra 265 mcm having 25 5 percent of total population of the state during period 2 and if we assume optimistically that as high as 80 percent 212 mcm of the total urban water supply recharges the aquifer the water level rise in saurashtra area 64454 km2 estimated specific yield 0 02 would have been around 15 cm eq 2 for period 2 against the observed rise of approximately 2 2 m table 4 in monsoonal water level from period 1 to period 2 this indicates that saurashtra s groundwater was rejuvenated from recharge through rainfall 5 2 impact of jyotigram scheme is rationing of energy effective in reducing the extraction of groundwater jyotigram yojna was launched in gujarat with focus on changing electricity supply to rural areas the major emphases of this policy were 1 restricting power supply to rural agriculture connections to 8 h a day to shift power load from peak hours to off peak hours and 2 reliable availability of electricity during these 8 h which enabled farmers to have uninterrupted use of electricity for withdrawal of groundwater this very policy was intended to address the problems of growing energy subsidy and groundwater overdraft shah et al 2004 shah and verma 2008 gupta 2012 as highlighted by shah and choudhary 2017 the policy initially restricted the groundwater draft due to restriction on electricity connections to a number of pump sets but the condition was altered in subsequent years with prioritized allocation of tube well connections to small farmers belonging to scheduled castes and tribes in gujarat figs 6 and 10 indicate that the draft of groundwater steadily increased even during the good rainfall years and the area under irrigation through groundwater also steadily increased during period 2 even the electricity consumption for agriculture did not significantly decrease in gujarat after full implementation of jyotigram yojna kumar and perry 2018 the steady increase in electricity consumption during period 2 when the groundwater levels were also increasing suggests that more water is being abstracted for agriculture and that this policy may not be instrumental in restoration of groundwater condition 6 conclusions today tapping run off to conserve and recharge groundwater is a major challenge faced by most of the states in india the current study aimed at investigating the much acclaimed people s participatory recharge movement of saurashtra this study provides empirical evidence that the improvement in monsoonal groundwater recharge for saurashtra was greater than in marathawada and vidarbha which have similar hydrogeological geographical and climatic characteristics during comparable wet spells the net positive impact can be attributed to enhanced recharge from the thousands of small water harvesting and artificial recharge structures this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the mean monsoon rainfall in periods 1 and 2 of saurashtra is the same and the number of rainy days were similar during periods 1 and 2 average rainy days were 31 and 30 respectively the other possible factors contributing to recharge like agricultural return seepage and canal seepage from ssp command area return seepage from urban waste water most of the urban water supply is imported from ssp and impact of controlling the pumping through jyotigram yojna have a marginal impact on saurashtra s groundwater recharge microanalysis of the two major river basins meghal 490 km2 and bhadar 7400 km2 in saurashtra has also shown significant impact of recharge structures on groundwater recharge kamboj 2011 verma and kirshnan 2012 there is a possibility that a component of rejected recharge if any in the saurashtra region has helped in building up groundwater resources in period 2 considering the average pre monsoon depth to the water level and 2 percent specific yield for the formation a component of rejected recharge 5 5 rejected recharge water that can potentially enter the groundwater but discharges because the aquifer is full and cannot accept it is possible which could not be computed because of a lack of continuous water level data for monsoon season the deeper pre monsoon water level in period 2 indicates that more space was available for recharge is accommodated more in period 2 as compared to period 1 there is no change in overall soil and terrain condition between the periods indicating that the artificial recharge structures must have played a significant role in transferring a part of rejected recharge during period 2 the hard rock region of saurashtra which is underlain by basaltic aquifers having good drainage density and conducive topography is suitable for such interventions comparing groundwater conditions in saurashtra with the rest of gujarat is inappropriate given the wide variation in characteristics of geology aquifer framework groundwater flow regime rainfall as well as the greater extent of large scale canal projects elsewhere in gujarat groundwater in marathawada and vidarbha has not equally flourished in terms of recharge even after efforts by the government of maharashtra since 2010 marathawada and vidarbha have also focused on mar with introduction of jalyukt shivar program as well as many ngos investing heavily in community based sustainable water management practices in the next couple of years it will be worthwhile to check if groundwater levels in those regions have also improved significantly as in saurashtra and whether effectiveness of mar continues to be supported by data credit authorship contribution statement
