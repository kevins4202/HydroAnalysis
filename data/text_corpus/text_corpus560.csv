2800,glacier and ice sheets are the largest reservoir of freshwater on earth global warming accelerates glacier retreat and enhances the volume of glacier runoff which heavily impacts the geochemical cycling in downstream ecosystems nitrate is the main form of nitrogen in glacier runoff while little is known about its source in high altitude regions here we measured complete nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 in ten geographically separated glacier runoffs on the tibetan plateau tp with altitudes ranging from 2 409 to 5 564 m the average no3 concentration in glacier runoff was 1 0 0 7 mg l 1 which is lower than that in the river and lake of the tp this indicates that the glacier runoff on the tp was less influenced by human activities nitrification derived no3 was the major source of glacier runoff no3 which ranged from 57 to 90 the nitrification process could occur in subglacial environments and glacial foreland soils furthermore denitrification process may not occur in glacier runoff over the tp our work may shed light on the nitrogen cycle in high altitude areas keywords nitrate sources nitrate transformations glacier runoff tibetan plateau data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glaciers have been receding at an accelerated rate in recent decades as a result of climate warming bolch et al 2012 the glacier melt induced release of nitrogen can impact glacier fed ecosystems slemmons et al 2013 glacial runoff transfers nitrogen milner et al 2017 derived from atmospheric deposition wolff 2013 and nitrification by microbes beneath the ice wadham et al 2016 glacial runoff input no3 is vital to oligotrophic proglacial and glacial lakes slemmons and saros 2012 however there is currently very little information on no3 in glacier runoff on the tibetan plateau tp the tp contains the largest number of glaciers outside the polar areas and is experiencing rapid retreat yao et al 2007 the source of no3 in alpine lakes and rivers has been studied due to its important role in low trophic and remote watershed which are less affected by direct human activities bourgeois et al 2018 hundey et al 2016 lin et al 2020 tsunogai et al 2011 xia et al 2019 atmospheric deposition of no3 is important to alpine aquatic ecosystems accounting for 35 of no3 of watersheds in the french alps bourgeois et al 2018 and 45 in rivers in mt everest region lin et al 2020 however tsunogai et al 2011 reported that atmospheric no3 accounted for only 10 of total no3 in subalpine lake mashu in japan and then rapidly assimilated through the active nitrogen cycle in the lake human related contributions have also been quantified nitrate and ammonium based fertilizers contributed 60 of no3 in aquatic systems in uinta mountain usa hundey et al 2016 manure is also one of the major sources 47 of no3 to the yellow river xia et al 2019 to date the source of no3 in glacier runoff on the tp has not been investigated the source and transformation of no3 in upstream glacier runoff are vital to understanding downstream ecosystems previous studies have mostly investigated no3 sources and transformations based on the composition of δ15n no3 and or δ18o no3 ansari et al 2013 jin et al 2015 matiatos et al 2021 however this method could overestimate the δ15n no3 value by as much as 1 2 due to mass independent 17o in atmospheric no3 coplen et al 2004 in addition different no3 sources had wide and overlapping ranges of values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 which increased the uncertainty in no3 source partitioning michalski et al 2004 recently the complete nitrate isotope δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 approach allowed us to take advantage of anomalous 17o enrichment which is mass independent oxygen isotope fractionation during photochemistry related to o3 michalski et al 2003 δ17o no3 can be a unique probe for tracking the fate of atmospheric no3 bourgeois et al 2018 lin et al 2020 other terrestrial n cycle processes such as nitrification denitrification and assimilation follow mass dependent fractionation and the δ17o no3 value is approximately 0 kendall et al 2007 michalski et al 2004 furthermore δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 also provide clues about denitrification and assimilation granger et al 2004 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 take denitrification as an example which causes the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of remaining the no3 in a roughly approximately 1 1 2 1 ratio through kinetic isotope effects as the no3 concentration decreases kendall et al 2007 li et al 2010 however studies using the δ17o no3 method are relatively limited especially in glacial runoff using complete nitrate isotopes can greatly enhance the accuracy in tracing no3 sources and be better to understand transformations in glacial ecosystems in this study we investigated the no3 sources and transformations for ten geographically separated glacier runoffs on the tp using triple isotopes of no3 we aim to 1 reveal the characteristics of the concentration and isotopic compositions of no3 in high elevation glacier runoff and 2 clarify the relative contributions of no3 and transformation processes in glacier runoff which is the key in understanding the nitrogen cycle in high altitude mountainous areas represented by the tp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ten glacier runoffs are located in different geographic zones and are influenced by westerly winds and indian monsoon fig s1 muztagh ata glacier mstg is situated in the northwestern tp where is surrounded by deserts and influenced by westerlies

altitudes from 2 409 to 5 564 m glacier runoff is defined as the water originating from ice melt snowmelt and rain over a given glacier the glacier runoff samples collected in this study belonging to proglacial runoff which included the glacier surface runoff and subglacial runoff as well as surface runoff from rainfall flushing on glacial foreland soil the largest sampled distance in runoff varied from within 1 km to 30 km e g the mstg and mggq glacier runoff exceeded 20 km while kqgr 24 k and qm glacier runoff are in the range of 1 2 km table s1 2 2 sampling a total of 54 water samples were collected from 2018 to 2020 during summer and autumn table s1 in each glacier runoff 3 to 12 samples were collected from upstream to downstream following the flow direction fig 1 and table s1 samples were collected at different times from 9 00 a m to 7 00p m due to logistic reasons all sample sites were located between the glacier terminus and sites where runoff was input into the downstream lake or main river the number of samples and distances between samples are determined by the length of runoff and the condition of bank at least one sample was collected to represent different runoff banks from rock soil without plants and soil with few plants in the qt samples were collected from all three runoffs located south and north of the glacier these runoffs suffer less influence from human activities there are no villages agriculture within the sampling catchment the latitude longitude and altitude at each sampled site were recorded by a global positioning system the water temperature and conductivity were monitored in the field with multiple water quality sonde hydrolab ds5 hach usa approximately 100 ml surface water was collected with nalgene bottles nalgene bottles were rinsed greater than 3 times with runoff before sampling all water samples were subsequently divided into two subsamples for hydrochemical parameter 50 ml and nitrate isotope analyses 50 ml in addition 26 fresh snow within a week and 9 rainfall samples were collected at seven sites on the tp as a proxy for atmospheric deposition of no3 for snow sampling we used precleaned shovels to collect fresh surface snow into sterile 500 ml whirlpack bags at the qiangyong glaicer qy zx guliya glacier gly ranwu county rw and langkazi county lkz fig s1 rainfall samples were collected using manual rain gauges which were installed at 1 5 m aboveground at the qy kqgr and lhasa city la fig s1 in addition 6 samples from the qt ice core were used as an end member of atmospheric deposition no3

liquid water isotope analyzer with precisions of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o of 0 8 and 0 1 respectively the stable isotopic compositions δ15n δ18o and δ17o of no3 were measured using the denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 in brief denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas aureofaciens atcc 13985 that lacks n2o reductase was used to convert nitrate or nitrite to n2o gas the product n2o was decomposed to n2 and o2 which were measured by an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms mat253 thermo fisher science inc with precon at the state key laboratory of tibetan plateau earth system environment and resources tpeser institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences the analytical precision for δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 was 0 3 0 6 and 0 3 respectively three international standards the usgs 32 usgs 34 and usgs 35 were used to calibrate the sample data the isotope ratios are defined as equation 1 1 δ r sample r standard r standard 1000 where r is the ratio

that only atmospheric deposition no3 possesses nonzero δ17o no3 values we used two distinct δ17o no3 as an end member in a two source mixing model to quantify the relative proportion of atmospheric deposition no3 f a and nitrification derived no3 f n equation 2 due to nitrification is a mass dependent fractionation process δ17o no3 values of nitrification derived no3 is close to 0 michalski et al 2004 f a could be gotten from equation 3 then f n in a glacier runoff can be determined using equation 4 based on the isotopic mass balance 2 δ 17 o n o 3 g l a c i e r r u n o f f f a δ 17 o a f n

nitrification in the study region we supposed three scenarios according to previous studies buchwald and casciotti 2010 casciotti et al 2010 fang et al 2012 snider et al 2010 for scenarios 1 δ18o no3 can be described by equation 7 ignoring any kinetic isotope effects and oxygen exchange 7 δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 for scenarios 2 the δ18o no3 can be calculated using the equation

from nitrification the δ18o h2o is the δ18o of glacier runoff measured in this study and δ18o o2 is the δ18o of atmospheric o2 which was 23 5 kroopnick and craig 1972 18εk o2 represents that isotopic fractionation for incorporation of oxygen from o2 18εk h2o 1 and 18εk h2o 2 represent that isotopic fractionation for incorporation of oxygen from h2o during nh2oh and no2 oxidation respectively the combined isotopic fractionation 18εk o2 18εk h2o 1 was estimated as 37 6 to 17 9 and the 18εk h2o 2 was estimated as 18 2 to 12 8 during no2 oxidation buchwald and casciotti 2010 casciotti et al 2010 18εep represents that the equilibrium isotope effects between no2 and h2o which was 13 5 buchwald and casciotti 2013 2 6 statistical analysis all of the data analysis in this paper was conducted using r software v3 5 0 and past pearson s correlation was applied to explore the relative proportions of nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff to the distance from the glacier terminus linear correlations were performed to determine the relationship between δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 or δ17o no3 in glacier runoff t test was used to compare the differences between δ17o no3 and δ15n no3 in the atmospheric samples and glacier runoff samples the distance from the glacier terminus underneath the glacier was calculated from the sampling sites to their corresponding glacier terminuses following the direct flow using locaspaceviewer version 4 1 4 3 result 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics in glacier runoff the hydrochemical characteristics of the runoff from the ten glaciers fluctuated over a wide range table s1 the tempature and conductivity at the sampled time varied from 1 6 0 7 kqgr to 12 9 0 1 tgl and 68 20 μs cm 1 tgl to 287 1 μs cm 1 zx respectively table s1 the dramatic variation in tempature and conductivity was partly caused by the daily fluctuation in air temperature and runoff flux conductivity was significantly correlated with the distance from the glacier terminus r2 0 226 p 0 001 the concentrations of nh4 and no2 in all samples were below the detection limit 10 μg l 1 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values in glacier runoff ranged from 153 6 2 6 kqgr to 63 5 0 9 24 k and from 21 0 0 3 kqgr to 10 3 0 0 24 k respectively table s1 δ2h h2o is significantly correlated with δ18o h2o linearly r2 0 996 p 0 001 fig s3 the local meteoric water line lmwl of tibetan rivers water is δ2h 8 55 δ18o 16 53 li and garzione 2017 in glacier runoff the slope of the δ2h and δ18o in water was lower than the lmwl suggesting that they were slightly influenced by evaporation 3 2 concentration and isotopic compositions of nitrate in glacier runoff the no3 concentration in glacier runoffs varied from 0 3 mg l 1 to 3 1 mg l 1 with a mean value of 1 0 0 7 mg l 1 the no3

value of 2 2 3 1 the measured δ15n no3 value was the lowest in the kqgr glacier runoff 2 8 0 4 and the highest in the mstg glacier runoff 6 2 1 5 table 1 the values of δ18o no3 ranged from 7 6 to 30 5 with a mean value of 9 4 7 9 the highest value of δ18o no3 comes from the 24 k glacier runoff 17 3 3 4 and the lowest value comes from the qm glacier runoff 3 2 3 8 table 1 the values of δ17o no3 ranged from 0 6 to 12 7 with a mean value of 5 6 2 6 which was higher than the reported ranges in lakes and rivers hundey et al 2016 liu et al 2013 rose et al 2015 tsunogai et al 2011 the δ17o no3 values were lower in qm and zx glacier runoffs varying from 0 6 to 2 8 while the values exceeded 8 in 24 k and kqgr glacier runoffs table 1 the oxygen isotope of no3 in all glacier runoff samples deviated from the mass dependent line fig s3 indicating that a portion of the runoff no3 was produced through the atmospheric ozone cycle there was a significantly correlation between δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 in glacier runoff fig s4 based on this correlation when the δ17o no3 0 100 biologically derived no3 we can determine the mean δ18o value of biological no3 in the glacier runoffs which is 8 3 3 3 the isotopic characteristics of nitrate in fresh snow rainfall and ice core samples the isotopic characteristics of nitrate in fresh snow rainfall and ice core samples were presented in table s2 across all samples the mean values of δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 were 0 2 3 0 64 7 9 5 and 24 0 4 4 respectively the δ18o no3 value in fresh snow samples showed a decreasing trend from west to east being 76 3 6 4 61 8 5 4 56 6 1 7 and 55 6 6 7 in gly qy lkz and rw respectively the δ17o no3 value in fresh snow samples showed a similar trend being 28 5 2 1 21 1 1 4 22 5 0 6 and 16 9 3 9 in gly qy lkz and rw respectively in qy rainfall samples the mean values of δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 were 22 0 0 2 and 64 3 1 5 respectively slightly higher than those in la rainfall samples 20 5 0 8 for δ17o no3 and 56 1 1 4 for δ18o no3 respectively but similar to fresh snow in qy glacier table s2 the distances among qy kqgr lkz and la are 1000 km they are located in the southern tp and have similar geographical features the δ17o no3 values in fresh snow and rainfall samples in qy kqgr lkz and la were within a small range from 18 8 to 23 0 with a mean value of 21 4 1 1 3 4 the proportional contribution of nitrate to glacier runoff the δ15n δ18o δ17o values in atmospheric no3 corresponding to each glacier location were approximated by using δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 in ice cores fresh snow and rainfall samples in this study and nitrate isotopic compositions in snow samples lin et al 2020 a detailed calculation of the atmospheric deposition δ15n no3 δ15na δ18o no3 δ18oa and δ17o no3 δ17oa values are summarized in the supplementary material the values of corresponding atmospheric deposition δ15na δ18oa and δ17oa for each glacier location are listed in table 2 according to equation 2 the relative proportion of nitrification derived no3 f n ranged from 57 to 90 in glacier runoff with a mean value of 76 12 the f n in glacier runoffs is lower than that in the temperature forest stream which contributes more than 90 huang et al 2020 the largest f n was 90 6 in qm glacial runoff and the lowest was 57 6 in 24 k glacial runoff table 2 the f n had a significant correlation with the distance from the glacier terminus in all glacier runoff samples r2 0 420 p 0 001 fig 2 to be statistically we selected glacier runoff with at least five sampling points a increasing trend between the distance from the glacier terminus and f n was observed fig s5 the fraction of atmospheric no3 f a ranged from 10 to 43 in glacier runoff with an average value of 24 12 table 2 3 5 isotopic compositions of biological no3 in glacier runoff the values of δ15nbio in glacier runoff ranged from 4 9 to 8 9 with a mean value of 2 6 4 0 fig 3 values of δ15nbio at mstg 7 3 1 5 and mggq 6 9 0 8 were significantly higher compared to the values of other glacier runoffs whereas that in zx 4 0 0 7 was more depleted in 15n the δ18obio values varied from 22 1 to 0 3 the lowest value of δ18obio was 22 1 in 24 k glacier runoff fig 3 the average δ18obio value was 8 2 4 9 which is consistent with the estimation by extrapolating linear relationship between δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 in glacier runoff 8 3 fig s4 using those reported fractionation effects the values of δ18o no3 produced by nitrification in the study region were calculated as 6 5 to 0 2 25 1 to 10 4 and 18 6 to 7 4 for scenarios 1 scenarios 2 and scenarios 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 less anthropogenic influence in glacier runoff on the tp indicated by low no3 concentrations the no3 concentrations in glacier runoffs on the tp were comparable to those in glacier runoffs and rivers in the alps regions bourgeois et al 2018 colombo et al 2019 but lower than those in rivers on the tp hu et al 2019 xia et al 2019 and runoffs in north american remote alpine regions hundey et al 2016 the no3 concentrations in glacier runoff on the tp were comparable or lower than those in other remote areas including the alps and north america indicating that they could be used as a global background value the no3 concentrations in tp glacier runoff were substantially lower than those in plain area rivers with heavy human influence for example they are only approximately one fifth of that in the songhua river yue et al 2014 and one twentieth of water in the yellow river basin liu et al 2013 thus this suggests the tp glacier is weakly influenced by human activity 4 2 the comparison of nitrate isotopic compositions between glacier runoff samples and atmospheric samples the δ17o no3 values in glacier runoffs were much lower than those in atmospheric snow ice core aerosol and rainfall samples from the tp fig 4 a glacier runoff is fed by ice melt snowmelt and rain over a given glacier thus the δ17o no3 in runoffs should be similar to that in atmospheric samples there could be two possible explanations for the lower δ17o no3 values in runoffs including photolysis and nitrification it has been reported that photolysis of no3 occurs in the antarctic surface snow causing a significant loss of no3 concentration and an enrichment of δ15n no3 erbland et al 2013 fibiger et al 2016 fibiger et al 2013 frey et al 2009 models have predicted the occurrence of postdeposition photolysis effects in central arctic greenland geng et al 2015 but has not been observed fibiger et al 2016 fibiger et al 2013 which is due to the high snow accumulation rate in greenland and different chemical compositions of the snow from those in the antarctic as a mass dependent process it is expected that photolysis alone will not change the δ17o no3 remaining in the snow however studies have shown that the δ17o no3 value decreases with the loss of no3 by photolysis erbland et al 2013 shi et al 2018 although its magnitude is generally 2 erbland et al 2013 mccabe et al 2005 the δ17o no3 in the glacier runoffs was at least 4 folds lower than that in atmospheric samples in the tp indicating that photolysis was not the driver of the low δ17o no3 this is confirmed by previous studies also suggested no significant photolysis in snow and ice from the tp li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 even though annual ultraviolet radiation over the tp is at least 10 times greater than that over polar regions beckmann et al 2014 nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff remains the most plausible explanation for the low δ17o no3 values nitrification is a mass dependent fractionation process and the three oxygen atoms of nitrification produced no3 are derived from o2 and h2o leading to δ17o no3 of nitrification derived no3 close to 0 michalski et al 2004 the great contribution of nitrification derived no3 would dilute the δ17o no3 from atmospheric no3 resulting in lower δ17o no3 values in glacier runoffs than that in atmospheric samples the nitrification process could occur in subglacial environments and glacial foreland soils which has been reported in literatures ansari et al 2013 wynn et al 2007 zeng et al 2016 no3 produced in subglacial environments could enter glacier runoffs through subglacial runoff and no3 produced in foreland soils could enter glacier runoff via surface runoff and rainfall we also found an increasing trend between the f n and the distance from glacier terminus fig 2 and fig s6 the farther the distance from the glacier terminus the higher the glacial foreland soils development on both sides of the runoff thus the abundance of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms increased which promote nitrification brankatschk et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 this may increase no3 discharge into glacier runoff these results further support our finding of a high proportion of nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff no3 but which source is more important in contributing glacier runoff no3 needs to be further investigated the high δ15n values 2 2 in glacier runoff no3 compared to those in the atmospheric samples fig 4b emphasizes the important roles of denitrification processes and soil n input with δ15n no3 values ranging from 2 to 5 in glacier runoff system the contribution of denitrification processes and soil n input to of δ15n no3 in runoffs needs future investigation 4 3 identification of biological no3 sources and processes the most δ15nbio and δ18obio values fell within the nitrification of nh4 in precipitation and soils n range fig 3 no samples had both δ15nbio and δ18obio characteristics of no3 fertilizers which is consistent with that there is no agricultural cultivation in the studied area it is difficult to distinguish the substrate of nitrification they could be had overlapping δ15n no3 ranges a fraction of the samples mostly from kqgr and 24 k had δ15nbio lower than 0 consistent with nitrification of nh4 in precipitation kendall et al 2007 however δ18obio values were as low as 22 1 in 24 k glacier runoff fig 3 perhaps due to strong 18o kinetic isotope fractionation effects associated with oxygen atoms incorporation throughout the nitrification process as well as combination of oxygen atoms between h2o and no2 fang et al 2012 the values of δ18o no3 produced by nitrification ranging from 25 1 to 10 4 based on the scenarios 2 when considering isotope effects and o exchange occur the δ18o no3 values produced by nitrification should be between scenarios 2 and 3 from 25 1 to 7 4 yet the values of δ18obio in qt glacier runoff were higher than 7 4 thus the isotopic fractionation effects could be varied in different regions of the tp and needed more observations in the further work few samples had elevated δ15nbio and low δ18obio values characteristic of the nitrification of sewage manure n in mstg and mggq glacier runoff however there is no village within the sampling catchment so the elevated δ15nbio could come from manure the length of those two glacier runoffs exceeded 20 km table s1 the contribution of manure to glacier no3 may be due to the wildlife activity in the downstream of glacier runoff we suggest there was no apparent denitrification process occurred in the study region it has reported that anoxic condition favors denitrification which increase both δ15n and δ18o of the residual nitrate with typical ratio of 1 to 2 kendall et al 2007 we found that there were no obvious positive correlations between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values after removing atmospheric signature when separately plotting for the glaciers with more than five sampling sites 24 k kqgr qt and mstg expect for mggq where a significantly positive relationship was observed with a slope of 0 6 fig s6 5 conclusion the triple isotopes of nitrate greatly enhanced the accuracy in tracing nitrate sources and distinguishing transformation processes in the glacial runoff ecosystem this study revealed that tibetan glacier is a pristine environment and the glacier runoff had low nitrate content nitrification derived no3 was the main source in the glacier runoff no3 the nitrification process may occur in subglacial environments and glacial foreland soils the denitrification signal was not obvious in glacial runoffs therefore we emphasize the importance of nitrogen cycling in alpine glaciers further research on the microbial processes associated with nitrification could enhance our understanding of their impacts on downstream ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement feng wang conceptualization software

data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction glaciers have been receding at an accelerated rate in recent decades as a result of climate warming bolch et al 2012 the glacier

nitrification by microbes beneath the ice wadham et al 2016 glacial runoff input no3 is vital to oligotrophic proglacial and glacial lakes slemmons and saros 2012 however there is currently very little information on no3 in glacier runoff on the tibetan plateau tp the tp contains the largest number of glaciers outside the polar areas and is experiencing rapid retreat yao et al 2007 the source of no3 in alpine lakes and rivers has been studied due to its important role in low trophic and remote watershed which are less affected by direct human activities bourgeois et al 2018 hundey et al 2016 lin et al 2020 tsunogai et al 2011 xia et al 2019 atmospheric deposition of no3 is important to alpine aquatic ecosystems accounting for 35 of no3 of watersheds in the french alps bourgeois et al 2018 and 45 in rivers in mt everest region lin et al 2020 however tsunogai et al 2011 reported that atmospheric no3 accounted for only 10 of total no3 in subalpine lake mashu in japan and then rapidly assimilated through the active nitrogen cycle in the lake human related contributions have also been quantified nitrate and ammonium based fertilizers contributed 60 of no3 in aquatic systems in uinta mountain usa hundey et al 2016 manure is also one of the major sources 47 of no3 to the yellow river xia et al 2019 to date the source of no3 in glacier runoff on the tp has not been investigated the source and transformation of no3 in upstream glacier runoff are vital to understanding downstream ecosystems previous studies have mostly investigated no3 sources and transformations based on the composition of δ15n no3 and or δ18o no3 ansari et al 2013 jin et al 2015 matiatos et al 2021 however this method could overestimate the δ15n no3 value by as much as 1 2 due to mass independent 17o in atmospheric no3 coplen et al 2004 in addition different no3 sources had wide and overlapping ranges of values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 which increased the uncertainty in no3 source partitioning michalski et al 2004 recently the complete nitrate isotope δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 approach allowed us to take advantage of anomalous 17o enrichment which is mass independent oxygen isotope fractionation during photochemistry related to o3 michalski et al 2003 δ17o no3 can be a unique probe for tracking the fate of atmospheric no3 bourgeois et al 2018 lin et al 2020 other terrestrial n cycle processes such as nitrification denitrification and assimilation follow mass dependent fractionation and the δ17o no3 value is approximately 0 kendall et al 2007 michalski et al 2004 furthermore δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 also provide clues about denitrification and assimilation granger et al 2004 mayer et al 2002 xue et al 2009 take denitrification as an example which causes the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values of remaining the no3 in a roughly approximately 1 1 2 1 ratio through kinetic isotope effects as the no3 concentration decreases kendall et al 2007 li et al 2010 however studies using the δ17o no3 method are relatively limited especially in glacial runoff using complete nitrate isotopes can greatly enhance the accuracy in tracing no3 sources and be better to understand transformations in glacial ecosystems in this study we investigated the no3 sources and transformations for ten geographically separated glacier runoffs on the tp using triple isotopes of no3 we aim to 1 reveal the characteristics of the concentration and isotopic compositions of no3 in high elevation glacier runoff and 2 clarify the relative contributions of no3 and transformation processes in glacier runoff which is the key in understanding the nitrogen cycle in high altitude mountainous areas represented by the tp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area ten glacier runoffs are located in different

altitudes from 2 409 to 5 564 m glacier runoff is defined as the water originating from ice melt snowmelt and rain over a given glacier the glacier runoff samples collected in this study belonging to proglacial runoff which included the glacier surface runoff and subglacial runoff as well as surface runoff from rainfall flushing on glacial foreland soil the largest sampled distance in runoff varied from within 1 km to 30 km e g the mstg and mggq glacier runoff exceeded 20 km while kqgr 24 k and qm glacier runoff are in the range of 1 2 km table s1 2 2 sampling a total of 54 water samples were collected from 2018 to 2020 during summer and autumn table s1 in each glacier runoff 3 to 12 samples were collected from upstream to downstream following the flow direction fig 1 and table s1 samples were collected at different times from 9 00 a m to 7 00p m due to logistic reasons all sample sites were located between the glacier terminus and sites where runoff was input into the downstream lake or main river the number of samples and distances between samples are determined by the length of runoff and the condition of bank at least one sample was collected to represent different runoff banks from rock soil without plants and soil with few plants in the qt samples were collected from all three runoffs located south and north of the glacier these runoffs suffer less influence from human activities there are no villages agriculture within the sampling catchment the latitude longitude and altitude at each sampled site were recorded by a global positioning system the water temperature and conductivity were monitored in the field with multiple water quality sonde hydrolab ds5 hach usa approximately 100 ml surface water was collected with nalgene bottles nalgene bottles were rinsed greater than 3 times with runoff before sampling all water samples were subsequently divided into two subsamples for hydrochemical parameter 50 ml and nitrate isotope analyses 50 ml in addition 26 fresh snow within a week and 9 rainfall samples were collected at seven sites on the tp as a proxy for atmospheric deposition of no3 for snow sampling we used precleaned shovels to collect fresh surface snow into sterile 500 ml whirlpack bags at the qiangyong glaicer qy zx guliya glacier gly ranwu county rw and langkazi county lkz fig s1 rainfall samples were collected using manual rain gauges which were installed at 1 5 m aboveground at the qy kqgr and lhasa city la fig s1 in addition 6 samples from the qt ice core were used as an end member of atmospheric deposition no3

that only atmospheric deposition no3 possesses nonzero δ17o no3 values we used two distinct δ17o no3 as an end member in a two source mixing model to quantify the relative proportion of atmospheric deposition no3 f a and nitrification derived no3 f n equation 2 due to nitrification is a mass dependent fractionation process δ17o no3 values of nitrification derived no3 is close to 0 michalski et

nitrification in the study region we supposed three scenarios according to previous studies buchwald and casciotti 2010 casciotti et al 2010 fang et al 2012 snider et al 2010 for scenarios 1 δ18o no3 can be described by equation 7 ignoring any kinetic isotope effects and oxygen exchange 7 δ 18 o n o 3 2 3 δ 18 o h 2 o 1 3 δ 18 o o 2 for scenarios 2 the δ18o no3 can be calculated using the equation

fractionation for incorporation of oxygen from o2 18εk h2o 1 and 18εk h2o 2 represent that isotopic fractionation for incorporation of oxygen from h2o during nh2oh and no2 oxidation respectively the combined isotopic fractionation 18εk o2 18εk h2o 1 was estimated as 37 6 to 17 9 and the 18εk h2o 2 was estimated as 18 2 to 12 8 during no2 oxidation buchwald and casciotti 2010 casciotti et al 2010 18εep represents that the equilibrium isotope effects between no2 and h2o which was 13 5 buchwald and casciotti 2013 2 6 statistical analysis all of the data analysis in this paper was conducted using r software v3 5 0 and past pearson s correlation was applied to explore the relative proportions of nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff to the distance from the glacier terminus linear correlations were performed to determine the relationship between δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 or δ17o no3 in glacier runoff t test was used to compare the differences between δ17o no3 and δ15n no3 in the atmospheric samples and glacier runoff samples the distance from the glacier terminus underneath the glacier was calculated from the sampling sites to their corresponding glacier terminuses following the direct flow using locaspaceviewer version 4 1 4 3 result 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics in glacier runoff the hydrochemical characteristics of the runoff from the ten glaciers fluctuated over a wide range table s1 the tempature and conductivity at the sampled time varied from 1 6 0 7 kqgr to 12 9 0 1 tgl and 68 20 μs cm 1 tgl to 287 1 μs cm 1 zx respectively table s1 the dramatic variation in tempature and conductivity was partly caused by the daily fluctuation in air temperature and runoff flux conductivity was significantly correlated with the distance from the glacier terminus r2 0 226 p 0 001 the concentrations of nh4 and no2 in all samples were below the detection limit 10 μg l 1 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o values in glacier runoff ranged from 153 6 2 6 kqgr to 63 5 0 9 24 k and from 21 0 0 3 kqgr to 10 3 0 0 24 k respectively table s1 δ2h h2o is significantly correlated with δ18o h2o linearly r2 0 996 p 0 001 fig s3 the local meteoric water line lmwl of tibetan rivers water is δ2h 8 55 δ18o 16 53 li and garzione 2017 in glacier runoff the slope of the δ2h and δ18o in water was lower than the lmwl suggesting that they were slightly influenced by evaporation 3 2

with a mean value of 9 4 7 9 the highest value of δ18o no3 comes from the 24 k glacier runoff 17 3 3 4 and the lowest value comes from the qm glacier runoff 3 2 3 8 table 1 the values of δ17o no3 ranged from 0 6 to 12 7 with a mean value of 5 6 2 6 which was higher than the reported ranges in lakes and rivers hundey et al 2016 liu et al 2013 rose et al 2015 tsunogai et al 2011 the δ17o no3 values were lower in qm and zx glacier runoffs varying from 0 6 to 2 8 while the values exceeded 8 in 24 k and kqgr glacier runoffs table 1 the oxygen isotope of no3 in all glacier runoff samples deviated from the mass dependent line fig s3 indicating that a portion of the runoff no3 was produced through the atmospheric ozone cycle there was a significantly correlation between δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 in glacier runoff fig s4 based on this correlation when the δ17o no3 0 100 biologically derived no3 we can determine the mean δ18o value of biological no3 in the glacier runoffs which is 8 3 3 3 the isotopic characteristics of nitrate in fresh snow rainfall and ice core samples the isotopic characteristics of nitrate in fresh snow rainfall and ice core samples were presented in table s2 across all samples the mean values of δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 were 0 2 3 0 64 7 9 5 and 24 0 4 4 respectively the δ18o no3 value in fresh snow samples showed a decreasing trend from west to east being 76 3 6 4 61 8 5 4 56 6 1 7 and 55 6 6 7 in gly qy lkz and rw respectively the δ17o no3 value in fresh snow samples showed a similar trend being 28 5 2 1 21 1 1 4 22 5 0 6 and 16 9 3 9 in gly qy lkz and rw respectively in qy rainfall samples the mean values of δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 were 22 0 0 2 and 64 3 1 5 respectively slightly higher than those in la rainfall samples 20 5 0 8 for δ17o no3 and 56 1 1 4 for δ18o no3 respectively but similar to fresh snow in qy glacier table s2 the distances among qy kqgr lkz and la are 1000 km they are located in the southern tp and have similar geographical features the δ17o no3 values in fresh snow and rainfall samples in qy kqgr lkz and la were within a small range from 18 8 to 23 0 with a mean value of 21 4 1 1 3 4 the proportional contribution of nitrate to glacier runoff the δ15n δ18o δ17o values in atmospheric no3 corresponding to each glacier location were approximated by using δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ17o no3 in ice cores fresh snow and rainfall samples in this study and nitrate isotopic compositions in snow samples lin et al 2020 a detailed calculation of the atmospheric deposition δ15n no3 δ15na δ18o no3 δ18oa and δ17o no3 δ17oa values are summarized in the supplementary material the values of corresponding atmospheric deposition δ15na δ18oa and δ17oa for each glacier location are listed in table 2 according to equation 2 the relative proportion of nitrification derived no3 f n ranged from 57 to 90 in glacier runoff with a mean value of 76 12 the f n in glacier runoffs is lower than that in the temperature forest stream which contributes more than 90 huang et al 2020 the largest f n was 90 6 in qm glacial runoff and the lowest was 57 6 in 24 k glacial runoff table 2 the f n had a significant correlation with the distance from the glacier terminus in all glacier runoff samples r2 0 420 p 0 001 fig 2 to be statistically we selected glacier runoff with at least five sampling points a increasing trend between the distance from the glacier terminus and f n was observed fig s5 the fraction of atmospheric no3 f a ranged from 10 to 43 in glacier runoff with an average value of 24 12 table 2 3 5 isotopic compositions of biological no3 in glacier runoff the values of δ15nbio in glacier runoff ranged from 4 9 to 8 9 with a mean value of 2 6 4 0 fig 3 values of δ15nbio at mstg 7 3 1 5 and mggq 6 9 0 8 were significantly higher compared to the values of other glacier runoffs whereas that in zx 4 0 0 7 was more depleted in 15n the δ18obio values varied from 22 1 to 0 3 the lowest value of δ18obio was 22 1 in 24 k glacier runoff fig 3 the average δ18obio value was 8 2 4 9 which is consistent with the estimation by extrapolating linear relationship between δ17o no3 and δ18o no3 in glacier runoff 8 3 fig s4 using those reported fractionation effects the values of δ18o no3 produced by nitrification in the study region were calculated as 6 5 to 0 2 25 1 to 10 4 and 18 6 to 7 4 for scenarios 1 scenarios 2 and scenarios 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 less anthropogenic influence in glacier runoff on the tp indicated by low no3 concentrations the no3 concentrations in glacier runoffs on the tp were comparable to those in glacier runoffs and rivers in the alps regions bourgeois et al 2018 colombo et al 2019 but lower than those in rivers on the tp hu et al 2019 xia et al 2019 and runoffs in north american remote alpine regions hundey et al 2016 the no3 concentrations in glacier runoff on the tp were comparable or lower than those in other remote areas including the alps and north america indicating that they could be used as a global background value the no3 concentrations in tp glacier runoff were substantially lower than those in plain area rivers with heavy human influence for example they are only approximately one fifth of that in the songhua river yue et al 2014 and one twentieth of water in the yellow river basin liu et al 2013 thus this suggests the tp glacier is weakly influenced by human activity 4 2 the comparison of nitrate isotopic compositions between glacier runoff samples and atmospheric samples the δ17o no3 values in glacier runoffs were much lower than those in atmospheric snow ice core aerosol and rainfall samples from the tp fig 4 a glacier runoff is fed by ice melt snowmelt and rain over a given glacier thus the δ17o no3 in runoffs should be similar to that in atmospheric samples there could be two possible explanations for the lower δ17o no3 values in runoffs including photolysis and nitrification it has been reported that photolysis of no3 occurs in the antarctic surface snow causing a significant loss of no3 concentration and an enrichment of δ15n no3 erbland et al 2013 fibiger et al 2016 fibiger et al 2013 frey et al 2009 models have predicted the occurrence of postdeposition photolysis effects in central arctic greenland geng et al 2015 but has not been observed fibiger et al 2016 fibiger et al 2013 which is due to the high snow accumulation rate in greenland and different chemical compositions of the snow from those in the antarctic as a mass dependent process it is expected that photolysis alone will not change the δ17o no3 remaining in the snow however studies have shown that the δ17o no3 value decreases with the loss of no3 by photolysis erbland et al 2013 shi et al 2018 although its magnitude is generally 2 erbland et al 2013 mccabe et al 2005 the δ17o no3 in the glacier runoffs was at least 4 folds lower than that in atmospheric samples in the tp indicating that photolysis was not the driver of the low δ17o no3 this is confirmed by previous studies also suggested no significant photolysis in snow and ice from the tp li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 even though annual ultraviolet radiation over the tp is at least 10 times greater than that over polar regions beckmann et al 2014 nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff remains the most plausible explanation for the low δ17o no3 values nitrification is a mass dependent fractionation process and the three oxygen atoms of nitrification produced no3 are derived from o2 and h2o leading to δ17o no3 of nitrification derived no3 close to 0 michalski et al 2004 the great contribution of nitrification derived no3 would dilute the δ17o no3 from atmospheric no3 resulting in lower δ17o no3 values in glacier runoffs than that in atmospheric samples the nitrification process could occur in subglacial environments and glacial foreland soils which has been reported in literatures ansari et al 2013 wynn et al 2007 zeng et al 2016 no3 produced in subglacial environments could enter glacier runoffs through subglacial runoff and no3 produced in foreland soils could enter glacier runoff via surface runoff and rainfall we also found an increasing trend between the f n and the distance from glacier terminus fig 2 and fig s6 the farther the distance from the glacier terminus the higher the glacial foreland soils development on both sides of the runoff thus the abundance of ammonia oxidizing microorganisms increased which promote nitrification brankatschk et al 2011 zeng et al 2016 this may increase no3 discharge into glacier runoff these results further support our finding of a high proportion of nitrification derived no3 in glacier runoff no3 but which source is more important in contributing glacier runoff no3 needs to be further investigated the high δ15n values 2 2 in glacier runoff no3 compared to those in the atmospheric samples fig 4b emphasizes the important roles of denitrification processes and soil n input with δ15n no3 values ranging from 2 to 5 in glacier runoff system the contribution of denitrification processes and soil n input to of δ15n no3 in runoffs needs future investigation 4 3 identification of biological no3 sources and processes the most δ15nbio and δ18obio values fell within the nitrification of nh4 in precipitation and soils n range fig 3 no samples had both δ15nbio and δ18obio characteristics of no3 fertilizers which is consistent with that there is no agricultural cultivation in the studied area it is difficult to distinguish the substrate of nitrification they could be had overlapping δ15n no3 ranges a fraction of the samples mostly from kqgr and 24 k had δ15nbio lower than 0 consistent with nitrification of nh4 in precipitation kendall et al 2007 however δ18obio values were as low as 22 1 in 24 k glacier runoff fig 3 perhaps due to strong 18o kinetic isotope fractionation effects associated with oxygen atoms incorporation throughout the nitrification process as well as combination of oxygen atoms between h2o and no2 fang et al 2012 the values of δ18o no3 produced by nitrification ranging from 25 1 to 10 4 based on the scenarios 2 when considering isotope effects and o exchange occur the δ18o no3 values produced by nitrification should be between scenarios 2 and 3 from 25 1 to 7 4 yet the values of δ18obio in qt glacier runoff were higher than 7 4 thus the isotopic fractionation effects could be varied in different regions of the tp and needed more observations in the further work few samples had elevated δ15nbio and low δ18obio values characteristic of the nitrification of sewage manure n in mstg and mggq glacier runoff however there is no village within the sampling catchment so the elevated δ15nbio could come from manure the length of those two glacier runoffs exceeded 20 km table s1 the contribution of manure to glacier no3 may be due to the wildlife activity in the downstream of glacier runoff we suggest there was no apparent denitrification process occurred in the study region it has reported that anoxic condition favors denitrification which increase both δ15n and δ18o of the residual nitrate with typical ratio of 1 to 2 kendall et al 2007 we found that there were no obvious positive correlations between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values after removing atmospheric signature when separately plotting for the glaciers with more than five sampling sites 24 k kqgr qt and mstg expect for mggq where a significantly positive relationship was observed with a slope of 0 6 fig s6 5 conclusion the triple isotopes of nitrate greatly enhanced the accuracy in tracing nitrate sources and distinguishing transformation processes in the glacial runoff ecosystem this study revealed that tibetan glacier is a pristine environment and the glacier runoff had low nitrate content nitrification derived no3 was the main source in the glacier runoff no3 the nitrification process may occur in subglacial environments and glacial foreland soils the denitrification signal was not obvious in glacial runoffs therefore we emphasize the importance of nitrogen cycling in alpine glaciers further research on the microbial processes associated with nitrification could enhance our understanding of their impacts on downstream ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement feng wang conceptualization software

precipitation is consumed in this process liu et al 2019 falamarzi et al 2014 it is also an important parameter for water carbon exchange of the soil plant atmosphere continuum so the accurate estimation of et is of vital significance for irrigation water management measuring et via different devices i e lysimeter eddy covariance system and bowen ratio energy balance system etc or estimating crop et via different models in various ecosystems has been long term researched i e li et al 2015 gassmanna et al 2019 bao et al 2022 fan et al 2021 and models have become a mainstream approach for the determination of et due to their cost effectiveness compared to the former bao et al 2021 a common indirect method to estimate et is to take the product of reference et et0 and the crop coefficient as the crop et and the direct method is realized by calculating the energy conversion of the water vapor and heat flux transport from the soil stoma and aerodynamics many studies have demonstrated that the direct method performs better than the indirect one on hourly and daily scales yu et al 2016 this may be caused by the fact that the indirect method is hard to reflect the mechanism of et process and the applicability of crop coefficient is limited to specific crops regions and climates chen et al 2021 in addition the adoption of generalized crop coefficient curves for the indirect method may produce inconsistent estimations katerji and rana 2006 but the direct way will avoid this issue considering the actual aerodynamic and surface resistance terms of crops the penman monteith pm model as a direct method has been widely used to estimate crop et li et al 2013b which simplifies the whole plant canopy and soil as a big leaf and describes the vapor passing through the whole leaf as surface resistance rs and the vapor transfer from the leaf to reference height as aerodynamic resistance ra nyolei et al 2021 most previous studies have reported that the single source model presents accurate estimations under dense canopy while it performs poorly under sparse canopy katerji et al 2011 rana et al 2011 soil evaporation matters to et components in sparse canopy while the important component is ignored in the pm model with rs normally deemed as canopy resistance rc the rs is even represented as a constant in most previous studies bao et al 2022 therefore the shuttleworth wallace sw model was introduced and the resistance between the ground surface and reference height was divided into five components in the two layer model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 et in the sw model is defined as the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration based on the pm equation and weighted by a set of coefficients combined with soil canopy and aerodynamic resistance many studies reported that the sw model provides more accurate estimates of crop et even under the partial and sparse canopy fisher et al 2005 gardiol et al 2003 liu et al 2016 nevertheless the capability of sw models is significantly affected by the value of resistance and parameter and the condition of the environment and crops liu et al 2020 irmak et al 2013 li et al 2016 the sw model is also full of uncertainty as more parameters and resistance variables are introduced maize is a crop with a gradual transition from sparse canopy to dense canopy and soil evaporation accounts for a large proportion of the total et and cannot be ignored especially at the early growth stage so the single source model for estimating et during the whole season of maize needs to be further investigated accordingly pm and sw models are applied as two types of underlying frameworks to compare their capability of et simulation in the maize process of partial canopy stage to full canopy stage the accurate estimation of rc is always challenging but important for the application of pm and sw models gassmanna et al 2019 the rc models quantifying the interaction between canopy stomatal resistance conductance and meteorological physiological and soil factors are useful tools for estimating et a series of empirical and semi empirical models have been developed to simulate rc the former is normally modeled by the statistical relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors such as humidity lange et al 1971 leaf temperature jarvis 1976 and ozone uddling et al 2009 and the latter is models based on the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis ball et al 1987 leuning et al 2008 abscisic acid gutschick and simonneau 2002 water conduction tuzet et al 2003 and turgor regulation dewar 2002 according to the assumption of plant physiological characteristics but their parameters have no biological significance however whether the rc models with different combinations of crop soil and meteorological factors are suitable for the dynamic development of maize canopy remains to be verified in this study five rc models jarvis ja katerji perrier kp farias fa kelliher leuning kl massman ma including empirical and semi empirical were selected and classified into three types to express the dynamic behavior of the maize rc the one way model only takes the meteorological factors as input variables i e kp ma katerji and perrier 1983 massman et al 1992 the two way model considers the combinations of meteorological and crop factors i e kl or meteorological and soil factors i e fa leuning et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2004 and the ja model integrating resistance of all transmission mediums meteorological crop and soil is classified as the three way model jarvis 1976 guyot et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 as a self adaptive heuristic algorithm in recent years the genetic algorithm ga has been successfully applied in hydrology and water resources studies including the estimation of et tang et al 2018 suggested that the ability of the artificial neural network model optimized by ga performed better than the support vector machine model to estimate the actual et of both mulch and non mulched maize croplands yuan et al 2019 optimized and calibrated the basic crop coefficients using a ga to simulate maize et and indicated that the ga results had a better consistency with the measured data similar results were confirmed in a study of winter wheat et by cui et al 2018 these studies all focused on the machine learning models or the indirect et methods but few studies on the rc model were found in recent studies the empirical parameters of rc models are usually fitted by the traditional least square method but the widely used approach could introduce significant bias into the parameters influenced by the outliers shiraki et al 2021 some studies had applied various algorithms to modify optimize and improve rc models under the pm single layer framework whitley et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2014 while few under the sw dual layer framework the applicability of the models varies with crops areas and soils therefore we conducted the comparative study with five classical rc models optimized by ga under the hypothesis of single source and dual source et processes in this study three types of rc models were optimized by ga and applied to calculate et by pm and sw models and the performance of pm type and sw type coupled models were evaluated using the measured et by the lysimeter system during the maize growing seasons of 2011 2013 the objectives of the study were 1 to improve the estimation accuracy of et for three types of rc coupled models optimized by ga 2 to evaluate the comprehensive capability and identify the sensitive environmental factors of pm and sw type models for maize et 3 to explore the optimal method for predicting maize et over the entire growing seasons in semi humid and drought prone regions the results could provide a theoretical and practical basis for the in depth understanding of crop et process and the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency for summer maize in semi humid and drought prone regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted at yangling irrigation experiment station 34 17 n 108 04 e altitude 521 m of northwest agricultural and forest university in northwest china from june to october in 2011 2013 the experimental site is located in a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with a mean annual air temperature of 12 9 mean annual precipitation of 630 mm and evaporation from a free water surface of 1500 mm and frost day of 212 d year the soil type of the experimental field is silt clay loam with statured soil moisture of 0 42 cm3 cm 3 field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 wilting point of 0 11 cm3 cm 3 and bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design and measurements experiments were carried out in plots with an automatic rainproof shelter two sets of lysimeter systems were installed in the maize field to measure et the lysimeter system 3 m length 2 2 m width 3 m depth was composed of three main parts including planting area weighing facilities and drainage system a filter bed was paved with gravels and sands at the bottom of the planting area to ensure uniform drainage the weight data were measured by the weighing and drainage system and automatically recorded and stored in the data collector on an hourly basis with an accuracy of 0 139 kg approximately 0 021 mm water and 0 001 kg respectively the interference of rainfall was avoided using the mobile shelter installed above the lysimeter the field management and the physiological and growth characteristics of plant canopy in lysimeters were basically the same as those in plots thus the daily et of maize field was summed from the hourly et measurement by lysimeter systems based on the principle of water equilibrium for more details on the lysimeter systems refer to yu et al 2016 summer maize was sown on june 18 june 19 and june 23 and harvested on october 1 october 2 and september 30 from 2011 to 2013 the plant density was 6 plants m2 irrigation was applied when soil moisture dropped below 60 of the field capacity and the irrigation level was set to supply the crop water consumed since the previous irrigation as measured by the lysimeter the irrigation amounts during different growing seasons of 2011 2013 are shown in table 1 the crop height hm and leaf area index lai of maize were measured every 5 7 days on the average of 10 representative plant samples after sowing hm is the distance from the highest point of straightened leaves to the ground before tasseling and from the top of tassels to the ground after tasseling lai was calculated from the product of leaf area per plant lap and plant density and lap was the sum of leaf area per blade lab the length and maximum width of each blade were measured by a ruler and the conversion relationship among lai lap and lab was referred to qi et al 2012 meteorological data were obtained from a standard weather station located at the experiment station the data included daily maximum tmax and minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh sunshine duration n and wind speed at 2 m u2 soil moisture θ at the depths of 20 40 and 60 cm was measured using the pre calibrated sensors thetaprobe ml2x delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and automatically recorded and stored at 60 min intervals in the data collector the oven drying method was used to monitor the surface θ and calibrate the value of θ measured by sensors each year the variations of θ in plough layer 0 60 cm over the maize field during

as a background reference and the rc models were coupled into the pm and sw models as a control value 2 4 model calibration and validation 2 4 1 model calibration the genetic algorithm ga is a self organizing adaptive and random searching algorithm based on the natural selection and genetic mechanism which simulates the processes of population initialization selection crossover and mutation to search for a global optimal solution aghajanloo et al 2013 the ga treats the set of possible solutions to practical problems as a population with individuals encoded by a specific gene and constituted chromosomes after the initial population is generated by coding using the principle of survival of the fittest the remaining individuals are selected according to their fitness and then the crossover and mutation are combined to produce a new generation of population which cycles back and forth and produces better and better approximate solutions by generation evolution the algorithm adopts multiple routes to search in parallel and avoids falling into local optimal solutions the algorithm flow is as follows setting initial parameters randomly generating the initial population individual fitness evaluation selecting surviving individuals by roulette chromosomal crossover chromosome mutation evaluating the fitness value of the mutated population judgment of termination condition if terminated output the optimal chromosome and the corresponding fitness otherwise return to the roulette and select a new surviving individual the empirical parameters in all the rc models were optimized using the ga with et measured by the lysimeter etob in 2011 and 2012 as the objective value for the calibration of resistance models rc in pm and r s c and r s s in sw were served as dependent variables and several input indicators as independent variables the ga was realized by the scikit opt codebase in python which is a powerful python module for heuristic algorithms firstly we constructed an objective function to portray the error between the simulated and observed values and then an approximate boundary was determined for each parameter considering previous studies bao et

in table 2 respectively 2 4 2 evaluation of model performance the performance of the models is normally evaluated from two aspects namely error accuracy and closeness goodness of fit a set of indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated and observed values of et including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and relative mean bias error mbe furthermore determination coefficient r2 and index of agreement d were used to describe the closeness between the two datasets rmse mae mbe r2 and d can be expressed as 28 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 29 mae 1 n i 1

o and e are the mean value of observed and estimated et the smaller the rsme mae and mbe are the closer the r 2 and d is to 1 the better the performance of the model is 2 5 sensitivity analysis and data treatment the sensitivity coefficient of pm type and sw type models to uncertainties in environmental variables can be obtained by computing the percentage variation of simulated r s c rc r s s and et when environmental variables are increased or decreased by 10 and 20 compared to the 2013 validation dataset the data pre disposal was conducted in microsoft excel 2019 the pycharm planform

analysis and graphing originlab massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of daytime meteorological physiological and soil factors during 2011 2013 the seasonal variations of diurnal rn vpd lai ta and θ over the maize field during the growing season june october from 2011 to 2013 were investigated fig 1 rn presented a similar trend and varied from 59 50 to 231 97 w m 2 with an average of 113 47 132 78 and 134 35 w m 2 during 2011 2013 vpd ranged from 0 to 2 63 kpa with an average of 0 58 0 73 and 1 0 kpa for the three years and the maximum vpd appeared at the early growing stage with values of 2 143 july 1 in 2011 2 29 june 23 in 2012 and 2 63 june 28 kpa in 2013 which might be attributed to the higher ta and lower rh in the mid summer season ta presented a downward trend with the prolongation of the growth period and fluctuated from 10 2 to 30 9 with a mean of 22 58 23 40 and 25 04 for 2011 2013 the trend of lai showed a regular parabolic and the period from early july to middle august was the fastest growing stage of maize however the seasonal variations of lai differed remarkably for the three years with the rank of 2013 2012 2011 the lower lai trend in 2011 may be due to the stunting caused by the lower solar radiation and temperature and the lower maturity of backfill soils in lysimeter θ showed similar trends in the three years which continuously sustained between θf and θw and declined after each irrigation event the values of θ remarkably differed among the three years with an average of 0 17 2011 0 19 2012 and 0 22 2013 cm3 cm 3 3 2 comparison of maize et estimated by the pm model based on three types of canopy resistance models to evaluate the capacity of different rc models under single source et hypothesis the performance of pm model coupled with ja kp fa kl and ma rc models was investigated by comparing the simulated et with the measured et by lysimeter system etob and the original simulated et by pm equation etpm at a diurnal timescale for calibration and validation dataset fig 2 and table 3 remarkably the simulated et of the pm model was overvalued by 36 3 as a whole with r2 ranging from 0 731 to 0 863 mae from 1 314 to 2 409 mm d 1 rmse from 1 787 to 2 948 mm d 1 and d from 0 539 to 0 652 during 2011 2013 the pm ja model produced underestimation with rmse and mae lower than 1 2 and 1 0 mm d 1 for the calibration dataset in 2011 2012 while the performance was reversed for the validation dataset in 2013 with rmse and mae more than 2 3 and 1 8 mm d 1 the etkp was averagely under predicted by 38 5 and pm kp model yielded closer estimation against the observed values during the low lai stage but underestimation when lai exceeded 2 statistical analysis indicated that the model for validation performed relative to the calibration with rmse mae r2 and d of 1 461 mm d 1 1 061 mm d 1 0 821 and 0 648 for the three years contrary to the pm kp model the pm fa model over predicted et on a whole however the model had the best goodness of fit among the six models with r2 of 0 778 0 893 and 0 916 in 2011 2013 the pm kl model presented a trend of underestimating maize et under the partial canopy stage lai 2 while overestimating in the dense canopy stage lai 2 with rmse varied between 1 365 and 1 640 mm d 1 mae between 1 159 and 1 368 mm d 1 r2 between 0 758 and 0 846 and d between 0 597 and 0 810 during the growing seasons of 2011 2013 the pm ma model also performed well at the sparse canopy stage while presenting a slightly undervalued estimation with the lysimeter measurements when lai exceeded 4 for the entire years the method averagely over predicted et with rmse of 1 419 mm d 1 mae of 1 064 mm d 1 r2 of 0 783 and d of 0 713 overall the simulated error of the original pm model was the highest rmse 2 2 mae 1 7 and the deviation of the coupled model was remarkably decreased after the introduction of rc models especially for kp and ma models rmse 1 5 mae 1 2 the calculation of r2 and d indicated that the estimation closeness of pm fa pm ja and pm kl was better than other models which suggested that these models had a higher degree of interpretation of the maize et process in general the pm fa and pm kp model showed greater potential with lower rmse and higher r2 based on the pm method for estimating daily maize et in a semi humid and drought prone region after comprehensively considering accuracy and agreement however both have large system deviations and further corrections are needed to improve the simulation accuracy 3 3 comparison of maize et estimated by the sw model based on three types of canopy resistance models fig 3 depicts the daily variation in maize et produced by the sw method combined with ja kp fa kl and ma rc models for calibration 2012 and verification 2013 dataset to evaluate the capacity of different rc models under dual source et hypothesis fig 3 and table 3 the sw model systematically overestimated et with higher slope rmse mae and lower r2 and d of 1 252 1 903 mm d 1 1 512 mm d 1 0 827 and 0 703 for the whole data series the ja model greatly alleviated the overestimation trend of the sw model and improved the closeness with the etob at the sparse canopy stage while the performance at the dense canopy stage of 2013 was poorer than that of 2012 due to the existence of outliers in august 2013 the statistical analysis showed that the error of the sw ja model dropped and the accuracy rose greatly especially in 2011 2012 compared with the original sw model the sw kp estimations matched well with the lysimeter system when lai 4 however the performance at the high lai stage was inconsistent between calibration and validation years specially etkp also agreed well with etob in 2012 but presented a trend of over prediction or under prediction with r2 of 0 782 and 0 849 rmse of 1 194 and 1 527 mm d 1 and mae of 0 983 and 1 178 mm d 1 in 2011 and 2013 similar to the sw model the sw fa model produced lightly overestimated during 2011 2013 which yielded the highest goodness of fit with r2 of 0 765 0 884 and 0 900 compared with other sw type models for the three years however the performance of sw kl model resembled the sw ma model namely the closer estimation during the partial canopy stage and the undervalued estimation for the dense canopy stage the best estimated regression equation of sw kl and sw ma methods near to 1 1 appeared in 2012 but the under predicted regression line with a slope less than 1 occurred in 2011 and 2013 this could be ascribed to the great difference in vpd from mid august to mid september during the three years in conclusion the original sw model could be capable of simulating the diurnal variation of maize et to some extent while yielding the largest error with rmse 1 90 and mae 1 50 and the poorest fitting with lower r2 and d of 0 827 and 0 703 the coupled models significantly reduced the deviation between the simulated and observed et with the rank of accuracy according to the rmse and mae as sw ja sw kl sw kp sw fa sw ma sw the value of r2 and d of sw type models were remarkably higher than that of sw model indicating that the introduction of rc models had a higher explanation degree for the et process of maize land during the whole growth period compared to the original sw model the rank of agreement according to the r2 and d was sw fa sw ja sw kl sw kp sw ma sw therefore it can be inferred that the sw model coupled with ja method could give accurate estimation during the whole growth stage of maize in the semi humid and drought prone region 3 4 comparison of maize et estimated by pm and sw type models the comparative analysis of different rc models with different combinations of variable inputs embedded to pm and sw methods was conducted to explore the optimal resistance models and reveal the mechanism of rc approaches under single source and dual source et hypotheses figs 4 and 5 the original pm and sw models averagely overestimated by 36 3 and 25 2 during the growing seasons between 2011 and 2013 the combination of fa method decreased the trend of overestimation by 6 and 14 7 while the other four methods presented underestimation the 3 year average mbe results showed a similar pattern the pm sw pm fa models produced mbe more than 40 while the mbe for pm kp and sw fa models was around 20 the other models yielded mbe lower than 10 especially the mbe for pm kl sw ja sw kp sw kl and sw ma models were close to zero indicating these models had high accuracy of et estimation on the other hand both pm and sw models yielded rmse above 1 9 mm d 1 the pm model coupled with ja kp fa kl and ma methods generated rmse with a range of 1 4 1 7 mm d 1 which was significantly lower than the original models but higher than that of the sw coupled models these suggest that the simulated et of coupled models agreed well with the measured value compared to the original models among which the sw coupled model performed best the distribution of mae also proved the results the r2 value obtained by linear regression with the fixed intercept of 0 was also exhibited in fig 4 the goodness of fit of pm type models was remarkably poorer than sw type models except for the pm fa model only pm kp and pm fa models produced better fitting than the pm model for all the pm type models with r2 higher than 0 82 whereas only the sw ma model had worse fitting than the sw model for the whole sw type models with r2 lower than 0 82 the pm fa model yielded the highest fitting accuracy followed by sw fa sw kl sw ja sw kp and pm kp models thus it can be concluded that the sw and coupled sw models performed superiorly relative to the pm and coupled pm models with lower error and higher closeness this demonstrated that the expansion of energy transformation occurring at the soil surface conforms to the underlayment of maize field characterized by sparse vegetation and bare land especially when lai 2 to sum up sw ja sw kl and sw kp models performed best with higher fitness and lower deviation sw fa pm fa pm kp and sw ma models simulated satisfactorily with higher fitness and relatively higher deviation pm kl pm ja and pm ma models estimated passably with lower fitness and lower deviation while sw and pm significantly overestimated during the whole growing season of maize 3 5 sensitivity analysis of pm and sw type models the response of the et and rc based on the pm model to changes of 10 and 20 in environment variables rn g vpd lai ta θ was evaluated in table 4 the sensitivity of rc to the environment was larger than et as a whole the original pm model was most sensitive to vpd rc 17 etpm 14 and rn rc 26 etpm 7 the effect of lai on rc and etpm was lowest with sensitivity coefficients within 2 and 1 to changes of 20 in lai change in rn had a larger influence on rc and et in kp fa kl and ma models with an amplitude around 20 for a rn change of 20 the rc and et were less sensitive to g in all the models with changes less than 8 and 3 the adoption of rc models was conducive to improving the stability of vpd for et simulation despite the slightly larger sensitivity of rc to vpd on the contrary the sensitivity of lai was notably improved after coupling rc models especially in ja and kl models which is because both models took lai into an independent parameter thereby amplifying the effect of lai similarly the et and rc were also less sensitive to ta except for kp and fa models with changes less than 3 and 8 the effect of ta on et was numerically realized by influencing δ and λ and it was only considered as input variable in ja model the θ had a direct bearing on the relationship between soil evaporation and plant transpiration ja and fa models introduced θ as an input indicator to simulate rc and the result showed that changes in θ strongly affected the value of rc and et the increase of θ exhibited negative feedback on rc and positive feedback on et and the corresponding variation of rc and et in ja and fa models exceeded by 60 and reduced by 30 for a θ decrease of 20 in general rn vpd and θ were the three key factors affecting the change of simulated rc the environmental factors considered in fa model were the most comprehensive and its response to each factor was higher which determined the higher goodness of fit of fa mode in terms of simulated et the environment variables including rn vpd lai ta and θ showed different degrees of activity in each model and the influence of θ and rn on et 20 was generally higher than that of vpd and lai 15 the environmental factors considered in pm ja and pm fa models were the most comprehensive but the sensitivity of each environmental factor in fa model to et was higher than that of ja model table 5 presents the sensitivity of the sw type models to environmental variables the sw type model subdivides the rs from the ground surface to the reference height into five parts and incorporates the r s s with the θ as the basic variable into the model thus directly connecting et with the θ rn vpd lai ta and θ captured positive effect on et while g was reverse the original sw model showed the highest sensitivity to rn and vpd with sensitivity coefficients more than 12 and close to 10 for 20 changes of rn and vpd and the sensitivity to ta 4 was slightly higher than that of lai 1 2 g 2 and θ 1 changes in rn of 20 had the greatest effects on et in all the sw type models and the sensitivity between et and θ was relatively higher in both ja and fa models changes in et were within 7 for the 20 changes of vpd in the kp and ma models but vpd had an abnormal effect on et in the sw ja model with the corresponding variations of 211 73 and 131 33 for rc and etja to a vpd increase of 10 and 20 this might own to the fact that the increased calculation of vpd had exceeded the threshold of f vpd and resulted in a partial negative value of rc making the simulated value of rc and et out of the reasonable range the effect of lai and ta was less on et compared with rn θ and vpd but more compared with g the rank of environmental variables according to the sensitivity of the sw type models to them was rn θ vpd ta lai g the soil layer and vegetation layer exert great regulation in et process simultaneously due to the special properties of maize fields the sw type model differs from pm type models in that it establishes a broader connection between θ and et instead of a conceptualized rs which affected et by regulating the soil surface and canopy resistances and amplifies the effect of soil evaporation accurately reflecting the actual et process of the maize field 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the three types of rc models the stomatal canopy resistance simultaneously regulates the effect of photosynthesis and transpiration and it is a crucial parameter in et models it should be clarified firstly that the rs is not equal to the rc and the connotation of rs is greater than rc with the integration of canopy soil and other mediums strictly the rc in the pm model should be treated as rs and the two resistances close only under the conditions of dense or full canopy li et al 2013a stomatal resistance at the leaf scale can be measured by a photosynthesis system while the rc at the canopy scale is almost impossible to directly measure by a kind of instrument or even hardly estimated by an effective physical model because the upscaling from leaf to canopy is affected by the interaction of complex external conditions such as blade position and light conditions at present the effective method to solve the problem is to use the measured et to reverse the rc based on the aerodynamic resistance nicolas et al 2008 the rc derived from the re arranged pm formula is normally taken as the representative of the true value and the simulated value of other rc models is calibrated to calculate the et this study adopted three types of rc models to compare their applicability including one way ma and kp two way kl and fa and three way ja models although many studies have proved that the ja model achieved acceptable performance with simple structure and accessible input variables when applied to arid and semi arid regions raab et al 2015 xu et al 2018 this study indicated the ja model showed poor fitting in pm especially when lai 2 and lai 4 but satisfactory accuracy was obtained by the sw method the difference may be caused by the theoretical limitations of the ja model the uncertainty of parameters calibrations and the neglecting of the effect of soil resistances some studies indicated the calculation method of ja model was a linear function and the model was less stable in response to changes in soil water content chen et al 2021 hence the coupling of sw was conductive to meliorating the rc results produced by ja model compared to the coupling of pm after incorporating with soil resistance another reason was the four parameters to be corrected increased the uncertainty of the model the most widely used approach such as the least square method could introduce significant bias into the parameters influenced by the outliers shiraki et al 2021 the differences in the pm ja model between our study and others could also be explained by the above opinions overall the ja model had certain limitations under the single source model but it may be a favorable choice under the dual source model for predicting et during the whole growing seasons of maize for two way models the estimated et of kl model was far from pretty with pm method when lai 2 but favorable with sw method during the whole period the model was mechanistic and the parameters had physical significance and could be measured though parameter calibration was used in this study the model considered the physiological control of crops but failed to take the soil factors into account the kl model was a suitable choice coupled with sw model even if in the partial canopy stage but not suitable for pm model especially during the low lai stage the fa model was an empirical and simple formula to predict the rc without parameter calibration it seems to systematically overestimate the maize et on either low or high lai stages with high mae however the r2 was highest for both pm fa and sw fa models this indicated that the fa model was potential for predicting maize et but should be improved to inflect the characteristics of climate crop and soil conditions for a specific site the improvement of the fa model may be realized by the coupling of corrected parameters and environmental variables for one way models the kp model maintained low mae for both pm and sw methods which may be attributed to the average underestimation influenced by the model itself the construct of the kp model was simple and the input variables were fewer and accessible the model was passable for sw model but the systematical underestimation was unacceptable with mbe 20 for the pm kp model and needed to be strictly adjusted the ma model produced similar effects for pm and sw methods and the biggest drawback of the model was the great errors for the low and high lai stages the r2 of pm ma and sw ma models were remarkably poor than that of the original pm and sw models however the deviation and the estimation trend were greatly improved therefore the model was modest for predicting maize et over the entire growth period to sum up this study illustrated that the three way ja model was able to produce more accurate estimations and better applicability under the frameworks of single and dual sources compared with one way and two way models since rc and et were influenced by the combined effect of climatic soil and plant factors in any type of ecosystem in the case of lacking certain measured data one way and two way models can also be used as effective means of et simulating the two way kl model considering the effects of meteorology and crop was more accurate than the fa model considering the combination of meteorology and soil the one way ma model only including atmosphere factors matched slightly better than kp model in the pm approach as reverse applied in the sw approach 4 2 evaluation of the pm type and sw type models many studies have investigated rc models to improve the estimation accuracy of et in different ecosystems such as salt marsh gassmanna et al 2019 grassland hu et al 2009 meadow wetland bao et al 2022 cornfield jiang et al 2016 however most of them were set on a sole background one source model or two source model only focused on a few classical rc models but neglected the potential of other rc models the same rc model showed different performances under different et frameworks bao et al 2021 compared the capacity of the improved pm model the pm model incorporated with the ball berry model and sw model based on the long term ec measurements and proposed that the sw model achieved better performance than the pm model in a meadow wetland this study also indicated that the sw type model performed better than the pm type model during the whole growth season of maize specially almost all the resistance models embedded to the sw model had lower mae mbe and higher r2 compared to the pm model this could be due to the improvement of simulated et in the sparse canopy stage and the reduction of simulated et for the dense canopy stage for example the etpm ja was systematically underestimated at the stage of lai 2 and overestimated at the stage of lai 4 with mae of 1 213 and r2 of 0 77 however the sw ja model produced evenly distributed markers and high density points for different lai stages with mae of 0 895 and r2 of 0 84 this result was reconfirmed by bao et al 2022 which compared the performance of the sw st model to the pm st model in li et al 2015 and indicated that the sw model had better feasibility than the pm model under the sparse vegetation regions in addition chen et al 2021 explored the performance of sw and pm models in cornfields under biodegradable film mulching and reported that the sw model had a sufficiently high accuracy under different irrigation levels during the early growing stage whereas both overestimated compared to the bsw model during the middle and late growth stages nevertheless disparate results also have been reported in other studies li et al 2013b liu et al 2020 a two year plastic film mulched maize field experiment was conducted to compare the performance of the modified sw msw model the original sw and pm model and the results manifested that the et accuracy of pm model 6 overestimation significantly improved against the sw model 17 overestimation for the entire period li et al 2013b liu et al 2020 indicated the pm model predicting the et for paddy fields under the special case of water saving irrigation chen et al 2022 performed slightly better than the equivalent sw model both during sparse and dense canopy coverage stages these previous studies have explicitly demonstrated that the ecosystem type agronomic strategy irrigation method and level and climatic condition were the main factors to select et model in addition the parameter calibration of resistance models i e parameterization method calibration period notably affected the accuracy of et model averagely e et can reach 20 30 at the mixed soil canopy stage of crop growth season in arid and semi arid regions dzikiti et al 2018 and canopy density was probably the most key factor for model structure however the single layer pm type model was unable to estimate e since the model assumes a homogeneous underlying surface regardless of whether it is traditional or mulched which led to large errors of et stimulation on the contrary the two layer sw model showed performance superior to that of the one layer model such as pm under sparse or partial crop canopy due to the implementation of surface aerodynamic interactions and net radiation partitioning the present study verified the overall high performance of the two layer sw type model to capture et and e dynamics over the entire crop season through the systematic comparison of the five rc coupled models in pm sw models and the conclusion could also be a reference for other sparsely planted ecosystems 4 3 limitations and prospects the limitation of our methodology is that only a single optimization algorithm ga was used which does not directly reflect the difference between the traditional method optimization algorithm and machine learning model secondly due to the limitations of observation station and data sequence there is still much room for improvement in the representativeness scale and accuracy of et simulation future studies should focus on the development of rs mechanism models and reveal the process of crop et especially under sparse canopy with long series of measured data from multiple sites to improve the accuracy generalization and stability of crop et modeling 5 conclusions this study incorporated the jarvis ja katerji perrier kp farias fa kelliher leuning kl and massman ma rc models into the conventional single layer and two layer models to evaluate their applicability for estimating the et for a maize ecosystem in a semi humid and drought prone region long term field lysimeter measurements were used to calibrate and verify the pm and sw type coupled models based on genetic algorithms the optimized rc coupled models remarkably alleviated the overestimation trend of the original pm and sw models with lower errors and higher agreements the sw type models achieved overall high performance to capture the daily et dynamics over the entire crop season as contrasted to the equivalent pm type models the three way ja model tended to perform more accurately than others especially the coupled sw ja model the two way fa model was potential to improve due to the highest r2 with the field based et for both pm and sw hypotheses the pm and sw type models showed the highest sensitivity to soil moisture θ and net radiation rn indicating the importance of the two environmental factors to regulate the rc and et this study improved the accuracy of the traditional models for estimating crop et and further confirmed that the combination of the ja model and sw model was the optimal method for predicting maize et over the entire growth season the conclusion could also be a reference for the actual et modeling over sparse vegetation credit authorship contribution statement xi chen formal analysis writing original

2801,the reliability and accuracy of canopy resistance rc are crucial for the evapotranspiration et estimation in sparsely vegetated ecosystems but most studies are still limited to the single source penman monteith pm model in this study we coupled three types of rc models three way model jarvis ja two way model kelliher leuning kl farias fa one way model katerji perrier kp massman ma to the pm and shuttleworth wallace sw models to assess their applicability and stability under single source and dual source hypotheses in a maize field in northwest china the models were calibrated and validated against the observed data from a three year 2011 2013 field experiment based on genetic algorithms ga the results indicated that the rc coupled models optimized by ga greatly alleviated the overestimation of the original pm and sw models with mean absolute error mae decreased by 13 85 40 77 and determination coefficient r2 increased by 0 40 7 37 the sw type models achieved overall high performance to simulate et at a diurnal timescale over the entire crop season compared to the equivalent pm type models the three way ja model including crop soil and meteorological factors tended to perform more accurately than the other rc models and the coupled sw ja model was optimal for predicting maize et over the entire growing season the two way kl model produced lower errors than the fa model whereas the fa model had the potential to be improved due to the highest r2 with the field based et for both pm and sw hypotheses in addition the sensitivity analysis to environmental variables showed the effect of leaf area index lai and vapor pressure deficit vpd was less on et compared with net radiation rn and soil moisture θ this study contributes to the knowledge in the area of actual et modeling over sparse vegetation which provides a reference for agricultural and environmental applications keywords evapotranspiration canopy resistance sparse canopy single source model dual source model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction crop evapotranspiration et is a key component of the eco hydrologic cycle wang et al 2019 and over 60 of global precipitation is consumed in this process liu et al 2019 falamarzi et al 2014 it is also an important parameter for water carbon exchange of the soil plant atmosphere continuum so the accurate estimation of et is of vital significance for irrigation water management measuring et via different devices i e lysimeter eddy covariance system and bowen ratio energy balance system etc or estimating crop et via different models in various ecosystems has been long term researched i e li et al 2015 gassmanna et al 2019 bao et al 2022 fan et al 2021 and models have become a mainstream approach for the determination of et due to their cost effectiveness compared to the former bao et al 2021 a common indirect method to estimate et is to take the product of reference et et0 and the crop coefficient as the crop et and the direct method is realized by calculating the energy conversion of the water vapor and heat flux transport from the soil stoma and aerodynamics many studies have demonstrated that the direct method performs better than the indirect one on hourly and daily scales yu et al 2016 this may be caused by the fact that the indirect method is hard to reflect the mechanism of et process and the applicability of crop coefficient is limited to specific crops regions and climates chen et al 2021 in addition the adoption of generalized crop coefficient curves for the indirect method may produce inconsistent estimations katerji and rana 2006 but the direct way will avoid this issue considering the actual aerodynamic and surface resistance terms of crops the penman monteith pm model as a direct method has been widely used to estimate crop et li et al 2013b which simplifies the whole plant canopy and soil as a big leaf and describes the vapor passing through the whole leaf as surface resistance rs and the vapor transfer from the leaf to reference height as aerodynamic resistance ra nyolei et al 2021 most previous studies have reported that the single source model presents accurate estimations under dense canopy while it performs poorly under sparse canopy katerji et al 2011 rana et al 2011 soil evaporation matters to et components in sparse canopy while the important component is ignored in the pm model with rs normally deemed as canopy resistance rc the rs is even represented as a constant in most previous studies bao et al 2022 therefore the shuttleworth wallace sw model was introduced and the resistance between the ground surface and reference height was divided into five components in the two layer model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 et in the sw model is defined as the sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration based on the pm equation and weighted by a set of coefficients combined with soil canopy and aerodynamic resistance many studies reported that the sw model provides more accurate estimates of crop et even under the partial and sparse canopy fisher et al 2005 gardiol et al 2003 liu et al 2016 nevertheless the capability of sw models is significantly affected by the value of resistance and parameter and the condition of the environment and crops liu et al 2020 irmak et al 2013 li et al 2016 the sw model is also full of uncertainty as more parameters and resistance variables are introduced maize is a crop with a gradual transition from sparse canopy to dense canopy and soil evaporation accounts for a large proportion of the total et and cannot be ignored especially at the early growth stage so the single source model for estimating et during the whole season of maize needs to be further investigated accordingly pm and sw models are applied as two types of underlying frameworks to compare their capability of et simulation in the maize process of partial canopy stage to full canopy stage the accurate estimation of rc is always challenging but important for the application of pm and sw models gassmanna et al 2019 the rc models quantifying the interaction between canopy stomatal resistance conductance and meteorological physiological and soil factors are useful tools for estimating et a series of empirical and semi empirical models have been developed to simulate rc the former is normally modeled by the statistical relationship between stomatal conductance and environmental factors such as humidity lange et al 1971 leaf temperature jarvis 1976 and ozone uddling et al 2009 and the latter is models based on the relationship between stomatal conductance and photosynthesis ball et al 1987 leuning et al 2008 abscisic acid gutschick and simonneau 2002 water conduction tuzet et al 2003 and turgor regulation dewar 2002 according to the assumption of plant physiological characteristics but their parameters have no biological significance however whether the rc models with different combinations of crop soil and meteorological factors are suitable for the dynamic development of maize canopy remains to be verified in this study five rc models jarvis ja katerji perrier kp farias fa kelliher leuning kl massman ma including empirical and semi empirical were selected and classified into three types to express the dynamic behavior of the maize rc the one way model only takes the meteorological factors as input variables i e kp ma katerji and perrier 1983 massman et al 1992 the two way model considers the combinations of meteorological and crop factors i e kl or meteorological and soil factors i e fa leuning et al 2008 ortega farias et al 2004 and the ja model integrating resistance of all transmission mediums meteorological crop and soil is classified as the three way model jarvis 1976 guyot et al 2017 zheng et al 2021 as a self adaptive heuristic algorithm in recent years the genetic algorithm ga has been successfully applied in hydrology and water resources studies including the estimation of et tang et al 2018 suggested that the ability of the artificial neural network model optimized by ga performed better than the support vector machine model to estimate the actual et of both mulch and non mulched maize croplands yuan et al 2019 optimized and calibrated the basic crop coefficients using a ga to simulate maize et and indicated that the ga results had a better consistency with the measured data similar results were confirmed in a study of winter wheat et by cui et al 2018 these studies all focused on the machine learning models or the indirect et methods but few studies on the rc model were found in recent studies the empirical parameters of rc models are usually fitted by the traditional least square method but the widely used approach could introduce significant bias into the parameters influenced by the outliers shiraki et al 2021 some studies had applied various algorithms to modify optimize and improve rc models under the pm single layer framework whitley et al 2009 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2014 while few under the sw dual layer framework the applicability of the models varies with crops areas and soils therefore we conducted the comparative study with five classical rc models optimized by ga under the hypothesis of single source and dual source et processes in this study three types of rc models were optimized by ga and applied to calculate et by pm and sw models and the performance of pm type and sw type coupled models were evaluated using the measured et by the lysimeter system during the maize growing seasons of 2011 2013 the objectives of the study were 1 to improve the estimation accuracy of et for three types of rc coupled models optimized by ga 2 to evaluate the comprehensive capability and identify the sensitive environmental factors of pm and sw type models for maize et 3 to explore the optimal method for predicting maize et over the entire growing seasons in semi humid and drought prone regions the results could provide a theoretical and practical basis for the in depth understanding of crop et process and the improvement of irrigation water use efficiency for summer maize in semi humid and drought prone regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted at yangling irrigation experiment station 34 17 n 108 04 e altitude 521 m of northwest agricultural and forest university in northwest china from june to october in 2011 2013 the experimental site is located in a temperate continental monsoon climate zone with a mean annual air temperature of 12 9 mean annual precipitation of 630 mm and evaporation from a free water surface of 1500 mm and frost day of 212 d year the soil type of the experimental field is silt clay loam with statured soil moisture of 0 42 cm3 cm 3 field capacity of 0 29 cm3 cm 3 wilting point of 0 11 cm3 cm 3 and bulk density of 1 35 g cm 3 2 2 experimental design and measurements experiments were carried out in plots with an automatic rainproof shelter two sets of lysimeter systems were installed in the maize field to measure et the lysimeter system 3 m length 2 2 m width 3 m depth was composed of three main parts including planting area weighing facilities and drainage system a filter bed was paved with gravels and sands at the bottom of the planting area to ensure uniform drainage the weight data were measured by the weighing and drainage system and automatically recorded and stored in the data collector on an hourly basis with an accuracy of 0 139 kg approximately 0 021 mm water and 0 001 kg respectively the interference of rainfall was avoided using the mobile shelter installed above the lysimeter the field management and the physiological and growth characteristics of plant canopy in lysimeters were basically the same as those in plots thus the daily et of maize field was summed from the hourly et measurement by lysimeter systems based on the principle of water equilibrium for more details on the lysimeter systems refer to yu et al 2016 summer maize was sown on june 18 june 19 and june 23 and harvested on october 1 october 2 and september 30 from 2011 to 2013 the plant density was 6 plants m2 irrigation was applied when soil moisture dropped below 60 of the field capacity and the irrigation level was set to supply the crop water consumed since the previous irrigation as measured by the lysimeter the irrigation amounts during different growing seasons of 2011 2013 are shown in table 1 the crop height hm and leaf area index lai of maize were measured every 5 7 days on the average of 10 representative plant samples after sowing hm is the distance from the highest point of straightened leaves to the ground before tasseling and from the top of tassels to the ground after tasseling lai was calculated from the product of leaf area per plant lap and plant density and lap was the sum of leaf area per blade lab the length and maximum width of each blade were measured by a ruler and the conversion relationship among lai lap and lab was referred to qi et al 2012 meteorological data were obtained from a standard weather station located at the experiment station the data included daily maximum tmax and minimum air temperature tmin relative humidity rh sunshine duration n and wind speed at 2 m u2 soil moisture θ at the depths of 20 40 and 60 cm was measured using the pre calibrated sensors thetaprobe ml2x delta t devices ltd cambridge uk and automatically recorded and stored at 60 min intervals in the data collector the oven drying method was used to monitor the surface θ and calibrate the value of θ measured by sensors each year the variations of θ in plough layer 0 60 cm over the maize field during the growing seasons of 2011 2013 are shown in fig 1 2 3 models 2 3 1 et models 1 the single source model the penman monteith pm model was given as monteith 1965 1 λ e t δ r n g c p ρ a v p d r a δ γ 1

organizing adaptive and random searching algorithm based on the natural selection and genetic mechanism which simulates the processes of population initialization selection crossover and mutation to search for a global optimal solution aghajanloo et al 2013 the ga treats the set of possible solutions to practical problems as a population with individuals encoded by a specific gene and constituted chromosomes after the initial population is generated by coding using the principle of survival of the fittest the remaining individuals are selected according to their fitness and then the crossover and mutation are combined to produce a new generation of population which cycles back and forth and produces better and better approximate solutions by generation evolution the algorithm adopts multiple routes to search in parallel and avoids falling into local optimal solutions the algorithm flow is as follows setting initial parameters randomly generating the initial population individual fitness evaluation selecting surviving individuals by roulette chromosomal crossover chromosome mutation evaluating the fitness value of the mutated population judgment of termination condition if terminated output the optimal chromosome and the corresponding fitness otherwise return to the roulette and select a new surviving individual the empirical parameters in all the rc models were optimized using the ga with et measured by the lysimeter etob in 2011 and 2012 as the objective value for the calibration of resistance models rc in pm and r s c and r s s in sw were served as dependent variables and several input indicators as independent variables the ga was realized by the scikit opt codebase in python which is a powerful python module for heuristic algorithms firstly we constructed an objective function to portray the error between the simulated and observed values and then an approximate boundary was determined for each parameter considering previous studies bao et

indicators were used to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated and observed values of et including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and relative mean bias error mbe furthermore determination coefficient r2 and index of agreement d were used to describe the closeness between the two datasets rmse mae mbe r2 and d can be expressed as 28 rmse 1 n i 1 n o i e i 2 29 mae 1 n i 1

o and e are the mean value of observed and estimated et the smaller the rsme mae and mbe are the closer the r 2 and d is to 1 the better the performance of the model is 2 5 sensitivity analysis and data treatment the sensitivity coefficient of pm type and sw type models to uncertainties in environmental variables can be obtained by computing the percentage variation of simulated r s c rc r s s and et when environmental variables are increased or decreased by 10 and 20 compared to the 2013 validation dataset the data pre disposal was conducted in microsoft excel 2019 the pycharm planform 2021 2 3 was adopted as the basic environment for the parameter calibration model calculation and validation and the programming language was python version 3 9 origin 2021 was applied to statistical analysis and graphing originlab massachusetts usa 3 results 3 1 seasonal variations of daytime meteorological physiological and soil factors during 2011 2013 the seasonal variations of diurnal rn vpd lai ta and θ over the maize field during the growing season june october from 2011 to 2013 were investigated fig 1 rn presented a similar trend and varied from 59 50 to 231 97 w m 2 with an average of 113 47 132 78 and 134 35 w m 2 during 2011 2013 vpd ranged from 0 to 2 63 kpa with an average of 0 58 0 73 and 1 0 kpa for the three years and the maximum vpd appeared at the early growing stage with values of 2 143 july 1 in 2011 2 29 june 23 in 2012 and 2 63 june 28 kpa in 2013 which might be attributed to the higher ta and lower rh in the mid summer season ta presented a downward trend with the prolongation of the growth period and fluctuated from 10 2 to 30 9 with a mean of 22 58 23 40 and 25 04 for 2011 2013 the trend of lai showed a regular parabolic and the period from early july to middle august was the fastest growing stage of maize however the seasonal variations of lai differed remarkably for the three years with the rank of 2013 2012 2011 the lower lai trend in 2011 may be due to the stunting caused by the lower solar radiation and temperature and the lower maturity of backfill soils in lysimeter θ showed similar trends in the three years which continuously sustained between θf and θw and declined after each irrigation event the values of θ remarkably differed among the three years with an average of 0 17 2011 0 19 2012 and 0 22 2013 cm3 cm 3 3 2 comparison of maize et estimated by the pm model based on three types of canopy resistance models to evaluate the capacity of different rc models under single source et hypothesis the performance of pm model coupled with ja kp fa kl and ma rc models was investigated by comparing the simulated et with the measured et by lysimeter system etob and the original simulated et by pm equation etpm at a diurnal timescale for calibration and validation dataset fig 2 and table 3 remarkably the simulated et of the pm model was overvalued by 36 3 as a whole with r2 ranging from 0 731 to 0 863 mae from 1 314 to 2 409 mm d 1 rmse from 1 787 to 2 948 mm d 1 and d from 0 539 to 0 652 during 2011 2013 the pm ja model produced underestimation with rmse and mae lower than 1 2 and 1 0 mm d 1 for the calibration dataset in 2011 2012 while the performance was reversed for the validation dataset in 2013 with rmse and mae more than 2 3 and 1 8 mm d 1 the etkp was averagely under predicted by 38 5 and pm kp model yielded closer estimation against the observed values during the low lai stage but underestimation when lai exceeded 2 statistical analysis indicated that the model for validation performed relative to the calibration with rmse mae r2 and d of 1 461 mm d 1 1 061 mm d 1 0 821 and 0 648 for the three years contrary to the pm kp model the pm fa model over predicted et on a whole however the model had the best goodness of fit among the six models with r2 of 0 778 0 893 and 0 916 in 2011 2013 the pm kl model presented a trend of underestimating maize et under the partial canopy stage lai 2 while overestimating in the dense canopy stage lai 2 with rmse varied between 1 365 and 1 640 mm d 1 mae between 1 159 and 1 368 mm d 1 r2 between 0 758 and 0 846 and d between 0 597 and 0 810 during the growing seasons of 2011 2013 the pm ma model also performed well at the sparse canopy stage while presenting a slightly undervalued estimation with the lysimeter measurements when lai exceeded 4 for the entire years the method averagely over predicted et with rmse of 1 419 mm d 1 mae of 1 064 mm d 1 r2 of 0 783 and d of 0 713 overall the simulated error of the original pm model was the highest rmse 2 2 mae 1 7 and the deviation of the coupled model was remarkably decreased after the introduction of rc models especially for kp and ma models rmse 1 5 mae 1 2 the calculation of r2 and d indicated that the estimation closeness of pm fa pm ja and pm kl was better than other models which suggested that these models had a higher degree of interpretation of the maize et process in general the pm fa and pm kp model showed greater potential with lower rmse and higher r2 based on the pm method for estimating daily maize et in a semi humid and drought prone region after comprehensively considering accuracy and agreement however both have large system deviations and further corrections are needed to improve the simulation accuracy 3 3 comparison of maize et estimated by the sw model based on three types of canopy resistance models fig 3 depicts the daily variation in maize et produced by the sw method combined with ja kp fa kl and ma rc models for calibration 2012 and verification 2013 dataset to evaluate the capacity of different rc models under dual source et hypothesis fig 3 and table 3 the sw model systematically overestimated et with higher slope rmse mae and lower r2 and d of 1 252 1 903 mm d 1 1 512 mm d 1 0 827 and 0 703 for the whole data series the ja model greatly alleviated the overestimation trend of the sw model and improved the closeness with the etob at the sparse canopy stage while the performance at the dense canopy stage of 2013 was poorer than that of 2012 due to the existence of outliers in august 2013 the statistical analysis showed that the error of the sw ja model dropped and the accuracy rose greatly especially in 2011 2012 compared with the original sw model the sw kp estimations matched well with the lysimeter system when lai 4 however the performance at the high lai stage was inconsistent between calibration and validation years specially etkp also agreed well with etob in 2012 but presented a trend of over prediction or under prediction with r2 of 0 782 and 0 849 rmse of 1 194 and 1 527 mm d 1 and mae of 0 983 and 1 178 mm d 1 in 2011 and 2013 similar to the sw model the sw fa model produced lightly overestimated during 2011 2013 which yielded the highest goodness of fit with r2 of 0 765 0 884 and 0 900 compared with other sw type models for the three years however the performance of sw kl model resembled the sw ma model namely the closer estimation during the partial canopy stage and the undervalued estimation for the dense canopy stage the best estimated regression equation of sw kl and sw ma methods near to 1 1 appeared in 2012 but the under predicted regression line with a slope less than 1 occurred in 2011 and 2013 this could be ascribed to the great difference in vpd from mid august to mid september during the three years in conclusion the original sw model could be capable of simulating the diurnal variation of maize et to some extent while yielding the largest error with rmse 1 90 and mae 1 50 and the poorest fitting with lower r2 and d of 0 827 and 0 703 the coupled models significantly reduced the deviation between the simulated and observed et with the rank of accuracy according to the rmse and mae as sw ja sw kl sw kp sw fa sw ma sw the value of r2 and d of sw type models were remarkably higher than that of sw model indicating that the introduction of rc models had a higher explanation degree for the et process of maize land during the whole growth period compared to the original sw model the rank of agreement according to the r2 and d was sw fa sw ja sw kl sw kp sw ma sw therefore it can be inferred that the sw model coupled with ja method could give accurate estimation during the whole growth stage of maize in the semi humid and drought prone region 3 4 comparison of maize et estimated by pm and sw type models the comparative analysis of different rc models with different combinations of variable inputs embedded to pm and sw methods was conducted to explore the optimal resistance models and reveal the mechanism of rc approaches under single source and dual source et hypotheses figs 4 and 5 the original pm and sw models averagely overestimated by 36 3 and 25 2 during the growing seasons between 2011 and 2013 the combination of fa method decreased the trend of overestimation by 6 and 14 7 while the other four methods presented underestimation the 3 year average mbe results showed a similar pattern the pm sw pm fa models produced mbe more than 40 while the mbe for pm kp and sw fa models was around 20 the other models yielded mbe lower than 10 especially the mbe for pm kl sw ja sw kp sw kl and sw ma models were close to zero indicating these models had high accuracy of et estimation on the other hand both pm and sw models yielded rmse above 1 9 mm d 1 the pm model coupled with ja kp fa kl and ma methods generated rmse with a range of 1 4 1 7 mm d 1 which was significantly lower than the original models but higher than that of the sw coupled models these suggest that the simulated et of coupled models agreed well with the measured value compared to the original models among which the sw coupled model performed best the distribution of mae also proved the results the r2 value obtained by linear regression with the fixed intercept of 0 was also exhibited in fig 4 the goodness of fit of pm type models was remarkably poorer than sw type models except for the pm fa model only pm kp and pm fa models produced better fitting than the pm model for all the pm type models with r2 higher than 0 82 whereas only the sw ma model had worse fitting than the sw model for the whole sw type models with r2 lower than 0 82 the pm fa model yielded the highest fitting accuracy followed by sw fa sw kl sw ja sw kp and pm kp models thus it can be concluded that the sw and coupled sw models performed superiorly relative to the pm and coupled pm models with lower error and higher closeness this demonstrated that the expansion of energy transformation occurring at the soil surface conforms to the underlayment of maize field characterized by sparse vegetation and bare land especially when lai 2 to sum up sw ja sw kl and sw kp models performed best with higher fitness and lower deviation sw fa pm fa pm kp and sw ma models simulated satisfactorily with higher fitness and relatively higher deviation pm kl pm ja and pm ma models estimated passably with lower fitness and lower deviation while sw and pm significantly overestimated during the whole growing season of maize 3 5 sensitivity analysis of pm and sw type models the response of the et and rc based on the pm model to changes of 10 and 20 in environment variables rn g vpd lai ta θ was evaluated in table 4 the sensitivity of rc to the environment was larger than et as a whole the original pm model was most sensitive to vpd rc 17 etpm 14 and rn rc 26 etpm 7 the effect of lai on rc and etpm was lowest with sensitivity coefficients within 2 and 1 to changes of 20 in lai change in rn had a larger influence on rc and et in kp fa kl and ma models with an amplitude around 20 for a rn change of 20 the rc and et were less sensitive to g in all the models with changes less than 8 and 3 the adoption of rc models was conducive to improving the stability of vpd for et simulation despite the slightly larger sensitivity of rc to vpd on the contrary the sensitivity of lai was notably improved after coupling rc models especially in ja and kl models which is because both models took lai into an independent parameter thereby amplifying the effect of lai similarly the et and rc were also less sensitive to ta except for kp and fa models with changes less than 3 and 8 the effect of ta on et was numerically realized by influencing δ and λ and it was only considered as input variable in ja model the θ had a direct bearing on the relationship between soil evaporation and plant transpiration ja and fa models introduced θ as an input indicator to simulate rc and the result showed that changes in θ strongly affected the value of rc and et the increase of θ exhibited negative feedback on rc and positive feedback on et and the corresponding variation of rc and et in ja and fa models exceeded by 60 and reduced by 30 for a θ decrease of 20 in general rn vpd and θ were the three key factors affecting the change of simulated rc the environmental factors considered in fa model were the most comprehensive and its response to each factor was higher which determined the higher goodness of fit of fa mode in terms of simulated et the environment variables including rn vpd lai ta and θ showed different degrees of activity in each model and the influence of θ and rn on et 20 was generally higher than that of vpd and lai 15 the environmental factors considered in pm ja and pm fa models were the most comprehensive but the sensitivity of each environmental factor in fa model to et was higher than that of ja model table 5 presents the sensitivity of the sw type models to environmental variables the sw type model subdivides the rs from the ground surface to the reference height into five parts and incorporates the r s s with the θ as the basic variable into the model thus directly connecting et with the θ rn vpd lai ta and θ captured positive effect on et while g was reverse the original sw model showed the highest sensitivity to rn and vpd with sensitivity coefficients more than 12 and close to 10 for 20 changes of rn and vpd and the sensitivity to ta 4 was slightly higher than that of lai 1 2 g 2 and θ 1 changes in rn of 20 had the greatest effects on et in all the sw type models and the sensitivity between et and θ was relatively higher in both ja and fa models changes in et were within 7 for the 20 changes of vpd in the kp and ma models but vpd had an abnormal effect on et in the sw ja model with the corresponding variations of 211 73 and 131 33 for rc and etja to a vpd increase of 10 and 20 this might own to the fact that the increased calculation of vpd had exceeded the threshold of f vpd and resulted in a partial negative value of rc making the simulated value of rc and et out of the reasonable range the effect of lai and ta was less on et compared with rn θ and vpd but more compared with g the rank of environmental variables according to the sensitivity of the sw type models to them was rn θ vpd ta lai g the soil layer and vegetation layer exert great regulation in et process simultaneously due to the special properties of maize fields the sw type model differs from pm type models in that it establishes a broader connection between θ and et instead of a conceptualized rs which affected et by regulating the soil surface and canopy resistances and amplifies the effect of soil evaporation accurately reflecting the actual et process of the maize field 4 discussion 4 1 evaluation of the three types of rc models the stomatal canopy resistance simultaneously regulates the effect of photosynthesis and transpiration and it is a crucial parameter in et models it should be clarified firstly that the rs is not equal to the rc and the connotation of rs is greater than rc with the integration of canopy soil and other mediums strictly the rc in the pm model should be treated as rs and the two resistances close only under the conditions of dense or full canopy li et al 2013a stomatal resistance at the leaf scale can be measured by a photosynthesis system while the rc at the canopy scale is almost impossible to directly measure by a kind of instrument or even hardly estimated by an effective physical model because the upscaling from leaf to canopy is affected by the interaction of complex external conditions such as blade position and light conditions at present the effective method to solve the problem is to use the measured et to reverse the rc based on the aerodynamic resistance nicolas et al 2008 the rc derived from the re arranged pm formula is normally taken as the representative of the true value and the simulated value of other rc models is calibrated to calculate the et this study adopted three types of rc models to compare their applicability including one way ma and kp two way kl and fa and three way ja models although many studies have proved that the ja model achieved acceptable performance with simple structure and accessible input variables when applied to arid and semi arid regions raab et al 2015 xu et al 2018 this study indicated the ja model showed poor fitting in pm especially when lai 2 and lai 4 but satisfactory accuracy was obtained by the sw method the difference may be caused by the theoretical limitations of the ja model the uncertainty of parameters calibrations and the neglecting of the effect of soil resistances some studies indicated the calculation method of ja model was a linear function and the model was less stable in response to changes in soil water content chen et al 2021 hence the coupling of sw was conductive to meliorating the rc results produced by ja model compared to the coupling of pm after incorporating with soil resistance another reason was the four parameters to be corrected increased the uncertainty of the model the most widely used approach such as the least square method could introduce significant bias into the parameters influenced by the outliers shiraki et al 2021 the differences in the pm ja model between our study and others could also be explained by the above opinions overall the ja model had certain limitations under the single source model but it may be a favorable choice under the dual source model for predicting et during the whole growing seasons of maize for two way models the estimated et of kl model was far from pretty with pm method when lai 2 but favorable with sw method during the whole period the model was mechanistic and the parameters had physical significance and could be measured though parameter calibration was used in this study the model considered the physiological control of crops but failed to take the soil factors into account the kl model was a suitable choice coupled with sw model even if in the partial canopy stage but not suitable for pm model especially during the low lai stage the fa model was an empirical and simple formula to predict the rc without parameter calibration it seems to systematically overestimate the maize et on either low or high lai stages with high mae however the r2 was highest for both pm fa and sw fa models this indicated that the fa model was potential for predicting maize et but should be improved to inflect the characteristics of climate crop and soil conditions for a specific site the improvement of the fa model may be realized by the coupling of corrected parameters and environmental variables for one way models the kp model maintained low mae for both pm and sw methods which may be attributed to the average underestimation influenced by the model itself the construct of the kp model was simple and the input variables were fewer and accessible the model was passable for sw model but the systematical underestimation was unacceptable with mbe 20 for the pm kp model and needed to be strictly adjusted the ma model produced similar effects for pm and sw methods and the biggest drawback of the model was the great errors for the low and high lai stages the r2 of pm ma and sw ma models were remarkably poor than that of the original pm and sw models however the deviation and the estimation trend were greatly improved therefore the model was modest for predicting maize et over the entire growth period to sum up this study illustrated that the three way ja model was able to produce more accurate estimations and better applicability under the frameworks of single and dual sources compared with one way and two way models since rc and et were influenced by the combined effect of climatic soil and plant factors in any type of ecosystem in the case of lacking certain measured data one way and two way models can also be used as effective means of et simulating the two way kl model considering the effects of meteorology and crop was more accurate than the fa model considering the combination of meteorology and soil the one way ma model only including atmosphere factors matched slightly better than kp model in the pm approach as reverse applied in the sw approach 4 2 evaluation of the pm type and sw type models many studies have investigated rc models to improve the estimation accuracy of et in different ecosystems such as salt marsh gassmanna et al 2019 grassland hu et al 2009 meadow wetland bao et al 2022 cornfield jiang et al 2016 however most of them were set on a sole background one source model or two source model only focused on a few classical rc models but neglected the potential of other rc models the same rc model showed different performances under different et frameworks bao et al 2021 compared the capacity of the improved pm model the pm model incorporated with the ball berry model and sw model based on the long term ec measurements and proposed that the sw model achieved better performance than the pm model in a meadow wetland this study also indicated that the sw type model performed better than the pm type model during the whole growth season of maize specially almost all the resistance models embedded to the sw model had lower mae mbe and higher r2 compared to the pm model this could be due to the improvement of simulated et in the sparse canopy stage and the reduction of simulated et for the dense canopy stage for example the etpm ja was systematically underestimated at the stage of lai 2 and overestimated at the stage of lai 4 with mae of 1 213 and r2 of 0 77 however the sw ja model produced evenly distributed markers and high density points for different lai stages with mae of 0 895 and r2 of 0 84 this result was reconfirmed by bao et al 2022 which compared the performance of the sw st model to the pm st model in li et al 2015 and indicated that the sw model had better feasibility than the pm model under the sparse vegetation regions in addition chen et al 2021 explored the performance of sw and pm models in cornfields under biodegradable film mulching and reported that the sw model had a sufficiently high accuracy under different irrigation levels during the early growing stage whereas both overestimated compared to the bsw model during the middle and late growth stages nevertheless disparate results also have been reported in other studies li et al 2013b liu et al 2020 a two year plastic film mulched maize field experiment was conducted to compare the performance of the modified sw msw model the original sw and pm model and the results manifested that the et accuracy of pm model 6 overestimation significantly improved against the sw model 17 overestimation for the entire period li et al 2013b liu et al 2020 indicated the pm model predicting the et for paddy fields under the special case of water saving irrigation chen et al 2022 performed slightly better than the equivalent sw model both during sparse and dense canopy coverage stages these previous studies have explicitly demonstrated that the ecosystem type agronomic strategy irrigation method and level and climatic condition were the main factors to select et model in addition the parameter calibration of resistance models i e parameterization method calibration period notably affected the accuracy of et model averagely e et can reach 20 30 at the mixed soil canopy stage of crop growth season in arid and semi arid regions dzikiti et al 2018 and canopy density was probably the most key factor for model structure however the single layer pm type model was unable to estimate e since the model assumes a homogeneous underlying surface regardless of whether it is traditional or mulched which led to large errors of et stimulation on the contrary the two layer sw model showed performance superior to that of the one layer model such as pm under sparse or partial crop canopy due to the implementation of surface aerodynamic interactions and net radiation partitioning the present study verified the overall high performance of the two layer sw type model to capture et and e dynamics over the entire crop season through the systematic comparison of the five rc coupled models in pm sw models and the conclusion could also be a reference for other sparsely planted ecosystems 4 3 limitations and prospects the limitation of our methodology is that only a single optimization algorithm ga was used which does not directly reflect the difference between the traditional method optimization algorithm and machine learning model secondly due to the limitations of observation station and data sequence there is still much room for improvement in the representativeness scale and accuracy of et simulation future studies should focus on the development of rs mechanism models and reveal the process of crop et especially under sparse canopy with long series of measured data from multiple sites to improve the accuracy generalization and stability of crop et modeling 5 conclusions this study incorporated the jarvis ja katerji perrier kp farias fa kelliher leuning kl and massman ma rc models into the conventional single layer and two layer models to evaluate their applicability for estimating the et for a maize ecosystem in a semi humid and drought prone region long term field lysimeter measurements were used to calibrate and verify the pm and sw type coupled models based on genetic algorithms the optimized rc coupled models remarkably alleviated the overestimation trend of the original pm and sw models with lower errors and higher agreements the sw type models achieved overall high performance to capture the daily et dynamics over the entire crop season as contrasted to the equivalent pm type models the three way ja model tended to perform more accurately than others especially the coupled sw ja model the two way fa model was potential to improve due to the highest r2 with the field based et for both pm and sw hypotheses the pm and sw type models showed the highest sensitivity to soil moisture θ and net radiation rn indicating the importance of the two environmental factors to regulate the rc and et this study improved the accuracy of the traditional models for estimating crop et and further confirmed that the combination of the ja model and sw model was the optimal method for predicting maize et over the entire growth season the conclusion could also be a reference for the actual et modeling over sparse vegetation credit authorship contribution statement xi chen formal analysis writing original

2802,this study combines historical records of 14c and 3h in the atmosphere and soil with renewal rate and groundwater lumped parameter models to predict the abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater over time 624 groundwater samples from numerous studies over four decades 1978 2019 in south africa namibia botswana and mozambique were collated to compare with predicted groundwater activities of 14c and 3h within the south african development community sadc region spatial datasets of carbonate bearing lithology c3 c4 vegetation summer winter rainfall and coastal proximity were used to apply corrections to 14c and 3h data corrected values of 14c and 3h were compared with the theoretical abundance of these tracers derived from the lumped parameter models to estimate the general mean residence times and presence of groundwater mixing between modern recharge and older groundwaters this study found that corrected values produced varying mean residence times derived from 14c ages 500

water supply and food security as well as supporting ecosystem functioning particularly in arid regions matchaya et al 2018 villholth et al 2013 understanding the sustainability of groundwater abstraction as well as groundwater dependent systems requires understanding mean residence transit time and its differentiation from apparent groundwater age calculated from a single tracer gleeson et al 2012 turnadge and smerdon 2014 groundwater mean residence time as opposed to apparent groundwater age represents the average time the water has spent underground in an aquifer system isolated from the atmosphere or average transit time it takes into account that groundwater usually consists of different packages of water of different ages that get mixed within the groundwater system cartwright et al 2017 whilst an apparent groundwater age can be calculated with a single radioisotope groundwater mean residence time requires a more comprehensive assessment using multiple tracers with different decay rates however isotopically derived estimates are affected by more than just radioactive decay with local recharge patterns water rock interaction and groundwater mixing mechanisms all potentially affecting the calculation and interpretation of mean residence times depending on which isotope tracer is used atkinson et al 2014 bethke and johnson 2008 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 turnadge and smerdon 2014 the most commonly used isotopes in groundwater residence time studies are radiocarbon 14c and tritium 3h both of which are naturally produced by the interaction of cosmic radiation with atmospheric gases atkinson et al 2014 clark and fritz 1997 but which have very different half lives 5730 years for 14c and 12 43 years for 3h under simple groundwater flow conditions 3h decays out completely before any significant change in 14c the deviation from the expected decay curve relationship between 14c and 3h in groundwater usually caused by mixing younger and older groundwater allows for the assessment of 1 mixing relationships albeit only qualitatively as the apparent ages calculated from3h and 14c from two waters do not mix in a linear fashion and 2 a significant change in recharge rate as even a small amount of 3h would indicate modern recharge even if the 14c abundance is still relatively low in order to assess any deviation from the expected decay curve for a given time period of recharge initial tracer abundance a series of corrections would need to be applied for both 14c and 3h to derive the initial activities in recharge le gal la salle et al 2001 however correction methods typically need measured local input parameters although methods to assess the impact of dead carbon addition on groundwater age determination have already been developed hagedorn et al 2018 han and plummer 2016 kalin 2000 samborska et al 2013 these approaches are usually applied at a local scale where the necessary δ13c soil and rock data to perform a dilution correction can be measured from where the sample was taken similarly studies that use 3h to determine the presence of modern groundwater typically have local records of 3h in precipitation to constrain recharge values into groundwater mcmahon et al 2011 samborska et al 2013 zuber et al 2005 when using 3h and 14c data collected earlier than the year 2000 before understanding the necessary local data needed for determining corrected residence time estimates downscaled datasets of regional atmospheric soil and groundwater data must be developed as δ13c data is of interest to many other research disciplines cao et al 2020 farooq et al 2021 looman et al 2019 xia et al 2021 regional distributions of δ13c in soils and rocks are available and at high enough resolutions to apply corrections to local groundwater systems furthermore recent advances in our understanding of natural 3h levels in precipitation have allowed for the prediction of spatial distributions in 3h abundances in regional precipitation van rooyen et al 2020a visser et al 2018 to assess how effective regional correction approaches are models must be interrogated and compared to regions where local data is available through the use of lumped parameter modelling techniques this study uses 14c δ13c and 3h data to interpret the presence of groundwater mixing and the potential range of mean residence times of groundwater from four countries across the sadc region namely namibia south africa botswana and mozambique fig 1 a large database 624 samples of 14c and 3h activities from precipitation and groundwater samples collected between 1978 and 2019 was compiled and analysed to better understand 1 the degree of natural attenuation of bomb pulse 14c and 3h in the southern hemisphere 2 the applicability of 14c and 3h residence time correction methods over a large area and 3 the presence of modern recharge mixing with fossil groundwaters correction methods include 1 derived 14c abundance affected by dissolved inorganic carbon dic from carbonate dissolution in open and closed systems for large regions with diverse lithologies cartwright 2010 and 2 regions that receive variable 3h activities in modern rainfall through seasonality and proximity to the ocean van rooyen et al 2020a to apply regional corrections spatial data are grouped according to the abundance of carbonate bearing lithologies the distribution of c3 c4 vegetation proximity to the ocean and precipitation seasonality in each location and reported according to regional aquifers that samples were collected from fig 1 subsequently the theoretical abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater was predicted using renewal rate and groundwater flow models to better simulate attenuation decay and mixing in the natural environment in order to understand groundwater recharge resilience and vulnerability although this study was performed in southern africa the applicability of the model approach will grow as more areas of the world attenuate the bomb peak of 14c and 3h allowing for the comparison of groundwater tracer activities with natural atmospheric abundances understanding the residence time of groundwater has greater implications for long term water security food security and socio economic development particularly in developing countries with semi arid to arid climates united nations 2015 2 methodology the model approach used in this study predicts the presence of groundwater mixing and the potential range of mean residence times of regional aquifer systems by 1 compiling groundwater reference data from previous studies in the sadc region 2 constructing theoretical abundance curves of 14c and 3h in groundwater using atmospheric and soil records for determining the potential initial abundance in recharge 3 correcting the compiled groundwater 14c data for open and closed system carbonate dissolution and the compiled groundwater 3h data for variations in 3h activity in precipitation and 4 using the predicted abundance curves in groundwater to compare the corrected groundwater data for each decadal time step from 1980 to 2020 to determine the presence and degree of groundwater mixing associated with the calculated groundwater mean residence times fig 2 2 1 compilation of groundwater reference data 14c and 3h data from across namibia botswana mozambique and south africa were collated from published and unpublished literature appendix table a1 producing 624 data points appendix table a2 the data was collected largely from south african water resources commission wrc reports and from the internal stellenbosch university library archive using groundwater and radiocarbon as search keywords the collated database includes 540 samples with δ13c values for the correction of 14c data although sample dates were spread across several decades the data was not continuous and samples from each individual borehole were in every case only sampled once however the measured 14c and 3h concentrations were always analysed from the same sample the data was separated into four decadal groups 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 to account for the natural attenuation of the bomb pulse experienced in the southern hemisphere the data used in this study was compiled from data analysed at several different laboratories as a result the precision accuracy and detection limits of the analyses are variable the average standard deviation of measurement uncertainty for 14c pmc and 3h tu data are σ 0 90 and σ 0 22 respectively from 624 data points samples collected between 2000 and 2010 were analysed at a facility that had better precision and accuracy for 3h data 0 1 tu compared to 0 7 1 tu 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology of large aquifer systems the spatial distribution of groundwater samples was clustered in the areas of interest of previous studies largely correlated to major rock and alluvial aquifers in the four countries from where the data was derived fig 1 groundwater samples n 47 located in the western cape province of south africa were mainly hosted in the table mountain group a fractured rock aquifer dominated by silicate host rocks this aquifer system is underlain by the less productive and lower quality malmesbury group shale aquifer where porosity is mostly secondary in nature and groundwater flow is often hosted in larger fault structures further north on the west coast of the northern cape province groundwater samples n 25 were typically hosted in shallower alluvial systems underlain by a fractured granitic aquifer system and the recharge mechanics are not well constrained benito et al 2010 watson et al 2021 samples collected in the northern reaches of the northern cape province n 183 were typically hosted in perched interspersed paleo river alluvial systems and deeper fractured rock aquifer systems underlain by basement granitoids groundwater samples collected from major inland rock aquifers in south africa and lesotho n 41 were hosted in fractured systems of sandstones and shales of the karoo supergroup confined by volcanic sequences of the drakensberg group with interspersed perched alluvial systems groundwater samples collected from the southern most maputo province of mozambique n 45 were hosted in two major hydrogeological regimes 1 low productivity basaltic and rhyolitic localized intergranular aquifers on the lebombo monocline and 2 large alluvial aquifers in valleys and floodplains sample locations in namibia were from three major systems 1 the transboundary stampriet aquifer comprised of interconnected sandstone and shale units that are interbedded with carbonate rich siltstones that extend across south africa and botswana n 67 2 north eastern low potential kalahari group aquifers comprised of interspersed calcareous rocks and perched alluvial systems n 47 and 3 northern limestone and dolomitic systems overlain by desert alluvials and salt pans n 43 specific sample locations in botswana were not disclosed in the original sources only local areas farms mines so samples are therefore grouped into the regions from where the studies were undertaken of which there were five 1 the kalahari region in the south west comprised of low productivity calcareous rocks and interspersed alluvial systems n 18 2 the malwewe and tsokwane areas in the south where localized alluvial and low productivity clay rich aquifers are dominant n 21 3 the meratswe valley region that has deeper 200 m fractured crystalline rock systems overlain by valley alluvial aquifers n 44 4 the orapa region dominated by deep confined clay rich sequences and interspersed fissured systems n 23 and 5 the mahathane serowe region that is a complex system of sandstones limestones and dolomites coal beds and fractured rock aquifers n 15 2 2 construction of 14c and 3h abundance curves for southern africa continuous temporal records of atmospheric and soil data associated with radionuclides especially in southern africa are scarce it was thus necessary to find a way to predict initial recharge activities of 14c and 3h across southern africa to do this historical atmospheric and soil data for 3h and 14c compiled from multiple sources were merged using a weighted moving average method that does not bias individual databases this method calculates the weighted moving average from the previous temporal dates to estimate the likely average activity over the study area as well as extrapolate for missing data in the temporal record subsequently theoretical groundwater recharge is modelled from established renewal rate methodologies le gal la salle et al 2001 for shallow systems and groundwater flow using the usgs developed tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 to ensure consistency with comparable groundwater flow investigations worldwide cartwright et al 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 nimmo et al 2005 suckow et al 2018 turnadge and smerdon 2014 2 2 1 atmospheric and soil record atmospheric 3h data was collected from six global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations gough island windhoek lynwood marion island pretoria cape town and 14c data was compiled from established 14c records from wellington new zealand manning and melhuish 1994 and heidelberg germany levin et al 2013 1995 atmospheric records of 14c and 3h were extrapolated over years with no data to better constrain the likely bomb pulse signal in the southern african atmosphere over time fig 3 following the approach of cartwright et al 2013 data prior to the bomb peak is assumed to be similar to current ambient levels and modelled by using the 14c and 3h atmospheric records to be 110 pmc and 2 tu respectively while atmospheric variation in 14c is well documented soil zone variations remain convoluted the concentration of 14c in the soil zone is derived from root respiration and is a function of the oxidation of organic matter in the soils that is typically older than modern plant matter cartwright et al 2013 in order to successfully estimate soil zone 14c global records collected from jenkinson et al 1992 kuc et al 2004 and tipping et al 2010 were used and extrapolated to the modern day for the purposes of this study on this basis 14c in the soil zone ranged from 95 pmc before the bomb pulse to around 115 130 pmc in the early 1990 s and decreased to 110 pmc in the late 2000 s it is also noted here that the interpretation of 14c in soil as well as the unsaturated zone is likely more complicated than presented in this study meredith et al 2016 wood et al 2015 however without higher resolution data and knowledge of specific environmental parameters these uncertainties can only be mitigated in future research when localised records become available 2 2 2 modelled 14c and 3h concentrations in groundwater the rate of incorporation of 14c and 3h in recharge is similar and their relationship can be predicted over time for various recharge rates suckow et al 2018 the abundance of 14c and 3h in recharge is predominantly dependent on the atmospheric activities of individual tracers at the time of recharge in order to model this interaction le gal la salle et al 2001 developed a renewal rate model that treats the top few meters of an aquifer as a reservoir that feeds the aquifer below and is in turn renewed by recharge water the 14c or 3h concentration at time t c t can be predicted according to eq 1 by calculating the effect of new recharge c i that has distinct 14c and 3h values on the previous year s recharge c t 1 according to the proportion of water replaced r n and how much decay has occurred from a known decay constant λ 1 c t 1 r n c t 1 e λ r n c i assuming that aquifers have a range of potential annual recharge rates variable r n values as not all aquifers are recharged at the same rate the theoretical abundance of 14c and 3h in a groundwater body that has a constant r n can be predicted over time this renewal rate model is only applicable for a single well mixed homogenous zone and is likely only representative of the upper zone of an aquifer or near the recharge source however although this method is applicable in simple shallow systems it is likely not representative of regional groundwater conditions and or arid areas that receive episodic recharge to model recharge and flow of groundwater in regional and or arid aquifer systems an exponential piston flow model epm was used to predict the simplified evolution of tracer abundances in the groundwater system an appropriate lumped parameter model lpm was selected which is a mathematical model that determines the concentration of a tracer over a simplified groundwater flow path aquifer geometry and flow configuration is conceptualized to account for hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing within an aquifer well bore or discharge area lpms are generally used for determining ages for groundwater by including one or more residence time tracers and predicting mixing relationships of younger and older aquifer components the model used in this study was computed using tracerlpm a python vba coded package developed by the usgs jurgens et al 2012 using an adapted model that assumes a water sample from a borehole or well is a mixture of water from different lengths of flow paths with a range of residence times cook and böhlke 2000 maloszewski and zuber 1993 małoszewski and zuber 1982 this epm model can be described as 2 c t 0 c i t τ g τ e λ τ d τ where t is the time of observation τ is the transit time and e λ τ is the decay term of the tracer if it is not stable g τ is the system response function described in cook and böhlke 2000 and zuber et al 2005 and is given by 2a g τ 0 f o r τ t 1 f 2b g τ f t 1 e τ f t t 1 1 f f o r τ t 1 f where t is the mean residence time of the water and f is the ratio of exponential flow to piston flow in the total water flow f 0 represents piston flow and f 1 represents exponential flow exponential flow models were calculated using tracerlpm using three f ratios f 0 6 f 0 8 and f 1 that represent the typical range of exponential flow seen in unconfined and semiconfined aquifers morgenstern et al 2010 stewart 2012 zuber et al 2005 this f ratio is converted to an epm ratio in the software which controls the contribution of piston flow to exponential flow conditions as described in jurgens et al 2012 the program predicts the theoretical tracer tracer concentration of 3h and 14c in groundwater as a function of input and time lpms that predict tracer behaviour in groundwater are most accurate with long term data which is largely missing from southern africa and preferably some known physical constraints on diffusion potential lamontagne et al 2015 suckow et al 2018 for the purpose of this study an epm was used to simulate a flow system that continually receives new injections of recharge along its flow path this approach makes several simplifying assumptions 1 the same amount of recharge is received each year and in the same location thus even though flow paths are variable and of different residence time recharge rates are consistent 2 the interaction between aquitards and aquifers is negligible and does not affect the isotopic signature derived from recharge in a single aquifer 3 the aquifer behaves as one homogenous body transferring water with a constant hydraulic conductivity and 4 the proportion of mixing between young and old water is constant throughout the aquifer and does not change along the flow path based on calculated epms the predicted values for 14c and 3h in groundwater are significantly different for different decadal periods as a result of the bomb pulse and subsequent attenuation the predicted abundance curves produced from atmospheric records differ from those predicted with soil records when using the simple renewal rate model fig 4 a the epms have in general a lower abundance of 3h against 14c due to the decay of 3h in the unsaturated zone fig 4b as the renewal rate model is not representative of groundwater flow in larger and deeper aquifers only the exponential piston flow models were used to predict the occurrence of mixing fig 4b 2 3 correction of tracer activity in groundwater reference data the abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater is not only a function of the atmospheric abundance recharge and subsequent decay but also other atmospheric vadose zone and geogenic processes that contribute to or dilute the apparent tracer abundance in order to interpret proportions of modern groundwater and fossil component ages that are representative of the natural system the compiled data was processed using two correction components these were the correction of 14c groundwater data for open and closed carbonate dissolution and 3h groundwater data for the variation of 3h activity in precipitation 2 3 1 open and closed system carbonate dissolution there are several geochemical models for the correction of the contribution of dead carbon during recharge and subsurface flow currently in use in modern hydrology essentially these models account for major carbonate reactions that occur in recharge and groundwater flow systems although more robust methods have been developed han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 these approaches require more environmental data than is available for the study area the correction method employed here fontes and garnier 1979 ingerson and pearson 1964 can be summarized by a q value that is then entered as a correction term into the decay equation and represents the proportion of c derived by closed system dissolution of carbonate rock dilution factor described as 3 q δ 13 c sample δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c recharge δ 13 c carbonate where sample is the measured δ13c value carbonate is the δ13c value for the local carbonate lithology recharge is the initial δ13c in the soil horizon and is largely controlled by root respiration processes and open system calcite dissolution in this study the potential dilution range of closed system dissolution was estimated by assigning δ13c ranges for carbonate and recharge from the distribution of c3 vs c4 dominant vegetation and carbonate bearing lithologies the compiled groundwater δ13c values in the dataset span the range of known values for c3 cam and c4 photosynthetic pathways in plants means of 25 17 and 14 respectively o leary 1988 and typical marine derived carbonate rock between 2 and 2 however the mean value of 8 75 median 8 40 with a standard deviation of 3 61 is skewed to more positive values than values produced through c4 photosynthesis suggesting that carbonate dissolution plays a significant role in diluting initial δ13c values and hence 14c activities across the sample locations fig 5 in order to constrain the degree of closed system carbonate dissolution the distribution of carbonate bearing lithology and initial δ13c values from vegetation type were assigned to each sample location the spatial distribution of carbonate dominated lithologies was compiled from regional geology maps by merging local carbonate bearing formations into 1 primary limestones and dolomites 2 secondary calcareous sedimentary rocks and 3 coal bearing lithologies for south africa johnson et al 2006 namibia mendelsohn 2002 botswana key and ayres 2000 and mozambique ruotoistenmäki 2008 fig 6 a photosynthetic pathways vary across southern africa from c3 cam dominated environments in the west to c4 dominated grasslands in the east the relative proportion of c4 cam c3 type vegetation in south africa which has recent published data varies significantly across the country particularly across winter and summer rainfall regions from 14 c4 in the south west to 67 c4 in the north east stock et al 2004 regional vegetation maps were used to estimate the likely dominance of c3 cam c4 plants at sample locations in south africa rutherford and mucina 2006 namibia mendelsohn 2002 botswana and mozambique rutherford et al 2005 fig 6b although vegetation maps are not at a uniform resolution between countries in this study the c4 proportion distribution showed close correlation to both local and larger scale studies of c3 c4 proportions in the sadc still and powell 2010 stock et al 2004 initial δ13c was predicted by assigning c3 c4 proportions from the spatial distribution of c3 c4 vegetation proportions 25 km 25 km to sample point locations fig 6b the likelihood of δ13c dilution was predicted through the presence of primary secondary and coal rich lithologies assigned to the spatial locations of samples subsequently a dilution line was drawn from the predicted initial δ13c soil value to the assumed rock δ13c value range predicted from local lithology to assess the degree of open closed system dissolution that has occurred fig 7 if the measured value fell to the left of the dilution line where decay is predominant the sample was corrected normally using the q value and the predicted 14c corrected residence time was used in the modern groundwater proportion prediction fig 7a if the measured value fell to the right of the dilution line then the q value correction was adjusted by the degree of open closed system dissolution based on the prevalence of local carbonate lithologies fig 7b if a sample is in a location with no presence of carbonate lithogies no correction is a applied and groundwater mixing is presumed the distribution and potential contribution of natural gas methanogenesis unsaturated zone processes and mantle derived co2 was not considered in this study this approach was only adopted due to a lack of regional soil carbonate rock and shallow groundwater δ13c data and is likely an over simplification of local systems meredith et al 2016 wood et al 2015 namibia and botswana had the highest proportion of samples taken in primary carbonate bearing lithologies 13 out of 150 samples and 11 out of 125 samples respectively followed by south african samples 18 out of 303 samples mozambique had no samples taken in carbonate bearing lithologies and this is likely a function of the narrow geographic range over which these samples were collected fig 6a a large number of south african and namibian samples are located in secondary carbonate bearing lithologies 167 out of 303 samples and 111 out of 150 samples respectively conversely a lower number of samples in botswana occur in secondary carbonate bearing lithologies 36 out of 125 samples and only 1 sample in mozambique 118 samples in south africa 44 in mozambique 26 samples in namibia and only 5 samples in botswana occur in areas where there are no carbonate lithologies present the only samples that occur in coal rich lithologies were found in botswana 52 out of 125 samples the distribution of δ13c values is plotted against measured 14c to show the potential dilution of initial 14c by dead carbon through open and closed carbonate dissolution given that initial δ13c is controlled by variable photosynthetic pathways fig 7 the degree of dilution is shown in the dilution lines between the known plant and rock contributions as q values calculated using eq 3 the resultant data produced a large range of q values 0 01 0 98 with a mean q value of 0 44 n 545 however the variability of q values is substantially less when interpreted in the context of the major aquifer systems delineated in this study the modal statistics of q values per system are summarised in table 1 although collating q values into the regional context mitigates smaller variances in local context it limits the resolution of calculated ages and mixing potential and localized studies will likely permit higher resolution results 2 3 2 3h variability in recharge corrections the temporal variation of 3h activity in precipitation is well documented in monthly gnip and other global records cauquoin et al 2015 harms et al 2016 li and si 2018 rozanski et al 2013 tadros et al 2014 zhai et al 2013 seasonality in 3h activity usually results in lower activities in precipitation in the winter months and higher activities in precipitation during the summer months mair et al 2013 van rooyen et al 2020a this trend is evident in areas where summer and winter precipitation are in general generated by different processes for example a large frontal system developing from the coastal areas to orographic precipitation inland as a result of moisture recycling distinct precipitation origins in south africa have been documented to show that the seasonal variation in 3h activity between summer and winter precipitation can be as high as 1 3 tu which has significant consequences for the long term prediction of 3h in groundwater van rooyen et al 2020a across all four countries the data was categorized into predominantly summer winter and all year precipitation areas depending on samples location to account for seasonality of 3h activity in precipitation fig 6c summer precipitation areas receive precipitation with elevated 3h activities and dominate most of the area except for the southwestern most extent of south africa subsequently the predicted initial recharge activity was adjusted up to 1 3 tu according to the rainfall area of the sample location as seen in van rooyen et al 2021 another major contributing factor to the variability of 3h in precipitation was the likelihood of ocean dilution and hence the proximity of the sample location to the ocean mair et al 2013 for this reason samples within 100 km of the coastline that experience the ocean dilution effect on initial 3h activity are corrected by increasing the 3h activity of measured samples by 1 tu as seen in van rooyen et al 2021 fig 6c 2 4 predicting the occurrence of mixing between modern and fossil groundwater the relationship between the mean residence time of groundwater and the activity of the chosen tracer where tracer activity decreases with an increase in mean residence time is non linear each residence time tracer has different input functions and decay rates resulting in different calculated mean residence times for the same sample depending on the chosen tracer cartwright et al 2017 the resultant calculated mean residence time is less than the actual mean residence time if groundwaters of different ages are mixed there are several possible explanations of different calculated mean residence times between tracers including 1 the mixing of modern and fossil components 2 heterogeneities in the aquifer that cause variable amounts of dispersion and 3 borehole screens sampling multiple water strikes and in turn hydrostratigraphic units instead of attempting to calculate mean residence times of mixed waters in an evidently complicated system this approach compares measured tracer abundance to predicted tracer abundance in order to assess if groundwater is mixed between modern and fossil components or not furthermore the calculated 14c age is reported as a potential range between corrected and uncorrected values as upper and lower limits due to the regional context of this study cannot isolate the degree and extent of if any open closed carbonate dissolution 3 results the compiled groundwater data in this study varies significantly between countries and decades 14c and 3h measurements mostly fall within the predicted ranges for each decadal time step collated data sampled in 1 south africa ranged from 8 6 to 118 5 pmc mean 69 10 n 304 for 14c and from 0 to 9 5 tu mean 1 07 n 304 for 3h 2 namibia ranged from 0 0 to 106 1 pmc mean 42 57 n 150 for 14c and from 0 to 5 3 tu mean 0 42 n 150 for 3h 3 botswana ranged from 6 44 to 106 8 pmc mean 75 10 n 125 for 14c and from 0 04 to 2 04 tu mean 0 38 n 125 for 3h and 4 mozambique ranged from 0 to 109 10 pmc mean 69 10 n 45 for 14c and from 0 to 7 00 tu mean 0 3 n 45 for 3h sample dates are not distributed equally between the four sadc countries and some studies only collected samples in one or two of the sampled decades samples from mozambique were all collected in the late 2010s and the majority of samples in botswana were collected in the 1990s and 2000s namibian samples were mainly collected from 1990 to 2010 and only south african samples are well distributed across all four decades samples collected in the 1 1980s ranged from 2 59 to 118 50 pmc mean 64 20 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 9 50 tu mean 1 15 tu for 3h 2 the 1990s data ranged from 0 to 110 30 pmc mean 47 08 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 7 tu mean 0 57 tu for 3h 3 the 2000s data ranged from 0 to 109 49 pmc mean 47 57 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 5 30 tu mean 0 46 tu for 3h and 4 the 2010s data ranged from 6 44 to 106 08 pmc mean 73 60 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 3 22 tu mean 0 48 tu for 3h corrected values of 14c and 3h were assessed against theoretical abundances predicted by lpm techniques the resultant comparisons suggest that almost half 49 of the sampled boreholes showed significant mixing between modern and holocene fossil groundwaters uncorrected 14c ages span a large range modern to 50 000 years mean 7760 years yet corrected ages using calculated q values predict ages from modern to 45 000 years mean 3340 years here the calculated mean residence times and percentage of mixed groundwater were summarized in terms of lithological zones associated with large rock and or alluvial aquifer systems fig 1 the highest percentage of mixed groundwater as well as the youngest ranges of calculated 14c mrt s were found in alluvial and primary fractured rock aquifers e g western coast of south africa and mozambique samples in the western cape province of south africa indicated that 50 0 of wells showed significant mixing between modern and holocene fossil groundwaters and average mrts range from 1420 corrected to 4550 uncorrected years old further north on the west coast of the northern cape province groundwater samples indicated that all wells 100 0 showed significant mixing and average mrts range from 1170 corrected to 4120 uncorrected years groundwater samples collected in the southern most province of mozambique indicated that all wells 100 0 showed significant mixing and average mrts range from 1020 corrected to 3430 uncorrected years the lowest percentage of mixed groundwaters were found in deep confined clay rich aquifers as well as layered coal bearing carbonate sequences e g orapa malwewe and serowe botswana groundwater samples collected in orapa indicated no significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 22 240 corrected to 28 580 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the malwewe and tsokwane areas in southern bostwana indicated that 20 0 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 6570 corrected to 12 270 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the mahathane serowe regions on the eastern border with zimbabwe indicated that only 6 7 of wells boreholes showed significant signs of mixing and had an average mrt range of 6220 corrected to 10 770 uncorrected years old the oldest average mrts were found in regions with low productivity calcareous rock aquifers and interlayered confined systems stampriet kalahari and meratswe valley aquifer systems groundwater samples in the transboundary stampriet aquifer which extends from namibia into south africa and botswana which was estimated to have 34 9 of wells boreholes that indicated significant mixing and average mrts that ranged from 15 704 corrected to 22 090 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the kalahari region in the south west of botswana indicated that 46 2 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 12 566 corrected to 18 500 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the meratswe valley region in central botswana indicated that 19 0 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 9330 corrected to 12 490 uncorrected years old groundwater indicating intermediate mixing proportions and mrt ranges were found in aquifers in central

showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 1040 corrected to 17 080 uncorrected years old 4 discussion the use of isotopic tracers to predict the occurrence of groundwater mixing between modern and fossil groundwaters is essential given the inherent difficulties associated with large scale numerical modelling of recharge baseflow and discharge however the occurrence distribution and longevity of modern groundwater is dependent on a myriad of environmental controls including climate fluctuations long term regional recharge patterns aquifer mechanics and anthropogenic practices cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2015 2012 jasechko et al 2017 specific care has been taken to conceptualise the presence of 14c dilution through open and closed systems in the study area as well as the effects of tritium variations in regional precipitation the modelled results are presented in the context of regional climate change water food security and sustainable development in the sadc although the model approach could be implemented in other regions around the globe 4 1 the dissolution of dead carbon the degree of open system dissolution across the four countries examined in this study differs significantly where south african n 201 of 304 and namibian n 46 of 125 samples are more clearly affected by open system conditions fig 8 this is likely caused by the high proportion of samples taken from secondary carbonate systems including carbonate rich sediments in otherwise silicate dominated aquifers e g the northern cape of south africa in samples with older ages it is difficult to assess the degree of open system dissolution as even when corrected under closed system conditions samples produce mean residence times that are typical for the region e g namibia and botswana it must also be noted that agricultural c3 crops could be large contributors to groundwater δ13c values in recharge as these regions can represent significant zones of recharge through irrigation in otherwise c4 dominated regions e g mozambique for samples less affected by open system conditions e g confined aquifers where 14c correction for closed system dissolution is appropriate q value corrections were applied n 433 of 624 calculated q values are representative of the distribution of carbonate bearing lithologies across sadc as well as the measured δ13c values that indicate significant dissolution fig 5 in silicate dominated aquifer systems the use of δ13c derived corrections is less likely to produce representative mrts even in environments where karstic systems and carbonate bearing aquifers are prevalent goldscheider et al 2020 stevanović 2018 the degree of open vs closed system dissolution could be made more accurate if coupled with another isotopic or geochemical measurement e g 87sr 86sr or hco3 cartwright 2010 cartwright et al 2013 4 2 the distribution of modern and fossil groundwater in southern africa the heterogeneity of recharge and flow paths combined with variable initial tracer abundances over time make large scale regional estimates of modern fossil groundwater mixing challenging hagedorn et al 2018 the methods used to predict the modern component in groundwater systems vary with scale and hence catchment scale quantitative investigations are ideal even so at larger scales isotopic investigations have proven to be useful for understanding groundwater sustainability when assessing macro distributions of modern groundwater proportions and recharge patterns gleeson et al 2016 the distributions of modern groundwater mixing predicted in this study show larger scale trends with higher proportions of mixing predicted for the southwest coast of south africa southeast coast of mozambique and most northern reaches of namibia fig 9 fig 9 regional rainfall distributions correlated with elevated percentages of mixed groundwater in mozambique and the western cape of south africa yet did not correspond with lower proportions of mixed groundwater on the northwest coast and inland rock aquifers of south africa this may be a result of contrasting groundwater environments where groundwater on the northwest coast is hosted in shallower shorter flow path regimes as opposed to the deep fractured systems in the highlands of south africa groundwater in central namibia and botswana have in general lower percentages of mixed groundwater and older fossil component residence times and this is likely the result of low precipitation rates high evaporation rates and less productive clay rich aquifer systems older mrts may also be a result of previously wetter climates experienced in the sadc as recharge in these areas has lessened relative to the total groundwater storage lee thorp et al 2001 a small portion of samples from namibia and botswana exhibited mrts that exceeded 50 000 years n 45 of 624 however the currently arid climate has been present for much of the holocene epoch suggesting that a larger proportion of the groundwater should represent older recharge such fossil components that exceed the longevity of 14c would be better constrained with a tracer of a longer half life e g 81kr half life 213 000 years or 36cl half life 301 000 years large aquifer systems e g the nubian and intercalaire aquifers in north africa and great artesian basin in australia have identified groundwater of ages much older than the capabilities of 14c determined with the use of 81kr suggesting there could be an older groundwater component in the sadc region that this study cannot constrain collon et al 2000 matsumoto et al 2020 voss and soliman 2014 predicted mixing proportions have a significant impact on the interpretation of mrts and in turn the availability of sustainable groundwater resources for agriculture and maintenance of the ecological reserve the central areas of south africa and bostwana are particularly dependent on groundwater to support agricultural activities giordano 2006 mukheibir 2008 puri and aureli 2005 leaving these regions which have a low percentage of mixed groundwater particularly vulnerable to groundwater depletion should the resource not be actively recharged at a rate equivalent to that of abstraction additionally botswana has a groundwater dependent ecology due to low surface water resources outside of the okavango delta which warrants prudence in the development of local groundwater resources timmermans and meijerink 1999 conversely some parts of northern namibia likely have an under utilized modern groundwater resource without considering groundwater quality as a result of less agricultural development in and around protected ecological reserves cunningham 1997 if predicted climate change reduced water availability in the central and southwest sadc the component of modern groundwater proportions are likely to decrease increasing the groundwater vulnerability of these areas van rooyen et al 2020b villholth et al 2013 as current predictions indicate significant climate shift over the sadc the proportions of modern groundwater infiltration will likely change accordingly yet the long term effects of this change are still poorly understood the distribution of mixed wells presented in this study show that although many aquifers have large proportions of fossil groundwater areas with high proportions of modern groundwater will likely be affected by changes in rainfall seasonality intensity and recharge potential associated with climate change areas with higher percentages of mixed wells should be the focus of new research and investigations into the effects of climate change on water security and sustainable development 4 3 model transferability and implications the proportions of mixed groundwater in wells boreholes predicted in this study give insight to regional groundwater resilience within the sadc where aquifers of high proportions of mixed groundwater and or younger mrts are likely renewing a larger portion of groundwater or at a higher rate as opposed to aquifers with low proportions of mixed groundwater and or older mrts the model presented in this study highlights the potential for 14c and 3h tracers to constrain the presence of modern groundwater mixing in data poor aquifers on a regional scale however the modelling approach would benefit from increased data availability and understanding of regional groundwater environments aquifers around the globe that have an abundance of groundwater data could implement a similar model framework to produce results that have an increased resolution of local aquifer components e g in australia atkinson et al 2014 hu et al 2019 tadros et al 2014 north china changming et al 2001 zhai et al 2013 north america scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 and north africa hamed et al 2014 voss and soliman 2014 the presence of extensive groundwater mixing in the wells investigated in this study suggest that these aquifers may be vulnerable to modern contaminants from surface processes jasechko et al 2017 the distribution of high percentages of modern groundwater mixing in well shows relatively good correlation with previous groundwater vulnerability estimates that identify the recharge of modern water as a contamination risk as well as an indicator of renewable groundwater musekiwa and majola 2013 van rooyen et al 2020b although the emphasis of this study was related to the sustainability of sadc groundwater the results are indicative of groundwater quality risks in the region as well furthermore the need for comprehensive isotope records is pertinent to the application of tracer studies for both groundwater quality and quantity assessments in the future 4 4 limitations of the model approach in this study modern fossil groundwater mixing predictions are implicitly dependent on the modelled abundance curve they were calculated from fig 4 it is evident from atmospheric and soil records that the bomb pulse has a significant impact on the predicted groundwater abundances of 14c and 3h these effects are less significant for predicted curves after the year 2000 when compared to the collated data in this study curves predicted using the renewal rate model cannot estimate mixing proportions as measured tracer abundance falls outside of the model thresholds fig 10 in contrast epm models predict tracer abundances that allow for the interpretation of a much larger portion of the collated data and can predict abundances in infinitely long groundwater flow paths fig 4 hence it is imperative that the appropriate groundwater flow model is selected before modelling mixing between modern and older groundwater components is undertaken similar tracer abundance investigations which comprise of different hydrogeology and across different spatial scales would benefit from numerically based groundwater flow predictions to supplement the lumped parameter models outlined in this study the indication of significant mixing in wells boreholes assessed in this study is dependent on the accurate prediction of 3h activity in recharge without the correction of ocean dilution and seasonal effects the occurrence of significant mixing may be over or underestimated by up to 8 although the mean discrepancy is 1 8 moreover the full 3h variability in precipitation is still poorly constrained across the sadc region samples collected in southern mozambique and the western cape province of south africa experienced the highest degree of ocean dilution van rooyen et al 2021 resulting in likely underestimated modern groundwater proportions fig 6 once corrected samples showed significant increases the percentage of mixed groundwater in sampled boreholes western cape from 42 to 50 and southern mozambique from 89 to 100 samples in botswana will likely reflect even lower proportions of mixed groundwater in wells boreholes if precipitation originates from continental recycling of moisture as this increases the 3h activity in recharge harms et al 2016 tadros et al 2014 corrections associated with the seasonality of rainfall are limited by the current understanding of summer vs winter precipitation distributions which may have changed significantly in the past century and are likely to continue to evolve with climate change roffe et al 2019 studies in areas with improved 3h data availability and continuity of records will benefit from more representative initial 3h predictions and in turn more representative predictions of groundwater mixing 5 conclusions assessment of the relationship between 14c and 3h can provide a clear distinction between modern and fossil components in groundwater in this study the construction of predicted abundance curves of 14c and 3h in groundwater from major aquifers within the sadc region provided the opportunity to assess actual 14c and 3h tracer abundances in the context of modern and older groundwater mixing groundwater within the extent of the study area was predicted to have extremely diverse proportions of mixed groundwater 0 6 100 mean 42 7 that correspond to a wide range of 14c derived groundwater mrts 500 28580 years areas of low proportions of mixed groundwater and older average mrt ranges are linked to areas of low mean annual rainfall as well as deep basement aquifers and clay rich aquifers of low productivity areas of higher proportions of mixed groundwater and younger average mrt ranges are synonymous with areas of relatively high mean annual precipitation as well as alluvial and fractured rock aquifers of higher productivity data compiled in this study indicate that simple renewal rate models from the atmospheric records alone cannot predict the activity of 14c and 3h and more representative groundwater flow models combined with soil records are necessary subsequently corrections for both 14c and 3h are necessary to calculate representative proportions of modern groundwater traditional 14c correction methods can be applied in aquifer systems where significant closed system dissolution is occurring and open system dissolution needs to be incorporated to avoid under estimating mean residence times the degree and rate of 14c dilution carries with it significant uncertainties and resultant ranges of mrts are substantial in older datasets where regional soil and rock δ13c data is not available spatial vegetation and geological maps are useful in assessing the degree of carbon dilution q value from open closed system dissolution of carbonate bearing lithologies yet the natural system is likely more complicated than outlined in this study the accuracy of modern groundwater mixing relationships is dependent on the variation of 3h in local rainfall over time which is in turn impacted by the seasonality of rainfall and the potential for ocean dilution furthermore modern recharge is not always mixing with older waters of the same mean residence time and the fossil groundwater component varies between aquifer systems the use of isotope tracers in particular 14c and 3h is appropriate in regions where groundwater sustainability is poorly constrained yet the model presented would benefit from specific records of local δ13c values in recharge and rock mass 3h 14c variability in precipitation and groundwater renewal and or flow rate credit authorship contribution

2802,this study combines historical records of 14c and 3h in the atmosphere and soil with renewal rate and groundwater lumped parameter models to predict the abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater over time 624 groundwater samples from numerous studies over four decades 1978 2019 in south africa namibia botswana and mozambique were collated to compare with predicted groundwater activities of 14c and 3h within the south african development community sadc region spatial datasets of carbonate bearing lithology c3 c4 vegetation summer winter rainfall and coastal proximity were used to apply corrections to 14c and 3h data corrected values of 14c and 3h were compared with the theoretical abundance of these tracers derived from the lumped parameter models to estimate the general mean residence times and presence of groundwater mixing between modern recharge and older groundwaters this study found that corrected values produced varying mean residence times derived from 14c ages 500 28500 years and a wide range of potentially mixed waters within each aquifer system 0 100 of tested wells across the study area the largest proportions of mixed groundwater as well as the youngest mean residence times were found in alluvial and primary fractured rock aquifers e g western coast of south africa and southern mozambique the smallest proportions of mixed groundwater were predicted in deep confined clay rich aquifers as well as layered coal bearing carbonate sequences e g orapa malwewe and serowe botswana insights into the proportions of mixed groundwater and mean residence times can help assess hydrological resilience on a regional scale such information is pertinent in promoting socio economic development and increased water food security in the sadc region by understanding the resilience of groundwater resources robust and informed strategies for water equality and gdp growth in the sadc region can be envisioned and implemented keywords radiocarbon tritium residence time sadc abbreviations sadc southern african development community data availability data included as appendix 1 introduction southern africa relies heavily on groundwater for sustaining water supply and food security as well as supporting ecosystem functioning particularly in arid regions matchaya et al 2018 villholth et al 2013 understanding the sustainability of groundwater abstraction as well as groundwater dependent systems requires understanding mean residence transit time and its differentiation from apparent groundwater age calculated from a single tracer gleeson et al 2012 turnadge and smerdon 2014 groundwater mean residence time as opposed to apparent groundwater age represents the average time the water has spent underground in an aquifer system isolated from the atmosphere or average transit time it takes into account that groundwater usually consists of different packages of water of different ages that get mixed within the groundwater system cartwright et al 2017 whilst an apparent groundwater age can be calculated with a single radioisotope groundwater mean residence time requires a more comprehensive assessment using multiple tracers with different decay rates however isotopically derived estimates are affected by more than just radioactive decay with local recharge patterns water rock interaction and groundwater mixing mechanisms all potentially affecting the calculation and interpretation of mean residence times depending on which isotope tracer is used atkinson et al 2014 bethke and johnson 2008 cartwright and morgenstern 2015 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 turnadge and smerdon 2014 the most commonly used isotopes in groundwater residence time studies are radiocarbon 14c and tritium 3h both of which are naturally produced by the interaction of cosmic radiation with atmospheric gases atkinson et al 2014 clark and fritz 1997 but which have very different half lives 5730 years for 14c and 12 43 years for 3h under simple groundwater flow conditions 3h decays out completely before any significant change in 14c the deviation from the expected decay curve relationship between 14c and 3h in groundwater usually caused by mixing younger and older groundwater allows for the assessment of 1 mixing relationships albeit only qualitatively as the apparent ages calculated from3h and 14c from two waters do not mix in a linear fashion and 2 a significant change in recharge rate as even a small amount of 3h would indicate modern recharge even if the 14c abundance is still relatively low in order to assess any deviation from the expected decay curve for a given time period of recharge initial tracer abundance a series of corrections would need to be applied for both 14c and 3h to derive the initial activities in recharge le gal la salle et al 2001 however correction methods typically need measured local input parameters although methods to assess the impact of dead carbon addition on groundwater age determination have already been developed hagedorn et al 2018 han and plummer 2016 kalin 2000 samborska et al 2013 these approaches are usually applied at a local scale where the necessary δ13c soil and rock data to perform a dilution correction can be measured from where the sample was taken similarly studies that use 3h to determine the presence of modern groundwater typically have local records of 3h in precipitation to constrain recharge values into groundwater mcmahon et al 2011 samborska et al 2013 zuber et al 2005 when using 3h and 14c data collected earlier than the year 2000 before understanding the necessary local data needed for determining corrected residence time estimates downscaled datasets of regional atmospheric soil and groundwater data must be developed as δ13c data is of interest to many other research disciplines cao et al 2020 farooq et al 2021 looman et al 2019 xia et al 2021 regional distributions of δ13c in soils and rocks are available and at high enough resolutions to apply corrections to local groundwater systems furthermore recent advances in our understanding of natural 3h levels in precipitation have allowed for the prediction of spatial distributions in 3h abundances in regional precipitation van rooyen et al 2020a visser et al 2018 to assess how effective regional correction approaches are models must be interrogated and compared to regions where local data is available through the use of lumped parameter modelling techniques this study uses 14c δ13c and 3h data to interpret the presence of groundwater mixing and the potential range of mean residence times of groundwater from four countries across the sadc region namely namibia south africa botswana and mozambique fig 1 a large database 624 samples of 14c and 3h activities from precipitation and groundwater samples collected between 1978 and 2019 was compiled and analysed to better understand 1 the degree of natural attenuation of bomb pulse 14c and 3h in the southern hemisphere 2 the applicability of 14c and 3h residence time correction methods over a large area and 3 the presence of modern recharge mixing with fossil groundwaters correction methods include 1 derived 14c abundance affected by dissolved inorganic carbon dic from carbonate dissolution in open and closed systems for large regions with diverse lithologies cartwright 2010 and 2 regions that receive variable 3h activities in modern rainfall through seasonality and proximity to the ocean van rooyen et al 2020a to apply regional corrections spatial data are grouped according to the abundance of carbonate bearing lithologies the distribution of c3 c4 vegetation proximity to the ocean and precipitation seasonality in each location and reported according to regional aquifers that samples were collected from fig 1 subsequently the theoretical abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater was predicted using renewal rate and groundwater flow models to better simulate attenuation decay and mixing in the natural environment in order to understand groundwater recharge resilience and vulnerability although this study was performed in southern africa the applicability of the model approach will grow as more areas of the world attenuate the bomb peak of 14c and 3h allowing for the comparison of groundwater tracer activities with natural atmospheric abundances understanding the residence time of groundwater has greater implications for long term water security food security and socio economic development particularly in developing countries with semi arid to arid climates united nations 2015 2 methodology the model approach used in this study predicts the presence of groundwater mixing and the potential range of mean residence times of regional aquifer systems by 1 compiling groundwater reference data from previous studies in the sadc region 2 constructing theoretical abundance curves of 14c and 3h in groundwater using atmospheric and soil records for determining the potential initial abundance in recharge 3 correcting the compiled groundwater 14c data for open and closed system carbonate dissolution and the compiled groundwater 3h data for variations in 3h activity in precipitation and 4 using the predicted abundance curves in groundwater to compare the corrected groundwater data for each decadal time step from 1980 to 2020 to determine the presence and degree of groundwater mixing associated with the calculated groundwater mean residence times fig 2 2 1 compilation of groundwater reference data 14c and 3h data from across namibia botswana mozambique and south africa were collated from published and unpublished literature appendix table a1 producing 624 data points appendix table a2 the data was collected largely from south african water resources commission wrc reports and from the internal stellenbosch university library archive using groundwater and radiocarbon as search keywords the collated database includes 540 samples with δ13c values for the correction of 14c data although sample dates were spread across several decades the data was not continuous and samples from each individual borehole were in every case only sampled once however the measured 14c and 3h concentrations were always analysed from the same sample the data was separated into four decadal groups 1980 1989 1990 1999 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 to account for the natural attenuation of the bomb pulse experienced in the southern hemisphere the data used in this study was compiled from data analysed at several different laboratories as a result the precision accuracy and detection limits of the analyses are variable the average standard deviation of measurement uncertainty for 14c pmc and 3h tu data are σ 0 90 and σ 0 22 respectively from 624 data points samples collected between 2000 and 2010 were analysed at a facility that had better precision and accuracy for 3h data 0 1 tu compared to 0 7 1 tu 2 1 1 geology and hydrogeology of large aquifer systems the spatial distribution of groundwater samples was clustered in the areas of interest of previous studies largely correlated to major rock and alluvial aquifers in the four countries from where the data was derived fig 1 groundwater samples n 47 located in the western cape province of south africa were mainly hosted in the table mountain group a fractured rock aquifer dominated by silicate host rocks this aquifer system is underlain by the less productive and lower quality malmesbury group shale aquifer where porosity is mostly secondary in nature and groundwater flow is often hosted in larger fault structures further north on the west coast of the northern cape province groundwater samples n 25 were typically hosted in shallower alluvial systems underlain by a fractured granitic aquifer system and the recharge mechanics are not well constrained benito et al 2010 watson et al 2021 samples collected in the northern reaches of the northern cape province n 183 were typically hosted in perched interspersed paleo river alluvial systems and deeper fractured rock aquifer systems underlain by basement granitoids groundwater samples collected from major inland rock aquifers in south africa and lesotho n 41 were hosted in fractured systems of sandstones and shales of the karoo supergroup confined by volcanic sequences of the drakensberg group with interspersed perched alluvial systems groundwater samples collected from the southern most maputo province of mozambique n 45 were hosted in two major hydrogeological regimes 1 low productivity basaltic and rhyolitic localized intergranular aquifers on the lebombo monocline and 2 large alluvial aquifers in valleys and floodplains sample locations in namibia were from three major systems 1 the transboundary stampriet aquifer comprised of interconnected sandstone and shale units that are interbedded with carbonate rich siltstones that extend across south africa and botswana n 67 2 north eastern low potential kalahari group aquifers comprised of interspersed calcareous rocks and perched alluvial systems n 47 and 3 northern limestone and dolomitic systems overlain by desert alluvials and salt pans n 43 specific sample locations in botswana were not disclosed in the original sources only local areas farms mines so samples are therefore grouped into the regions from where the studies were undertaken of which there were five 1 the kalahari region in the south west comprised of low productivity calcareous rocks and interspersed alluvial systems n 18 2 the malwewe and tsokwane areas in the south where localized alluvial and low productivity clay rich aquifers are dominant n 21 3 the meratswe valley region that has deeper 200 m fractured crystalline rock systems overlain by valley alluvial aquifers n 44 4 the orapa region dominated by deep confined clay rich sequences and interspersed fissured systems n 23 and 5 the mahathane serowe region that is a complex system of sandstones limestones and dolomites coal beds and fractured rock aquifers n 15 2 2 construction of 14c and 3h abundance curves for southern africa continuous temporal records of atmospheric and soil data associated with radionuclides especially in southern africa are scarce it was thus necessary to find a way to predict initial recharge activities of 14c and 3h across southern africa to do this historical atmospheric and soil data for 3h and 14c compiled from multiple sources were merged using a weighted moving average method that does not bias individual databases this method calculates the weighted moving average from the previous temporal dates to estimate the likely average activity over the study area as well as extrapolate for missing data in the temporal record subsequently theoretical groundwater recharge is modelled from established renewal rate methodologies le gal la salle et al 2001 for shallow systems and groundwater flow using the usgs developed tracerlpm software jurgens et al 2012 to ensure consistency with comparable groundwater flow investigations worldwide cartwright et al 2013 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 nimmo et al 2005 suckow et al 2018 turnadge and smerdon 2014 2 2 1 atmospheric and soil record atmospheric 3h data was collected from six global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip stations gough island windhoek lynwood marion island pretoria cape town and 14c data was compiled from established 14c records from wellington new zealand manning and melhuish 1994 and heidelberg germany levin et al 2013 1995 atmospheric records of 14c and 3h were extrapolated over years with no data to better constrain the likely bomb pulse signal in the southern african atmosphere over time fig 3 following the approach of cartwright et al 2013 data prior to the bomb peak is assumed to be similar to current ambient levels and modelled by using the 14c and 3h atmospheric records to be 110 pmc and 2 tu respectively while atmospheric variation in 14c is well documented soil zone variations remain convoluted the concentration of 14c in the soil zone is derived from root respiration and is a function of the oxidation of organic matter in the soils that is typically older than modern plant matter cartwright et al 2013 in order to successfully estimate soil zone 14c global records collected from jenkinson et al 1992 kuc et al 2004 and tipping et al 2010 were used and extrapolated to the modern day for the purposes of this study on this basis 14c in the soil zone ranged from 95 pmc before the bomb pulse to around 115 130 pmc in the early 1990 s and decreased to 110 pmc in the late 2000 s it is also noted here that the interpretation of 14c in soil as well as the unsaturated zone is likely more complicated than presented in this study meredith et al 2016 wood et al 2015 however without higher resolution data and knowledge of specific environmental parameters these uncertainties can only be mitigated in future research when localised records become available 2 2 2 modelled 14c and 3h concentrations in groundwater the rate of incorporation of 14c and 3h in recharge is similar and their relationship can be predicted over time for various recharge rates suckow et al 2018 the abundance of 14c and 3h in recharge is predominantly dependent on the atmospheric activities of individual tracers at the time of recharge in order to model this interaction le gal la salle et al 2001 developed a renewal rate model that treats the top few meters of an aquifer as a reservoir that feeds the aquifer below and is in turn renewed by recharge water the 14c or 3h concentration at time t c t can be predicted according to eq 1 by calculating the effect of new recharge c i that has distinct 14c and 3h values on the previous year s recharge c t 1 according to the proportion of water replaced r n and how much decay has occurred from a known decay constant λ 1 c t 1 r n c t 1 e λ r n c i assuming that aquifers have a range of potential annual recharge rates variable r n values as not all aquifers are recharged at the same rate the theoretical abundance of 14c and 3h in a groundwater body that has a constant r n can be predicted over time this renewal rate model is only applicable for a single well mixed homogenous zone and is likely only representative of the upper zone of an aquifer or near the recharge source however although this method is applicable in simple shallow systems it is likely not representative of regional groundwater conditions and or arid areas that receive episodic recharge to model recharge and flow of groundwater in regional and or arid aquifer systems an exponential piston flow model epm was used to predict the simplified evolution of tracer abundances in the groundwater system an appropriate lumped parameter model lpm was selected which is a mathematical model that determines the concentration of a tracer over a simplified groundwater flow path aquifer geometry and flow configuration is conceptualized to account for hydrodynamic dispersion or mixing within an aquifer well bore or discharge area lpms are generally used for determining ages for groundwater by including one or more residence time tracers and predicting mixing relationships of younger and older aquifer components the model used in this study was computed using tracerlpm a python vba coded package developed by the usgs jurgens et al 2012 using an adapted model that assumes a water sample from a borehole or well is a mixture of water from different lengths of flow paths with a range of residence times cook and böhlke 2000 maloszewski and zuber 1993 małoszewski and zuber 1982 this epm model can be described as 2 c t 0 c i t τ g τ e λ τ d τ where t is the time of observation τ is the transit time and e λ τ is the decay term of the tracer if it is not stable g τ is the system response function described in cook and böhlke 2000 and zuber et al 2005 and is given by 2a g τ 0 f o r τ t 1 f 2b g τ f t 1 e τ f t t 1 1 f f o r τ t 1 f where t is the mean residence time of the water and f is the ratio of exponential flow to piston flow in the total water flow f 0 represents piston flow and f 1 represents exponential flow exponential flow models were calculated using tracerlpm using three f ratios f 0 6 f 0 8 and f 1 that represent the typical range of exponential flow seen in unconfined and semiconfined aquifers morgenstern et al 2010 stewart 2012 zuber et al 2005 this f ratio is converted to an epm ratio in the software which controls the contribution of piston flow to exponential flow conditions as described in jurgens et al 2012 the program predicts the theoretical tracer tracer concentration of 3h and 14c in groundwater as a function of input and time lpms that predict tracer behaviour in groundwater are most accurate with long term data which is largely missing from southern africa and preferably some known physical constraints on diffusion potential lamontagne et al 2015 suckow et al 2018 for the purpose of this study an epm was used to simulate a flow system that continually receives new injections of recharge along its flow path this approach makes several simplifying assumptions 1 the same amount of recharge is received each year and in the same location thus even though flow paths are variable and of different residence time recharge rates are consistent 2 the interaction between aquitards and aquifers is negligible and does not affect the isotopic signature derived from recharge in a single aquifer 3 the aquifer behaves as one homogenous body transferring water with a constant hydraulic conductivity and 4 the proportion of mixing between young and old water is constant throughout the aquifer and does not change along the flow path based on calculated epms the predicted values for 14c and 3h in groundwater are significantly different for different decadal periods as a result of the bomb pulse and subsequent attenuation the predicted abundance curves produced from atmospheric records differ from those predicted with soil records when using the simple renewal rate model fig 4 a the epms have in general a lower abundance of 3h against 14c due to the decay of 3h in the unsaturated zone fig 4b as the renewal rate model is not representative of groundwater flow in larger and deeper aquifers only the exponential piston flow models were used to predict the occurrence of mixing fig 4b 2 3 correction of tracer activity in groundwater reference data the abundance of 14c and 3h in groundwater is not only a function of the atmospheric abundance recharge and subsequent decay but also other atmospheric vadose zone and geogenic processes that contribute to or dilute the apparent tracer abundance in order to interpret proportions of modern groundwater and fossil component ages that are representative of the natural system the compiled data was processed using two correction components these were the correction of 14c groundwater data for open and closed carbonate dissolution and 3h groundwater data for the variation of 3h activity in precipitation 2 3 1 open and closed system carbonate dissolution there are several geochemical models for the correction of the contribution of dead carbon during recharge and subsurface flow currently in use in modern hydrology essentially these models account for major carbonate reactions that occur in recharge and groundwater flow systems although more robust methods have been developed han et al 2012 plummer and glynn 2013 these approaches require more environmental data than is available for the study area the correction method employed here fontes and garnier 1979 ingerson and pearson 1964 can be summarized by a q value that is then entered as a correction term into the decay equation and represents the proportion of c derived by closed system dissolution of carbonate rock dilution factor described as 3 q δ 13 c sample δ 13 c carbonate δ 13 c recharge δ 13 c carbonate where sample is the measured δ13c value carbonate is the δ13c value for the local carbonate lithology recharge is the initial δ13c in the soil horizon and is largely controlled by root respiration processes and open system calcite dissolution in this study the potential dilution range of closed system dissolution was estimated by assigning δ13c ranges for carbonate and recharge from the distribution of c3 vs c4 dominant vegetation and carbonate bearing lithologies the compiled groundwater δ13c values in the dataset span the range of known values for c3 cam and c4 photosynthetic pathways in plants means of 25 17 and 14 respectively o leary 1988 and typical marine derived carbonate rock between 2 and 2 however the mean value of 8 75 median 8 40 with a standard deviation of 3 61 is skewed to more positive values than values produced through c4 photosynthesis suggesting that carbonate dissolution plays a significant role in diluting initial δ13c values and hence 14c activities across the sample locations fig 5 in order to constrain the degree of closed system carbonate dissolution the distribution of carbonate bearing lithology and initial δ13c values from vegetation type were assigned to each sample location the spatial distribution of carbonate dominated lithologies was compiled from regional geology maps by merging local carbonate bearing formations into 1 primary limestones and dolomites 2 secondary calcareous sedimentary rocks and 3 coal bearing lithologies for south africa johnson et al 2006 namibia mendelsohn 2002 botswana key and ayres 2000 and mozambique ruotoistenmäki 2008 fig 6 a photosynthetic pathways vary across southern africa from c3 cam dominated environments in the west to c4 dominated grasslands in the east the relative proportion of c4 cam c3 type vegetation in south africa which has recent published data varies significantly across the country particularly across winter and summer rainfall regions from 14 c4 in the south west to 67 c4 in the north east stock et al 2004 regional vegetation maps were used to estimate the likely dominance of c3 cam c4 plants at sample locations in south africa rutherford and mucina 2006 namibia mendelsohn 2002 botswana and mozambique rutherford et al 2005 fig 6b although vegetation maps are not at a uniform resolution between countries in this study the c4 proportion distribution showed close correlation to both local and larger scale studies of c3 c4 proportions in the sadc still and powell 2010 stock et al 2004 initial δ13c was predicted by assigning c3 c4 proportions from the spatial distribution of c3 c4 vegetation proportions 25 km 25 km to sample point locations fig 6b the likelihood of δ13c dilution was predicted through the presence of primary secondary and coal rich lithologies assigned to the spatial locations of samples subsequently a dilution line was drawn from the predicted initial δ13c soil value to the assumed rock δ13c value range predicted from local lithology to assess the degree of open closed system dissolution that has occurred fig 7 if the measured value fell to the left of the dilution line where decay is predominant the sample was corrected normally using the q value and the predicted 14c corrected residence time was used in the modern groundwater proportion prediction fig 7a if the measured value fell to the right of the dilution line then the q value correction was adjusted by the degree of open closed system dissolution based on the prevalence of local carbonate lithologies fig 7b if a sample is in a location with no presence of carbonate lithogies no correction is a applied and groundwater mixing is presumed the distribution and potential contribution of natural gas methanogenesis unsaturated zone processes and mantle derived co2 was not considered in this study this approach was only adopted due to a lack of regional soil carbonate rock and shallow groundwater δ13c data and is likely an over simplification of local systems meredith et al 2016 wood et al 2015 namibia and botswana had the highest proportion of samples taken in primary carbonate bearing lithologies 13 out of 150 samples and 11 out of 125 samples respectively followed by south african samples 18 out of 303 samples mozambique had no samples taken in carbonate bearing lithologies and this is likely a function of the narrow geographic range over which these samples were collected fig 6a a large number of south african and namibian samples are located in secondary carbonate bearing lithologies 167 out of 303 samples and 111 out of 150 samples respectively conversely a lower number of samples in botswana occur in secondary carbonate bearing lithologies 36 out of 125 samples and only 1 sample in mozambique 118 samples in south africa 44 in mozambique 26 samples in namibia and only 5 samples in botswana occur in areas where there are no carbonate lithologies present the only samples that occur in coal rich lithologies were found in botswana 52 out of 125 samples the distribution of δ13c values is plotted against measured 14c to show the potential dilution of initial 14c by dead carbon through open and closed carbonate dissolution given that initial δ13c is controlled by variable photosynthetic pathways fig 7 the degree of dilution is shown in the dilution lines between the known plant and rock contributions as q values calculated using eq 3 the resultant data produced a large range of q values 0 01 0 98 with a mean q value of 0 44 n 545 however the variability of q values is substantially less when interpreted in the context of the major aquifer systems delineated in this study the modal statistics of q values per system are summarised in table 1 although collating q values into the regional context mitigates smaller variances in local context it limits the resolution of calculated ages and mixing potential and localized studies will likely permit higher resolution results 2 3 2 3h variability in recharge corrections the temporal variation of 3h activity in precipitation is well documented in monthly gnip and other global records cauquoin et al 2015 harms et al 2016 li and si 2018 rozanski et al 2013 tadros et al 2014 zhai et al 2013 seasonality in 3h activity usually results in lower activities in precipitation in the winter months and higher activities in precipitation during the summer months mair et al 2013 van rooyen et al 2020a this trend is evident in areas where summer and winter precipitation are in general generated by different processes for example a large frontal system developing from the coastal areas to orographic precipitation inland as a result of moisture recycling distinct precipitation origins in south africa have been documented to show that the seasonal variation in 3h activity between summer and winter precipitation can be as high as 1 3 tu which has significant consequences for the long term prediction of 3h in groundwater van rooyen et al 2020a across all four countries the data was categorized into predominantly summer winter and all year precipitation areas depending on samples location to account for seasonality of 3h activity in precipitation fig 6c summer precipitation areas receive precipitation with elevated 3h activities and dominate most of the area except for the southwestern most extent of south africa subsequently the predicted initial recharge activity was adjusted up to 1 3 tu according to the rainfall area of the sample location as seen in van rooyen et al 2021 another major contributing factor to the variability of 3h in precipitation was the likelihood of ocean dilution and hence the proximity of the sample location to the ocean mair et al 2013 for this reason samples within 100 km of the coastline that experience the ocean dilution effect on initial 3h activity are corrected by increasing the 3h activity of measured samples by 1 tu as seen in van rooyen et al 2021 fig 6c 2 4 predicting the occurrence of mixing between modern and fossil groundwater the relationship between the mean residence time of groundwater and the activity of the chosen tracer where tracer activity decreases with an increase in mean residence time is non linear each residence time tracer has different input functions and decay rates resulting in different calculated mean residence times for the same sample depending on the chosen tracer cartwright et al 2017 the resultant calculated mean residence time is less than the actual mean residence time if groundwaters of different ages are mixed there are several possible explanations of different calculated mean residence times between tracers including 1 the mixing of modern and fossil components 2 heterogeneities in the aquifer that cause variable amounts of dispersion and 3 borehole screens sampling multiple water strikes and in turn hydrostratigraphic units instead of attempting to calculate mean residence times of mixed waters in an evidently complicated system this approach compares measured tracer abundance to predicted tracer abundance in order to assess if groundwater is mixed between modern and fossil components or not furthermore the calculated 14c age is reported as a potential range between corrected and uncorrected values as upper and lower limits due to the regional context of this study cannot isolate the degree and extent of if any open closed carbonate dissolution 3 results the compiled groundwater data in this study varies significantly between countries and decades 14c and 3h measurements mostly fall within the predicted ranges for each decadal time step collated data sampled in 1 south africa ranged from 8 6 to 118 5 pmc mean 69 10 n 304 for 14c and from 0 to 9 5 tu mean 1 07 n 304 for 3h 2 namibia ranged from 0 0 to 106 1 pmc mean 42 57 n 150 for 14c and from 0 to 5 3 tu mean 0 42 n 150 for 3h 3 botswana ranged from 6 44 to 106 8 pmc mean 75 10 n 125 for 14c and from 0 04 to 2 04 tu mean 0 38 n 125 for 3h and 4 mozambique ranged from 0 to 109 10 pmc mean 69 10 n 45 for 14c and from 0 to 7 00 tu mean 0 3 n 45 for 3h sample dates are not distributed equally between the four sadc countries and some studies only collected samples in one or two of the sampled decades samples from mozambique were all collected in the late 2010s and the majority of samples in botswana were collected in the 1990s and 2000s namibian samples were mainly collected from 1990 to 2010 and only south african samples are well distributed across all four decades samples collected in the 1 1980s ranged from 2 59 to 118 50 pmc mean 64 20 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 9 50 tu mean 1 15 tu for 3h 2 the 1990s data ranged from 0 to 110 30 pmc mean 47 08 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 7 tu mean 0 57 tu for 3h 3 the 2000s data ranged from 0 to 109 49 pmc mean 47 57 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 5 30 tu mean 0 46 tu for 3h and 4 the 2010s data ranged from 6 44 to 106 08 pmc mean 73 60 pmc for 14c and from 0 to 3 22 tu mean 0 48 tu for 3h corrected values of 14c and 3h were assessed against theoretical abundances predicted by lpm techniques the resultant comparisons suggest that almost half 49 of the sampled boreholes showed significant mixing between modern and holocene fossil groundwaters uncorrected 14c ages span a large range modern to 50 000 years mean 7760 years yet corrected ages using calculated q values predict ages from modern to 45 000 years mean 3340 years here the calculated mean residence times and percentage of mixed groundwater were summarized in terms of lithological zones associated with large rock and or alluvial aquifer systems fig 1 the highest percentage of mixed groundwater as well as the youngest ranges of calculated 14c mrt s were found in alluvial and primary fractured rock aquifers e g western coast of south africa and mozambique samples in the western cape province of south africa indicated that 50 0 of wells showed significant mixing between modern and holocene fossil groundwaters and average mrts range from 1420 corrected to 4550 uncorrected years old further north on the west coast of the northern cape province groundwater samples indicated that all wells 100 0 showed significant mixing and average mrts range from 1170 corrected to 4120 uncorrected years groundwater samples collected in the southern most province of mozambique indicated that all wells 100 0 showed significant mixing and average mrts range from 1020 corrected to 3430 uncorrected years the lowest percentage of mixed groundwaters were found in deep confined clay rich aquifers as well as layered coal bearing carbonate sequences e g orapa malwewe and serowe botswana groundwater samples collected in orapa indicated no significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 22 240 corrected to 28 580 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the malwewe and tsokwane areas in southern bostwana indicated that 20 0 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 6570 corrected to 12 270 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the mahathane serowe regions on the eastern border with zimbabwe indicated that only 6 7 of wells boreholes showed significant signs of mixing and had an average mrt range of 6220 corrected to 10 770 uncorrected years old the oldest average mrts were found in regions with low productivity calcareous rock aquifers and interlayered confined systems stampriet kalahari and meratswe valley aquifer systems groundwater samples in the transboundary stampriet aquifer which extends from namibia into south africa and botswana which was estimated to have 34 9 of wells boreholes that indicated significant mixing and average mrts that ranged from 15 704 corrected to 22 090 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the kalahari region in the south west of botswana indicated that 46 2 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 12 566 corrected to 18 500 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the meratswe valley region in central botswana indicated that 19 0 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 9330 corrected to 12 490 uncorrected years old groundwater indicating intermediate mixing proportions and mrt ranges were found in aquifers in central south africa and northern namibia samples collected in the northern cape of south africa indicated that 50 0 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 500 corrected to 4190 uncorrected years old groundwater collected from major inland rock aquifers in south africa and lesotho indicated that 44 4 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 1030 corrected to 4870 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected from the northern most aquifers of namibia indicated that 78 6 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 1820 corrected to 5560 uncorrected years old groundwater samples collected in the north eastern low potential kalahari group aquifers of namibia indicated that 29 5 of wells boreholes showed significant mixing and average mrts ranged from 1040 corrected to 17 080 uncorrected years old 4 discussion the use of isotopic tracers to predict the occurrence of groundwater mixing between modern and fossil groundwaters is essential given the inherent difficulties associated with large scale numerical modelling of recharge baseflow and discharge however the occurrence distribution and longevity of modern groundwater is dependent on a myriad of environmental controls including climate fluctuations long term regional recharge patterns aquifer mechanics and anthropogenic practices cuthbert et al 2019 gleeson et al 2015 2012 jasechko et al 2017 specific care has been taken to conceptualise the presence of 14c dilution through open and closed systems in the study area as well as the effects of tritium variations in regional precipitation the modelled results are presented in the context of regional climate change water food security and sustainable development in the sadc although the model approach could be implemented in other regions around the globe 4 1 the dissolution of dead carbon the degree of open system dissolution across the four countries examined in this study differs significantly where south african n 201 of 304 and namibian n 46 of 125 samples are more clearly affected by open system conditions fig 8 this is likely caused by the high proportion of samples taken from secondary carbonate systems including carbonate rich sediments in otherwise silicate dominated aquifers e g the northern cape of south africa in samples with older ages it is difficult to assess the degree of open system dissolution as even when corrected under closed system conditions samples produce mean residence times that are typical for the region e g namibia and botswana it must also be noted that agricultural c3 crops could be large contributors to groundwater δ13c values in recharge as these regions can represent significant zones of recharge through irrigation in otherwise c4 dominated regions e g mozambique for samples less affected by open system conditions e g confined aquifers where 14c correction for closed system dissolution is appropriate q value corrections were applied n 433 of 624 calculated q values are representative of the distribution of carbonate bearing lithologies across sadc as well as the measured δ13c values that indicate significant dissolution fig 5 in silicate dominated aquifer systems the use of δ13c derived corrections is less likely to produce representative mrts even in environments where karstic systems and carbonate bearing aquifers are prevalent goldscheider et al 2020 stevanović 2018 the degree of open vs closed system dissolution could be made more accurate if coupled with another isotopic or geochemical measurement e g 87sr 86sr or hco3 cartwright 2010 cartwright et al 2013 4 2 the distribution of modern and fossil groundwater in southern africa the heterogeneity of recharge and flow paths combined with variable initial tracer abundances over time make large scale regional estimates of modern fossil groundwater mixing challenging hagedorn et al 2018 the methods used to predict the modern component in groundwater systems vary with scale and hence catchment scale quantitative investigations are ideal even so at larger scales isotopic investigations have proven to be useful for understanding groundwater sustainability when assessing macro distributions of modern groundwater proportions and recharge patterns gleeson et al 2016 the distributions of modern groundwater mixing predicted in this study show larger scale trends with higher proportions of mixing predicted for the southwest coast of south africa southeast coast of mozambique and most northern reaches of namibia fig 9 fig 9 regional rainfall distributions correlated with elevated percentages of mixed groundwater in mozambique and the western cape of south africa yet did not correspond with lower proportions of mixed groundwater on the northwest coast and inland rock aquifers of south africa this may be a result of contrasting groundwater environments where groundwater on the northwest coast is hosted in shallower shorter flow path regimes as opposed to the deep fractured systems in the highlands of south africa groundwater in central namibia and botswana have in general lower percentages of mixed groundwater and older fossil component residence times and this is likely the result of low precipitation rates high evaporation rates and less productive clay rich aquifer systems older mrts may also be a result of previously wetter climates experienced in the sadc as recharge in these areas has lessened relative to the total groundwater storage lee thorp et al 2001 a small portion of samples from namibia and botswana exhibited mrts that exceeded 50 000 years n 45 of 624 however the currently arid climate has been present for much of the holocene epoch suggesting that a larger proportion of the groundwater should represent older recharge such fossil components that exceed the longevity of 14c would be better constrained with a tracer of a longer half life e g 81kr half life 213 000 years or 36cl half life 301 000 years large aquifer systems e g the nubian and intercalaire aquifers in north africa and great artesian basin in australia have identified groundwater of ages much older than the capabilities of 14c determined with the use of 81kr suggesting there could be an older groundwater component in the sadc region that this study cannot constrain collon et al 2000 matsumoto et al 2020 voss and soliman 2014 predicted mixing proportions have a significant impact on the interpretation of mrts and in turn the availability of sustainable groundwater resources for agriculture and maintenance of the ecological reserve the central areas of south africa and bostwana are particularly dependent on groundwater to support agricultural activities giordano 2006 mukheibir 2008 puri and aureli 2005 leaving these regions which have a low percentage of mixed groundwater particularly vulnerable to groundwater depletion should the resource not be actively recharged at a rate equivalent to that of abstraction additionally botswana has a groundwater dependent ecology due to low surface water resources outside of the okavango delta which warrants prudence in the development of local groundwater resources timmermans and meijerink 1999 conversely some parts of northern namibia likely have an under utilized modern groundwater resource without considering groundwater quality as a result of less agricultural development in and around protected ecological reserves cunningham 1997 if predicted climate change reduced water availability in the central and southwest sadc the component of modern groundwater proportions are likely to decrease increasing the groundwater vulnerability of these areas van rooyen et al 2020b villholth et al 2013 as current predictions indicate significant climate shift over the sadc the proportions of modern groundwater infiltration will likely change accordingly yet the long term effects of this change are still poorly understood the distribution of mixed wells presented in this study show that although many aquifers have large proportions of fossil groundwater areas with high proportions of modern groundwater will likely be affected by changes in rainfall seasonality intensity and recharge potential associated with climate change areas with higher percentages of mixed wells should be the focus of new research and investigations into the effects of climate change on water security and sustainable development 4 3 model transferability and implications the proportions of mixed groundwater in wells boreholes predicted in this study give insight to regional groundwater resilience within the sadc where aquifers of high proportions of mixed groundwater and or younger mrts are likely renewing a larger portion of groundwater or at a higher rate as opposed to aquifers with low proportions of mixed groundwater and or older mrts the model presented in this study highlights the potential for 14c and 3h tracers to constrain the presence of modern groundwater mixing in data poor aquifers on a regional scale however the modelling approach would benefit from increased data availability and understanding of regional groundwater environments aquifers around the globe that have an abundance of groundwater data could implement a similar model framework to produce results that have an increased resolution of local aquifer components e g in australia atkinson et al 2014 hu et al 2019 tadros et al 2014 north china changming et al 2001 zhai et al 2013 north america scanlon et al 2012 sophocleous 2005 and north africa hamed et al 2014 voss and soliman 2014 the presence of extensive groundwater mixing in the wells investigated in this study suggest that these aquifers may be vulnerable to modern contaminants from surface processes jasechko et al 2017 the distribution of high percentages of modern groundwater mixing in well shows relatively good correlation with previous groundwater vulnerability estimates that identify the recharge of modern water as a contamination risk as well as an indicator of renewable groundwater musekiwa and majola 2013 van rooyen et al 2020b although the emphasis of this study was related to the sustainability of sadc groundwater the results are indicative of groundwater quality risks in the region as well furthermore the need for comprehensive isotope records is pertinent to the application of tracer studies for both groundwater quality and quantity assessments in the future 4 4 limitations of the model approach in this study modern fossil groundwater mixing predictions are implicitly dependent on the modelled abundance curve they were calculated from fig 4 it is evident from atmospheric and soil records that the bomb pulse has a significant impact on the predicted groundwater abundances of 14c and 3h these effects are less significant for predicted curves after the year 2000 when compared to the collated data in this study curves predicted using the renewal rate model cannot estimate mixing proportions as measured tracer abundance falls outside of the model thresholds fig 10 in contrast epm models predict tracer abundances that allow for the interpretation of a much larger portion of the collated data and can predict abundances in infinitely long groundwater flow paths fig 4 hence it is imperative that the appropriate groundwater flow model is selected before modelling mixing between modern and older groundwater components is undertaken similar tracer abundance investigations which comprise of different hydrogeology and across different spatial scales would benefit from numerically based groundwater flow predictions to supplement the lumped parameter models outlined in this study the indication of significant mixing in wells boreholes assessed in this study is dependent on the accurate prediction of 3h activity in recharge without the correction of ocean dilution and seasonal effects the occurrence of significant mixing may be over or underestimated by up to 8 although the mean discrepancy is 1 8 moreover the full 3h variability in precipitation is still poorly constrained across the sadc region samples collected in southern mozambique and the western cape province of south africa experienced the highest degree of ocean dilution van rooyen et al 2021 resulting in likely underestimated modern groundwater proportions fig 6 once corrected samples showed significant increases the percentage of mixed groundwater in sampled boreholes western cape from 42 to 50 and southern mozambique from 89 to 100 samples in botswana will likely reflect even lower proportions of mixed groundwater in wells boreholes if precipitation originates from continental recycling of moisture as this increases the 3h activity in recharge harms et al 2016 tadros et al 2014 corrections associated with the seasonality of rainfall are limited by the current understanding of summer vs winter precipitation distributions which may have changed significantly in the past century and are likely to continue to evolve with climate change roffe et al 2019 studies in areas with improved 3h data availability and continuity of records will benefit from more representative initial 3h predictions and in turn more representative predictions of groundwater mixing 5 conclusions assessment of the relationship between 14c and 3h can provide a clear distinction between modern and fossil components in groundwater in this study the construction of predicted abundance curves of 14c and 3h in groundwater from major aquifers within the sadc region provided the opportunity to assess actual 14c and 3h tracer abundances in the context of modern and older groundwater mixing groundwater within the extent of the study area was predicted to have extremely diverse proportions of mixed groundwater 0 6 100 mean 42 7 that correspond to a wide range of 14c derived groundwater mrts 500 28580 years areas of low proportions of mixed groundwater and older average mrt ranges are linked to areas of low mean annual rainfall as well as deep basement aquifers and clay rich aquifers of low productivity areas of higher proportions of mixed groundwater and younger average mrt ranges are synonymous with areas of relatively high mean annual precipitation as well as alluvial and fractured rock aquifers of higher productivity data compiled in this study indicate that simple renewal rate models from the atmospheric records alone cannot predict the activity of 14c and 3h and more representative groundwater flow models combined with soil records are necessary subsequently corrections for both 14c and 3h are necessary to calculate representative proportions of modern groundwater traditional 14c correction methods can be applied in aquifer systems where significant closed system dissolution is occurring and open system dissolution needs to be incorporated to avoid under estimating mean residence times the degree and rate of 14c dilution carries with it significant uncertainties and resultant ranges of mrts are substantial in older datasets where regional soil and rock δ13c data is not available spatial vegetation and geological maps are useful in assessing the degree of carbon dilution q value from open closed system dissolution of carbonate bearing lithologies yet the natural system is likely more complicated than outlined in this study the accuracy of modern groundwater mixing relationships is dependent on the variation of 3h in local rainfall over time which is in turn impacted by the seasonality of rainfall and the potential for ocean dilution furthermore modern recharge is not always mixing with older waters of the same mean residence time and the fossil groundwater component varies between aquifer systems the use of isotope tracers in particular 14c and 3h is appropriate in regions where groundwater sustainability is poorly constrained yet the model presented would benefit from specific records of local δ13c values in recharge and rock mass 3h 14c variability in precipitation and groundwater renewal and or flow rate credit authorship contribution

2803,considering surface and subsurface interactions is imperative to predict water movement water quantity and quality in the environment however substantial execution time and over parameterization presently limit the applicability of integrated hydrologic models at larger scales herein a new efficient coupling routine for one dimensional 1d surface subsurface modeling was developed by externally coupling two widely used open source codes kineros2 k2 solves the 1d kinematic wave equation for overland flow and hydrus 1d h1d solves the richards equation for subsurface flow a novel approach combined with water balance and boundary condition switching is used to account for surface ponding and water exchange between the two model domains a weighting factor related to the surface water depth is used to assign the time series of exchange fluxes in one h1d profile to multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation this novel approach enables us to represent the entire subsurface below each overland flow plane by one vertical soil column with different soil layering when soil properties vary horizontally multiple soil columns can represent spatial heterogeneities the performance of the coupled h1d k2 model is examined by comparing simulation results with the hydrus 2d h2d model for six benchmark problems the solution s robustness stability and accuracy are

industrial domestic and agricultural users have increased by 600 over the past century due to population growth and economic development un world water development report 2018 climate change and anthropogenic activities have also influenced water quantity and quality haddeland et al 2014 for example climate change shifts precipitation patterns and increases the frequency of flooding and droughts vorosmarty et al 2000 managed aquifer recharge is a promising adaptation measure to reduce water vulnerability and maintain its sustainability niswonger et al 2017 sasidharan et al 2018 marwaha et al 2021 this water management approach can maximize water storage in groundwater aquifers and increase water supply during droughts niswonger et al 2017 kourakos et al 2019 however there are limitations in available modeling resources for exploring integrated flow processes and impacts associated with managed aquifer recharge programs climate change etc it is imperative to understand surface and subsurface water flow interactions to improve sustainable water resource management smith et al 2004 fan et al 2019 a large number of models have been developed to predict the hydrologic behavior of coupled surface and subsurface systems in response to human activity and climate variability woolhiser et al 1970 freeze 1972 smith and hebbert 1983 qu and duffy 2007 these hydrologic

comparison to empirical and lumped models physically based distributed hydrologic models are valuable tools for considering the full complexity of governing physiochemical processes singh and woolhiser 2002 smith et al 2004 fatichi et al 2016 and are capable of predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of water flow and pollutant transport at hillslope to watershed scales šimůnek 2015 kollet et al 2017 wen et al 2021 benchmark simulation cases ranging from simple homogenous cases with constant rainfall rates to more complex cases with subsurface heterogeneity and lateral flow have been utilized to compare the performance of different physically based distributed coupled integrated hydrologic models sulis et al 2010 smith et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 results illustrate that all models can reproduce general hydrologic behaviors of benchmark cases liggett et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 wen et al 2021 however fully integrated hydrologic models are computationally intensive require extensive parameterization and need substantial execution time these limitations restrict their applicability at large scales the surface subsurface coupling strategy determines the volume and rate of exchange of water between the two domains huang and yeh 2009 alters the rainfall runoff behavior such as peak flow and the onset of water ponding kollet et al 2017 and eventually affects the accuracy stability and robustness of a hydrologic model liggett et al 2012 coon et al 2020 because of the faster dynamics of surface flow compared to subsurface flow coupling strategies are broadly classified into three categories continuous pressure first order exchange i e the exchange flux is determined by a calibrated coefficient and the head difference between the surface and subsurface nodes and hybrid approaches e g boundary condition bc switching and regularization penalty methods huang and yeh 2009 coon et al 2020 the continuous pressure approach enforces pressure continuity in the two domains kollet and maxwell 2006 but rapid changes in surface pressure can cause numerical instabilities at the subsurface boundary huang and yeh 2009 liggett et al 2012 de maet et al 2015 the convergence is especially poor near the transition from dry surface to surface ponding coon et al 2020 in addition the same time step must be used for solving the surface and subsurface equations simultaneously which greatly increases the associated computational cost because smaller time steps are required for surface water flow huang and yeh 2009 de maet et al 2015 in contrast a conceptual interface is considered to represent the connectivity between the surface and subsurface in the first order exchange approach i e ebel et al 2009 liggett et al 2012 this coupling approach allows surface and subsurface equations to be solved separately panday and huyakorn 2004 and the exchange water flux through the interface layer is obtained as the product of the pressure difference in the two domains and an exchange coefficient qu and duffy 2007 liggett et al 2012 a properly calibrated exchange coefficient can enhance the solver convergence and produce similar results to the pressure continuity approach liggett et al 2012 the bc switching approach calculates infiltration rates for stages with and without surface ponding camporese et al 2010 camporese et al 2014 the subsurface flow equation is first solved for the atmosphere controlled bc i e specified time dependent water fluxes and then a mass balance calculation is performed to determine the ponding condition at each surface node once surface ponding occurs the land surface bc is switched from an atmospheric controlled bc to a soil controlled bc i e specified time dependent pressure sulis et al 2010 the bc switching approach causes a time lag between surface and subsurface flows on an overland plane influencing the onset of runoff generation and the movement of the saturation front when inflow occurs uphill sulis et al 2010 de maet et al 2015 introduced a hybrid coupling approach that combines the continuous pressure and first order exchange approaches this hybrid coupling approach can produce similar results to the first order exchange approaches and improve the scheme s robustness although current coupled integrated hydrologic models reproduce similar hydrographs huang and yeh 2009 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 the impact of coupling approaches has not been extensively examined under the complex boundary conditions that occur during multiple rainstorms furthermore the application of existing coupled models to large scale problems is limited due to simplified representation of the subsurface and empirical formulations for infiltration estimation giráldez and woolhiser 1996 singh and bhallamudi 1998 or high computational burden morita and yen 2002 the computational burden is a significant obstacle that limits the implementation of hydrological models at larger scales the numerical solution of the richards equation usually requires fine spatial grids and small time steps which greatly increase the computation cost niswonger et al 2006 šimůnek et al 2006 small time steps are required to overcome numerical instabilities at the subsurface boundary due to rapid changes in surface pressure huang and yeh 2009 liggett et al 2012 much effort has been devoted to improving the computational efficiency of integrated hydrologic models including parallel computing kollet and maxwell 2006 brunner and simmons 2012 automatically adjusting time step size panday and huyakorn 2004 simunek et al 2005 sulis et al 2010 goodrich et al 2012 nested discretization wang et al 2018 and dimensionality reduction niswonger et al 2006 seo et al 2007 brunetti et al 2018 different for overland and subsurface flow and automatically adjusted time steps can significantly enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the coupled models roberts 2003 simuunek et al 2005 goodrich et al 2012 alternatively dimensionality reduction of the surface and subsurface flow domain can provide a comparative advantage as unsaturated flow is predominantly vertical mantoglou 1992 a single or multiple vertical soil profiles representing one dimensional 1d water flow in the vadose zone can be coupled to a 1d overland flow plane this simplification and dimensionality reduction could reduce computational time compared to variably saturated flow simulations in 2d or 3d panday and huyakorn 2004 niswonger et al 2006 seo et al 2007 several conjunctive surface subsurface models have been developed to simulate the overland flow on a plane with 1d or 2d overland flow and 1d 2d or 3d flow in the vadose zone smith and woolhiser 1971 abbott et al 1986 singh and bhallamudi 1998 morita and yen 2002 panday and huyakorn 2004 thompson et al 2004 he et al 2008 large scale coupled hydrologic models such as mike she thompson et al 2004 and modflow2000 h1d seo et al 2007 beegum et al 2018 are examples of this dimensionality reduction approach the general objective of this study is to develop a simple accurate and computationally efficient coupled hydrologic model for overland flow and variably saturated flow through the vadose zone at the hillslope scale two existing open source 1d codes are coupled for this purpose kineros2 referred to below as k2 smith et al 1999 goodrich et al 2012 for overland flow and hydrus 1d referred to below as h1d simunek et al 2016 for vertical water flow in the vadose zone the specific objectives are i to develop a novel coupled h1d k2 model to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and improve the computational efficiency ii to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model by comparing its results with the two dimensional version of hydrus 2d 3d referred to below as h2d on six benchmark problems and iii to investigate the roles of a rainstorm size and frequency slope bottom bc and soil heterogeneity on the surface and subsurface water flow we pose the following hypotheses i the coupled h1d k2 model accurately represents the surface subsurface water flow in response to multiple rainfall storms compared to h2d ii computational time can be reduced by applying one h1d soil profile to an overland flow plane rather than to each individual surface node and iii subsurface heterogeneity and bottom bc affect the runoff generation mechanism pattern and magnitude while the slope magnitude impacts the timing of the hydrograph and volume of cumulative runoff 2 hydrologic models and setups to achieve these objectives a novel approach was developed to externally couple two well established and widely used open source codes to simulate hydrologic processes at the surface and in the subsurface using a matlab r2021b script the k2 model simulates 1d overland flow via the kinematic wave equation goodrich et al 2006 and h1d simulates 1d variably saturated flow in the subsurface simunek et al 2005 simunek et al 2016 to evaluate the model performance we compared the simulation results of the h1d k2 model with the h2d model that includes an overland flow routine šimunek 2003 simunek 2015 the h2d model outputs are used as a reference for model comparison because the model is physically based solves the richards and kinematic wave equations simultaneously and does not reduce the problem s dimensionality contrary to the coupled h1d k2 model the conceptual models for h2d and coupled h1d k2 are presented in fig 1 c and 1d respectively 2 1 coupled h1d k2 model the kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros2 k2 is a widely used and open source watershed model representing a watershed by a cascade of overland flow planes and channels smith et al 1999 goodrich et al 2012 the overland flow is described using the kinematic wave approximation of the saint venant equations assuming uniform flow and a friction slope approximately equal to the plane slope woolhiser et al 1970 giráldez and woolhiser 1996 the kinematic wave solution is accurate for most overland flow conditions woolhiser and liggett 1967 goodrich et al 2012 the kinematic wave equation can be expressed as follows 1 h t q x q x t where h is the surface water depth m t is time s x is the distance coordinate over the plane m q is the discharge per unit width m2 s and q x t is the change of the lateral inflow rate m s which is equal to local precipitation rate minus local infiltration and evapotranspiration rates discharge per unit width q is related to the surface water depth h by a simple power relation giráldez and woolhiser 1996 2 q α h m where parameters α m1 3s 1 and m are related to the slope surface roughness and flow conditions laminar or turbulent flow the manning hydraulic resistance law is commonly used to obtain the parameter α 3 α k n s 1 2 a n d m 5 3 where s is the slope and n is a manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow m1 3s 1 k is a unit conversion factor between international system si and english units k 1 m1 3 s 1 for si units and 1 49 ft1 3 s 1 for english units the k2 model has been applied to investigate the processes of interception infiltration runoff generation erosion and sediment transport up to five particle sizes for individual rainfall runoff events giráldez and woolhiser 1996 goodrich et al 2006 guber et al 2014 meles bitew et al 2020 infiltration is described using an equation for cumulative vertical infiltration into a homogeneous infinite soil profile with uniform initial moisture content parlange et al 1982 the k2 model can also consider a two layer soil profile without a bottom boundary condition to represent differences in soil texture in the subsurface k2 cannot simulate saturation excess overland flow fig s5 because it assumes an infinitely deep soil profile furthermore the k2 model does not provide information on the spatial and temporal variability of water content and neglects evaporation these limitations restrict the ability of the k2 model to investigate surface subsurface connectivity to overcome the above discussed limitations we have developed a novel coupling approach to replace the empirical infiltration equation in the k2 model with the physically based h1d model h1d simulates 1d variably saturated water flow in the vadose zone by numerically solving the richards equation fig 1d and using realistic bcs at the soil profile bottom simunek et al 2005 evapotranspiration processes are accounted in h1d but are not considered in this paper since their impact on the runoff generation is relatively small for the considered time scales the total simulation time is divided into multiple periods δtp which are usually larger than the individual time steps δti for solving the surface and subsurface equations furthermore convergence conditions are employed to automatically adjust time steps in both the h1d simunek et al 2005 and k2 goodrich et al 2012 models to improve computational efficiency one soil profile is used to represent the entire subsurface domain when soil characteristics do not vary horizontally but may change in the vertical direction when soil properties vary horizontally the overland flow plane is divided into multiple sections each connecting to one soil type fig 1d a matlab script executes the h1d and k2 codes sequentially a series of matlab functions read and write the input and output files initialize local and global variables and update exchange information at a selected δtp fig 2 shows a flowchart depicting the coupling approach in the h1d k2 model this coupling sequence is summarized below 1 the h1d code is executed with the applied land surface bcs i e rainfall evaporation to obtain the actual infiltration and evaporation rates the land surface bc of each h1d soil profile is determined using the surface water depth calculated in the previous δtp if there is no ponding an atmospheric bc is used when water starts ponding at the soil surface the land surface bc is switched from an atmospheric bc to a constant pressure head bc the corresponding pressure head value is equal to the average water depth of surface nodes in an overland flow plane if multiple h1d soil profiles are set a loop is employed to estimate infiltration for each soil profile fig 2 2 a water balance considering infiltration rainfall evaporation and ponded water is performed to determine if the soil infiltration capacity qsoil exceeds the water supply qsupply the sum of rainfall inflow from a neighboring plane and ponded water minus evaporation when the pressure head bc is imposed the infiltration volume over a δtp is controlled by qsoil rather than by water supply and calculated cumulative infiltration may be larger than qsupply the pressure head bc will overestimate infiltration when the soil infiltration capacity exceeds the water supply the pressure head bc for the subsurface equation is therefore switched to an atmospheric bc if this exceedance occurs the h1d code will maintain water balance when using an atmospheric bc that considers the actual infiltration rate and the maximum water supply volume during δtp the potential surface flux q surf is set equal to rainfall rate qr plus the ponding water contribution given as 4 q s u r f t q r t j 2 nk h j t nk 1 δ t p where h j t is the time series of surface water depths at the surface node and j is the surface node number starting from node 1 and ending with node nk note that the second term on the right side of eq 4 gives the mean surface water depth for all surface nodes j 1 2 nk divided by the δtp the subsurface equation is then solved with the surface water depths at the previous time as an initial condition and the new specified flux bc the criterion used to stop each iteration cycle is the difference between cumulative infiltration and cumulative water supply over the time interval being less than 10 6 m2 3 the time series of net surface flux ql j t i e the difference between rainfall evaporation and actual infiltration generated by the h1d is then applied to the corresponding surface nodes in the k2 code when rainfall is larger than actual infiltration positive ql is redistributed at the land surface and routed down over the overland flow plane in the case of negative ql ponded water infiltrates into the subsurface and its absolute value is subtracted from the surface storage of each surface node while solving the surface water routing equation note that ql j t in an h1d profile corresponds to vertical inflow from multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation fig 1d therefore a new method is used to assign the time series of ql j t in the overland plane a weighting factor is calculated as a ratio of the surface water depth at each surface node and the average surface water depth of an entire plane at the end of the previous δtp it is reasonable to assume that cumulative infiltration into the soil with a higher ponding depth is larger than the one with a smaller ponding depth when the surface water depth at a surface node is zero ql j t is zero as well additionally the k2 code was modified to save and initialize local and global variables with the previously calculated results so that ql j t is applied to the corresponding surface nodes the net surface flux is obtained by 5 q l j t q r t q i t i f q r t q i t h j t j 2 nk h j t nk 1 q r t q i t i f q r t q i t where qi is the infiltration rate 4 the k2 code is executed to calculate lateral water flow on the land surface while considering the feedback of the subsurface hydrological processes surface water depths at each surface node and the outflow rate from the overland plane are simulated during δtp 5 calculated pressure heads are set as the initial condition for the h1d computation at the next δtp the information on water depths is updated for the k2 after that a temporal loop is executed until the total simulation time ti reaches the final time tmax 2 2 hydrus 2d h2d model with an overland flow routine the h2d version 3 model with an overland flow routine was used to simulate runoff at the land surface and water infiltration and redistribution processes in the vadose zone šimunek 2003 simunek 2015 water flow in the vadose zone is described using the richards equation while the overland flow is described using the kinematic wave equation eq 1 the water exchange rate between the surface and subsurface domain is represented using the source term in the surface flow equation eq 1 while the applied land surface bcs account for the effects of surface water conditions on subsurface flow the soil hydraulic functions of van genuchten 1980 are used to obtain unsaturated soil hydraulic properties the atmospheric bc with surface runoff is applied on the land surface to reflect the surface conditions and bc switching between the variable pressure head and the atmospheric controlled conditions i e precipitation and evaporation are implemented to represent ponding or no ponding conditions respectively at any given time step the subsurface equation is solved first for prescribed initial conditions and an atmospheric bc after that a water balance calculation is performed to calculate the exchange flux and distribute it to separate surface and subsurface nodes once surface ponding is reached at any surface node once qsoil is smaller than ql j t overland flow is generated the surface water is routed to the lower parts of the hillslope via a kinematic wave equation when water is ponded at the soil surface the land surface bc is switched to a variable pressure head bc surface water depths at each surface node are updated at each time step the output information is printed for each node where the overland flow becomes active details concerning the theory numerical solution techniques and example applications of h2d are given by šimunek and van genuchten 2008 and kohne et al 2011 3 benchmark cases the hydrological processes on a hillslope with a length l of 400 m and subsurface thickness of 1 m fig 1a were simulated and compared using the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models the subsurface was discretized into 100 finite elements with the mesh size varying from 0 0053 m near the soil surface to 0 012 m at the soil bottom the horizontal mesh size was 2 m for the h2d model and 10 m for the k2 model the total number of surface nodes was 41 in the k2 model the first surface node was used to receive inflow from uphill not considered in this study finer horizontal discretization was used in the h2d model because coarse 2 m spatial discretization causes numerical oscillation problems for the heterogenous hillslope with a steep slope the subsurface spatial heterogeneity in the horizontal direction determines the number of h1d profiles at least three h1d soil profiles were needed to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in fig 3 b and 3c for the model with three soil profiles the uphill middle and downhill h1d soil profiles correspond to 15 10 and 15 surface nodes respectively for the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles each surface node relates to one h1d soil profile furthermore an analytical solution of overland flow on an impermeable plane served as a base case to evaluate the model performance the subsurface with the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 10 11 m min was assumed to be impermeable and modeled results were compared with the analytical solution the performance of the coupled h1d k2 code was tested against h2d for homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions with horizontally different saturated hydraulic conductivities ks initial water content distributions bottom bcs i e no flow and free drainage slope ratios and rainfall intensities and durations detailed model setups are listed in table 1 four slopes 0 0005 0 001 0 0025 and 0 01 were selected to test the impact of the surface flow speed on infiltration and overland flow while two bottom bc types were employed to test the feedback between the subsurface and surface flow processes the bottom bc is used to represent the exchange flux between the vadose zone and groundwater the no flow bc represents an impermeable bottom layer while the free drainage bc allows for water to drain from the bottom of the soil profile by gravity simunek et al 2005 time step and iteration criteria settings in the h1d and h2d models were the same to obtain comparable results the pressure head and water content tolerances were equal to 0 01 m and 0 001 respectively the initial pressure head distribution was assumed to be hydrostatic equilibrium with a given top pressure head the same initial pressure head distribution was used for both the h1d and h2d models both initial and minimum time steps were set at 10 6 min and the maximum time step was set to 1 min the maximum number of iterations was equal to 10 all simulations were carried out for 300 mins except for cases with multiple rainstorms 1200 mins the rainfall rate was applied for 200 mins followed by 100 mins of recession qr 0 for the coupled h1d k2 model the duration of water exchange δtp between surface and subsurface varied from 2 to 100 mins depending on the slope and heterogeneity of the overland plane simulation outputs were reported at a one min interval the van genuchten parameters are listed in table 1 the performance of the coupled h1d k2 code was evaluated by comparing its results with the output of the h2d model including the time series of outflow rates surface water depths at three observation points h 1 h 2 and h 3 shown in fig 3 and the surface water storage furthermore the relative mass balance error mbe evaluated the errors caused by the coupling strategy and numerical methods used in the two domains the relative mbe was computed for the entire hillslope domain using the following equation 6 re l a t i v e m b e 0 t max q r t q e t q d t d t l 0 t max q out t d t δ q surf δ q sub 0 t max q r t d t where δqsurf m2 and δqsub m2 are the changes in the surface and subsurface storages over the total simulation time respectively qe is the evaporation rate m min qd is the drainage at the soil profile bottom m min and qout is the outflow rate m2 min the ability of the coupled h1d k2 model to predict spatial and temporal water content distributions depends on the number of vertical soil profiles employed we therefore simulated and compared three models h2d served as a reference the coupled h1d k2 model with one for a homogeneous case or three for a heterogeneous case soil profiles and the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles kriging interpolation with a linear semi variogram model was used to estimate the water content distribution water content variations with depth and time were also compared to evaluate vadose zone flow figs s1 and s2 to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed h1d k2 model over a wide range of conditions we simulated and compared outflow rates and cumulative runoffs for 32 cases with those obtained by the h2d model the detailed descriptions of the sensitivity analysis the related results and the discussion are given in the supporting material fig s3 in general simulation results show that the coupled h1d k2 model can accurately and efficiently simulate the surface and subsurface hydrological processes on a hillslope under scenarios with different spatial heterogeneities fig 3 slopes i e 0 0005 0 001 0 0025 and 0 01 and bottom bcs i e no flow and free drainage the overland flow plane connecting one homogeneous cases and three heterogeneous cases h1d profiles with different soil layering can capture the general hydrological behavior at the surface and in the subsurface fig s3 which is similar to the results of integrated hydrologic models used in previous studies e g simunek 2003 sulis et al 2010 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 under a uniform rainfall storm the runoff pattern was sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity while its magnitude was related to the drainage condition at the bottom fig s3 3 1 runoff generation on a homogeneous hillslope with uniform rainfall two homogeneous and isotropic planes with impervious and pervious soils and a slope of 0 0005 were used to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff in response to uniform rainfall for the coupled h1d k2 model one soil profile was used to simulate water flow in the subsurface table 1 the rainfall rate q r 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins followed by 100 mins of recession qr 0 m min the total simulation time was 300 mins table 1 an analytical solution of the kinematic wave equation on an impervious rectangular plane gottardi and venutelli 1993 was used to compare simulated outflow rates using the coupled h1d k2 and h2d models the parameters used in the analytical solution base case are listed in table 1 the detailed information including the mathematical equation parameters and bcs can be found in gottardi and venutelli 1993 and jaber and mohtar 2003 the mechanism for runoff generation is mainly classified into two types saturation excess dunne runoff and infiltration excess horton runoff smith and woolhiser 1971 fatichi et al 2016 for the dunne runoff surface ponding occurs after the soil saturates and water fills the subsurface storage to realize this runoff generation mechanism the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 6 94 10 4 m min was specified to be larger than the rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min three simulations with different depths of the initial water table iwt were tested table 1 conversely for the hortonian overland flow the surface ponding occurs when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate ks qr three simulations with the same iwt depth of 1 m and different ks 6 94 10 5 m min 6 94 10 6 m min and 6 94 10 11 m min were considered 3 2 runoff generation on a heterogenous hillslope a hillslope transect with two soil materials was simulated to consider spatial heterogeneity of subsurface hydraulic properties on the runoff generation to demonstrate the robustness of the coupled h1d k2 model we considered two heterogeneous cases in which high or low permeability zones are near the surface 0 0 05 m compared to the rest of the soil materials heterogeneous case 1 similar to a test problem introduced in šimunek 2003 uses a high permeable near surface 0 05 m middle section fig 1d and 3 with a ks value of 6 94 10 4 m min that is two orders of magnitude higher than the rest of the uniform subsurface with a k s of 6 94 10 6 m min heterogeneous case 2 is similar to kollet and maxwell 2006 with a low permeable near surface 0 05 m soil in the middle of the hillslope and a k s value two orders of magnitude smaller 6 94 10 6 m min than the remaining soil ks 6 94 10 4 m min both heterogeneous cases employed three h1d soil profiles to describe subsurface water flow in the hillslope s uphill middle and downhill sections see fig 1b and s1 the length of the middle section was 100 m while it was 150 m for both uphill and downhill sections a rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins followed by the 200 mins of recession qr 0 m min the slopes were 0 01 and 0 0005 for case 1 and case 2 respectively free drainage and no flow bcs were applied at the bottom of the soil profiles in case 1 and case 2 respectively these two benchmark cases have been used in the intercomparison of integrated hydrologic models e g sulis et al 2010 simunek 2015 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 3 3 runoff generation on a homogeneous hillslope with multiple rainstorms four different configurations slopes of 0 0005 and 0 01 and no flow and free drainage bottom bcs with multiple rainstorms were considered to examine the stability of the coupled h1d k2 model the rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins then decreased to 1 0 10 4 m min for the next 200 mins followed by 200 mins of recession qr 0 m min the rainfall events were repeated in the next 600 mins the total simulation time was 1200 mins the soil was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic with a ks of 6 94 10 5 m min the h1d k2 model only employed one soil profile to represent vadose zone flow in these simulations table 1 4 results 4 1 surface runoff over a homogeneous subsurface with a uniform rainfall rate simulation results for the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models have excellent agreement with the analytical solution for the low permeability subsurface 6 94 10 11 m min fig 4 a and saturated condition fig 4b the average errors were less than 0 5 in both cases simulated outflow rates for the h2d and h1d k2 models were in good agreement for both infiltration excess fig 4a and saturation excess fig 4b conditions differences were less than 0 9 in outflow rates and less than 0 5 in the cumulative outflow 4 2 surface runoff over a heterogeneous hillslope with a uniform rainfall rate 4 2 1 heterogeneous case 1 the hydrograph simulated by the h2d model fig 5 a shows that outflow began at 3 8 mins experienced a steep increase to 6 52 10 4 m2 s remained constant until the arrival of the second wave at 145 mins and then gradually increased and reached peak flow 6 99 10 4 m2 s after rainfall stopped t 200 mins the outflow rate decreased gradually to zero at 229 mins similar outflow rates were obtained for case 1 by the coupled h1d k2 model when a high permeability zone was placed near the surface in the middle section of the hillslope the onset and cessation of surface runoff were almost identical for the three hydrological models simulated surface water depths at observation points h 1 and h 3 were almost identical for all three models fig 5b the biggest difference occurred in predicting the onset of water ponding at h2 node located on the high permeability section of the hillslope the corresponding values for the h2d model the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles and the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles were 92 mins 82 mins and 122 mins respectively the maximum differences in the surface water depth were less than 0 2 mm among the three models table 2 shows that differences in simulated water balance components of heterogeneous case 1 were very small among the three models compared to the results produced by h2d peak flow predicted by the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 and three soil profiles was approximately 8 0 higher while the cumulative outflow was quite similar 2 2 3 4 difference the shortest computation time was for the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles 21 36 s followed by the h2d model 32 49 s while the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles had the longest computation time 321 74 s fig 6 demonstrates similar subsurface water content distributions simulated by the three models in response to the rainfall runoff processes in case 1 since the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the lower and upper sections of the hillslope water ponding occurs quickly in these two sections and is routed downslope either off the hillslope or to the midsection fig 6a as rainfall intensity does not exceed the infiltration capacity of the midsection no ponding due to rainfall occurs instead the ponded water from the upper part of the hillslope was routed downslope and infiltrated into the subsurface in the midsection causing earlier arrival of the saturation front in the middle section of the hillslope with higher permeability after the cessation of the rainfall water drained out from the bottom of the soil profile causing a decrease in the water content the h2d model and the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles very well reproduced the overland and subsurface water movement behavior conversely as expected only the horizontally averaged saturation front characteristics were captured in the middle section by the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles where this section was represented by only one soil profile although this model significantly simplifies the real conditions it could produce the overall hydrological behavior of this entire system e g outflow rate and peak average subsurface saturation sufficiently well for most practical problems 4 2 2 heterogeneous case 2 fig 7 a shows the hydrograph simulated by the three models for heterogeneous case 2 low permeability zone located in the middle of the hillslope h2d predicts that the outflow occurs at 108 3 mins experiences a step increase to 1 25 10 3 m2 s after several mins then remains constant for about 50 mins before gradually reaching the peak flow 2 08 10 3 m2 s and a slow recession once rainfall stops at 200 mins after cessation of the rainfall t 200 mins the outflow rate decreased gradually dropping to 1 59 10 4 m2 s at the end of the simulation the coupled h1d k2 model shows very similar outflow behavior as the h2d model with the only difference in the early onset of predicted surface runoff of 4 and 17 mins for the h1d k2 models with 40 and three soil profiles respectively all three models predicted the same trend of surface water depths at points h 1 and h 2 fig 7b with the only minor differences in the onset of runoff at point h 3 fig 6b fig 8 a shows the water content distributions simulated by h2d at selected times ponded water from the low permeability zone the middle section of the hillslope was routed toward the outlet and infiltrated into the downhill portion of the hillslope the saturation front gradually moved downward and toward the outlet because of the additional water source from the midsection full surface saturation was achieved faster in the downhill section than in the uphill portion of the hillslope similar water content distributions were observed for the h2d model and the h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles fig 7a and 7b conversely the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles could not fully capture the same water content distribution dynamics in particular the routed surface water infiltrated and redistributed in the vertical direction and reached saturation after 90 mins in the downhill portion of the hillslope table 3 summarizes components of the simulated water balance for the three models for heterogeneous case 2 differences in cumulative outflow and peak flow were less than 0 3 for the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 and three soil profiles compared to h2d the simulated peak flow and time were the same for all three models moreover the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles had the shortest computation time 16 71 s followed by the h2d model 24 35 s the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles had the longest computation time 145 92 s 4 3 surface runoff over a homogeneous subsurface with multiple rainstorms 4 3 1 no flow bottom bc fig 9 a shows hydrographs simulated by the h2d and h1d k2 with a single soil profile models in response to multiple rainstorms when the slope is 0 0005 and 0 01 the subsurface is homogeneous and a no flow bottom bc is applied even though a single soil profile was employed in the coupled h1d k2 model the hydrograph shapes were very similar for both models the only discrepancy was in the cumulative runoff for relatively flat 0 0005 and steep 0 01 slopes was only 0 14 and 0 22 respectively table s1 there was also a slight difference less than 5 0 10 5 m2 s in peak outflow during the second rainfall event t 200 400 mins similarly the simulated water depths by the coupled h1d k2 model were in good agreement with those obtained by the h2d model at the three observation points fig 9b and 9c for slopes of 0 0005 and 0 01 respectively furthermore the timing of the predicted onset and cessation of surface runoff were the same for all surface points using the coupled h1d k2 and h2d models fig 9c the biggest difference in ponding depths between the two models was observed during the second rainfall event about 1 mm because h2d predicts ponding at the lower part of the hillslope 4 3 2 free drainage bottom bc fig 10 illustrates that the coupled h1d k2 model reproduced similar hydrographs to the h2d model for homogeneous hillslopes with a free drainage bottom bc subjected to multiple rainstorms the free drainage bc causes dryer soil conditions and facilitates surface water infiltration compared to a no flow bottom bc the free drainage bc resulted in decreased peak amplitudes of surface runoff for all rainfall events fig 10a compared to the no flow bc fig 9a during the low intensity rainfall 0 qr ks the outflow rate decreased gradually the second wave of surface runoff present in the previous example due to saturation excess did not occur because the subsurface storage was not entirely filled due to the continued draining of the subsurface fig 10b shows the temporal evolution of the surface water depth at observation points h 1 h 2 and h 3 while the results simulated by the h1d k2 model agree closely with the h2d model s results for all test cases there was a small difference in the timing of surface runoff cessation the water depth at the three observation points decreased to zero simultaneously in the h1d k2 model whereas they gradually and successively dropped to zero in the h2d model 5 discussion the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models predict similar hydrological behaviors at the land surface and in the subsurface of homogeneous and heterogeneous hillslopes subject to a uniform rainfall figs 4 5 and 7 or multiple rainstorms figs 9 and 10 the simulated components of the water balance are very close to each other tables 2 3 and s1 discrepancies in the onset and cessation of surface runoff and spatial and temporal water content distributions simulated by the two models are caused mainly by the coupling strategy the time interval δtp and the number of the h1d soil profiles nh1d first the coupled h1d k2 model uses the bc switching approach to execute the two codes sequentially this results in the subsurface flow equation being solved before the surface flow equation with subsurface flow affecting surface flow at the current time level while surface flow affecting subsurface flow only at the next time level second the fixed δtp also contributes to discrepancies because of a time lag in updating bcs the h1d model calculates the actual infiltration rate with applied surface conditions obtained at the end of the previous period fig 2 although water inflows and outflows are balanced during particular time steps of the simulation the time lagged approach may cause uncertainty in the distribution of net surface fluxes in surface nodes eq 5 which eventually affects the accuracy of the simulated results despite adopting the same sequential solution procedure the h2d model updates bcs in each individual time step which is much smaller than δtp this is the main reason for discrepancies in the simulated outflow rate between two models fig 5a and s3 similar conclusions about the limitation of this time lagged approach have been discussed in the literature e g panday and huyakorn 2004 huang and yeh 2009 third the number of h1d soil profiles causes discrepancies in spatial and temporal water content distributions figs 6 and 8 onset of the second outflow wave and the surface water flow depths fig 5b and 7 when only one h1d soil profile is used to represent the entire subsurface the volume of infiltrated water contributed by ponding at multiple surface nodes is redistributed to one soil profile this process causes higher water contents at an earlier stage fig s1c and s2c and delays soil saturation fig s1e and s2e water fluxes at multiple surface nodes are also applied to only one soil profile eq 5 causing ponding fig 9 or infiltration fig 10 in all nodes furthermore differences between h1d k2 and h2d models for a homogeneous hillslope fig 4 were much smaller than for the heterogeneous hillslope figs 5 and 7 the main reason is that the direction of unsaturated water flow in a homogeneous hillslope is predominantly vertical and water starts ponding on the entire plane at the same time also a relatively small surface flow depth a maximum of 3 0 cm does not significantly impact the infiltration rate fig s4 resulting in a nearly uniform infiltration rate along the homogeneous hillslope this indicates that one h1d soil profile is sufficient to accurately simulate water flow in the homogeneous hillslopes previous studies have reported similar conclusions e g smith and woolhiser 1971 singh and bhallamudi 1998 on the other hand the h1d k2 model with three soil profiles only broadly approximates the movement of the surface water front at a heterogeneous hillslope figs 6 and 8 the h1d k2 model can fully capture similarly to h2d the general behavior of heterogeneous hillslopes when more vertical h1d soil profiles are employed fig 6b and 8b when users do not need accurate spatial moisture distribution figs 6 and 8 it is better to use the h1d k2 model due to the higher computational efficiency the simulation results of the h1d k2 model also agree closely with those presented in an integrated hydrologic model intercomparison project maxwell et al 2014 in this project seven broadly used integrated hydrologic models were compared including ats coon et al 2020 cathy sulis et al 2010 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 mike she thompson et al 2004 and parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 for the homogeneous cases infiltration excess and saturation excess fig 4 the peak flow and the onset of flow are almost identical to the results obtained by the seven integrated hydrologic models maxwell et al 2014 for heterogeneous case 2 fig 7 and table 3 the peak flow mean relative error of 7 1 with a deviation of 4 8 and the onset of flow mean value of 17 7 with a deviation of 13 4 fell within the range of results presented in maxwell et al 2014 similar to our findings these discrepancies have mainly been attributed to differences in the coupling strategy δtp and the number of soil profiles huang and yeh 2009 sulis et al 2010 maxwell et al 2014 compared to h2d the h1d k2 code can reduce the computational time tables 2 3 and s1 because the dimensionality reduction decreases the number of elements and nodes for calculation the bc switching approach allows surface and subsurface flow equations to be separately solved using dynamic time steps fig 1 which overcomes numerical instabilities of subsurface solutions caused by fast surface flow our approach calculates infiltration rates for the entire plane when ponding occurs using the average surface water depth eq 4 and rearranges the net surface flux to surface nodes based on individual surface water depths eq 5 similarly singh and bhallamudi 1998 demonstrated up to 10 times speedup when using a uniform infiltration rate compared to a non uniform infiltration rate at surface nodes the surface flow on a hillslope can be represented by a cascade of 1d overland flow planes while the subsurface flow is assumed to occur only in the vertical direction our water balance and bc switching approach enables the h1d k2 model to accurately consider the feedback of subsurface processes e g evaporation infiltration drainage on surface water flow furthermore by replacing the empirical infiltration equation in the k2 model with a physically based h1d model the h1d k2 model can overcome the limitation of predicting the surface runoff generated by the saturation excess conditions fig s5 and can provide spatial and temporal water content distributions figs 6 8 s1 and s2 the h1d k2 model can consider multiple soil layers with different soil textures whereas the standard k2 model can only consider two soil layers while the lower layer must be infinite spatial variations in the subsoil characteristics in the vertical direction can be accurately captured by the h1d k2 model which presently does not account for lateral water flow in the vadose zone note that matlab only serves as a platform to exchange information between the h1d and k2 codes and assignes exchange fluxes to separate surface and subsurface nodes based on the surface water depth when access to a comprehensive set of matlab and simulink products is restricted one could use other programming languages e g r python c etc to create the coupling routine with the same structure and the spatial and temporal loops described in section 2 1 and fig 2 our external coupling approach keeps two codes independent allowing users to use their latest versions in the coupled h1d k2 code another advantage of this approach is the ease of parallel computing implementation since hydrological processes in an h1d soil profile are independent of other soil profiles furthermore the users can also run the coupled h1d k2 code on high performance computing cluster systems after integrating with the matlab parallel server however the main advantage of the h1d k2 model compared to k2 is that it can consider complex meteorological conditions rainfall variability different soil textures different initial water conditions different bottom bcs e g free drainage seepage face variable fluxes pressures and the effects of vegetation which are the dominant factors for subsurface flow conditions moreover since the physical nonequilibrium flow model e g dual porosity and dual permeability has been developed in the computational module of h1d simunek et al 2005 the same conceptualization can be used in the coupled h1d k2 model to simulate the impacts of physical nonequilibrium on surface water flow future research will extend this computationally efficient model to a watershed scale by dividing the domain into a cascade of overland flow planes and channels 6 conclusions a novel approach was developed to couple open source codes for vadose zone flow hydrus 1d and overland flow kineros2 resulting in the h1d k2 model this new coupling routine sequentially solved the richards equation for subsurface flow and the kinematic wave equation for overland flow a water balance and bc switching approach was used to couple the surface and subsurface hydrological processes the water exchange flux in an h1d profile was assigned to multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation using a weighting factor related to the water depth six benchmark problems were performed over a wide range of conditions with different saturated hydraulic conductivities initial conditions bottom bcs slopes and multiple rainstorm events the simulated hydrographs surface water depth and water components by the coupled h1d k2 model closely agree with those obtained by the h2d model the coupled h1d k2 model is a simple accurate and computationally efficient hydrologic model it can simulate surface runoff generated by infiltration excess and saturation excess in response to rainfall or inflow it can also provide spatial and temporal water content distributions and surface water depths its computational efficiency is improved by adopting a dynamic time step approach and applying one h1d soil profile to an entire overland flow plane rather than to individual surface nodes a heterogeneous hillslope can be divided into a cascade of planes with different slopes spatial variations of soil characteristics and different drainage conditions at the bottom the novel coupling approach and the h1d k2 model can be extended to larger scales by dividing a watershed into a cascade of overland flow planes and

2803,considering surface and subsurface interactions is imperative to predict water movement water quantity and quality in the environment however substantial execution time and over parameterization presently limit the applicability of integrated hydrologic models at larger scales herein a new efficient coupling routine for one dimensional 1d surface subsurface modeling was developed by externally coupling two widely used open source codes kineros2 k2 solves the 1d kinematic wave equation for overland flow and hydrus 1d h1d solves the richards equation for subsurface flow a novel approach combined with water balance and boundary condition switching is used to account for surface ponding and water exchange between the two model domains a weighting factor related to the surface water depth is used to assign the time series of exchange fluxes in one h1d profile to multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation this novel approach enables us to represent the entire subsurface below each overland flow plane by one vertical soil column with different soil layering when soil properties vary horizontally multiple soil columns can represent spatial heterogeneities the performance of the coupled h1d k2 model is examined by comparing simulation results with the hydrus 2d h2d model for six benchmark problems the solution s robustness stability and accuracy are assessed for a wide variety of cases including multiple rainstorms different slopes heterogeneous subsurface and different bottom boundary conditions resulting in 41 cases the simulated hydrographs surface water levels and water balance components are all in good agreement relative mass balance errors are very small typically not exceeding 4 0 for the coupled h1d k2 model compared with the h2d model the coupled model achieves a factor of 1 3 10 speedup by applying one h1d soil profile to an entire overland flow plane rather than to individual surface nodes keywords hydrologic model computational efficiency surface runoff vadose zone flow water balance surface subsurface interactions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global water demands for industrial domestic and agricultural users have increased by 600 over the past century due to population growth and economic development un world water development report 2018 climate change and anthropogenic activities have also influenced water quantity and quality haddeland et al 2014 for example climate change shifts precipitation patterns and increases the frequency of flooding and droughts vorosmarty et al 2000 managed aquifer recharge is a promising adaptation measure to reduce water vulnerability and maintain its sustainability niswonger et al 2017 sasidharan et al 2018 marwaha et al 2021 this water management approach can maximize water storage in groundwater aquifers and increase water supply during droughts niswonger et al 2017 kourakos et al 2019 however there are limitations in available modeling resources for exploring integrated flow processes and impacts associated with managed aquifer recharge programs climate change etc it is imperative to understand surface and subsurface water flow interactions to improve sustainable water resource management smith et al 2004 fan et al 2019 a large number of models have been developed to predict the hydrologic behavior of coupled surface and subsurface systems in response to human activity and climate variability woolhiser et al 1970 freeze 1972 smith and hebbert 1983 qu and duffy 2007 these hydrologic

comparison to empirical and lumped models physically based distributed hydrologic models are valuable tools for considering the full complexity of governing physiochemical processes singh and woolhiser 2002 smith et al 2004 fatichi et al 2016 and are capable of predicting the spatial and temporal distribution of water flow and pollutant transport at hillslope to watershed scales šimůnek 2015 kollet et al 2017 wen et al 2021 benchmark simulation cases ranging from simple homogenous cases with constant rainfall rates to more complex cases with subsurface heterogeneity and lateral flow have been utilized to compare the performance of different physically based distributed coupled integrated hydrologic models sulis et al 2010 smith et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 results illustrate that all models can reproduce general hydrologic behaviors of benchmark cases liggett et al 2012 maxwell et al 2014 kollet et al 2017 wen et al 2021 however fully integrated hydrologic models are computationally intensive require extensive parameterization and need substantial execution time these limitations restrict their applicability at large scales the surface subsurface coupling strategy determines the volume and rate of exchange of water between the two domains huang and yeh 2009 alters the rainfall runoff behavior such as peak flow and the onset of water ponding kollet et al 2017 and eventually affects the accuracy stability and robustness of a hydrologic model liggett et al 2012 coon et al 2020 because of the faster dynamics of surface flow compared to subsurface flow coupling strategies are broadly classified into three categories continuous pressure first order exchange i e the exchange flux is determined by a calibrated coefficient and the head difference between the surface and subsurface nodes and hybrid approaches e g boundary condition bc switching and regularization penalty methods huang and yeh 2009 coon et al 2020 the continuous pressure approach enforces pressure continuity in the two domains kollet and maxwell 2006 but rapid changes in surface pressure can cause numerical instabilities at the subsurface boundary huang and yeh 2009 liggett et al 2012 de maet et al 2015 the convergence is especially poor near the transition from dry surface to surface ponding coon et al 2020 in addition the same time step must be used for solving the surface and subsurface equations simultaneously which greatly increases the associated computational cost because smaller time steps are required for surface water flow huang and yeh 2009 de maet et al 2015 in contrast a conceptual interface is considered to represent the connectivity between the surface and subsurface in the first order exchange approach i e ebel et al 2009 liggett et al 2012 this coupling approach allows surface and subsurface equations to be solved separately panday and huyakorn 2004 and the exchange water flux through the interface layer is obtained as the product of the pressure difference in the two domains and an exchange coefficient qu and duffy 2007 liggett et al 2012 a properly calibrated exchange coefficient can enhance the solver convergence and produce similar results to the pressure continuity approach liggett et al 2012 the bc switching approach calculates infiltration rates for stages with and without surface ponding camporese et al 2010 camporese et al 2014 the subsurface flow equation is first solved for the atmosphere controlled bc i e specified time dependent water fluxes and then a mass balance calculation is performed to determine the ponding condition at each surface node once surface ponding occurs the land surface bc is switched from an atmospheric controlled bc to a soil controlled bc i e specified time dependent pressure sulis et al 2010 the bc switching approach causes a time lag between surface and subsurface flows on an overland plane influencing the onset of runoff generation and the movement of the saturation front when inflow occurs uphill sulis et al 2010 de maet et al 2015 introduced a hybrid coupling approach that combines the continuous pressure and first order exchange approaches this hybrid coupling approach can produce similar results to the first order exchange approaches and improve the scheme s robustness although current coupled integrated hydrologic models reproduce similar hydrographs huang and yeh 2009 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 the impact of coupling approaches has not been extensively examined under the complex boundary conditions that occur during multiple rainstorms furthermore the application of existing coupled models to large scale problems is limited due to simplified representation of the subsurface and empirical formulations for infiltration estimation giráldez and woolhiser 1996 singh and bhallamudi 1998 or high computational burden morita and yen 2002 the computational burden is a significant obstacle that limits the implementation of hydrological models at larger scales the numerical solution of the richards equation usually requires fine spatial grids and small time steps which greatly increase the computation cost niswonger et al 2006 šimůnek et al 2006 small time steps are required to overcome numerical instabilities at the subsurface boundary due to rapid changes in surface pressure huang and yeh 2009 liggett et al 2012 much effort has been devoted to improving the computational efficiency of integrated hydrologic models including parallel computing kollet and maxwell 2006 brunner and simmons 2012 automatically adjusting time step size panday and huyakorn 2004 simunek et al 2005 sulis et al 2010 goodrich et al 2012 nested discretization wang et al 2018 and dimensionality reduction niswonger et al 2006 seo et al 2007 brunetti et al 2018 different for overland and subsurface flow and automatically adjusted time steps can significantly enhance the computational efficiency and robustness of the coupled models roberts 2003 simuunek et al 2005 goodrich et al 2012 alternatively dimensionality reduction of the surface and subsurface flow domain can provide a comparative advantage as unsaturated flow is predominantly vertical mantoglou 1992 a single or multiple vertical soil profiles representing one dimensional 1d water flow in the vadose zone can be coupled to a 1d overland flow plane this simplification and dimensionality reduction could reduce computational time compared to variably saturated flow simulations in 2d or 3d panday and huyakorn 2004 niswonger et al 2006 seo et al 2007 several conjunctive surface subsurface models have been developed to simulate the overland flow on a plane with 1d or 2d overland flow and 1d 2d or 3d flow in the vadose zone smith and woolhiser 1971 abbott et al 1986 singh and bhallamudi 1998 morita and yen 2002 panday and huyakorn 2004 thompson et al 2004 he et al 2008 large scale coupled hydrologic models such as mike she thompson et al 2004 and modflow2000 h1d seo et al 2007 beegum et al 2018 are examples of this dimensionality reduction approach the general objective of this study is to develop a simple accurate and computationally efficient coupled hydrologic model for overland flow and variably saturated flow through the vadose zone at the hillslope scale two existing open source 1d codes are coupled for this purpose kineros2 referred to below as k2 smith et al 1999 goodrich et al 2012 for overland flow and hydrus 1d referred to below as h1d simunek et al 2016 for vertical water flow in the vadose zone the specific objectives are i to develop a novel coupled h1d k2 model to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and improve the computational efficiency ii to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model by comparing its results with the two dimensional version of hydrus 2d 3d referred to below as h2d on six benchmark problems and iii to investigate the roles of a rainstorm size and frequency slope bottom bc and soil heterogeneity on the surface and subsurface water flow we pose the following hypotheses i the coupled h1d k2 model accurately represents the surface subsurface water flow in response to multiple rainfall storms compared to h2d ii computational time can be reduced by applying one h1d soil profile to an overland flow plane rather than to each individual surface node and iii subsurface heterogeneity and bottom bc affect the runoff generation mechanism pattern and magnitude while the slope magnitude impacts the timing of the hydrograph and volume of cumulative runoff 2 hydrologic models and setups to achieve these objectives a novel approach was developed to externally couple two well established and widely used open source codes to simulate hydrologic processes at the surface and in the subsurface using a matlab r2021b script the k2 model simulates 1d overland flow via the kinematic wave equation goodrich et al 2006 and h1d simulates 1d variably saturated flow in the subsurface simunek et al 2005 simunek et al 2016 to evaluate the model performance we compared the simulation results of the h1d k2 model with the h2d model that includes an overland flow routine šimunek 2003 simunek 2015 the h2d model outputs are used as a reference for model comparison because the model is physically based solves the richards and kinematic wave equations simultaneously and does not reduce the problem s dimensionality contrary to the coupled h1d k2 model the conceptual models for h2d and coupled h1d k2 are presented in fig 1 c and 1d respectively 2 1 coupled h1d k2 model the kinematic runoff and erosion model kineros2 k2 is a widely used and open source watershed model representing a watershed by a cascade of overland flow planes and channels smith et al 1999 goodrich et al 2012 the overland flow is described using the kinematic wave approximation of the saint venant equations assuming uniform flow and a friction slope approximately equal to the plane slope woolhiser et al 1970 giráldez and woolhiser 1996 the kinematic wave solution is accurate for most overland flow conditions woolhiser and liggett 1967 goodrich et al 2012 the kinematic wave equation can be expressed as follows 1 h t q x q x t where h is the surface water depth m t is time s x is the distance coordinate over the plane m q is the discharge per unit width m2 s and q x t is the change of the lateral inflow rate m s which is equal to local precipitation rate minus local infiltration and evapotranspiration rates discharge per unit width q is related to the surface water depth h by a simple power relation giráldez and woolhiser 1996 2 q α h m where parameters α m1 3s 1 and m are related to the slope surface roughness and flow conditions laminar or turbulent flow the manning hydraulic resistance law is commonly used to obtain the parameter α 3 α k n s 1 2 a n d m 5 3 where s is the slope and n is a manning s roughness coefficient for overland flow m1 3s 1 k is a unit conversion factor between international system si and english units k 1 m1 3 s 1 for si units and 1 49 ft1 3 s 1 for english units the k2 model has been applied to investigate the processes of interception infiltration runoff generation erosion and sediment transport up to five particle sizes for individual rainfall runoff events giráldez and woolhiser 1996 goodrich et al 2006 guber et al 2014 meles bitew et al 2020 infiltration is described using an equation for cumulative vertical infiltration into a homogeneous infinite soil profile with uniform initial moisture content parlange et al 1982 the k2 model can also consider a two layer soil profile without a bottom boundary condition to represent differences in soil texture in the subsurface k2 cannot simulate saturation excess overland flow fig s5 because it assumes an infinitely deep soil profile furthermore the k2 model does not provide information on the spatial and temporal variability of water content and neglects evaporation these limitations restrict the ability of the k2 model to investigate surface subsurface connectivity to overcome the above discussed limitations we have developed a novel coupling approach to replace the empirical infiltration equation in the k2 model with the physically based h1d model h1d simulates 1d variably saturated water flow in the vadose zone by numerically solving the richards equation fig 1d and using realistic bcs at the soil profile bottom simunek et al 2005 evapotranspiration processes are accounted in h1d but are not considered in this paper since their impact on the runoff generation is relatively small for the considered time scales the total simulation time is divided into multiple periods δtp which are usually larger than the individual time steps δti for solving the surface and subsurface equations furthermore convergence conditions are employed to automatically adjust time steps in both the h1d simunek et al 2005 and k2 goodrich et al 2012 models to improve computational efficiency one soil profile is used to represent the entire subsurface domain when soil characteristics do not vary horizontally but may change in the vertical direction when soil properties vary horizontally the overland flow plane is divided into multiple sections each connecting to one soil type fig 1d a matlab script executes the h1d and k2 codes sequentially a series of matlab functions read and write the input and output files initialize local and global variables and update exchange information at a selected δtp fig 2 shows a flowchart depicting the coupling approach in the h1d k2 model this coupling sequence is summarized below 1 the h1d code is executed with the applied land surface bcs i e rainfall evaporation to obtain the actual infiltration and evaporation rates the land surface bc of each h1d soil profile is determined using the surface water depth calculated in the previous δtp if there is no ponding an atmospheric bc is used when water starts ponding at the soil surface the land surface bc is switched from an atmospheric bc to a constant pressure head bc the corresponding pressure head value is equal to the average water depth of surface nodes in an overland flow plane if multiple h1d soil profiles are set a loop is employed to estimate infiltration for each soil profile fig 2 2 a water balance considering infiltration rainfall evaporation and ponded water is performed to determine if the soil infiltration capacity qsoil exceeds the water supply qsupply the sum of rainfall inflow from a neighboring plane and ponded water minus evaporation when the pressure head bc is imposed the infiltration volume over a δtp is controlled by qsoil rather than by water supply and calculated cumulative infiltration may be larger than qsupply the pressure head bc will overestimate infiltration when the soil infiltration capacity exceeds the water supply the pressure head bc for the subsurface equation is therefore switched to an atmospheric bc if this exceedance occurs the h1d code will maintain water balance when using an atmospheric bc that considers the actual infiltration rate and the maximum water supply volume during δtp the potential surface flux q surf is set equal to rainfall rate qr plus the ponding water contribution given as 4 q s u r f t q r t j 2 nk h j t nk 1 δ t p where h j t is the time series of surface water depths at the surface node and j is the surface node number starting from node 1 and ending with node nk note that the second term on the right side of eq 4 gives the mean surface water depth for all surface nodes j 1 2 nk divided by the δtp the subsurface equation is then solved with the surface water depths at the previous time as an initial condition and the new specified flux bc the criterion used to stop each iteration cycle is the difference between cumulative infiltration and cumulative water supply over the time interval being less than 10 6 m2 3 the time series of net surface flux ql j t i e the difference between rainfall evaporation and actual infiltration generated by the h1d is then applied to the corresponding surface nodes in the k2 code when rainfall is larger than actual infiltration positive ql is redistributed at the land surface and routed down over the overland flow plane in the case of negative ql ponded water infiltrates into the subsurface and its absolute value is subtracted from the surface storage of each surface node while solving the surface water routing equation note that ql j t in an h1d profile corresponds to vertical inflow from multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation fig 1d therefore a new method is used to assign the time series of ql j t in the overland plane a weighting factor is calculated as a ratio of the surface water depth at each surface node and the average surface water depth of an entire plane at the end of the previous δtp it is reasonable to assume that cumulative infiltration into the soil with a higher ponding depth is larger than the one with a smaller ponding depth when the surface water depth at a surface node is zero ql j t is zero as well additionally the k2 code was modified to save and initialize local and global variables with the previously calculated results so that ql j t is applied to the corresponding surface nodes the net surface flux is obtained by 5 q l j t q r t q i t i f q r t q i t h j t j 2 nk h j t nk 1 q r t q i t i f q r t q i t where qi is the infiltration rate 4 the k2 code is executed to calculate lateral water flow on the land surface while considering the feedback of the subsurface hydrological processes surface water depths at each surface node and the outflow rate from the overland plane are simulated during δtp 5 calculated pressure heads are set as the initial condition for the h1d computation at the next δtp the information on water depths is updated for the k2 after that a temporal loop is executed until the total simulation time ti reaches the final time tmax 2 2 hydrus 2d h2d model with an overland flow routine the h2d version 3 model with an overland flow routine was used to simulate runoff at the land surface and water infiltration and redistribution processes in the vadose zone šimunek 2003 simunek 2015 water flow in the vadose zone is described using the richards equation while the overland flow is described using the kinematic wave equation eq 1 the water exchange rate between the surface and subsurface domain is represented using the source term in the surface flow equation eq 1 while the applied land surface bcs account for the effects of surface water conditions on subsurface flow the soil hydraulic functions of van genuchten 1980 are used to obtain unsaturated soil hydraulic properties the atmospheric bc with surface runoff is applied on the land surface to reflect the surface conditions and bc switching between the variable pressure head and the atmospheric controlled conditions i e precipitation and evaporation are implemented to represent ponding or no ponding conditions respectively at any given time step the subsurface equation is solved first for prescribed initial conditions and an atmospheric bc after that a water balance calculation is performed to calculate the exchange flux and distribute it to separate surface and subsurface nodes once surface ponding is reached at any surface node once qsoil is smaller than ql j t overland flow is generated the surface water is routed to the lower parts of the hillslope via a kinematic wave equation when water is ponded at the soil surface the land surface bc is switched to a variable pressure head bc surface water depths at each surface node are updated at each time step the output information is printed for each node where the overland flow becomes active details concerning the theory numerical solution techniques and example applications of h2d are given by šimunek and van genuchten 2008 and kohne et al 2011 3 benchmark cases the hydrological processes on a hillslope with a length l of 400 m and subsurface thickness of 1 m fig 1a were simulated and compared using the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models the subsurface was discretized into 100 finite elements with the mesh size varying from 0 0053 m near the soil surface to 0 012 m at the soil bottom the horizontal mesh size was 2 m for the h2d model and 10 m for the k2 model the total number of surface nodes was 41 in the k2 model the first surface node was used to receive inflow from uphill not considered in this study finer horizontal discretization was used in the h2d model because coarse 2 m spatial discretization causes numerical oscillation problems for the heterogenous hillslope with a steep slope the subsurface spatial heterogeneity in the horizontal direction determines the number of h1d profiles at least three h1d soil profiles were needed to reflect the spatial heterogeneity in fig 3 b and 3c for the model with three soil profiles the uphill middle and downhill h1d soil profiles correspond to 15 10 and 15 surface nodes respectively for the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles each surface node relates to one h1d soil profile furthermore an analytical solution of overland flow on an impermeable plane served as a base case to evaluate the model performance the subsurface with the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 10 11 m min was assumed to be impermeable and modeled results were compared with the analytical solution the performance of the coupled h1d k2 code was tested against h2d for homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions with horizontally different saturated hydraulic conductivities ks initial water content distributions bottom bcs i e no flow and free drainage slope ratios and rainfall intensities and durations detailed model setups are listed in table 1 four slopes 0 0005 0 001 0 0025 and 0 01 were selected to test the impact of the surface flow speed on infiltration and overland flow while two bottom bc types were employed to test the feedback between the subsurface and surface flow processes the bottom bc is used to represent the exchange flux between the vadose zone and groundwater the no flow bc represents an impermeable bottom layer while the free drainage bc allows for water to drain from the bottom of the soil profile by gravity simunek et al 2005 time step and iteration criteria settings in the h1d and h2d models were the same to obtain comparable results the pressure head and water content tolerances were equal to 0 01 m and 0 001 respectively the initial pressure head distribution was assumed to be hydrostatic equilibrium with a given top pressure head the same initial pressure head distribution was used for both the h1d and h2d models both initial and minimum time steps were set at 10 6 min and the maximum time step was set to 1 min the maximum number of iterations was equal to 10 all simulations were carried out for 300 mins except for cases with multiple rainstorms 1200 mins the rainfall rate was applied for 200 mins followed by 100 mins of recession qr 0 for the coupled h1d k2 model the duration of water exchange δtp between surface and subsurface varied from 2 to 100 mins depending on the slope and heterogeneity of the overland plane simulation outputs were reported at a one min interval the van genuchten parameters are listed in table 1 the performance of the coupled h1d k2 code was evaluated by comparing its results with the output of the h2d model including the time series of outflow rates surface water depths at three observation points h 1 h 2 and h 3 shown in fig 3 and the surface water storage furthermore the relative mass balance error mbe evaluated the errors caused by the coupling strategy and numerical methods used in the two domains the relative mbe was computed for the entire hillslope domain using the following equation 6 re l a t i v e m b e 0 t max q r t q e t q d t d t l 0 t max q out t d t δ q surf δ q sub 0 t max q r t d t where δqsurf m2 and δqsub m2 are the changes in the surface and subsurface storages over the total simulation time respectively qe is the evaporation rate m min qd is the drainage at the soil profile bottom m min and qout is the outflow rate m2 min the ability of the coupled h1d k2 model to predict spatial and temporal water content distributions depends on the number of vertical soil profiles employed we therefore simulated and compared three models h2d served as a reference the coupled h1d k2 model with one for a homogeneous case or three for a heterogeneous case soil profiles and the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles kriging interpolation with a linear semi variogram model was used to estimate the water content distribution water content variations with depth and time were also compared to evaluate vadose zone flow figs s1 and s2 to illustrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed h1d k2 model over a wide range of conditions we simulated and compared outflow rates and cumulative runoffs for 32 cases with those obtained by the h2d model the detailed descriptions of the sensitivity analysis the related results and the discussion are given in the supporting material fig s3 in general simulation results show that the coupled h1d k2 model can accurately and efficiently simulate the surface and subsurface hydrological processes on a hillslope under scenarios with different spatial heterogeneities fig 3 slopes i e 0 0005 0 001 0 0025 and 0 01 and bottom bcs i e no flow and free drainage the overland flow plane connecting one homogeneous cases and three heterogeneous cases h1d profiles with different soil layering can capture the general hydrological behavior at the surface and in the subsurface fig s3 which is similar to the results of integrated hydrologic models used in previous studies e g simunek 2003 sulis et al 2010 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 under a uniform rainfall storm the runoff pattern was sensitive to the spatial heterogeneity while its magnitude was related to the drainage condition at the bottom fig s3 3 1 runoff generation on a homogeneous hillslope with uniform rainfall two homogeneous and isotropic planes with impervious and pervious soils and a slope of 0 0005 were used to evaluate the model performance in predicting surface runoff in response to uniform rainfall for the coupled h1d k2 model one soil profile was used to simulate water flow in the subsurface table 1 the rainfall rate q r 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins followed by 100 mins of recession qr 0 m min the total simulation time was 300 mins table 1 an analytical solution of the kinematic wave equation on an impervious rectangular plane gottardi and venutelli 1993 was used to compare simulated outflow rates using the coupled h1d k2 and h2d models the parameters used in the analytical solution base case are listed in table 1 the detailed information including the mathematical equation parameters and bcs can be found in gottardi and venutelli 1993 and jaber and mohtar 2003 the mechanism for runoff generation is mainly classified into two types saturation excess dunne runoff and infiltration excess horton runoff smith and woolhiser 1971 fatichi et al 2016 for the dunne runoff surface ponding occurs after the soil saturates and water fills the subsurface storage to realize this runoff generation mechanism the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks 6 94 10 4 m min was specified to be larger than the rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min three simulations with different depths of the initial water table iwt were tested table 1 conversely for the hortonian overland flow the surface ponding occurs when the rainfall rate exceeds the infiltration rate ks qr three simulations with the same iwt depth of 1 m and different ks 6 94 10 5 m min 6 94 10 6 m min and 6 94 10 11 m min were considered 3 2 runoff generation on a heterogenous hillslope a hillslope transect with two soil materials was simulated to consider spatial heterogeneity of subsurface hydraulic properties on the runoff generation to demonstrate the robustness of the coupled h1d k2 model we considered two heterogeneous cases in which high or low permeability zones are near the surface 0 0 05 m compared to the rest of the soil materials heterogeneous case 1 similar to a test problem introduced in šimunek 2003 uses a high permeable near surface 0 05 m middle section fig 1d and 3 with a ks value of 6 94 10 4 m min that is two orders of magnitude higher than the rest of the uniform subsurface with a k s of 6 94 10 6 m min heterogeneous case 2 is similar to kollet and maxwell 2006 with a low permeable near surface 0 05 m soil in the middle of the hillslope and a k s value two orders of magnitude smaller 6 94 10 6 m min than the remaining soil ks 6 94 10 4 m min both heterogeneous cases employed three h1d soil profiles to describe subsurface water flow in the hillslope s uphill middle and downhill sections see fig 1b and s1 the length of the middle section was 100 m while it was 150 m for both uphill and downhill sections a rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins followed by the 200 mins of recession qr 0 m min the slopes were 0 01 and 0 0005 for case 1 and case 2 respectively free drainage and no flow bcs were applied at the bottom of the soil profiles in case 1 and case 2 respectively these two benchmark cases have been used in the intercomparison of integrated hydrologic models e g sulis et al 2010 simunek 2015 kollet et al 2017 coon et al 2020 3 3 runoff generation on a homogeneous hillslope with multiple rainstorms four different configurations slopes of 0 0005 and 0 01 and no flow and free drainage bottom bcs with multiple rainstorms were considered to examine the stability of the coupled h1d k2 model the rainfall rate qr 3 3 10 4 m min was applied for the first 200 mins then decreased to 1 0 10 4 m min for the next 200 mins followed by 200 mins of recession qr 0 m min the rainfall events were repeated in the next 600 mins the total simulation time was 1200 mins the soil was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic with a ks of 6 94 10 5 m min the h1d k2 model only employed one soil profile to represent vadose zone flow in these simulations table 1 4 results 4 1 surface runoff over a homogeneous subsurface with a uniform rainfall rate simulation results for the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models have excellent agreement with the analytical solution for the low permeability subsurface 6 94 10 11 m min fig 4 a and saturated condition fig 4b the average errors were less than 0 5 in both cases simulated outflow rates for the h2d and h1d k2 models were in good agreement for both infiltration excess fig 4a and saturation excess fig 4b conditions differences were less than 0 9 in outflow rates and less than 0 5 in the cumulative outflow 4 2 surface runoff over a heterogeneous hillslope with a uniform rainfall rate 4 2 1 heterogeneous case 1 the hydrograph simulated by the h2d model fig 5 a shows that outflow began at 3 8 mins experienced a steep increase to 6 52 10 4 m2 s remained constant until the arrival of the second wave at 145 mins and then gradually increased and reached peak flow 6 99 10 4 m2 s after rainfall stopped t 200 mins the outflow rate decreased gradually to zero at 229 mins similar outflow rates were obtained for case 1 by the coupled h1d k2 model when a high permeability zone was placed near the surface in the middle section of the hillslope the onset and cessation of surface runoff were almost identical for the three hydrological models simulated surface water depths at observation points h 1 and h 3 were almost identical for all three models fig 5b the biggest difference occurred in predicting the onset of water ponding at h2 node located on the high permeability section of the hillslope the corresponding values for the h2d model the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles and the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles were 92 mins 82 mins and 122 mins respectively the maximum differences in the surface water depth were less than 0 2 mm among the three models table 2 shows that differences in simulated water balance components of heterogeneous case 1 were very small among the three models compared to the results produced by h2d peak flow predicted by the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 and three soil profiles was approximately 8 0 higher while the cumulative outflow was quite similar 2 2 3 4 difference the shortest computation time was for the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles 21 36 s followed by the h2d model 32 49 s while the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles had the longest computation time 321 74 s fig 6 demonstrates similar subsurface water content distributions simulated by the three models in response to the rainfall runoff processes in case 1 since the rainfall intensity exceeds the infiltration capacity of the lower and upper sections of the hillslope water ponding occurs quickly in these two sections and is routed downslope either off the hillslope or to the midsection fig 6a as rainfall intensity does not exceed the infiltration capacity of the midsection no ponding due to rainfall occurs instead the ponded water from the upper part of the hillslope was routed downslope and infiltrated into the subsurface in the midsection causing earlier arrival of the saturation front in the middle section of the hillslope with higher permeability after the cessation of the rainfall water drained out from the bottom of the soil profile causing a decrease in the water content the h2d model and the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles very well reproduced the overland and subsurface water movement behavior conversely as expected only the horizontally averaged saturation front characteristics were captured in the middle section by the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles where this section was represented by only one soil profile although this model significantly simplifies the real conditions it could produce the overall hydrological behavior of this entire system e g outflow rate and peak average subsurface saturation sufficiently well for most practical problems 4 2 2 heterogeneous case 2 fig 7 a shows the hydrograph simulated by the three models for heterogeneous case 2 low permeability zone located in the middle of the hillslope h2d predicts that the outflow occurs at 108 3 mins experiences a step increase to 1 25 10 3 m2 s after several mins then remains constant for about 50 mins before gradually reaching the peak flow 2 08 10 3 m2 s and a slow recession once rainfall stops at 200 mins after cessation of the rainfall t 200 mins the outflow rate decreased gradually dropping to 1 59 10 4 m2 s at the end of the simulation the coupled h1d k2 model shows very similar outflow behavior as the h2d model with the only difference in the early onset of predicted surface runoff of 4 and 17 mins for the h1d k2 models with 40 and three soil profiles respectively all three models predicted the same trend of surface water depths at points h 1 and h 2 fig 7b with the only minor differences in the onset of runoff at point h 3 fig 6b fig 8 a shows the water content distributions simulated by h2d at selected times ponded water from the low permeability zone the middle section of the hillslope was routed toward the outlet and infiltrated into the downhill portion of the hillslope the saturation front gradually moved downward and toward the outlet because of the additional water source from the midsection full surface saturation was achieved faster in the downhill section than in the uphill portion of the hillslope similar water content distributions were observed for the h2d model and the h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles fig 7a and 7b conversely the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles could not fully capture the same water content distribution dynamics in particular the routed surface water infiltrated and redistributed in the vertical direction and reached saturation after 90 mins in the downhill portion of the hillslope table 3 summarizes components of the simulated water balance for the three models for heterogeneous case 2 differences in cumulative outflow and peak flow were less than 0 3 for the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 and three soil profiles compared to h2d the simulated peak flow and time were the same for all three models moreover the coupled h1d k2 model with three soil profiles had the shortest computation time 16 71 s followed by the h2d model 24 35 s the coupled h1d k2 model with 40 soil profiles had the longest computation time 145 92 s 4 3 surface runoff over a homogeneous subsurface with multiple rainstorms 4 3 1 no flow bottom bc fig 9 a shows hydrographs simulated by the h2d and h1d k2 with a single soil profile models in response to multiple rainstorms when the slope is 0 0005 and 0 01 the subsurface is homogeneous and a no flow bottom bc is applied even though a single soil profile was employed in the coupled h1d k2 model the hydrograph shapes were very similar for both models the only discrepancy was in the cumulative runoff for relatively flat 0 0005 and steep 0 01 slopes was only 0 14 and 0 22 respectively table s1 there was also a slight difference less than 5 0 10 5 m2 s in peak outflow during the second rainfall event t 200 400 mins similarly the simulated water depths by the coupled h1d k2 model were in good agreement with those obtained by the h2d model at the three observation points fig 9b and 9c for slopes of 0 0005 and 0 01 respectively furthermore the timing of the predicted onset and cessation of surface runoff were the same for all surface points using the coupled h1d k2 and h2d models fig 9c the biggest difference in ponding depths between the two models was observed during the second rainfall event about 1 mm because h2d predicts ponding at the lower part of the hillslope 4 3 2 free drainage bottom bc fig 10 illustrates that the coupled h1d k2 model reproduced similar hydrographs to the h2d model for homogeneous hillslopes with a free drainage bottom bc subjected to multiple rainstorms the free drainage bc causes dryer soil conditions and facilitates surface water infiltration compared to a no flow bottom bc the free drainage bc resulted in decreased peak amplitudes of surface runoff for all rainfall events fig 10a compared to the no flow bc fig 9a during the low intensity rainfall 0 qr ks the outflow rate decreased gradually the second wave of surface runoff present in the previous example due to saturation excess did not occur because the subsurface storage was not entirely filled due to the continued draining of the subsurface fig 10b shows the temporal evolution of the surface water depth at observation points h 1 h 2 and h 3 while the results simulated by the h1d k2 model agree closely with the h2d model s results for all test cases there was a small difference in the timing of surface runoff cessation the water depth at the three observation points decreased to zero simultaneously in the h1d k2 model whereas they gradually and successively dropped to zero in the h2d model 5 discussion the h2d and coupled h1d k2 models predict similar hydrological behaviors at the land surface and in the subsurface of homogeneous and heterogeneous hillslopes subject to a uniform rainfall figs 4 5 and 7 or multiple rainstorms figs 9 and 10 the simulated components of the water balance are very close to each other tables 2 3 and s1 discrepancies in the onset and cessation of surface runoff and spatial and temporal water content distributions simulated by the two models are caused mainly by the coupling strategy the time interval δtp and the number of the h1d soil profiles nh1d first the coupled h1d k2 model uses the bc switching approach to execute the two codes sequentially this results in the subsurface flow equation being solved before the surface flow equation with subsurface flow affecting surface flow at the current time level while surface flow affecting subsurface flow only at the next time level second the fixed δtp also contributes to discrepancies because of a time lag in updating bcs the h1d model calculates the actual infiltration rate with applied surface conditions obtained at the end of the previous period fig 2 although water inflows and outflows are balanced during particular time steps of the simulation the time lagged approach may cause uncertainty in the distribution of net surface fluxes in surface nodes eq 5 which eventually affects the accuracy of the simulated results despite adopting the same sequential solution procedure the h2d model updates bcs in each individual time step which is much smaller than δtp this is the main reason for discrepancies in the simulated outflow rate between two models fig 5a and s3 similar conclusions about the limitation of this time lagged approach have been discussed in the literature e g panday and huyakorn 2004 huang and yeh 2009 third the number of h1d soil profiles causes discrepancies in spatial and temporal water content distributions figs 6 and 8 onset of the second outflow wave and the surface water flow depths fig 5b and 7 when only one h1d soil profile is used to represent the entire subsurface the volume of infiltrated water contributed by ponding at multiple surface nodes is redistributed to one soil profile this process causes higher water contents at an earlier stage fig s1c and s2c and delays soil saturation fig s1e and s2e water fluxes at multiple surface nodes are also applied to only one soil profile eq 5 causing ponding fig 9 or infiltration fig 10 in all nodes furthermore differences between h1d k2 and h2d models for a homogeneous hillslope fig 4 were much smaller than for the heterogeneous hillslope figs 5 and 7 the main reason is that the direction of unsaturated water flow in a homogeneous hillslope is predominantly vertical and water starts ponding on the entire plane at the same time also a relatively small surface flow depth a maximum of 3 0 cm does not significantly impact the infiltration rate fig s4 resulting in a nearly uniform infiltration rate along the homogeneous hillslope this indicates that one h1d soil profile is sufficient to accurately simulate water flow in the homogeneous hillslopes previous studies have reported similar conclusions e g smith and woolhiser 1971 singh and bhallamudi 1998 on the other hand the h1d k2 model with three soil profiles only broadly approximates the movement of the surface water front at a heterogeneous hillslope figs 6 and 8 the h1d k2 model can fully capture similarly to h2d the general behavior of heterogeneous hillslopes when more vertical h1d soil profiles are employed fig 6b and 8b when users do not need accurate spatial moisture distribution figs 6 and 8 it is better to use the h1d k2 model due to the higher computational efficiency the simulation results of the h1d k2 model also agree closely with those presented in an integrated hydrologic model intercomparison project maxwell et al 2014 in this project seven broadly used integrated hydrologic models were compared including ats coon et al 2020 cathy sulis et al 2010 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 mike she thompson et al 2004 and parflow kollet and maxwell 2006 for the homogeneous cases infiltration excess and saturation excess fig 4 the peak flow and the onset of flow are almost identical to the results obtained by the seven integrated hydrologic models maxwell et al 2014 for heterogeneous case 2 fig 7 and table 3 the peak flow mean relative error of 7 1 with a deviation of 4 8 and the onset of flow mean value of 17 7 with a deviation of 13 4 fell within the range of results presented in maxwell et al 2014 similar to our findings these discrepancies have mainly been attributed to differences in the coupling strategy δtp and the number of soil profiles huang and yeh 2009 sulis et al 2010 maxwell et al 2014 compared to h2d the h1d k2 code can reduce the computational time tables 2 3 and s1 because the dimensionality reduction decreases the number of elements and nodes for calculation the bc switching approach allows surface and subsurface flow equations to be separately solved using dynamic time steps fig 1 which overcomes numerical instabilities of subsurface solutions caused by fast surface flow our approach calculates infiltration rates for the entire plane when ponding occurs using the average surface water depth eq 4 and rearranges the net surface flux to surface nodes based on individual surface water depths eq 5 similarly singh and bhallamudi 1998 demonstrated up to 10 times speedup when using a uniform infiltration rate compared to a non uniform infiltration rate at surface nodes the surface flow on a hillslope can be represented by a cascade of 1d overland flow planes while the subsurface flow is assumed to occur only in the vertical direction our water balance and bc switching approach enables the h1d k2 model to accurately consider the feedback of subsurface processes e g evaporation infiltration drainage on surface water flow furthermore by replacing the empirical infiltration equation in the k2 model with a physically based h1d model the h1d k2 model can overcome the limitation of predicting the surface runoff generated by the saturation excess conditions fig s5 and can provide spatial and temporal water content distributions figs 6 8 s1 and s2 the h1d k2 model can consider multiple soil layers with different soil textures whereas the standard k2 model can only consider two soil layers while the lower layer must be infinite spatial variations in the subsoil characteristics in the vertical direction can be accurately captured by the h1d k2 model which presently does not account for lateral water flow in the vadose zone note that matlab only serves as a platform to exchange information between the h1d and k2 codes and assignes exchange fluxes to separate surface and subsurface nodes based on the surface water depth when access to a comprehensive set of matlab and simulink products is restricted one could use other programming languages e g r python c etc to create the coupling routine with the same structure and the spatial and temporal loops described in section 2 1 and fig 2 our external coupling approach keeps two codes independent allowing users to use their latest versions in the coupled h1d k2 code another advantage of this approach is the ease of parallel computing implementation since hydrological processes in an h1d soil profile are independent of other soil profiles furthermore the users can also run the coupled h1d k2 code on high performance computing cluster systems after integrating with the matlab parallel server however the main advantage of the h1d k2 model compared to k2 is that it can consider complex meteorological conditions rainfall variability different soil textures different initial water conditions different bottom bcs e g free drainage seepage face variable fluxes pressures and the effects of vegetation which are the dominant factors for subsurface flow conditions moreover since the physical nonequilibrium flow model e g dual porosity and dual permeability has been developed in the computational module of h1d simunek et al 2005 the same conceptualization can be used in the coupled h1d k2 model to simulate the impacts of physical nonequilibrium on surface water flow future research will extend this computationally efficient model to a watershed scale by dividing the domain into a cascade of overland flow planes and channels 6 conclusions a novel approach was developed to couple open source codes for vadose zone flow hydrus 1d and overland flow kineros2 resulting in the h1d k2 model this new coupling routine sequentially solved the richards equation for subsurface flow and the kinematic wave equation for overland flow a water balance and bc switching approach was used to couple the surface and subsurface hydrological processes the water exchange flux in an h1d profile was assigned to multiple surface nodes in the k2 calculation using a weighting factor related to the water depth six benchmark problems were performed over a wide range of conditions with different saturated hydraulic conductivities initial conditions bottom bcs slopes and multiple rainstorm events the simulated hydrographs surface water depth and water components by the coupled h1d k2 model closely agree with those obtained by the h2d model the coupled h1d k2 model is a simple accurate and computationally efficient hydrologic model it can simulate surface runoff generated by infiltration excess and saturation excess in response to rainfall or inflow it can also provide spatial and temporal water content distributions and surface water depths its computational efficiency is improved by adopting a dynamic time step approach and applying one h1d soil profile to an entire overland flow plane rather than to individual surface nodes a heterogeneous hillslope can be divided into a cascade of planes with different slopes spatial variations of soil characteristics and different drainage conditions at the bottom the novel coupling approach and the h1d k2 model can be extended to larger scales by dividing a watershed into a cascade of overland flow planes and

2804,we used natural language processing nlp to assess topic diversity in all research articles 75 000 from eighteen water science and hydrology journals published between 1991 and 2019 we found that individual water science and hydrology research articles are becoming increasingly diverse in the sense that on average the number of topics represented in individual articles is increasing which may be a sign of increasing interdisciplinarity this is true even though the body of water science and hydrology literature as a whole is not becoming more topically diverse topics with the largest increases in popularity were climate change impacts water policy planning and pollutant removal topics with the largest decreases in popularity were stochastic models and numerical models at a journal level water resources research journal of hydrology and hydrological processes are the three most topically diverse journals among the corpus that we studied keywords topic diversity water resources

6976752 1 introduction in the early stages of hydrology and water resources science the focus was on bringing together natural scientists engineers and social scientists harshbarger and evans 1967 freeze 1990 identified a separation between physical and social sciences in water research and encouraged the journal water resources research w r r to encourage then limited partnerships to encourage the mixture of these topics a report by the national research council 1991 focused on the importance of a diverse educational base in hydrology and encouraged multidisciplinary hydrological research as necessary to understand and predict the full global water cycle over the next decade hydrologic sciences became central to new research topics e g hydroclimatology hydrometeorology geobiology hydroecology hydrogeomorphology ecogeomorphology earth system dynamics etc national research council 2012 in the modern era montanari et al 2013 argued that the scientific decade 2013 2022 would focus on advanced monitoring and data analysis techniques and that diversity in water science could be sought through connecting economic sciences and geosciences montanari et al 2015 later argued that this branching of sub topics in hydrologic sciences has given rise to a vibrant interdisciplinary research culture that focuses on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and interactions between water earth and biological systems ruddell and wagener 2015 mentioned that hydrology education must expand beyond traditional scopes to address the evolving and unique needs of society e g data and modeling driven cybereducation developing an international faculty learning community hydro economics etc vogel et al 2015 described a modern hydrologic science that develops deeper understanding of human nature connections he argued that every theoretical hydrologic model introduced previously is in need of revision to properly capture nonstationarity in nature proposing knowledge discovery through big data to understand the coupled human hydrologic system the 21st century saw a sharp rise in demand for more robust diverse hydrologic models which account for nonstationarity associated with climate change e g milly et al 2008 bayazit 2015 galloway 2011 and leverage large samples of available data gupta et al 2014 nearing et al 2021 argued that modern data science has the potential to transform water science given concerted effort to bring together hydrologists with data scientists computer scientists and statisticians regardless of how we perceive open challenges in the discipline it is important for scientists and practitioners to have some idea about whether and how the water science and hydrology science community is changing in this study we identify and quantify trends and interactions in and between different subtopics within the discipline specifically we measure trends and diversity of different sub topics within the discipline and we use these analyses to provide some insight into the state of topic diversity in the field water research articles encompass a wide range of research topics including groundwater streamflow climate change eco hydrology biogeochemistry water quality etc all of which are consequential to global socioeconomic well being mccurley and jawitz 2017 attempted to assess interdisciplinarity in hydrology by analyzing instances of topic keywords in article titles however their corpus consisted of article titles from only one journal w r r and used pre identified keywords and topics in this paper we look at a broad spectrum of water science and hydrology research publications our corpus encompasses 18 high impact journals and use data science techniques to help partially automate the process of identifying distinct sub topics in the discipline one of the major challenges faced by all scientific communities is the increasing volume of peer reviewed literature fig 1 quantifies this phenomenon in hydrology and water science recent advances in computational linguistics machine learning and a variety of application ready toolboxes for natural language processing nlp can help facilitate analyses of vast electronic corpora for a variety of objectives cambria and white 2014 these techniques which include information retrieval text categorization and other text mining techniques based on machine learning have been gaining popularity in information systems since the 1990s sebastiani 2002 topic modeling is a particular type of nlp that uses statistical algorithms to extract semantic information from a collection of texts in the form of thematic classes jiang et al 2016 topic models can be applied to massive collections of documents blei 2012 and have been used to recommend scientific articles based on content and user ratings wang and blei 2011 topic modeling has also been used to cluster scientific documents yau et al 2014 improve bibliographic search jardine and teufel 2014 pham et al 2018 shu et al 2009 tang et al 2008 paul and girju 2009 and for a variety of application specific objectives such as statistical modeling of the biomedical corpora blei et al 2006 bibliometric exploration of hydropower research jiang et al 2016 in the analysis of research trends in personal information privacy choi et al 2017 development of meta review in cloud computing literature upreti et al 2016 literature review of social science articles li and liu 2018 discovering themes and trends in transportation research sun et al 2017 identifying contribution of authors in knowledge management literature jussila et al 2017 exploring the history of cognition priva and austerweil 2015 and exploring topic divergence and similarities in scientific conferences hall et al 2008 as opposed to s c i e n t o m e t r i c s techniques mingers and leydesdorff 2015 which have been traditionally used for ranking articles and authors based on citation data topic modeling allows for a contextual understanding of particular scientific domains and disciplines motivated by the success of topic modeling in a wide range of applications we explore its potential to aid bibliometric exploration of peer reviewed water science literature in particular we explore the question of whether peer reviewed water science literature is increasing in diversity with respect to sub topics in the discipline the specific hypotheses that we will explore are individual hydrology research papers are becoming more topically diverse i e it is increasing at the level of individual research projects the hydrology and water science corpus as a whole is becoming more topically diverse there is a difference in per paper topic diversity between different water science journals some topics are negatively correlated to diversity in the community research output 2 methods table 1 lists notation used throughout this paper including variables and indices related to the model and corpus the corpus that we analyzed is described in section 2 1 below we analyzed this corpus using sequential latent dirichlet allocation ldaseq in gensim řehřek and sojka 2011 based on blei and lafferty 2006 s dynamic topic model dtm to identify dominant topics and to associate topics with individual research articles ldaseq is described in appendix this nlp method identifies topics by associating a unique set of words that frequently co appear together in timestamped documents and assigns weights to each of those words based on their likelihood of appearance within a particular topic 2 1 corpus peer reviewed abstracts offer snapshots of the historical and current trends and developments in both theoretical and applied research in this study we use abstracts because they are intended to be concise representations of full texts and are used often for bibliometric analyses griffiths and steyvers 2004 gatti et al 2015 the corpus that we use consists of abstracts from all peer reviewed articles published in eighteen water science journals between 1991 and 2019 this is all water science journals with a 2018 impact factor if of greater than 0 9 scimago journal and country rank the list of journals and journal abbreviations along with corresponding ifs years of available data and total number of abstracts are listed in table 2 in total 74 479 article abstracts were acquired from the web of science core collection in the form of bib files methods for pre processing this corpus are described in appendix 2 2 analysis methods to reiterate from the introduction the hypotheses that we want to test are about whether hydrology and water science research is becoming more topically diverse over time we will test these hypotheses by exploring sub topics within the discipline and measuring whether individual research articles individual journals and the body of water science and hydrology literature as a whole is becoming more topically diverse the analysis tools that we use to address these research questions are described below this analysis was applied to the posterior document topic and topic word expectations from a trained ldaseq model with 45 topics k o p t 45 we used a combination of objective subjective method to choose the optimal number of topics details of this process can be found in appendix 2 2 1 temporal trends in topic distributions there are multiple methods of analyzing temporal trends and distributions of topics griffiths and steyvers 2004 applied a disjointed time blind topic model and rearranged documents according to their publication dates blei and lafferty 2006 developed a sequential topic modeling approach that learns time dynamic parameters for the document topic and topic word distributions constrained by linear filtering theory wang and mccallum 2006 introduced a non markov joint modeling framework where topics are associated with a continuous distribution over document timestamps we initially tested griffiths and steyvers 2004 s approach of time unaware topic modeling and post hoc aggregation of results according to timestamp for benchmarking due to the sequential nature of our data we chose dynamic topic modeling blei and lafferty 2006 approach for this study because unlike a time blind topic model it provides a qualitative scope into the contents of a large textual dataset in addition to providing us with a quantitative predictive model for our sequential corpus we calculated temporal topic distributions for a given year μ k t as the proportion of all topic weights over all papers from a given year t 1 μ k t d 1 m μ k d i t d t d 1 m i t d t μ k d represents the weight for topic k assigned to document d t d is the year in which document d was published and i is an indicator function such that i 0 1 and i x 0 for x 0 henceforth i will carry the same meaning statistical significance of these trends were assessed using standard linear regression analysis between variables in each case we computed the i pearson correlation coefficient r as the strength of association between variables ii the p value for the t test of the correlation coefficient against a null hypothesis of zero trend and iii the bayes factor b10 as a measure of the strength of evidence toward the alternate nonzero trend hypothesis 2 2 2 measurement of topic diversity shannon entropy shannon 1948 is a classic diversity metric that is used among many other things in ecology studies to quantify the diversity of species in a given ecosystem or location e g harte and newman 2014 sherwin and prat i fornells 2019 intuitively we propose that articles can be analogous to ecological sites and topics are analogous to species we used the shannon entropy based metric applied to topic distributions to measure diversity at corpus and article levels 2 2 3 measuring diversity at the article level we used shannon entropy to measure the topic diversity h d for each article in our corpus as 2 h d k 1 k μ k d l o g μ k d where μ k is the distribution of topics over document d we also calculated the mean shannon diversity in documents per year as h t ˆ 3 h t ˆ d 1 m h d i t d t d 1 m i t d t finally we calculated the shannon diversity of topics in documents per journal per year h j t as 4 h j t d 1 m h d i j d j t d t l 1 k d 1 m h d i j d j t d t shannon diversity is represented using the natural unit of information nat where 1 nat represents the information contained in an event when the probability of that event occurring is 1 e 2 2 4 measuring diversity at the journal and corpus level we calculated shannon diversity at the corpus level and then computed these corpus indexes for both the entire corpus and for each journal to do this we began by calculating the k nomial distribution over topics μ j in a particular set of articles j either a journal or the whole corpus although we will hereafter refer to subscript j as referring to a specific journal 5 μ k j d 1 m μ k d i j d j l 1 k d 1 m μ l d i j d j where μ k j is the relative popularity of a particular topic in a particular journal as a fraction of popularity of all topics in the journal we then calculated the total entropy of each μ j topic distribution as h j which is a measure of the shannon diversity of the per journal topic distributions 6 h j k 1 k μ k j l o g μ k j the popularity of a particular topic in a particular journal for a particular year μ k j t is a fraction of the popularity of all topics in that journal and year 7 μ k j t d 1 m μ k d i j d j t d t l 1 k d 1 m μ l d i j d j t d t we used these per year per journal topic distributions to construct time series of individual topic popularity in each journal μ k j t which allowed us to quantify the evolving diversity of topic distributions in individual journals over time 2 3 correlation between pairs of topics we calculate the correlation coefficient between pairs of topics this allows us to broadly separate frequently co occurring i e exist within the same article topics from the ones which do not frequently co occur the correlation coefficient between topic weights over the whole corpus m for each pair of topics r k j was calculated as 8 r k j d 1 m μ k d μ ˆ k d μ j d μ ˆ j d d 1 m μ k d μ ˆ k d 2 d 1 m μ j d μ ˆ j d 2 where μ k d is the weight for topic k assigned to document d and μ k d ˆ is the mean weight for a topic k assigned over all documents in the corpus and μ j d is the weight for a topic j assigned to document d and μ j d ˆ is the mean weight for topic j assigned over all documents in the corpus we only report correlations greater than 0 2 2 4 correlation between topics and per article diversity we observe the correlation between topics and per article diversity in water science articles by observing the statistical relationship between topic distribution weights and article diversity this allows us to identify which topics participate more or less often in articles with greater or lesser topic diversity intuitively a negative statistical relationship between topic distribution weights and article diversity indicates decreasing article diversity when certain topics are more present within an article we denote the correlation coefficient between document topic distributions and their corresponding article diversity scores entropy metrics as r μ h d 3 results and analysis 3 1 naming the topics the first step toward using the posterior expectations of the ldaseq model is naming the topics we identified and named k 45 topics by first looking at the topic word distributions the set of words most likely to appear within a particular topic and the per document topic distributions from the titles of 100 articles most closely associated with each topic we reinforced our choices of topic names with an informal survey sent to four qualified hydrologists outside of our research group fig 2 illustrates the topic word distributions of k 45 topics in the form of wordclouds along with our chosen topic names this topic naming analysis was similar to what was done by mccurley and jawitz 2017 who looked at topic diversity in w r r papers as described in the introduction those authors assigned seven topics in hydrology prior to their analysis catchment hydrology hydro geology hydro meteorology contaminant hydrology socio hydrology and hydro climatology our post hoc identified topics extracted using ldaseq were conceptually similar to these however ldaseq was able to extract a larger and more nuanced set of topics through unsupervised learning 3 2 temporal trends of topics in the full corpus the popularity of each topic changes with time and these trends are also shown in fig 2 some topics demonstrated statistically significant rising trends in popularity table 3 some of these rising topic trends e g rainfall runoff precipitation rainfall spatial variability might be attributed to researchers increasingly leveraging the availability and accessibility of hydrology related data both in terms of breadth and depth other topics demonstrated statistically significant downward trends table 3 the remainder of topics do not demonstrate any significant trend within our corpus fig 3 shows the relative popularity of topics over time plotted on the same scale fig 2 shows the same topic trends but not normalized considering the relative popularity of topics in 1991 vs 2019 topics that lost the most popularity within our corpus over 50 are stochastic models 62 numerical modeling 61 solute transport 56 conversely the topics that gained the most over 50 are climate change impacts 155 water policy planning 143 pollutant removal 117 watershed features 72 irrigation 60 modeling 57 precipitation 57 and rainfall 55 these changes in the popularity of topics can be perhaps interpreted as shifting focus of researchers who publish their works within the journals in our corpus these changes reflect the increasing effects of climate change on water availability and rainfall increasing water stress and an ever more pressing need for sustainable and efficient water management e g mehran et al 2017 tabari 2020 padrón et al 2020 gudmundsson et al 2021 in addition to leveraging the availability of data water researchers are responding to the needs of the time 3 3 are articles becoming more topically diverse the corpus wide mean per article diversity metric is shown in fig 4 our findings indicate the average diversity of topics within individual water science articles is increasing overall regression based trend analysis for the shannon diversity metric time from the entire corpus are r 0 95 p value 1 36e 14 b10 3 39e 11 indicating a statistically significant trend at any reasonable significance threshold to gain an intuitive interpretation of this change in diversity we applied another metric from ecological biological sciences ens effective number of species in our case we will call it ent effective number of topics where e n t e h d as an example if e n t x for mean per article diversity h t ˆ for year t h t ˆ is equivalent to articles containing x count of equally common topics in our corpus the mean effective number of topics e n t per article steadily rose from 13 62 in 1991 to 15 29 in 2019 this means a 4 44 rise in mean per article topic diversity translates to 12 26 rise in the number of equally common topics per article between 1991 and 2019 this rising ent can also be interpreted intuitively as an indicator of water researchers absorbing knowledge from topics within other disciplines through interdisciplinary collaborations and education 3 4 which journals are contributing to per article diversity to understand which journals are contributing to the trend of increasing diversity of topics in individual research articles we calculated the mean diversity of articles per year for each of the eighteen journals as shown in fig 5 as before we used linear regression to assess the significance of temporal trends in these per journal time series water resources research w r r demonstrates the strongest rise as an individual journal in the mean diversity of topics per article published between 1991 and 2019 r 0 92 p value 2 39e 12 bf10 2 77e 09 other journals with overall rise in per article diversity within our corpus are advances in water resources a w r r 0 69 p value 5 69e 05 bf10 513 33 water research w r r 0 67 p value 9 14e 05 bf10 336 08 journal of contaminant hydrology j c h r 0 67 p value 1 05e 05 bf10 297 751 and journal of hydrology j h r 0 57 p value 1 57e 03 bf10 27 06 while these results do not directly translate to a rise of interdisciplinarity within these journals they most certainly indicate increasing diversification of topics this increasing diversification can be driven by multiple factors which again includes researchers creating new and absorbing knowledge from other disciplines journals which demonstrate moderate rises in per article diversities are water resources management w r m r 0 46 p value 0 026 bf10 2 68 and hydrogeology journal h g j r 0 43 p value 0 05 bf10 1 59 journal of water resource planning management j w r p m r 0 28 p value 0 15 bf10 0 62 journal of the american water resources association j a w r a r 0 11 p value 0 64 bf10 0 29 and hydrological processes h p r 0 02 p value 0 94 bf10 0 24 do not demonstrate any significant trend at a significance level of α 0 01 average diversity of articles published in hydrologic sciences journal h s j r 0 46 p value 0 01 bf10 4 11 hydrology earth system sciences h e s s r 0 36 p value 0 09 bf10 1 00 and journal of hydrometeorology j h m r 0 30 p value 0 21 bf10 0 59 decreased the rest of the journals do not have publication records long enough for trend analysis the declining per article diversity trends could mean that these journals are increasingly favoring a particular set of topics or that researchers working on certain topics are favoring these journals 3 5 is the whole corpus becoming more topically diverse fig 6 shows the temporal variability of topic entropy diversity over time for the entire corpus dashed black line and for each individual journal solid colored lines this differs from the average per article diversity metrics reported in the previous subsection in that these metrics are calculated over the topic distributions averaged over all papers in the corpus journal whereas the per article diversity metrics diversity of presumably individual research projects the corpus metrics measure the diversity of topics overall in a journal or corpus and measure the mixture of topics at community level rather than at the level of individual research projects the diversity for the entire corpus rose very slightly in the late 1990s and since then the entropy of the entire corpus has remained steady or slightly decreased however no definite trend exists overall r 0 43 p value 0 02 bf10 0 69 this emphasized the disentanglement of per article diversity from corpus diversity showing that increasing article level diversity does not necessarily translate to overall corpus diversity we used fig 6 to also visualize the per journal topic diversity trends statistically significant upward diversity trends can be seen for advances in water resources a w r r 0 79 p value 2 68e 07 bf10 6 59e 04 water resources research w r r r 0 713 p value 1 39e 05 bf10 1824 36 journal of water resources planning management j w r p m r 0 69 p value 3 73e 05 bf10 745 97 and hydrogeology journal h g j r 0 52 p value 0 01 bf10 5 13 journals which demonstrated statistically significant downward trends were water research w r r 0 64 p value 1 70e 04 bf10 191 81 and hydrological sciences journal h s j r 0 59 p value 8 04e 04 bf10 48 40 other journals did not demonstrate any significant trend in entropy over time here again evidences of disentanglement between per article diversity and overall corpus diversity can be seen at a journal level 3 6 overall journal diversity the stacked bar plots in fig 7 show the relative fraction of topic representation in each journal with the total height of each bar representing the journal s topic entropy water resources research w r r 3 45 nats journal of hydrology j h 3 40 nats hydrological processes h p 3 35 nats and journal of the american water resources association j a w r a 3 25 nats are the most topically diverse journals in our corpus we can again intuitively interpret these values in terms of e n t meaning that these journals have published the highest numbers of equally common topics within the entire dataset the overall shannon diversity per journal decreases for more specialty journals i e journals which focus atmospheric science topics journal of hydrometeorology j h m and water management topics water resources management w r m journal of water resources planning management j w r p m journals with a fairly recent publication history i e environmental science water research and technology e s w r t international soil and water conservation research i s w c r journal of hydrology regional studies j h r e g and water resources and industry w r i had lower overall diversity compared to the rest of the corpus which is expected 3 7 correlations between topic pairs to reiterate from section 2 3 we observe the correlations both positive and negative between pairs of topics to understand which topics co appear frequently in our corpus 3 7 1 co appearing topics an intuitive way to depict inter topic correlations r k j are chord diagrams r k j correlation coefficients measure relationships between per paper topic weights meaning that a higher r k j value indicates papers that contain word groups associated with topic k also tend to contain word groups associated with topic j positive correlation coefficients between pairs of topics indicate some degree of co appearance of these topics in research articles and vice versa positive and negative inter topic correlations are shown in fig 8 where the width of each chord represents the overall correlation between a pair of topics for ease of viewing positive correlations are only plotted for r k j 0 20 and negative correlations r k j 0 20 inter topic correlation plots for the entire corpus lends us a snapshot of co appearing topics 3 7 2 positive and negative inter topic correlations positive correlations or likelihood of co occurrence can be observed for a range of topics e g between rainfall and streamflow rainfall and spatial variability uncertainty and stochastic models land surface flux and hydrogeology groundwater and solute transport and microbiology and wastewater treatment anti correlations indicate that there are set of vocabulary in the water science literature that are largely not shared between sub communities for example pollutant removal and land surface flux pollutant removal and vadose zone water policy and planning and uncertainty numerical modeling and reservoir management and irrigation and sediment transport are less likely to co appear within our corpus these negative correlations between topics indicate potential for expanding avenues of collaborative research 3 8 correlation between individual topics and per article diversity reiterating from section 2 4 we quantify relationships between per article diversity and corresponding topic weights some topics in our corpus tend to reduce the paper wise diversity when they appear in an article meaning they are less likely to appear alongside a wide variety of other topics statistical relationship between mean per article shannon diversities h d and their corresponding topic distribution weights μ are shown in fig 9 topics which demonstrate statistically significant relationships with per article diversity are indicated with black dots on their corresponding bars fig 10 shows the temporal behavior of these negatively correlated r μ h d 0 05 topics wastewater treatment r 0 74 p value 6 54e 06 bf10 3602 16 was the only topic becoming less negatively correlated with per article diversity indicating an increasing co appearance with a wider variety of other topics in individual articles opposite trend was observed for modeling r 0 88 p value 4 93e 10 bf10 2 12e 07 water policy and planning r 0 63 p value 2 28e 4 bf10 147 57 precipitation r 0 87 p value 2 53e 09 bf10 4 71e 06 and climate change impacts r 0 87 p value 1 30e 09 bf10 8 69e 06 soil chemistry r 0 17 p value 0 37 bf10 0 34 does not demonstrate any significant trend 4 conclusions discussion we use semantic based topic diversity to quantify two types of topic diversities in hydrology and water science articles i within individual articles and ii across corpora both within individual journals and within a corpus of all water science journals with a 2018 if greater than 0 9 we tested the hypotheses that diversity was increasing in both respects and found evidence to support one of those hypotheses but not the other individual researchers appear to be broadening their scope across different subtopics in the discipline i e per paper topic diversity is increasing fig 4 and while individual topics are changing in popularity over time fig 3 the water science and hydrology corpus as a whole is not increasing nor decreasing in diversity fig 6 the primary findings of this study are see the four hypotheses outlined in section 1 1 at an article level the average shannon diversity of topics in individual research papers is increasing over the entire corpus r 0 95 p value 1 36e 14 b10 3 39e 11 there was a 4 44 rise in mean per article topic diversity translating to a 12 26 rise in the number of equally common topics per article between 1991 and 2019 2 at a corpus level the average shannon diversity of topics in the whole corpus is neither increasing nor decreasing r 0 43 p value 0 02 bf10 0 69 3 at a journal level the most topically diverse water science journals are water resources research w r r 3 45 nats journal of hydrology j h 3 40 nats hydrological processes h p 3 35 nats and journal of the american water resources association j a w r a 3 25 nats certain journals are increasing in their average per article topic diversity water resources research w r r advances in water resources a w r water research w r journal of contaminant hydrology j c h and journal of hydrology j h and three journals are decreasing in their average per article topic diversity hydrological sciences journal h s j hydrology and earth system sciences h e s s and journal of hydrometeorology j h m 4 at a topic level certain topics are more semantically different from the others in a sense that their appearance in an article tend to reduce the article diversity these topics are wastewater treatment modeling biodegradation soil chemistry water policy and planning precipitation and climate change impacts our interpretation of these findings is that water science research articles are becoming more topically diverse the increasing mixture of research topics in articles is most likely a bottom up effect driven by changing efforts attitudes and vision by individual researchers and perhaps of increasingly multidisciplinary education as called for by national research council 1991 however diversity of the overall corpus is not increasing if it were the case that both per paper diversity and the overall corpus diversity were increasing it would have been difficult to disentangle these effects the hydrology community could benefit from top down policies and actions which encourage more topically diverse and cross disciplinary research which we think will raise overall diversity the ability to automatically detect distinct sets of vocabularies as topics is a strength of unsupervised dynamic topic modeling however it is important to remember that any results from an analysis of topic model outputs is related to the words that define the topics as more topics emerge within our discipline through new knowledge increasing collaborations and conducive policies we expect topic modeling to continue being helpful toward tracking the evolution of hydrological sciences 4 1 future outlook the volume of scientific research in general is growing rapidly this makes it difficult for researchers to be confident about fully understanding the state of the science and also makes it challenging to expand into new research topics since so much background information is available for synthesis we expect that in the future machine learning methods like topic modeling will be an integral part of the tool set available to help scientists synthesize scientific literature while this paper provides multi level per paper per journal and whole corpus contextual insights into the current state of topic diversity in water research we envision that similar nlp based efforts might help us address problems related to semantically synthesizing diverse bodies of water science and hydrological literature there have been several bibliometric analyses of hydrology literature e g clark and hanson 2017 zare et al 2017 rajaram et al 2015 koutsoyiannis and kundzewicz 2007 mccurley and jawitz 2017 however nlp has the potential to allow for faster and more contextual analyses of larger corpora ldaseq also allows us to look at the evolution of topics in terms of their probabilistic distance and also their varying word topic distributions this paper serves as a preface to a currently undergoing hydrology topic evolution study interdisciplinary research has been identified as one of the ways to solve the world s biggest problems ledford 2015 however academia continues to be strangled by traditional stereotypes interdisciplinary proposals are less likely to receive funding bromham et al 2016 and institutions continue to enable this discrimination ledford 2015 while we cannot definitively say that interdisciplinarity is increasing in hydrological sciences the increasing per article diversity is an indicator that it may be this article lays the groundwork for further and much needed focus on interdisciplinarity in hydrological sciences credit authorship contribution statement mashrekur rahman conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data

prieto sierra from universidad de cantabria for their help identifying topic names appendix preprocessing the corpus performance of dynamic topic modeling is influenced by the quality of input training data article abstracts were preprocessed into a canonical format for efficacious feature extraction feldman et al 2007 to prepare the data we used separate temporally segregated dataframes of abstracts and metadata from each journal all sets of data were processed through identical multi layered cleaning routines we used spacy and nltk python libraries to filter non semantic elements such as stopwords punctuation and symbols and in addition we manually identified and removed unwanted elements that were common in our article abstracts the cleaned abstracts are available in the repository linked in the data and code availability statement at the end of this article in the next step we formed bi grams and segmented texts by tokenizing with whitespaces as word boundaries this was followed by lemmatization to extract semantic roots from conjugations etc using this corpus we created a map between words and integer identifiers we then converted this dictionary into a bag of words format making the corpus ready for ingestion by an ldaseq model implemented in g e n s i m a python library for nlp řehřek and sojka 2011 a 1 dynamic topic modeling to understand dynamic topic modeling we must start with latent dirichlet allocation lda lda builds on another more traditional topic modeling approach latent semantic analysis landauer et al 1998 and captures the intuition that text documents exhibit multiple topics in different proportions documents are represented as mixtures of topics per document topic distributions and each topic is characterized by a distribution over words per topic word distributions we can build an intuition of this model as follows it is assumed that the per document topic distributions of all documents in a corpus share a common dirichlet prior parameterized by parameters α and that the per topic word distributions also share a different common dirichlet prior parameterized by parameters β the distribution over a particular word w in a document d with topic distribution μ d can be understood as blei et al 2003 a 1 p w μ d β k 1 k p z k μ d p w z k β where z k is a particular topic from k total topics treating the per document topic distribution as latent and integrating over all n d words in each document d and over all m documents in corpus d gives a 2 p d α β d 1 m μ d p μ d α n 1 n d p w d n μ d β d μ d the above is an intuition only in actuality lda assumes a generating model i e a model of how the corpus was produced that samples each μ d once for each word in a corpus which means that each document contains a mixture of topics which is why each document has its own topic distribution called a per document topic distribution this means that each document d can be associated with an n d vector of topics z d one topic assignment out of k total topics for each word in the document this generating model is described in more detail by blei et al 2003 and others in a static topic model lda it is implicitly assumed that the documents are drawn from a fixed set of topics in an exchangeable sense however for many collections of documents the order of the documents reflect an evolving set of topics in the dynamic topic model dtm or ldaseq fig a 11 we divide the data by timestamps and then model each slice of documents with a number of topics where topics in time slice t d evolve from the topics associated with slice t d 1 unlike the static lda model the uncertainty about the distributions over words cannot be modeled by a dirichlet prior β we instead chain the natural parameters of each topic in a state space model which evolves with statistical noise in the same way the uncertainty over the per document topic distribution in each time slice is modeled using a logistic normal distribution with a mean α in this way topics and topic proportion distributions are chained together sequentially tying a collection of topic models here we use an ldaseq implementation in the python g e n s i m package we trained our models with the number of passes set to 5000 and chunksize number of documents in a batch set to 100 for finding the optimal number of topics we used a parallelized implementation of lda in g e n s i m to train individual models with topic sizes ranging from k 10 to k 80 each model trained using 40 shared memory cores on a single node of a high performance cluster using these settings it takes on the order of a few hours to train a single model between 3 15 h per model on our particular machine depending on k given that the ldaseq models take in the order of weeks to run we used the parallelized static lda for this analysis because our objective was to estimate a range of topics which might be optimal for both these classes of models a 2 choosing an optimal number of topics ideally it is desirable to maximize the number of topics identified by ldaseq to increase variety and depth in terms of how the model partitions subtopics in the discipline in practice a number of topics k above some unknown optimal number of topics k o p t increases the occurrence of common words among different topics resulting in compromised quality of topics lu et al 2011 we therefore adopted a hybrid quantitative qualitative approach for deciding the optimal number of topics k o p t a 2 1 data driven approach to choose an optimal number of topics we used a combination of perplexity p and coherence c scores to evaluate model performance over a range of different numbers of topics details on how coherence and perplexity are calculated and their underlying algorithms are given in appendix a 3 we trained lda models using identical hyperparameters for different numbers of topics from k 10 to k 80 logging the coherence c and perplexity p scores for each value of k the goal of this multi model training routine was to acquire a range of values of k within which k o p t was likely the resulting scores are plotted in fig a 12 coherence higher is better peaked at around k 25 with substantial noise around that value and there was no clear optimum in perplexity lower is better therefore to determine k o p t we additionally qualitatively considered a range of k 25 to k 50 see next subsection a 2 2 qualitative approach to choosing optimal number of topics qualitative perception of topics is a common step in essentially all topic modeling research e g sun et al 2017 paul and dredze 2014 jiang et al 2016 and allows for data driven evaluation metrics to be supported by manual validation we assessed the quality of topics for various values of k looking for increasing or decreasing occurrence of similar words within certain topics and backtracking into the dataframe to observe the titles of documents associated with each topic we drew on our prior experience in hydrology to make these assessments and also solicited input from several other professional hydrologists we used the aforementioned range of values of k and this subjective assessment to choose k o p t 45 a 3 perplexity and coherence perplexity is a popular metric for evaluating language models chen et al 1998 perplexity is an information theory metric that measures something like how surprised the model might be on the introduction of new data zhao et al 2015 formally defined by blei et al 2003 perplexity for a collection of m documents is a 3 p e x p d 1 m l o g p w d d 1 m n d perplexity is a decreasing function of the probability assigned to each per document word distribution lower perplexity indicates a better model topic coherence c is a measure of similarity in semantics between the high probability words in a certain topic we use g e n s i m s built in topic coherence model which is an implementation of the method described by röder et al 2015 calculating topic coherence is a four stage process involving segmentation of word subsets probability calculation confirmation measure and aggregation fig a 13 adapted from röder et al 2015 illustrates these four steps t represents an input collection of words and the first stage creates a set of different kinds of segmentation of words s from t since coherence measures the fitting together of words or a set of words secondly probabilities of occurrence of words p are calculated based on reference corpus confirmation measure ingests both p and s to yield the agreements φ of pairs of s in the final step the aforementioned scores are aggregated to compute coherence c 
2804,we used natural language processing nlp to assess topic diversity in all research articles 75 000 from eighteen water science and hydrology journals published between 1991 and 2019 we found that individual water science and hydrology research articles are becoming increasingly diverse in the sense that on average the number of topics represented in individual articles is increasing which may be a sign of increasing interdisciplinarity this is true even though the body of water science and hydrology literature as a whole is not becoming more topically diverse topics with the largest increases in popularity were climate change impacts water policy planning and pollutant removal topics with the largest decreases in popularity were stochastic models and numerical models at a journal level water resources research journal of hydrology and hydrological processes are the three most topically diverse journals among the corpus that we studied keywords topic diversity water resources science hydrology natural language processing topic modeling machine learning data availability the code and data to reproduce all results and figures are available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6976752 1 introduction in the early stages of hydrology and water resources science the focus was on bringing together natural scientists engineers and social scientists harshbarger and evans 1967 freeze 1990 identified a separation between physical and social sciences in water research and encouraged the journal water resources research w r r to encourage then limited partnerships to encourage the mixture of these topics a report by the national research council 1991 focused on the importance of a diverse educational base in hydrology and encouraged multidisciplinary hydrological research as necessary to understand and predict the full global water cycle over the next decade hydrologic sciences became central to new research topics e g hydroclimatology hydrometeorology geobiology hydroecology hydrogeomorphology ecogeomorphology earth system dynamics etc national research council 2012 in the modern era montanari et al 2013 argued that the scientific decade 2013 2022 would focus on advanced monitoring and data analysis techniques and that diversity in water science could be sought through connecting economic sciences and geosciences montanari et al 2015 later argued that this branching of sub topics in hydrologic sciences has given rise to a vibrant interdisciplinary research culture that focuses on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales and interactions between water earth and biological systems ruddell and wagener 2015 mentioned that hydrology education must expand beyond traditional scopes to address the evolving and unique needs of society e g data and modeling driven cybereducation developing an international faculty learning community hydro economics etc vogel et al 2015 described a modern hydrologic science that develops deeper understanding of human nature connections he argued that every theoretical hydrologic model introduced previously is in need of revision to properly capture nonstationarity in nature proposing knowledge discovery through big data to understand the coupled human hydrologic system the 21st century saw a sharp rise in demand for more robust diverse hydrologic models which account for nonstationarity associated with climate change e g milly et al 2008 bayazit 2015 galloway 2011 and leverage large samples of available data gupta et al 2014 nearing et al 2021 argued that modern data science has the potential to transform water science given concerted effort to bring together hydrologists with data scientists computer scientists and statisticians regardless of how we perceive open challenges in the discipline it is important for scientists and practitioners to have some idea about whether and how the water science and hydrology science community is changing in this study we identify and quantify trends and interactions in and between different subtopics within the discipline specifically we measure trends and diversity of different sub topics within the discipline and we use these analyses to provide some insight into the state of topic diversity in the field water research articles encompass a wide range of research topics including groundwater streamflow climate change eco hydrology biogeochemistry water quality etc all of which are consequential to global socioeconomic well being mccurley and jawitz 2017 attempted to assess interdisciplinarity in hydrology by analyzing instances of topic keywords in article titles however their corpus consisted of article titles from only one journal w r r and used pre identified keywords and topics in this paper we look at a broad spectrum of water science and hydrology research publications our corpus encompasses 18 high impact journals and use data science techniques to help partially automate the process of identifying distinct sub topics in the discipline one of the major challenges faced by all scientific communities is the increasing volume of peer reviewed literature fig 1 quantifies this phenomenon in hydrology and water science recent advances in computational linguistics machine learning and a variety of application ready toolboxes for natural language processing nlp can help facilitate analyses of vast electronic corpora for a variety of objectives cambria and white 2014 these techniques which include information retrieval text categorization and other text mining techniques based on machine learning have been gaining popularity in information systems since the 1990s sebastiani 2002 topic modeling is a particular type of nlp that uses statistical algorithms to extract semantic information from a collection of texts in the form of thematic classes jiang et al 2016 topic models can be applied to massive collections of documents blei 2012 and have been used to recommend scientific articles based on content and user ratings wang and blei 2011 topic modeling has also been used to cluster scientific documents yau et al 2014 improve bibliographic search jardine and teufel 2014 pham et al 2018 shu et al 2009 tang et al 2008 paul and girju 2009 and for a variety of application specific objectives such as statistical modeling of the biomedical corpora blei et al 2006 bibliometric exploration of hydropower research jiang et al 2016 in the analysis of research trends in personal information privacy choi et al 2017 development of meta review in cloud computing literature upreti et al 2016 literature review of social science articles li and liu 2018 discovering themes and trends in transportation research sun et al 2017 identifying contribution of authors in knowledge management literature jussila et al 2017 exploring the history of cognition priva and austerweil 2015 and exploring topic divergence and similarities in scientific conferences hall et al 2008 as opposed to s c i e n t o m e t r i c s techniques mingers and leydesdorff 2015 which have been traditionally used for ranking articles and authors based on citation data topic modeling allows for a contextual understanding of particular scientific domains and disciplines motivated by the success of topic modeling in a wide range of applications we explore its potential to aid bibliometric exploration of peer reviewed water science literature in particular we explore the question of whether peer reviewed water science literature is increasing in diversity with respect to sub topics in the discipline the specific hypotheses that we will explore are individual hydrology research papers are becoming more topically diverse i e it is increasing at the level of individual research projects the hydrology and water science corpus as a whole is becoming more topically diverse there is a difference in per paper topic diversity between different water science journals some topics are negatively correlated to diversity in the community research output 2 methods table 1 lists notation used throughout this paper including variables and indices related to the model and corpus the corpus that we analyzed is described in section 2 1 below we analyzed this corpus using sequential latent dirichlet allocation ldaseq in gensim řehřek and sojka 2011 based on blei and lafferty 2006 s dynamic topic model dtm to identify dominant topics and to associate topics with individual research articles ldaseq is described in appendix this nlp method identifies topics by associating a unique set of words that frequently co appear together in timestamped documents and assigns weights to each of those words based on their likelihood of appearance within a particular topic 2 1 corpus peer reviewed abstracts offer snapshots of the historical and current trends and developments in both theoretical and applied research in this study we use abstracts because they are intended to be concise representations of full texts and are used often for bibliometric analyses griffiths and steyvers 2004 gatti et al 2015 the corpus that we use consists of abstracts from all peer reviewed articles published in eighteen water science journals between 1991 and 2019 this is all water science journals with a 2018 impact factor if of greater than 0 9 scimago journal and country rank the list of journals and journal abbreviations along with corresponding ifs years of available data and total number of abstracts are listed in table 2 in total 74 479 article abstracts were acquired from the web of science core collection in the form of bib files methods for pre processing this corpus are described in appendix 2 2 analysis methods to reiterate from the introduction the hypotheses that we want to test are about whether hydrology and water science research is becoming more topically diverse over time we will test these hypotheses by exploring sub topics within the discipline and measuring whether individual research articles individual journals and the body of water science and hydrology literature as a whole is becoming more topically diverse the analysis tools that we use to address these research questions are described below this analysis was applied to the posterior document topic and topic word expectations from a trained ldaseq model with 45 topics k o p t 45 we used a combination of objective subjective method to choose the optimal number of topics details of this process can be found in appendix 2 2 1 temporal trends in topic distributions there are multiple methods of analyzing temporal trends and distributions of topics griffiths and steyvers 2004 applied a disjointed time blind topic model and rearranged documents according to their publication dates blei and lafferty 2006 developed a sequential topic modeling approach that learns time dynamic parameters for the document topic and topic word distributions constrained by linear filtering theory wang and mccallum 2006 introduced a non markov joint modeling framework where topics are associated with a continuous distribution over document timestamps we initially tested griffiths and steyvers 2004 s approach of time unaware topic modeling and post hoc aggregation of results according to timestamp for benchmarking due to the sequential nature of our data we chose dynamic topic modeling blei and lafferty 2006 approach for this study because unlike a time blind topic model it provides a qualitative scope into the contents of a large textual dataset in addition to providing us with a quantitative predictive model for our sequential corpus we calculated temporal topic distributions for a given year μ k t as the proportion of all topic weights over all papers from a given year t 1 μ k t d 1 m μ k d i t d t d 1 m i t d t μ k d represents the weight for topic k assigned to document d t d is the year in which document d was published and i is an indicator function such that i 0 1 and i x 0 for x 0 henceforth i will carry the same meaning statistical significance of these trends were assessed using standard linear regression analysis between variables in each case we computed the i pearson correlation coefficient r as the strength of association between variables ii the p value for the t test of the correlation coefficient against a null hypothesis of zero trend and iii the bayes factor b10 as a measure of the strength of evidence toward the alternate nonzero trend hypothesis 2 2 2 measurement of topic diversity shannon entropy shannon 1948 is a classic diversity metric that is used among many other things in ecology studies to quantify the diversity of species in a given ecosystem or location e g harte and newman 2014 sherwin and prat i fornells 2019 intuitively we propose that articles can be analogous to ecological sites and topics are analogous to species we used the shannon entropy based metric applied to topic distributions to measure diversity at corpus and article levels 2 2 3 measuring diversity at the article level we used shannon entropy to measure the topic diversity h d for each article in our corpus as 2 h d k 1 k μ k d l o g μ k d where μ k is the distribution of topics over document d we also calculated the mean shannon diversity in documents per year as h t ˆ 3 h t ˆ d 1 m h d i t d t d 1 m i t d t finally we calculated the shannon diversity of topics in documents per journal per year h j t as 4 h j t d 1 m h d i j d j t d t l 1 k d 1 m h d i j d j t d t shannon diversity is represented using the natural unit of information nat where 1 nat represents the information contained in an event when the probability of that event occurring is 1 e 2 2 4 measuring diversity at the journal and corpus level we calculated shannon diversity at the corpus level and then computed these corpus indexes for both the entire corpus and for each journal to do this we began by calculating the k nomial distribution over topics μ j in a particular set of articles j either a journal or the whole corpus although we will hereafter refer to subscript j as referring to a specific journal 5 μ k j d 1 m μ k d i j d j l 1 k d 1 m μ l d i j d j where μ k j is the relative popularity of a particular topic in a particular journal as a fraction of popularity of all topics in the journal we then calculated the total entropy of each μ j topic distribution as h j which is a measure of the shannon diversity of the per journal topic distributions 6 h j k 1 k μ k j l o g μ k j the popularity of a particular topic in a particular journal for a particular year μ k j t is a fraction of the popularity of all topics in that journal and year 7 μ k j t d 1 m μ k d i j d j t d t l 1 k d 1 m μ l d i j d j t d t we used these per year per journal topic distributions to construct time series of individual topic popularity in each journal μ k j t which allowed us to quantify the evolving diversity of topic distributions in individual journals over time 2 3 correlation between pairs of topics we calculate the correlation coefficient between pairs of topics this allows us to broadly separate frequently co occurring i e exist within the same article topics from the ones which do not frequently co occur the correlation coefficient between topic weights over the whole corpus m for each pair of topics r k j was calculated as 8 r k j d 1 m μ k d μ ˆ k d μ j d μ ˆ j d d 1 m μ k d μ ˆ k d 2 d 1 m μ j d μ ˆ j d 2 where μ k d is the weight for topic k assigned to document d and μ k d ˆ is the mean weight for a topic k assigned over all documents in the corpus and μ j d is the weight for a topic j assigned to document d and μ j d ˆ is the mean weight for topic j assigned over all documents in the corpus we only report correlations greater than 0 2 2 4 correlation between topics and per article diversity we observe the correlation between topics and per article diversity in water science articles by observing the statistical relationship between topic distribution weights and article diversity this allows us to identify which topics participate more or less often in articles with greater or lesser topic diversity intuitively a negative statistical relationship between topic distribution weights and article diversity indicates decreasing article diversity when certain topics are more present within an article we denote the correlation coefficient between document topic distributions and their corresponding article diversity scores entropy metrics as r μ h d 3 results and analysis 3 1 naming the topics the first step toward using the posterior expectations of the ldaseq model is naming the topics we identified and named k 45 topics by first looking at the topic word distributions the set of words most likely to appear within a particular topic and the per document topic distributions from the titles of 100 articles most closely associated with each topic we reinforced our choices of topic names with an informal survey sent to four qualified hydrologists outside of our research group fig 2 illustrates the topic word distributions of k 45 topics in the form of wordclouds along with our chosen topic names this topic naming analysis was similar to what was done by mccurley and jawitz 2017 who looked at topic diversity in w r r papers as described in the introduction those authors assigned seven topics in hydrology prior to their analysis catchment hydrology hydro geology hydro meteorology contaminant hydrology socio hydrology and hydro climatology our post hoc identified topics extracted using ldaseq were conceptually similar to these however ldaseq was able to extract a larger and more nuanced set of topics through unsupervised learning 3 2 temporal trends of topics in the full corpus the popularity of each topic changes with time and these trends are also shown in fig 2 some topics demonstrated statistically significant rising trends in popularity table 3 some of these rising topic trends e g rainfall runoff precipitation rainfall spatial variability might be attributed to researchers increasingly leveraging the availability and accessibility of hydrology related data both in terms of breadth and depth other topics demonstrated statistically significant downward trends table 3 the remainder of topics do not demonstrate any significant trend within our corpus fig 3 shows the relative popularity of topics over time plotted on the same scale fig 2 shows the same topic trends but not normalized considering the relative popularity of topics in 1991 vs 2019 topics that lost the most popularity within our corpus over 50 are stochastic models 62 numerical modeling 61 solute transport 56 conversely the topics that gained the most over 50 are climate change impacts 155 water policy planning 143 pollutant removal 117 watershed features 72 irrigation 60 modeling 57 precipitation 57 and rainfall 55 these changes in the popularity of topics can be perhaps interpreted as shifting focus of researchers who publish their works within the journals in our corpus these changes reflect the increasing effects of climate change on water availability and rainfall increasing water stress and an ever more pressing need for sustainable and efficient water management e g mehran et al 2017 tabari 2020 padrón et al 2020 gudmundsson et al 2021 in addition to leveraging the availability of data water researchers are responding to the needs of the time 3 3 are articles becoming more topically diverse the corpus wide mean per article diversity metric is shown in fig 4 our findings indicate the average diversity of topics within individual water science articles is increasing overall regression based trend analysis for the shannon diversity metric time from the entire corpus are r 0 95 p value 1 36e 14 b10 3 39e 11 indicating a statistically significant trend at any reasonable significance threshold to gain an intuitive interpretation of this change in diversity we applied another metric from ecological biological sciences ens effective number of species in our case we will call it ent effective number of topics where e n t e h d as an example if e n t x for mean per article diversity h t ˆ for year t h t ˆ is equivalent to articles containing x count of equally common topics in our corpus the mean effective number of topics e n t per article steadily rose from 13 62 in 1991 to 15 29 in 2019 this means a 4 44 rise in mean per article topic diversity translates to 12 26 rise in the number of equally common topics per article between 1991 and 2019 this rising ent can also be interpreted intuitively as an indicator of water researchers absorbing knowledge from topics within other disciplines through interdisciplinary collaborations and education 3 4 which journals are contributing to per article diversity to understand which journals are contributing to the trend of increasing diversity of topics in individual research articles we calculated the mean diversity of articles per year for each of the eighteen journals as shown in fig 5 as before we used linear regression to assess the significance of temporal trends in these per journal time series water resources research w r r demonstrates the strongest rise as an individual journal in the mean diversity of topics per article published between 1991 and 2019 r 0 92 p value 2 39e 12 bf10 2 77e 09 other journals with overall rise in per article diversity within our corpus are advances in water resources a w r r 0 69 p value 5 69e 05 bf10 513 33 water research w r r 0 67 p value 9 14e 05 bf10 336 08 journal of contaminant hydrology j c h r 0 67 p value 1 05e 05 bf10 297 751 and journal of hydrology j h r 0 57 p value 1 57e 03 bf10 27 06 while these results do not directly translate to a rise of interdisciplinarity within these journals they most certainly indicate increasing diversification of topics this increasing diversification can be driven by multiple factors which again includes researchers creating new and absorbing knowledge from other disciplines journals which demonstrate moderate rises in per article diversities are water resources management w r m r 0 46 p value 0 026 bf10 2 68 and hydrogeology journal h g j r 0 43 p value 0 05 bf10 1 59 journal of water resource planning management j w r p m r 0 28 p value 0 15 bf10 0 62 journal of the american water resources association j a w r a r 0 11 p value 0 64 bf10 0 29 and hydrological processes h p r 0 02 p value 0

hydrology earth system sciences h e s s r 0 36 p value 0 09 bf10 1 00 and journal of hydrometeorology j h m r 0 30 p value 0 21 bf10 0 59 decreased the rest of the journals do not have publication records long enough for trend analysis the declining per article diversity trends could mean that these journals are increasingly favoring a particular set of topics or that researchers working on certain topics are favoring these journals 3 5 is the whole corpus becoming more topically diverse fig 6 shows the temporal variability of topic entropy diversity over time for the entire corpus dashed black line and for each individual journal solid colored lines this differs from the average per article diversity metrics reported in the previous subsection in that these metrics are calculated over the topic distributions averaged over all papers in the corpus journal whereas the per article diversity metrics diversity of presumably individual research projects the corpus metrics measure the diversity of topics overall in a journal or corpus and measure the mixture of topics at community level rather than at the level of individual research projects the diversity for the entire corpus rose very slightly in the late 1990s and since then the entropy of the entire corpus has remained steady or slightly decreased however no definite trend exists overall r 0 43 p value 0 02 bf10 0 69 this emphasized the disentanglement of per article diversity from corpus diversity showing that increasing article level diversity does not necessarily translate to overall corpus diversity we used fig 6 to also visualize the per journal topic diversity trends statistically significant upward diversity trends can be seen for advances in water resources a w r r 0 79 p value 2 68e 07 bf10 6 59e 04 water resources research w r r r 0 713 p value 1 39e 05 bf10 1824 36 journal of water resources planning management j w r p m r 0 69 p value 3 73e 05 bf10 745 97 and hydrogeology journal h g j r 0 52 p value 0 01 bf10 5 13 journals which demonstrated statistically significant downward trends were water research w r r 0 64 p value 1 70e 04 bf10 191 81 and hydrological sciences journal h s j r 0 59 p value 8 04e 04 bf10 48 40 other journals did not demonstrate any significant trend in entropy over time here again evidences of disentanglement between per article diversity and overall corpus diversity can be seen at a journal level 3 6 overall journal diversity the stacked bar plots in fig 7 show the relative fraction of topic representation in each journal with the total height of each bar representing the journal s topic entropy water resources research w r r 3 45 nats journal of hydrology j h 3 40 nats hydrological processes h p 3 35 nats and journal of the american water resources association j a w r a 3 25 nats are the most topically diverse journals in our corpus we can again intuitively interpret these values in terms of e n t meaning that these journals have published the highest numbers of equally common topics within the entire dataset the overall shannon diversity per journal decreases for more specialty journals i e journals which focus atmospheric science topics journal of hydrometeorology j h m and water management topics water resources management w r m journal of water resources planning management j w r p m journals with a fairly recent publication history i e environmental science water research and technology e s w r t international soil and water conservation research i s w c r journal of hydrology regional studies j h r e g and water resources and industry w r i had lower overall diversity compared to the rest of the corpus which is expected 3 7 correlations between topic pairs to reiterate from section 2 3 we observe the correlations both positive and negative between pairs of topics to understand which topics co appear frequently in our corpus 3 7 1 co appearing topics an intuitive way to depict inter topic correlations r k j are chord diagrams r k j correlation coefficients measure relationships between per paper topic weights meaning that a higher r k j value indicates papers that contain word groups associated with topic k also tend to contain word groups associated with topic j positive correlation coefficients between pairs of topics indicate some degree of co appearance of these topics in research articles and vice versa positive and negative inter topic correlations are shown in fig 8 where the width of each chord represents the overall correlation between a pair of topics for ease of viewing positive correlations are only plotted for r k j 0 20 and negative correlations r k j 0 20 inter topic correlation plots for the entire corpus lends us a snapshot of co appearing topics 3 7 2 positive and negative inter topic correlations positive correlations or likelihood of co occurrence can be observed for a range of topics e g between rainfall and streamflow rainfall and spatial variability uncertainty and stochastic models land surface flux and hydrogeology groundwater and solute transport and microbiology and wastewater treatment anti correlations indicate that there are set of vocabulary in the water science literature that are largely not shared between sub communities for example pollutant removal and land surface flux pollutant removal and vadose zone water policy and planning and uncertainty numerical modeling and reservoir management and irrigation and sediment transport are less likely to co appear within our corpus these negative correlations between topics indicate potential for expanding avenues of collaborative research 3 8 correlation between individual topics and per article diversity reiterating from section 2 4 we quantify relationships between per article diversity and corresponding topic weights some topics in our corpus tend to reduce the paper wise diversity when they appear in an article meaning they are less likely to appear alongside a wide variety of other topics statistical relationship between mean per article shannon diversities h d and their corresponding topic distribution weights μ are shown in fig 9 topics which demonstrate statistically significant relationships with per article diversity are indicated with black dots on their corresponding bars fig 10 shows the temporal behavior of these negatively correlated r μ h d 0 05 topics wastewater treatment r 0 74 p value 6 54e 06 bf10 3602 16 was the only topic becoming less negatively correlated with per article diversity indicating an increasing co appearance with a wider variety of other topics in individual articles opposite trend was observed for modeling r 0 88 p value 4 93e 10 bf10 2 12e 07 water policy and planning r 0 63 p value 2 28e 4

significant trend 4 conclusions discussion we use semantic based topic diversity to quantify two types of topic diversities in hydrology and water science articles i within individual articles and ii across corpora both within individual journals and within a corpus of all water science journals with a 2018 if greater than 0 9 we tested the hypotheses that diversity was increasing in both respects and found evidence to support one of those hypotheses but not the other individual researchers appear to be broadening their scope across different subtopics in the discipline i e per paper topic diversity is increasing fig 4 and while individual topics are changing in popularity over time fig 3 the water science and hydrology corpus as a whole is not increasing nor decreasing in diversity fig 6 the primary findings of this study are see the four hypotheses outlined in section 1 1 at an article level the average shannon diversity of topics in individual research papers is increasing over the entire corpus r 0 95 p value 1 36e 14 b10 3 39e 11 there was a 4 44 rise in mean per article topic diversity translating to a 12 26 rise in the number of equally common topics per article between 1991 and 2019 2 at a corpus level the average shannon diversity of topics in the whole corpus is neither increasing nor decreasing r 0 43 p value 0 02 bf10 0 69 3 at a journal level the most topically diverse water science journals are water resources research w r r 3 45 nats journal of hydrology j h 3 40 nats hydrological processes h p 3 35 nats and journal of the american water resources association j a w r a 3 25 nats certain journals are increasing in their average per article topic diversity water resources research w r r advances in water resources a w r water research w r journal of contaminant hydrology j c h and journal of hydrology j h and three journals are decreasing in their average per article topic diversity hydrological sciences journal h s j hydrology and earth system sciences h e s s and journal of hydrometeorology j h m 4 at a topic level certain topics are more semantically different from the others in a sense that their appearance in an article tend to reduce the article diversity these topics are wastewater treatment modeling biodegradation soil chemistry water policy and planning precipitation and climate change impacts our interpretation of these findings is that water science research articles are becoming more topically diverse the increasing mixture of research topics in articles is most likely a bottom up effect driven by changing efforts attitudes and vision by individual researchers and perhaps of increasingly multidisciplinary education as called for by national research council 1991 however diversity of the overall corpus is not increasing if it were the case that both per paper diversity and the overall corpus diversity were increasing it would have been difficult to disentangle these effects the hydrology community could benefit from top down policies and actions which encourage more topically diverse and cross disciplinary research which we think will raise overall diversity the ability to automatically detect distinct sets of vocabularies as topics is a strength of unsupervised dynamic topic modeling however it is important to remember that any results from an analysis of topic model outputs is related to the words that define the topics as more topics emerge within our discipline through new knowledge increasing collaborations and conducive policies we expect topic modeling to continue being helpful toward tracking the evolution of hydrological sciences 4 1 future outlook the volume of scientific research in general is growing rapidly this makes it difficult for researchers to be confident about fully understanding the state of the science and also makes it challenging to expand into new research topics since so much background information is available for synthesis we expect that in the future machine learning methods like topic modeling will be an integral part of the tool set available to help scientists synthesize scientific literature while this paper provides multi level per paper per journal and whole corpus contextual insights into the current state of topic diversity in water research we envision that similar nlp based efforts might help us address problems related to semantically synthesizing diverse bodies of water science and hydrological literature there have been several bibliometric analyses of hydrology literature e g clark and hanson 2017 zare et al 2017 rajaram et al 2015 koutsoyiannis and kundzewicz 2007 mccurley and jawitz 2017 however nlp has the potential to allow for faster and more contextual analyses of larger corpora ldaseq also allows us to look at the evolution of topics in terms of their probabilistic distance and also their varying word topic distributions this paper serves as a preface to a currently undergoing hydrology topic evolution study interdisciplinary research has been identified as one of the ways to solve the world s biggest problems ledford 2015 however academia continues to be strangled by traditional stereotypes interdisciplinary proposals are less likely to receive funding bromham et al 2016 and institutions continue to enable this discrimination ledford 2015 while we cannot definitively say that interdisciplinarity is increasing in hydrological sciences the increasing per article diversity is an indicator that it may be this article lays the groundwork for further and much needed focus on interdisciplinarity in hydrological sciences credit authorship contribution statement mashrekur rahman conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation resources data

prieto sierra from universidad de cantabria for their help identifying topic names appendix preprocessing the corpus performance of dynamic topic modeling is influenced by the quality of input training data article abstracts were preprocessed into a canonical format for efficacious feature extraction feldman et al 2007 to prepare the data we used separate temporally segregated dataframes of abstracts and metadata from each journal all sets of data were processed through identical multi layered cleaning routines we used spacy and nltk python libraries to filter non semantic elements such as stopwords punctuation and symbols and in addition we manually identified and removed unwanted elements that were common in our article abstracts the cleaned abstracts are available in the repository linked in the data and code availability statement at the end of this article in the next step we formed bi grams and segmented texts by tokenizing with whitespaces as word boundaries this was followed by lemmatization to extract semantic roots from conjugations etc using this corpus we created a map between words and integer identifiers we then converted this dictionary into a bag of words format making the corpus ready for ingestion by an ldaseq model implemented in g e n s i m a python library for nlp řehřek and sojka 2011 a 1 dynamic topic modeling to understand dynamic topic modeling we must start with latent dirichlet allocation lda lda builds on another more traditional topic modeling approach latent semantic analysis landauer et al 1998 and captures the intuition that text documents exhibit multiple topics in different proportions documents are represented as mixtures of topics per document topic distributions and each topic is characterized by a distribution over words per topic word distributions we can build an intuition of this model as follows it is assumed that the per document topic distributions of all documents in a corpus share a common dirichlet prior parameterized by parameters α and that the per topic word distributions also share a different common dirichlet prior parameterized by parameters β the distribution over a particular word w in a document d with topic distribution μ d can be understood as blei et al 2003 a 1 p w μ d β k 1 k p z k μ d p w z k β where z k is a particular topic from k total topics treating the per document topic distribution as latent and integrating over all n d words in each document d and over all m documents in corpus d gives a 2 p d α β d 1 m μ d p μ d α n 1 n d p w d n μ d β d μ d the above is an intuition only in actuality lda assumes a generating model i e a model of how the corpus was produced that samples each μ d once for each word in a corpus which means that each document contains a mixture of topics which is why each document has its own topic distribution called a per document topic distribution this means that each document d can be associated with an n d vector of topics z d one topic assignment out of k total topics for each word in the document this generating model is described in more detail by blei et al 2003 and others in a static topic model lda it is implicitly assumed that the documents are drawn from a fixed set of topics in an exchangeable sense however for many collections of documents the order of the documents reflect an evolving set of topics in the dynamic topic model dtm or ldaseq fig a 11 we divide the data by timestamps and then model each slice of documents with a number of topics where topics in time slice t d evolve from the topics associated with slice t d 1 unlike the static lda model the uncertainty about the distributions over words cannot be modeled by a dirichlet prior β we instead chain the natural parameters of each topic in a state space model which evolves with statistical noise in the same way the uncertainty over the per document topic distribution in each time slice is modeled using a logistic normal distribution with a mean α in this way topics and topic proportion distributions are chained together sequentially tying a collection of topic models here we use an ldaseq implementation in the python g e n s i m package we trained our models with the number of passes set to 5000 and chunksize number of documents in a batch set to 100 for finding the optimal number of topics we used a parallelized implementation of lda in g e n s i m to train individual models with topic sizes ranging from k 10 to k 80 each model trained using 40 shared memory cores on a single node of a high performance cluster using these settings it takes on the order of a few hours to train a single model between 3 15 h per model on our particular machine depending on k given that the ldaseq models take in the order of weeks to run we used the parallelized static lda for this analysis because our objective was to estimate a range of topics which might be optimal for both these classes of models a 2 choosing an optimal number of topics ideally it is desirable to maximize the number of topics identified by ldaseq to increase variety and depth in terms of how the model partitions subtopics in the discipline in practice a number of topics k above some unknown optimal number of topics k o p t increases the occurrence of common words among different topics resulting in compromised quality of topics lu et al 2011 we therefore adopted a hybrid quantitative qualitative approach for deciding the optimal number of topics k o p t a 2 1 data driven approach to choose an optimal number of topics we used a combination of perplexity p and coherence c scores to evaluate model performance over a range of different numbers of topics details on how coherence and perplexity are calculated and their underlying algorithms are given in appendix a 3 we trained lda models using identical hyperparameters for different numbers of topics from k 10 to k 80 logging the coherence c and perplexity p scores for each value of k the goal of this multi model training routine was to acquire a range of values of k within which k o p t was likely the resulting scores are plotted in fig a 12 coherence higher is better peaked at around k 25 with substantial noise around that value and there was no clear optimum in perplexity lower is better therefore to determine k o p t we additionally qualitatively considered a range of k 25 to k 50 see next subsection a 2 2 qualitative approach to choosing optimal number of topics qualitative perception of topics is a common step in essentially all topic modeling research e g sun et al 2017 paul and dredze 2014 jiang et al 2016 and allows for data driven evaluation metrics to be supported by manual validation we assessed the quality of topics for various values of k looking for increasing or decreasing occurrence of similar words within certain topics and backtracking into the dataframe to observe the titles of documents associated with each topic we drew on our prior experience in hydrology to make these assessments and also solicited input from several other professional hydrologists we used the aforementioned range of values of k and this subjective assessment to choose k o p t 45 a 3 perplexity and coherence perplexity is a popular metric for evaluating language models chen et al 1998 perplexity is an information theory metric that measures something like how surprised the model might be on the introduction of new data zhao et al 2015 formally defined by blei et al 2003 perplexity for a collection of m documents is a 3 p e x p d 1 m l o g p w d d 1 m n d perplexity is a decreasing function of the probability assigned to each per document word distribution lower perplexity indicates a better model topic coherence c is a measure of similarity in semantics between the high probability words in a certain topic we use g e n s i m s built in topic coherence model which is an implementation of the method described by röder et al 2015 calculating topic coherence is a four stage process involving segmentation of word subsets probability calculation confirmation measure and aggregation fig a 13 adapted from röder et al 2015 illustrates these four steps t represents an input collection of words and the first stage creates a set of different kinds of segmentation of words s from t since coherence measures the fitting together of words or a set of words secondly probabilities of occurrence of words p are calculated based on reference corpus confirmation measure ingests both p and s to yield the agreements φ of pairs of s in the final step the aforementioned scores are aggregated to compute coherence c
