7315,hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes in western north america mountain peatlands exist in different hydrogeological settings across a range climatic conditions and vary in floristic composition the sustainability of these ecosystems particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle we conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands with differing vegetation hydrogeological setting sloping vs basin and climate strong vs weak monsoon influence growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site the sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season alternatively the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients a zero flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration the differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover this research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration which were several fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands keywords wetland peatland ecohydrology groundwater mountain evapotranspiration 1 introduction one of the most important ecohydrological characteristics of wetland ecosystems is the presence of saturated soils a water table wt near the soil surface creates an interaction of groundwater flow with a biologically active zone where plants and soil microbes dominate biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions these conditions contribute to the critical ecological services provided by wetlands including the removal of groundwater contaminants before they reach surface waters kellogg et al 2009 and sequestration of atmospheric carbon c gorham 1991 further the water logged soil conditions found in wetlands exert a strong control on plant production and community composition dwire et al 2006 wolfe et al 2006 and contribute greatly to the conservation value of these ecosystems near surface water tables are particularly important in mountain peatlands where they play a critical role in sustaining organic soils chimner and cooper 2003 millar et al 2017 schimelpfenig et al 2013 and their characteristic vegetation cooper and andrus 1994 peatlands exist at high elevations in mountainous regions across the globe chagué goff et al 2010 cooper et al 2012 pullens et al 2016 these ecosystems provide important refugia for regionally rare plant species typically found in boreal regions chimner et al 2010 serve as locally important c sinks chimner and cooper 2003 and act as important regulators of groundwater fluxes as they are typically positioned at focal points for groundwater and surface water flow on the landscape winter 1999 the majority of precipitation in temperate continental mountain regions such as those found in western north america generally falls during the winter and spring as snow providing most of the water that sustains wetlands woods et al 2006 monsoon driven rainfall can also serve as important water sources for mountain ecosystems during the growing season mahmood and vivoni 2014 depending on geographic location and differences in late summer precipitation regime at sufficient spatial scales may differentially affect wt dynamics in mountain peatlands because the wt is often within or above the root zone of hydrophytes mountain peatlands also play a distinctive role in groundwater flow dynamics with considerable amounts of water potentially being lost via actual evapotranspiration consequently actual evapotranspiration eta from the saturated groundwater zone etg may exert a strong control on the water budget and wt position fahle and dietrich 2014 in the past several decades a warming climate in temperate mountain regions has affected seasonal water fluxes higher air temperatures have led to reductions in peak snow pack and forced earlier melting in spring with more winter precipitation falling as rain instead of snow christensen and lettenmaier 2007 regonda et al 2004 this shift in the timing of key hydrological processes has reduced late summer stream flows and led to drought stress in riparian ecosystems clow 2010 hamlet et al 2005 rood et al 2008 increases in air temperatures leading to longer growing seasons and increases in vapor pressure deficit have been associated with increased wetland evapotranspiration and a subsequent decrease in wt during the growing season bridgham et al 1999 riutta et al 2007 roulet et al 1992 further changes in wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 solar radiation wild 2009 and continental scale drying milly and dunne 2016 all impact eta under a changing climate mountain peatlands are typically small relative to those found in boreal regions due to steep slopes and valley confinement patterson and cooper 2007 and therefore may be more susceptible to climate driven changes in groundwater dynamics than peatlands occurring in larger groundwater flow systems kløve et al 2014 further mountain peatlands located at the low end of their known elevation range can be particularly susceptible to climate change due to already lower growing season wt positions compared to those at higher elevation millar et al 2017 mountain peatlands can occur under strikingly different hydrogeological settings including hillslopes and basins because groundwater inputs are critical for their sustainability wolf and cooper 2015 characterizing subsurface flows in these ecosystems is prerequisite to determining future changes in ecohydrological processes to better understand the effects of climate change on groundwater dependent ecosystems feedbacks between biological and hydrological processes must be accounted for kløve et al 2014 in peatlands etg and wt position are interdependent and diurnal changes in wt can be used along with meteorological data to estimate etg losses from the saturated zone fahle and dietrich 2014 however previous applications of this approach typically cover brief periods of time carlson mazur et al 2013 loheide 2008 and do not account for changes in plant biomass over the course of a growing season accounting for plant phenology in such models is a necessary step for simulating saturated zone water fluxes over the course of a growing season where photosynthetic biomass of wetland plants increases following snow melt and decreases during senescence in the fall in this study we investigated hydrological processes in two mountain peatlands one in a basin setting with sparse coverage of sedges and a strong monsoon influence and another in sloping setting with a dense coverage of sedges and shrubs with a weaker monsoon influence using field investigations and statistically robust empirical models of groundwater fluxes we hypothesized that the water budget components would be substantially different between the two study sites based on differences between their hydrogeological settings vegetation communities and climates our objectives were to i compare subsurface hydraulic gradients and groundwater flow paths between the two sites and ii develop and compare growing season water budgets between them that account for plant phenology driven changes in etg fluxes 2 study sites this study investigated two montane peatlands in the rocky mountains located approximately 400 km apart in latitude one in the san juan mountains of southwestern colorado anglica fen and another in the medicine bow mountains of southern wyoming sand lake fen both sites occur at the low end of the known elevation range for peatlands chimner et al 2010 heidel and jones 2006 where under a future climate these ecosystems are most likely to experience altered hydrological cycles and ecosystem atmosphere c exchange millar et al 2017 anglica fen ang is approximately 8800 m2 37 38 24 n 107 47 45 w at an elevation of 2600 m anglica fen occupies a basin consisting of fractured bedrock with no major surface water inflows or outflows the peatland is dominated by carex lasiocarpa with areas co dominated by c lasiocarpa and carex utriculata and includes a floating sphagnum fimbriatum dominated mat sand lake fen slk 41 20 31 n 106 10 2 w is approximately 15 300 m2 surrounded by glacial till gently sloping with no major surface water inflows or outflows at an elevation of 2700 m a small superficial channel exists at the downgradient end of slk that remained dry during most field visits particularly in 2013 two distinct plant communities exist as a mosaic at slk an herbaceous community dominated by carex simulata c utriculata and juncus balticus and a shrub community dominated by betula glandulosa salix planifolia and salix wolfii 3 methods this section describes the methods used to pursue our two primary study objectives first we describe the field instrumentation and data collection that enabled the characterization of groundwater flow paths at each site section 3 1 this is followed by a description of field measurements and modeling of the water budget components including precipitation actual evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone net groundwater flow and storage change in section 3 2 3 1 characterization of groundwater flow patterns a network of monitoring wells and nested piezometers was installed to cover the aerial extent of each peatland monitoring wells consisted of perforated 3 8 cm diameter pvc pipe installed to the base of the peat body or approximately one meter below grade whichever was shallowest monitoring wells were screened across the water table borings were made with a bucket auger making sure not to auger past the base of the peat body the borings were backfilled after installing the wells with native material and wells were developed by purging approximately 3 well volumes using a pvc bailer at most locations nested with each monitoring well were 1 9 cm diameter pvc piezometers at 20 cm increments below the peat surface to a maximum depth of 1 5 m piezometer pipes which were open at the bottom without vertical screening were installed by direct push using a metal dowel inside the pipe to prevent peat from entering during installation piezometers were not developed due to their narrow diameters and minimal soil disturbance during installation in situ rugged troll down well pressure transducers fort collins co were used to log wt position on an hourly basis at a centrally located monitoring well at each site these hourly data were used in the water budget model as described in section 3 2 water levels in all other monitoring wells and piezometers were gauged at each site on an approximately monthly basis during the growing season of 2012 to determine groundwater flow directions water table elevation at each site during each gauging campaign was contoured using cubic spline interpolation similarly hydraulic heads were interpolated along longitudinal transects at each site elevations and hydraulic heads at each site were set to an arbitrary datum for simplicity 3 2 growing season water budgets 3 2 1 field measurements adjacent to the central monitoring well at each site a meteorological station was installed including a hobo onset rg 2 data logging rain gauge bourne ma set at an approximate height of 2 m and above the canopy and an in situ barotroll logging barometric pressure and air temperature sensor installed above ground in a radiation shield composed of perforated pvc pipe hung within a conifer tree lundquist and huggett 2008 net radiation rnet and soil heat flux g were measured using radiation energy balance net radiometers and soil heat flux plates rebs seattle wa net radiometers were installed 2 m above the peatland surface and soil heat flux plates were installed 5 cm below the peat surface both of which were connected to a campbell cr 10x logan utah data logger to obtain hourly measurements 3 2 2 water budget models we developed water budget models for both peatlands during the growing seasons 2012 and 2013 eq 1 hourly input data collected in the field were integrated over 24 hr periods and used to run the model on daily time steps fig 1 1 δ s p et g gw net in eq 1 δs is the daily change in groundwater storage p is the daily total precipitation etg is the daily total evapotranspiration loss from groundwater and gwnet accounts for the daily net flow of groundwater calculated as a residual all water budget components are in mm d 1 daily precipitation was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges mounted on site δs was calculated from daily changes in wt position as follows 2 δ s s y δ wt in eq 2 δwt represents the daily net change in wt position and s y represents readily available specific yield s y was estimated for each site as the ratio of infiltrated precipitation to rise in wt for rain events 5 mm this method is appropriate for shallow water table conditions with a capillary fringe close to or at the soil surface carlson mazur et al 2013 loheide et al 2005 gerla 1992 rosenberry and winter 1997 methods used in modeling etg based on diurnal wt fluctuations require time periods without precipitation which can confound modeling efforts carlson mazur et al 2013 to model etg throughout the growing season including periods when wt position was affected by precipitation events a multiple linear regression model was developed using daily potential evapotranspiration pet calculated by summing hourly estimates and a 28 day running average of air temperature rav millar et al 2017 as predictor variables eq 3 incorporating rav as a predictor variable in the etg model allows for changes in plant phenology which more accurately reflected seasonal variation in etg fluxes i e as plants increase in biomass as the season progresses so do their transpiration demands 3 et g β 0 β 1 pet β 2 rav throughout each growing season at each site pet was modeled using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 to improve estimates of pet based on regional climate priestley taylor coefficients α of 2 01 and 1 92 were used for ang and slk respectively cristea et al 2013 due to data logger malfunction rnet and g were not recorded at slk from doy 177 to doy 190 in 2012 average daily pet using measurements collected 5 days before and 5 days after the data logger malfunction were used to fill the gap in pet data for both sites during both growing seasons at least 21 consecutive days with 0 2 mm of precipitation occurred during june therefore we used diurnal wt fluctuations during these time periods to independently calculate rates of etg by considering the rates of wt decline dwt dt during daylight hours which were then used to calibrate etg models eq 3 a locally weighted regression smoothing function span 0 007 was first used to filter out noise in the wt data carlson mazur et al 2013 cleveland 1979 strong diurnal oscillations in wt position were apparent during both growing seasons at slk fig 2 a with a decrease during the day due to etg demands and a rise during the night as a result groundwater inflow to isolate the wt change associated with etg at slk we detrended the smoothed water level data to remove the longer term trend we used the approach of loheide 2008 that includes an additional groundwater inflow term estimated from rising water levels measured during nighttime to account for the recovery source that impacts wt change throughout the day at ang wt position decreased during the day but to a lesser degree than slk and remained flat throughout the night fig 2a therefore we used the method of schilling 2007 to calculate daily etg by multiplying s y times the overall daily change in wt position for each day during the growing season gwnet was determined by taking the net difference between the total inputs and outputs in eq 1 a positive gwnet represented net groundwater inflow to the peatland whereas a negative gwnet represented a net outflow the latter can be associated with direct precipitation events that drive immediate surface either hortonian or saturation excess over land flow or subsurface outflow from the peatland outside the peatland the same precipitation event may have a lagged effect sustaining positive gwnet for multiple days when sufficient hydrologic connection exists between the peatland and the local groundwater flow system model parameters including s y eq 2 and β0 β1 and β2 eq 3 were estimated using a bayesian framework using r statistical software r development core team austria for s y the measured response variable used to constrain the parameter estimation is the amount of water table rise following a precipitation event for the β parameters in eq 3 the measurements are estimates of etg based on wt fluctuations both wt fluctuation methods used for estimating etg during rain free periods required an estimate of s y therefore the posterior mean estimates of s y were used to calculate etg values for estimating parameters β0 β1 and β2 in the etg multiple linear regression model posterior distributions for model parameters were estimated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc analysis in the rjags package for r plummer 2011 a total of 25 000 iterations were used with 4 mcmc chains with burn in after 10 000 iterations vague prior distributions were used for all model parameters normal distributions were used for all priors except for s y for which a beta distribution was used 4 et gi obs normal μ et g σ procet g 2 5 δ s i obs normal μ δ s i σ proc δ s 2 eqs 4 and 5 represent the likelihood functions for the observed etg et gi obs and δs δ s i obs for each peatland in the equations µetgi and µδs i represent the predicted values of etg and δs respectively and σ procet g 2 and σ proc δ s 2 represent the process variance associated with those predictions convergence was ensured for all parameter estimates and model predictions using the gelman rubin diagnostic gelman and rubin 1992 mcmc generated posterior distributions for the model parameters were used to address uncertainty in the modeled water budget eq 1 model parameter uncertainty was propagated in daily and monthly δs etg and gwnet estimates using mcmc with a total of 6000 iterations and burn in at 3000 iterations fig 1 4 results 4 1 groundwater potential gradients and water table fluctuations groundwater cross sections had contrasting potential gradients and inferred flow directions at each site the sloping peatland slk had a strong lateral groundwater flow direction with over 200 cm of hydraulic head change across the 125 m transect water table elevation contour plots also showed a sloping water table at slk that was consistent with cross sectional transects throughout the 2012 study period fig 3 prior to the start of the water budget modeling period the wt remained near the peat surface fig 3a whereas decreases in wt position were more pronounced at the downgradient end of the site later in the growing season fig 3b and c in contrast the basin peatland ang had no obvious lateral gradient but there were clear vertical gradients and an apparent zero flux plain at approximately 50 cm below the peat surface standing water existed at ang prior to the start of the water budget modeling period fig 4 a the wt elevation contour plots for this site likewise revealed a very flat water table surface early in the growing season with a slight slope forming towards the eastern portion of the site by july fig 4b and c at both sites during both study years wt position steadily declined during the during the early part of the growing season figs 5 8 around the end of june the downward trend in wt position began to be punctuated with sharp rises creating spikes in the hydrograph that coincide with rain events with no known precipitation falling as snow these spikes were more frequent at ang due to more frequent monsoon driven rain events during july and august at slk spikes were less frequent in 2012 however they were often larger in magnitude than those at ang in 2013 the largest wt decline to 99 cm below the peat surface occurred in early august at slk this decline was followed by a rise in wt position to within 20 cm of the peat surface that coincided with the significant precipitation events of september 2013 4 2 evapotranspiration fluxes from groundwater and growing season water budgets hourly etg fluxes calculated by the multiple linear regression model differed substantially between the two sites hourly etg at slk unconfounded by precipitation events had a steady increase in daily maximum flux over the 21 d calibration periods increasing linearly by approximately fivefold while hourly pet showed little change on a day to day basis fig 2c conversely etg fluxes at ang were generally flat over this time period fig 2b after converting to daily values the regression model using pet and rav performed well against daily estimates of etg obtained using wt fluctuations table 1 fig 9 model parameter estimates varied between sites with greater uncertainty in the estimated coefficient associated with pet at slk and greater degree of uncertainty in the estimated coefficient associated with rav at ang table 2 mean posterior estimates of s y used in calculating etg and δs varied significantly between sites 6 7 10 2 and 0 14 at slk and ang respectively table 2 while these posterior mean values were used to estimate β0 β1 and β2 etg estimated from water table fluctuations varied by 14 and 20 for ang and slk respectively with one standard deviation from posterior mean estimates of s y during the 2012 growing season ang received 124 mm of rainfall most of which fell during july and august fig 10 during the same year slk received 63 mm the majority of which fell during the same months as ang similarly during the growing season of 2013 from june through august approximately twice as much precipitation fell at ang than slk 139 mm compared to 72 mm however unusually high precipitation during september at both sites but more so for slk brought growing season total precipitation to similar amounts at both sites 205 and 192 mm for ang and slk similar seasonal patterns were observed in both sites with some differences the scale of etg and gwnet fluxes were much greater at slk fig 10 whereas slk exhibited a parabolic pattern in etg with positive gwnet values ang showed a gradual decline with groundwater fluxes out of the wetland both sites had a decline in shallow groundwater storage early in the growing season with negative δs estimates for june during both years fig 10 major runoff occurred from doy 254 to 258 in 2013 at slk associated with record rainfall uncharacteristic of peatlands under lesser rainfall intensities holden and burt 2002 since our model did not account for surface water flow the last five days of the study period in 2013 were omitted from the water budget model at slk at ang during the same year minimal changes in storage occurred in july and august followed by an increase in september 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater potential gradients and flow dynamics the zero flux plane observed at ang was likely due to divergent flow caused by upward flow of groundwater via etg within the root zone and gravity driven downward flow below the reach of vegetation this is in concordance with a previous study that reported a major decrease in root biomass approaching a peat depth of 50 cm in five sedge dominated peatlands in the rocky mountains chimner and cooper 2003 while even greater plant uptake of groundwater was also occurring at slk evident in greater etg fluxes a divergence in vertical flow was not observed this was likely due to the dominant lateral gradient at slk resulting from greater groundwater flow through the peat body 5 2 growing season hydrological fluxes daily growing season etg fluxes at slk were comparable to those reported elsewhere for a sphagnum dominated bog watras et al 2017 as well as woody and herbaceous vegetation in a temperate riparian zone satchithanantham et al 2017 further cumulative growing season etg fluxes at slk were comparable to those found over a six year study period for a mountain fen in central colorado dominated by similar and in some cases the same shrub and sedge species using energy balance techniques blanken 2014 during both years etg was an order of magnitude lower at ang than at slk the differences in etg between the two sites likely reflects differences in transpiration rates driven by differences in aboveground biomass between the two sites slk is dominated by three woody species salix planifolia s wolfii and betula glandulosa and a continuous cover of sedges and mosses while ang is dominated by a comparatively sparse canopy of thin leaved carex lasiocarpa bonfils et al 2012 further there was an extensive litter layer of sedge leaves and culms at ang which could have further reduced etg by limiting soil evaporation balwinder singh et al 2011 blanken 2014 mukherjee et al 2010 this work contributes to a growing body of research focused on using wt fluctuations to estimate etg fluxes from wetlands by providing an empirical approach to incorporate a phenological proxy for hydrophytic vegetation plant phenology during the growing season is recognized as an important control on the temporal variation of ecosystem scale eta and should be included in models simulating such fluxes kasurinen et al 2014 mackay et al 2007 as with daily and cumulative growing season etg estimates for each site we found differences in temporal trends in these fluxes sand lake fen showed a general increase from the early growing season then a peak in daily etg in the middle followed by decrease towards the end of the growing season similar temporal trends in eta and etg has been reported elsewhere for groundwater supported wetlands through observations kabenge et al 2013 sonnentag et al 2009 and model results watras et al 2017 satchithanantham et al 2017 however this was not the case for ang where etg fluxes were consistently lower had no obvious mid growing season peak and showed a much subtler decrease over the course of the growing season the steadier behavior at ang is also supported by a lower posterior mean estimate and relatively higher degree of uncertainty for β2 which controls how etg changes with rav these results show important differences in the hydrological dynamics for peatlands in different settings and highlight the need to incorporate greater mechanistic details in etg models for these ecosystems approximately twice as much precipitation fell in july and august of both study years at ang as at slk due to a stronger influence of the north american monsoon in the san juan mountains rises in the wt occurred in response to precipitation at both sites but most often at ang due to more frequent rain events while wt rises following precipitation events at slk occurred less frequently at ang they were more dramatic this was likely due to upgradient recharge leading to increased groundwater inflow as well as the peat body having a lower s y requiring less infiltrated precipitation to raise the wt water table position and δs typically peaked within approximately 48 h following precipitation events at both sites the delayed peak in wt position and δs coincided with peaks in gwnet suggesting that rain events recharge groundwater in peatland catchments driving increases in groundwater inputs after a precipitation event has ceased stein et al 2004 considering the comparative lack of groundwater inflow at ang precipitation events are critical in maintaining a water table near the peat surface during the growing season highlighting the significance of the north american monsoon at this site both ang and slk had an overall decrease in calculated groundwater storage negative δs throughout both growing seasons as driven by the decline in wt position apparent in the measured data our estimates of s y a critical factor in calculating δs varied substantially between sites with posterior mean estimates about twice as high at ang as at slk both estimates however are within the range of readily available specific yield values reported for wetlands carlson mazur et al 2013 fahle and dietrich 2014 and the differences in s y between ang and slk may be due to differences in physical peat characteristics between the two sites associated with differences in vegetation crockett et al 2016 gnatowski et al 2010 lautz 2008 decreases in groundwater storage at both sites were most pronounced early in the growing season with june having the most negative estimates of δs at both sites during both years this was driven primarily by etg at both sites as gwnet was always positive from june through august at slk and only slightly negative at ang during june of both years these results emphasize the importance of etg as a large output in a wetland s water balance rosenberry et al 2004 thompson et al 2014 the differing responses of gwnet between ang and slk highlight the importance of their hydrogeological setting for peatlands with a sufficiently large surrounding groundwater contributing area such as slk groundwater inflow will at least partially offset water losses due to daily etg demands evident in the rising wt during nighttime hours alternatively daily etg fluxes in basin peatlands surrounded by low permeability material like ang will likely not be followed by wt rise at night due to insufficient groundwater inflow temperatures are expected to increase and peak snow water equivalent swe is expected to decline by 10 40 at elevations similar to that of both peatlands christensen and lettenmaier 2007 while this study focused on groundwater dynamics during the growing season predictions of decreased swe and earlier snow melt for both study sites suggest that earlier declines in wt at the beginning of the growing season are likely in the future further a longer growing season brought about by increases in temperature will potentially increase cumulative etg fluxes serrat capdevila et al 2011 leading to a lower wt the sites in this study had water tables that declined earlier in the summer and to a deeper position than higher elevation peatlands in both regions millar et al 2017 these hydrological differences have been implicated as major controlling factors of ecosystem atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange for mountain peatlands and those found at elevations similar to those in this study are likely to be most susceptible to conversion from long term c sinks to sources because ang is highly dependant on the late summer monsoon to maintain its water levels changes in the strength of monsoonal flow will determine the long term fate of this peatland further accounting for the variability in subsurface flow based on differing hydrogeological conditions as we observed in this study is prerequisite to understanding the role of mountain wetlands in lateral translocation of dissolved c an important ecosystem c flux butman et al 2016 particularly for peatlands nilsson et al 2008 lastly the etg fluxes from groundwater at slk have important implications for catchment scale subsurface flow and water budgets in mountainous regions like slk in this study most mountain peatlands in the rocky mountains occur on slopes and are supported by groundwater inflow chimner et al 2010 despite occupying a relatively small area peatlands exist at focal points for groundwater discharge cooper et al 2017 winter 1999 growing season etg fluxes from groundwater at slk were roughly several fold higher than those reported for regionally common upland forests dominated by pinus contorta penn et al 2016 reed et al 2014 and picea engelmannii frank et al 2014 schlaepfer et al 2014 future research should further investigate the role of mountain peatlands in regional scale hydrological analyses including the importance of physiographic position in the catchment 6 conclusion this study investigated hydrological processes at two mountain peatlands one in a basin setting with sparse vegetation cover and a strong monsoon influence and another in a sloping setting with dense coverage of sedges and shrubs and a weaker monsoon influence groundwater inflow was a substantially larger portion of the saturated zone water budget for the sloping peatland which was critical in maintaining a near surface water table despite large etg fluxes the basin peatland conversely was characterized by much lower etg fluxes and negligible net groundwater inflow monsoon precipitation events late in the growing season played an important role preventing precipitous water table declines at the basin peatland understanding the water budget at mountain peatlands is particularly important given their potential sensitivity to climate change including changes in snow melt dynamics and winter precipitation as well as longer growing seasons lastly due to high rates of etg compared to actual evapotranspiration in surrounding uplands modeling of catchment scale water fluxes in mountain regions should account for peatland ecosystems despite their small size

7315,hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes in western north america mountain peatlands exist in different hydrogeological settings across a range climatic conditions and vary in floristic composition the sustainability of these ecosystems particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle we conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands with differing vegetation hydrogeological setting sloping vs basin and climate strong vs weak monsoon influence growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site the sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season alternatively the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients a zero flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration the differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover this research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration which were several fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands keywords wetland peatland ecohydrology groundwater mountain evapotranspiration 1 introduction one of the most important ecohydrological characteristics of wetland ecosystems is the presence of saturated soils a water table wt near the soil surface creates an interaction of groundwater flow with a biologically active zone where plants and soil microbes dominate biogeochemical processes under anaerobic conditions these conditions contribute to the critical ecological services provided by wetlands including the removal of groundwater contaminants before they reach surface waters kellogg et al 2009 and sequestration of atmospheric carbon c gorham 1991 further the water logged soil conditions found in wetlands exert a strong control on plant production and community composition dwire et al 2006 wolfe et al 2006 and contribute greatly to the conservation value of these ecosystems near surface water tables are particularly important in mountain peatlands where they play a critical role in sustaining organic soils chimner and cooper 2003 millar et al 2017 schimelpfenig et al 2013 and their characteristic vegetation cooper and andrus 1994 peatlands exist at high elevations in mountainous regions across the globe chagué goff et al 2010 cooper et al 2012 pullens et al 2016 these ecosystems provide important refugia for regionally rare plant species typically found in boreal regions chimner et al 2010 serve as locally important c sinks chimner and cooper 2003 and act as important regulators of groundwater fluxes as they are typically positioned at focal points for groundwater and surface water flow on the landscape winter 1999 the majority of precipitation in temperate continental mountain regions such as those found in western north america generally falls during the winter and spring as snow providing most of the water that sustains wetlands woods et al 2006 monsoon driven rainfall can also serve as important water sources for mountain ecosystems during the growing season mahmood and vivoni 2014 depending on geographic location and differences in late summer precipitation regime at sufficient spatial scales may differentially affect wt dynamics in mountain peatlands because the wt is often within or above the root zone of hydrophytes mountain peatlands also play a distinctive role in groundwater flow dynamics with considerable amounts of water potentially being lost via actual evapotranspiration consequently actual evapotranspiration eta from the saturated groundwater zone etg may exert a strong control on the water budget and wt position fahle and dietrich 2014 in the past several decades a warming climate in temperate mountain regions has affected seasonal water fluxes higher air temperatures have led to reductions in peak snow pack and forced earlier melting in spring with more winter precipitation falling as rain instead of snow christensen and lettenmaier 2007 regonda et al 2004 this shift in the timing of key hydrological processes has reduced late summer stream flows and led to drought stress in riparian ecosystems clow 2010 hamlet et al 2005 rood et al 2008 increases in air temperatures leading to longer growing seasons and increases in vapor pressure deficit have been associated with increased wetland evapotranspiration and a subsequent decrease in wt during the growing season bridgham et al 1999 riutta et al 2007 roulet et al 1992 further changes in wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 solar radiation wild 2009 and continental scale drying milly and dunne 2016 all impact eta under a changing climate mountain peatlands are typically small relative to those found in boreal regions due to steep slopes and valley confinement patterson and cooper 2007 and therefore may be more susceptible to climate driven changes in groundwater dynamics than peatlands occurring in larger groundwater flow systems kløve et al 2014 further mountain peatlands located at the low end of their known elevation range can be particularly susceptible to climate change due to already lower growing season wt positions compared to those at higher elevation millar et al 2017 mountain peatlands can occur under strikingly different hydrogeological settings including hillslopes and basins because groundwater inputs are critical for their sustainability wolf and cooper 2015 characterizing subsurface flows in these ecosystems is prerequisite to determining future changes in ecohydrological processes to better understand the effects of climate change on groundwater dependent ecosystems feedbacks between biological and hydrological processes must be accounted for kløve et al 2014 in peatlands etg and wt position are interdependent and diurnal changes in wt can be used along with meteorological data to estimate etg losses from the saturated zone fahle and dietrich 2014 however previous applications of this approach typically cover brief periods of time carlson mazur et al 2013 loheide 2008 and do not account for changes in plant biomass over the course of a growing season accounting for plant phenology in such models is a necessary step for simulating saturated zone water fluxes over the course of a growing season where photosynthetic biomass of wetland plants increases following snow melt and decreases during senescence in the fall in this study we investigated hydrological processes in two mountain peatlands one in a basin setting with sparse coverage of sedges and a strong monsoon influence and another in sloping setting with a dense coverage of sedges and shrubs with a weaker monsoon influence using field investigations and statistically robust empirical models of groundwater fluxes we hypothesized that the water budget components would be substantially different between the two study sites based on differences between their hydrogeological settings vegetation communities and climates our objectives were to i compare subsurface hydraulic gradients and groundwater flow paths between the two sites and ii develop and compare growing season water budgets between them that account for plant phenology driven changes in etg fluxes 2 study sites this study investigated two montane peatlands in the rocky mountains located approximately 400 km apart in latitude one in the san juan mountains of southwestern colorado anglica fen and another in the medicine bow mountains of southern wyoming sand lake fen both sites occur at the low end of the known elevation range for peatlands chimner et al 2010 heidel and jones 2006 where under a future climate these ecosystems are most likely to experience altered hydrological cycles and ecosystem atmosphere c exchange millar et al 2017 anglica fen ang is approximately 8800 m2 37 38 24 n 107 47 45 w at an elevation of 2600 m anglica fen occupies a basin consisting of fractured bedrock with no major surface water inflows or outflows the peatland is dominated by carex lasiocarpa with areas co dominated by c lasiocarpa and carex utriculata and includes a floating sphagnum fimbriatum dominated mat sand lake fen slk 41 20 31 n 106 10 2 w is approximately 15 300 m2 surrounded by glacial till gently sloping with no major surface water inflows or outflows at an elevation of 2700 m a small superficial channel exists at the downgradient end of slk that remained dry during most field visits particularly in 2013 two distinct plant communities exist as a mosaic at slk an herbaceous community dominated by carex simulata c utriculata and juncus balticus and a shrub community dominated by betula glandulosa salix planifolia and salix wolfii 3 methods this section describes the methods used to pursue our two primary study objectives first we describe the field instrumentation and data collection that enabled the characterization of groundwater flow paths at each site section 3 1 this is followed by a description of field measurements and modeling of the water budget components including precipitation actual evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone net groundwater flow and storage change in section 3 2 3 1 characterization of groundwater flow patterns a network of monitoring wells and nested piezometers was installed to cover the aerial extent of each peatland monitoring wells consisted of perforated 3 8 cm diameter pvc pipe installed to the base of the peat body or approximately one meter below grade whichever was shallowest monitoring wells were screened across the water table borings were made with a bucket auger making sure not to auger past the base of the peat body the borings were backfilled after installing the wells with native material and wells were developed by purging approximately 3 well volumes using a pvc bailer at most locations nested with each monitoring well were 1 9 cm diameter pvc piezometers at 20 cm increments below the peat surface to a maximum depth of 1 5 m piezometer pipes which were open at the bottom without vertical screening were installed by direct push using a metal dowel inside the pipe to prevent peat from entering during installation piezometers were not developed due to their narrow diameters and minimal soil disturbance during installation in situ rugged troll down well pressure transducers fort collins co were used to log wt position on an hourly basis at a centrally located monitoring well at each site these hourly data were used in the water budget model as described in section 3 2 water levels in all other monitoring wells and piezometers were gauged at each site on an approximately monthly basis during the growing season of 2012 to determine groundwater flow directions water table elevation at each site during each gauging campaign was contoured using cubic spline interpolation similarly hydraulic heads were interpolated along longitudinal transects at each site elevations and hydraulic heads at each site were set to an arbitrary datum for simplicity 3 2 growing season water budgets 3 2 1 field measurements adjacent to the central monitoring well at each site a meteorological station was installed including a hobo onset rg 2 data logging rain gauge bourne ma set at an approximate height of 2 m and above the canopy and an in situ barotroll logging barometric pressure and air temperature sensor installed above ground in a radiation shield composed of perforated pvc pipe hung within a conifer tree lundquist and huggett 2008 net radiation rnet and soil heat flux g were measured using radiation energy balance net radiometers and soil heat flux plates rebs seattle wa net radiometers were installed 2 m above the peatland surface and soil heat flux plates were installed 5 cm below the peat surface both of which were connected to a campbell cr 10x logan utah data logger to obtain hourly measurements 3 2 2 water budget models we developed water budget models for both peatlands during the growing seasons 2012 and 2013 eq 1 hourly input data collected in the field were integrated over 24 hr periods and used to run the model on daily time steps fig 1 1 δ s p et g gw net in eq 1 δs is the daily change in groundwater storage p is the daily total precipitation etg is the daily total evapotranspiration loss from groundwater and gwnet accounts for the daily net flow of groundwater calculated as a residual all water budget components are in mm d 1 daily precipitation was measured using tipping bucket rain gauges mounted on site δs was calculated from daily changes in wt position as follows 2 δ s s y δ wt in eq 2 δwt represents the daily net change in wt position and s y represents readily available specific yield s y was estimated for each site as the ratio of infiltrated precipitation to rise in wt for rain events 5 mm this method is appropriate for shallow water table conditions with a capillary fringe close to or at the soil surface carlson mazur et al 2013 loheide et al 2005 gerla 1992 rosenberry and winter 1997 methods used in modeling etg based on diurnal wt fluctuations require time periods without precipitation which can confound modeling efforts carlson mazur et al 2013 to model etg throughout the growing season including periods when wt position was affected by precipitation events a multiple linear regression model was developed using daily potential evapotranspiration pet calculated by summing hourly estimates and a 28 day running average of air temperature rav millar et al 2017 as predictor variables eq 3 incorporating rav as a predictor variable in the etg model allows for changes in plant phenology which more accurately reflected seasonal variation in etg fluxes i e as plants increase in biomass as the season progresses so do their transpiration demands 3 et g β 0 β 1 pet β 2 rav throughout each growing season at each site pet was modeled using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 to improve estimates of pet based on regional climate priestley taylor coefficients α of 2 01 and 1 92 were used for ang and slk respectively cristea et al 2013 due to data logger malfunction rnet and g were not recorded at slk from doy 177 to doy 190 in 2012 average daily pet using measurements collected 5 days before and 5 days after the data logger malfunction were used to fill the gap in pet data for both sites during both growing seasons at least 21 consecutive days with 0 2 mm of precipitation occurred during june therefore we used diurnal wt fluctuations during these time periods to independently calculate rates of etg by considering the rates of wt decline dwt dt during daylight hours which were then used to calibrate etg models eq 3 a locally weighted regression smoothing function span 0 007 was first used to filter out noise in the wt data carlson mazur et al 2013 cleveland 1979 strong diurnal oscillations in wt position were apparent during both growing seasons at slk fig 2 a with a decrease during the day due to etg demands and a rise during the night as a result groundwater inflow to isolate the wt change associated with etg at slk we detrended the smoothed water level data to remove the longer term trend we used the approach of loheide 2008 that includes an additional groundwater inflow term estimated from rising water levels measured during nighttime to account for the recovery source that impacts wt change throughout the day at ang wt position decreased during the day but to a lesser degree than slk and remained flat throughout the night fig 2a therefore we used the method of schilling 2007 to calculate daily etg by multiplying s y times the overall daily change in wt position for each day during the growing season gwnet was determined by taking the net difference between the total inputs and outputs in eq 1 a positive gwnet represented net groundwater inflow to the peatland whereas a negative gwnet represented a net outflow the latter can be associated with direct precipitation events that drive immediate surface either hortonian or saturation excess over land flow or subsurface outflow from the peatland outside the peatland the same precipitation event may have a lagged effect sustaining positive gwnet for multiple days when sufficient hydrologic connection exists between the peatland and the local groundwater flow system model parameters including s y eq 2 and β0 β1 and β2 eq 3 were estimated using a bayesian framework using r statistical software r development core team austria for s y the measured response variable used to constrain the parameter estimation is the amount of water table rise following a precipitation event for the β parameters in eq 3 the measurements are estimates of etg based on wt fluctuations both wt fluctuation methods used for estimating etg during rain free periods required an estimate of s y therefore the posterior mean estimates of s y were used to calculate etg values for estimating parameters β0 β1 and β2 in the etg multiple linear regression model posterior distributions for model parameters were estimated using markov chain monte carlo mcmc analysis in the rjags package for r plummer 2011 a total of 25 000 iterations were used with 4 mcmc chains with burn in after 10 000 iterations vague prior distributions were used for all model parameters normal distributions were used for all priors except for s y for which a beta distribution was used 4 et gi obs normal μ et g σ procet g 2 5 δ s i obs normal μ δ s i σ proc δ s 2 eqs 4 and 5 represent the likelihood functions for the observed etg et gi obs and δs δ s i obs for each peatland in the equations µetgi and µδs i represent the predicted values of etg and δs respectively and σ procet g 2 and σ proc δ s 2 represent the process variance associated with those predictions convergence was ensured for all parameter estimates and model predictions using the gelman rubin diagnostic gelman and rubin 1992 mcmc generated posterior distributions for the model parameters were used to address uncertainty in the modeled water budget eq 1 model parameter uncertainty was propagated in daily and monthly δs etg and gwnet estimates using mcmc with a total of 6000 iterations and burn in at 3000 iterations fig 1 4 results 4 1 groundwater potential gradients and water table fluctuations groundwater cross sections had contrasting potential gradients and inferred flow directions at each site the sloping peatland slk had a strong lateral groundwater flow direction with over 200 cm of hydraulic head change across the 125 m transect water table elevation contour plots also showed a sloping water table at slk that was consistent with cross sectional transects throughout the 2012 study period fig 3 prior to the start of the water budget modeling period the wt remained near the peat surface fig 3a whereas decreases in wt position were more pronounced at the downgradient end of the site later in the growing season fig 3b and c in contrast the basin peatland ang had no obvious lateral gradient but there were clear vertical gradients and an apparent zero flux plain at approximately 50 cm below the peat surface standing water existed at ang prior to the start of the water budget modeling period fig 4 a the wt elevation contour plots for this site likewise revealed a very flat water table surface early in the growing season with a slight slope forming towards the eastern portion of the site by july fig 4b and c at both sites during both study years wt position steadily declined during the during the early part of the growing season figs 5 8 around the end of june the downward trend in wt position began to be punctuated with sharp rises creating spikes in the hydrograph that coincide with rain events with no known precipitation falling as snow these spikes were more frequent at ang due to more frequent monsoon driven rain events during july and august at slk spikes were less frequent in 2012 however they were often larger in magnitude than those at ang in 2013 the largest wt decline to 99 cm below the peat surface occurred in early august at slk this decline was followed by a rise in wt position to within 20 cm of the peat surface that coincided with the significant precipitation events of september 2013 4 2 evapotranspiration fluxes from groundwater and growing season water budgets hourly etg fluxes calculated by the multiple linear regression model differed substantially between the two sites hourly etg at slk unconfounded by precipitation events had a steady increase in daily maximum flux over the 21 d calibration periods increasing linearly by approximately fivefold while hourly pet showed little change on a day to day basis fig 2c conversely etg fluxes at ang were generally flat over this time period fig 2b after converting to daily values the regression model using pet and rav performed well against daily estimates of etg obtained using wt fluctuations table 1 fig 9 model parameter estimates varied between sites with greater uncertainty in the estimated coefficient associated with pet at slk and greater degree of uncertainty in the estimated coefficient associated with rav at ang table 2 mean posterior estimates of s y used in calculating etg and δs varied significantly between sites 6 7 10 2 and 0 14 at slk and ang respectively table 2 while these posterior mean values were used to estimate β0 β1 and β2 etg estimated from water table fluctuations varied by 14 and 20 for ang and slk respectively with one standard deviation from posterior mean estimates of s y during the 2012 growing season ang received 124 mm of rainfall most of which fell during july and august fig 10 during the same year slk received 63 mm the majority of which fell during the same months as ang similarly during the growing season of 2013 from june through august approximately twice as much precipitation fell at ang than slk 139 mm compared to 72 mm however unusually high precipitation during september at both sites but more so for slk brought growing season total precipitation to similar amounts at both sites 205 and 192 mm for ang and slk similar seasonal patterns were observed in both sites with some differences the scale of etg and gwnet fluxes were much greater at slk fig 10 whereas slk exhibited a parabolic pattern in etg with positive gwnet values ang showed a gradual decline with groundwater fluxes out of the wetland both sites had a decline in shallow groundwater storage early in the growing season with negative δs estimates for june during both years fig 10 major runoff occurred from doy 254 to 258 in 2013 at slk associated with record rainfall uncharacteristic of peatlands under lesser rainfall intensities holden and burt 2002 since our model did not account for surface water flow the last five days of the study period in 2013 were omitted from the water budget model at slk at ang during the same year minimal changes in storage occurred in july and august followed by an increase in september 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater potential gradients and flow dynamics the zero flux plane observed at ang was likely due to divergent flow caused by upward flow of groundwater via etg within the root zone and gravity driven downward flow below the reach of vegetation this is in concordance with a previous study that reported a major decrease in root biomass approaching a peat depth of 50 cm in five sedge dominated peatlands in the rocky mountains chimner and cooper 2003 while even greater plant uptake of groundwater was also occurring at slk evident in greater etg fluxes a divergence in vertical flow was not observed this was likely due to the dominant lateral gradient at slk resulting from greater groundwater flow through the peat body 5 2 growing season hydrological fluxes daily growing season etg fluxes at slk were comparable to those reported elsewhere for a sphagnum dominated bog watras et al 2017 as well as woody and herbaceous vegetation in a temperate riparian zone satchithanantham et al 2017 further cumulative growing season etg fluxes at slk were comparable to those found over a six year study period for a mountain fen in central colorado dominated by similar and in some cases the same shrub and sedge species using energy balance techniques blanken 2014 during both years etg was an order of magnitude lower at ang than at slk the differences in etg between the two sites likely reflects differences in transpiration rates driven by differences in aboveground biomass between the two sites slk is dominated by three woody species salix planifolia s wolfii and betula glandulosa and a continuous cover of sedges and mosses while ang is dominated by a comparatively sparse canopy of thin leaved carex lasiocarpa bonfils et al 2012 further there was an extensive litter layer of sedge leaves and culms at ang which could have further reduced etg by limiting soil evaporation balwinder singh et al 2011 blanken 2014 mukherjee et al 2010 this work contributes to a growing body of research focused on using wt fluctuations to estimate etg fluxes from wetlands by providing an empirical approach to incorporate a phenological proxy for hydrophytic vegetation plant phenology during the growing season is recognized as an important control on the temporal variation of ecosystem scale eta and should be included in models simulating such fluxes kasurinen et al 2014 mackay et al 2007 as with daily and cumulative growing season etg estimates for each site we found differences in temporal trends in these fluxes sand lake fen showed a general increase from the early growing season then a peak in daily etg in the middle followed by decrease towards the end of the growing season similar temporal trends in eta and etg has been reported elsewhere for groundwater supported wetlands through observations kabenge et al 2013 sonnentag et al 2009 and model results watras et al 2017 satchithanantham et al 2017 however this was not the case for ang where etg fluxes were consistently lower had no obvious mid growing season peak and showed a much subtler decrease over the course of the growing season the steadier behavior at ang is also supported by a lower posterior mean estimate and relatively higher degree of uncertainty for β2 which controls how etg changes with rav these results show important differences in the hydrological dynamics for peatlands in different settings and highlight the need to incorporate greater mechanistic details in etg models for these ecosystems approximately twice as much precipitation fell in july and august of both study years at ang as at slk due to a stronger influence of the north american monsoon in the san juan mountains rises in the wt occurred in response to precipitation at both sites but most often at ang due to more frequent rain events while wt rises following precipitation events at slk occurred less frequently at ang they were more dramatic this was likely due to upgradient recharge leading to increased groundwater inflow as well as the peat body having a lower s y requiring less infiltrated precipitation to raise the wt water table position and δs typically peaked within approximately 48 h following precipitation events at both sites the delayed peak in wt position and δs coincided with peaks in gwnet suggesting that rain events recharge groundwater in peatland catchments driving increases in groundwater inputs after a precipitation event has ceased stein et al 2004 considering the comparative lack of groundwater inflow at ang precipitation events are critical in maintaining a water table near the peat surface during the growing season highlighting the significance of the north american monsoon at this site both ang and slk had an overall decrease in calculated groundwater storage negative δs throughout both growing seasons as driven by the decline in wt position apparent in the measured data our estimates of s y a critical factor in calculating δs varied substantially between sites with posterior mean estimates about twice as high at ang as at slk both estimates however are within the range of readily available specific yield values reported for wetlands carlson mazur et al 2013 fahle and dietrich 2014 and the differences in s y between ang and slk may be due to differences in physical peat characteristics between the two sites associated with differences in vegetation crockett et al 2016 gnatowski et al 2010 lautz 2008 decreases in groundwater storage at both sites were most pronounced early in the growing season with june having the most negative estimates of δs at both sites during both years this was driven primarily by etg at both sites as gwnet was always positive from june through august at slk and only slightly negative at ang during june of both years these results emphasize the importance of etg as a large output in a wetland s water balance rosenberry et al 2004 thompson et al 2014 the differing responses of gwnet between ang and slk highlight the importance of their hydrogeological setting for peatlands with a sufficiently large surrounding groundwater contributing area such as slk groundwater inflow will at least partially offset water losses due to daily etg demands evident in the rising wt during nighttime hours alternatively daily etg fluxes in basin peatlands surrounded by low permeability material like ang will likely not be followed by wt rise at night due to insufficient groundwater inflow temperatures are expected to increase and peak snow water equivalent swe is expected to decline by 10 40 at elevations similar to that of both peatlands christensen and lettenmaier 2007 while this study focused on groundwater dynamics during the growing season predictions of decreased swe and earlier snow melt for both study sites suggest that earlier declines in wt at the beginning of the growing season are likely in the future further a longer growing season brought about by increases in temperature will potentially increase cumulative etg fluxes serrat capdevila et al 2011 leading to a lower wt the sites in this study had water tables that declined earlier in the summer and to a deeper position than higher elevation peatlands in both regions millar et al 2017 these hydrological differences have been implicated as major controlling factors of ecosystem atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange for mountain peatlands and those found at elevations similar to those in this study are likely to be most susceptible to conversion from long term c sinks to sources because ang is highly dependant on the late summer monsoon to maintain its water levels changes in the strength of monsoonal flow will determine the long term fate of this peatland further accounting for the variability in subsurface flow based on differing hydrogeological conditions as we observed in this study is prerequisite to understanding the role of mountain wetlands in lateral translocation of dissolved c an important ecosystem c flux butman et al 2016 particularly for peatlands nilsson et al 2008 lastly the etg fluxes from groundwater at slk have important implications for catchment scale subsurface flow and water budgets in mountainous regions like slk in this study most mountain peatlands in the rocky mountains occur on slopes and are supported by groundwater inflow chimner et al 2010 despite occupying a relatively small area peatlands exist at focal points for groundwater discharge cooper et al 2017 winter 1999 growing season etg fluxes from groundwater at slk were roughly several fold higher than those reported for regionally common upland forests dominated by pinus contorta penn et al 2016 reed et al 2014 and picea engelmannii frank et al 2014 schlaepfer et al 2014 future research should further investigate the role of mountain peatlands in regional scale hydrological analyses including the importance of physiographic position in the catchment 6 conclusion this study investigated hydrological processes at two mountain peatlands one in a basin setting with sparse vegetation cover and a strong monsoon influence and another in a sloping setting with dense coverage of sedges and shrubs and a weaker monsoon influence groundwater inflow was a substantially larger portion of the saturated zone water budget for the sloping peatland which was critical in maintaining a near surface water table despite large etg fluxes the basin peatland conversely was characterized by much lower etg fluxes and negligible net groundwater inflow monsoon precipitation events late in the growing season played an important role preventing precipitous water table declines at the basin peatland understanding the water budget at mountain peatlands is particularly important given their potential sensitivity to climate change including changes in snow melt dynamics and winter precipitation as well as longer growing seasons lastly due to high rates of etg compared to actual evapotranspiration in surrounding uplands modeling of catchment scale water fluxes in mountain regions should account for peatland ecosystems despite their small size

7316,predicting water table depth over the long term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics boundary conditions and human activities also nonlinear interactions occur among these factors therefore a new time series model based on long short term memory lstm was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models the proposed model is composed of an lstm layer with another fully connected layer on top of it with a dropout method applied in the first lstm layer in this study the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district in arid northwestern china using data of 14 years 2000 2013 the proposed model uses monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input data to predict water table depth a simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre process data to ensure data on the same scale 14 years of data are separated into two sets training set 2000 2011 and validation set 2012 2013 in the experiment as expected the proposed model achieves higher r 2 scores 0 789 0 952 in water table depth prediction when compared with the results of traditional feed forward neural network ffnn which only reaches relatively low r 2 scores 0 004 0 495 proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well furthermore the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model s architecture are discussed through experimentation the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly in addition comparisons between the r 2 scores of the proposed model and double lstm model r 2 scores range from 0 170 to 0 864 further prove that the proposed model s architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data thus one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain keywords machine learning model water table depth deep learning lstm hetao irrigation district 1 introduction groundwater provides an important source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial use however groundwater resources are vulnerable to over exploitation climate change and biochemical pollution bouwer 2000 sophocleous 2005 evans and sadler 2008 white and falkland 2010 karandish et al 2015 as a result many areas over the world face groundwater shortages an example of such areas is the hetao irrigation district one of the largest irrigation districts in china that is located in the arid area of the yellow river watershed the yellow river serves as the main source of irrigation water in this district however the availability of irrigation water from the yellow river has decreased dramatically with intensified water resource use in the yellow river watershed yang et al 2003 therefore groundwater has become an important source of supplementary irrigation water in hetao irrigation district the effective management of groundwater resources especially in the context of increased groundwater demands for agriculture use is necessary to provide sustainable use of water resources in hetao irrigation district sustainable groundwater planning and management requires accurate forecasting of water table depth wang et al 2014 an accurate and reliable assessment of water table depth can help engineers and decision makers to 1 develop optimal water resource allocation strategies 2 adjust crop patterns in different sub irrigation areas and 3 develop optimal irrigation schedules while controlling the effects of salinity related to intensive irrigation xu et al 2010 the objective of this study is to develop an effective and accurate method for predicting water table depth that can be used to help engineers and decision makers manage groundwater resources and make management decisions in the last two decades predictions of water table depth have usually been made by using physically based models such as modflow and hydrus e g pang et al 2000 batelaan et al 2003 zume and tarhule 2008 faulkner et al 2009 xu et al 2012 however those models have many practical limitations because they are always data demanding and time consuming during model development and calibration using physically based models to predict water table depth in hetao irrigation district is particularly challenging because the district covers a large area lacks abundant hydrogeological data and has strong spatial and seasonal variability in freeze thaw periods in the last decade many studies have investigated the advantages and disadvantages of various physically based models and evaluated their prediction performance with that of emerging data driven machine learning methods the machine learning methods include multiple linear regression mlr sahoo and jha 2013 support vector regression svr yu et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 belayneh et al 2014 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 and artificial neural networks ann raman and sunilkumar 1995 daliakopoulos et al 2005 sarangi et al 2006 napolitano et al 2011 parchami araghi et al 2013 seo et al 2015 chang et al 2016 these statistical methods explore the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in historical data without using a physical model because the latter always requires a large number of physical parameters and a deep understanding of the physical processes of the modeling domain in many cases machine learning methods can achieve a better predictive performance than physically based models parkin et al 2007 chu and chang 2009 mohanty et al 2013 karandish and šimunek 2016 for example mohanty et al 2013 found that an ann model provided a better prediction of water table depth than modflow for short term predictions karandish and šimunek 2016 found that both adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and svm models performed well when compared with hydrus 2d for water stressed conditions therefore machine learning methods provide promising tools for predicting water table depth ann methods are used in this study for predicting water table depth because ann has a strong self learning ability which is suitable for complicated problems however traditional ffnn models do not have the ability to learn time series data because they cannot preserve previous information resulting in limited prediction capability for long term time series data such as data related to water table depth cannas et al 2006 this problem can be resolved by using more advanced ffnn models recently researchers have integrated ffnn with other methods such as genetic algorithms ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 bahrami et al 2016 mehr and kahya 2017 wavelet transform adamowski and chan 2011 kisi and shiri 2012 nourani et al 2015 and singular spectrum analysis sahoo et al 2017 polomčićet al 2017 genetic algorithm can be applied to optimize neural networks wavelet transform and singular spectrum analysis can pre process time series data then add processed time series data into neural networks and thus allow ffnn models to learn time series data very well however these advanced ffnn models require complicated procedures related to data pre processing for example sahoo et al 2017 first employed singular spectrum analysis to decompose time series data into separable and interpretable reconstructed components and then applied genetic algorithm to select the best reconstructed components as inputs of ffnn while this data pre processing can strengthen the ability of a ffnn model to learn time series data subjective user intervention is needed e g choosing the number of different reconstructed components furthermore the pre processing is time consuming because of the calculation of many reconstructed components the present study focuses on a time series prediction task so recurrent neural network rnn rumelhart et al 1986 is a suitable choice a rnn model has internal self looped cells allowing the rnn to remember time series information and making it adept at performing time series tasks in addition in this study lstm a special kind of rnn that works well in processing long term time series data was chosen due to its sophisticated network structure compared with aforementioned advanced ffnn model the proposed lstm based model only applied a very simple data pre processing method lstm is a famous deep learning model it is recurrent where connections between units form a directed cycle allowing data to flow both forwards and backwards within the network then the previous information can be preserved for future use lstm model have already been used as a very advanced model in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning such as in nature language processing mikolov et al 2010 sundermeyer et al 2012 speech recognition graves and jaitly 2014 machine translation sutskever et al 2014 and automatic image captioning wang et al 2016 however only a few studies have applied rnns or lstms to handle time series data in the field of hydrology silva et al 2013 the goal of this study was to develop a two layer lstm based model for predicting water table depth in hetao irrigation district the model contained one layer of lstm and a fully connected layer atop of the lstm layer the model employed monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input variables for predicting water table depth in the district the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area and observational data are introduced section 3 illustrates rnn lstm dropout regularization the proposed model s

boundaries respectively characterized by narrow strips of flat terrain and fertile land the entire hetao irrigation district has been divided into five sub areas from west to east as follows ulanbuh jiefangzha yongji yichang and urad fig 1 based on management practices mean annual precipitation is 169 4 mm about 70 of which falls during june september the maximum precipitation occurs in august the mean minimum and maximum temperatures were 3 9 c 14 6 c and 28 4 c respectively china meteorological data service center 1954 2013 hetao irrigation district covers 11 073 km2 the central part of the district is about 180 km long and 60 km wide about 52 5740 km2 of the entire terrestrial area is irrigated a total of 227 monitoring wells are used in the district fig 1 with the water table depth measured every 5 days because monthly data are used in the model the measured water table depth is averaged by month 2 2 data and statistical analysis our experiments used 14 years 2000 2013 of time series data from the five sub areas in hetao irrigation district since people in this district use surface water pumping volume is very small so it was omitted in this study therefore at the beginning the data included water diversion precipitation evaporation temperature water table depth area of the region water consumption for industry and domestic use then lasso regression yuan and lin 2006 tibshirani 1996 a statistical method that can be used to select variables was applied to choose important variables from the original data based on regression weights finally only five variables were chosen for this study water diversion precipitation evaporation volume temperature and water table depth time series of these variables are presented for the five sub areas of the district fig 2 from fig 2 these data were found to have periodic characteristics therefore time at the monthly scale has also been used as an input variable to improve the model s ability to generalize creating a sixth variable in the present study the first 12 years of time series data were used as a training set and the next two years of data was used as a validation set a statistic description of the water table depth of different sub areas is shown in table 1 table 1 shows that ulanbuh had the smallest standard deviation 0 331 m and range of water table depth 1 297 m meaning the water table depth of ulanbuh is more stable than that of other areas 2 3 data pre processing as shown in fig 2 the input data varied widely these differences will have a negative effect on the model s ability to learn therefore all six of the variables were standardized to ensure they remain on the same scale this pre processing can guarantee a stable convergence of parameters in the model developed in the present study the standardization formula is as follows 1 x ij new x ij x i σ i where x ij represents data in ith year jth month x i and σ i are the average and standard deviation of data in the ith year respectively 3 methodology 3 1 long short term memory network lstm before introducing lstm we would like to first introduce rnn because lstm is a special kind of rnn rnns were first developed in the 1980s these networks have connections between neurons and form a directed cycle this type of structure creates an internal self looped cell which allows it to display dynamic temporal behavior rnns have chain like structures of repeating modules fig 3 a these structures can help rnns to remember previous information which allows the rnns to process arbitrary long time sequences therefore rnns have been successful in learning sequences forward propagation begins with a specific initial state h 0 0 for each time step from t 1 to t τ the following update equations were applied 2 h t tanh b h wh t 1 ux t 3 o t b o vh t where x t is the input vector at time t and h t 1 is the hidden cell state at time t 1 the parameters are the bias vector b h and b o as well as the weight matrices u w and v for input to hidden hidden to hidden and hidden to output connections respectively the gradients of the rnns can be computed via back propagation through time rumelhart et al 1986 werbos 1990 however back propagation through time is not sufficiently efficient to learn a pattern from long term dependency because of a gradient vanishing problem hochreiter 1998 this problem can be solved by the structure of lstms hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 graves 2012 jozefowicz et al 2015 like rnns lstms also have chain like modules but the repeating modules have more complicated structures each repeating module of lstms contain a memory block this memory block is specifically designed to store information over long time periods the memory block contains four parts a cec the constant error carousel cell in addition to three special multiplicative units called gates the cec cell runs straight down the entire chain without any activation function and thus the gradient does not vanish when back propagation through time is applied to train a lstm therefore lstms have been shown to learn long term dependencies more easily than rnns because information can easily flow along the cells unchanged furthermore the input forget gers et al 2000 and output gates in each memory block can control the flow of information inside memory block the input forget and output gates control the extent to which new input flows into a cec cell information is stored in a cell and output flows of the cell into the rest of the networks respectively a schematic of memory block is shown in fig 3 b it includes block input three gates input forget output and a cec cell similar to rnns lstms computes a mapping from an input sequence x to an output sequence y by calculating the network unit activations using the following equations iteratively from t 1 to t τ with initial values c 0 0 and h 0 0 4 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 5 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 6 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 h t o t tanh c t where w i w f and w o denote the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively similarly u i u f and u o denote the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the hidden respectively b i b f b o denote the input forget and output gate bias vectors respectively σ is an element wise non linear activation function logistic sigmoid i t f t ot and c t are the input forget output gates and the cell state vectors at time t respectively all of which are the same size as the cell output vector h t the element wise multiplication of two vectors is denoted with 3 2 dropout for neural networks deep neural networks are well suited to process big data however deep neural networks with large number of parameters can easily be overfitting especially when data are limited therefore dropout provides an effective regularization method that can be used to solve this problem hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 the most important idea of dropout method is that at each training iteration when the neural network is updating a certain layer where the dropout is applied it randomly does not update or dropout some neurons with probability p in this layer this means that a part of the neural network was sampled and it was trained at one iteration in each iteration of training a different part of the network was sampled and trained with dropout the weights of the neurons learned through backpropagation become somewhat more insensitive to the weights of the other neurons thus dropout can help to prevent the networks from relying on certain neurons in the layers too much and reduce the neurons co adaptability at testing time all of the neurons of the networks are retained no dropout but the activations are scaled by p probability of dropout a neural network whose first and second hidden layers have been applied dropout is shown in fig 4 3 3 our proposed model framework in this work we were interested in predicting water table depth this is a time series problem because the current water table depth has changed in a way that is dependent on previous this time series prediction was cast as a regression problem the proposed model is illustrated in fig 6 a the input data were first put into the lstm layer the input gate of the lstm layer will recompose input data and decide which input data is important this process is similar to principal component analysis pca however the lstm layer can preserve previous information which can help to improve the ability of the model to learn time series data a fully connected layer is set atop the lstm layer in order to improve the model s learning ability moreover dropout is set on the lstm layer to prevent overfitting the loss function is defined below 10 loss i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi is measured value at time i and y i is predicted value at time i however this model framework has some limitations first the initial parameters of the proposed model will affect the final results in addition even though an lstm layer has a strong ability to learn time series data its fitting ability may be insufficient therefore a fully connected layer was added atop of a single lstm layer nevertheless exactly how many lstm layers should be used as hidden layers in order to reach the optimized results remained unknown the flowchart of the proposed model framework is displayed in fig 5 all of the code in this study was written in the theano package of python software throughout the computation was performed on an intel core i5 4210u cpu with 4g ram 3 4 model evaluation criteria in this study the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the model s accuracy between the measured and predicted values r 2 measures the degree of how well the outcomes are replicated by the model ranging between 1 where for optimal model prediction an r 2 score close to 1 is preferred the r 2 equation is as follows 11 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where yi is measured value at time i y is mean of yi i 1 n and y i is predicted value at time i diverse types of information related to the predictive capacities of the model were measured through rmse rmse measures the prediction precision which creates a positive value by squaring the errors rmse scores range between 0 and the model prediction is ideal if rmse is 0 rmse is defined as 12 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 4 results and discussions in section 4 1 the first 12 years of data were used including water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature month and water table depth to train the proposed model different models were used for different areas each model was trained using stochastic gradient descent sgd method in order to observe the changes in water table depth in the entire hetao irrigation district the proposed model also has been evaluated in the entire area whose temperature was the average of five sub areas and precipitation water diversion and evaporation volume were sum of five sub areas this all encompassing area was named hetao it is reasonable to expect that the proposed model can work well in the entire area if it can perform well in other sub areas in addition the proposed model was compared with ffnn in the water table depth prediction in section 4 2 the effectiveness of dropout was explored finally section 4 3 discusses the architecture of the proposed model and compares it with a double lstm model 4 1 water table depth prediction results as mentioned above in the training process the first 12 years of data were used to train the proposed model in different areas after the models had been trained each model was validated through use of the validation set and tuned the hyper parameters of the models two performance metrics of different models in different sub areas and hetao were computed in order to obtain the optimal model hyper parameters the number of hidden neurons in the lstm layer and the learning rate the optimal hyper parameters of the proposed model used for water table depth prediction are shown in table 2 first row note that models for different areas use the same hyper parameters in order to illustrate how hyper parameters affect the results different hyper parameters were set for the proposed model and the yongji sub area was used as an example results including training loss r 2 and running time are also displayed in table 2 from table 2 it can be learned that a higher learning rate 10 3 may cause the optimization task to miss the optimal point r 2 was only 0 62 however a lower learning rate 10 5 may help to avoid overshooting but may cause the model to use a longer time to converge too many training iterations may not ensure more optimal results the results from 20 000 and 40 000 training iterations were the same in addition it is common to set a dropout probability to 0 5 in the deep learning field as introduced by hinton et al 2012 moreover too many neurons 70 in this study are computationally expensive 20 000 iterations in 9 76 min and often cause overfitting meanwhile having an insufficient number of neurons 10 in this study may decrease the network s learning ability as can be seen in table 2 therefore during implementation 40 hidden neurons were chosen in the lstm layer to compare the proposed model with ffnn model ffnn model in different areas were also trained using the same hyper parameters as mentioned above results in terms of the two evaluation metrics in different areas are summarized in table 3 from table 3 the r 2 of the proposed model ranged from 0 789 to 0 952 and rmse from 0 070 m to 0 184 m the r 2 of the proposed model was much higher than that of ffnn model which ranged from 0 004 to 0 466 in addition the rmse of the proposed model was much smaller than that of ffnn model with the rmse ranging from 0 239 m to 0 372 m these findings indicate that the proposed model can predict water table depth more accurately than other methods table 3 also shows that the proposed model has the best performance in ulanbuh s water table depth prediction r 2 0 952 rmse 0 070 m we believe this occurred because the range and standard deviation of water table depth in ulanuh were the smallest table 1 meaning the water table depth was more stable in ulanbuh than in other areas the proposed model produced better results with respect to r 2 and rmse than the ffnn model especially in yichang and urad where the performance metrics of the proposed model were much better than the ffnn model s in addition table 3 illustrates that the proposed model also worked well in predicting the water table depth in the hetao area meaning the proposed model can be used to predict the water table depth in the entire hetao irrigation district fig 7 displays the measured and predicted water table depth from both the proposed and the ffnn models in different sub areas for brevity only the results of yichang urad and hetao are presented fig 7 showing both the proposed and the ffnn models can capture the variation trend of water table depth in these three areas however the ffnn model fails to accurately predict the water table depth because it cannot capture the previous information which is further illustrated in fig 8 the ffnn model was found to not accurately predict the water table depth in the first month of 2012 indicating that the ffnn model cannot remember the previous water table depth this phenomenon is especially obvious in yichang and urad because during 2009 2011 the government decreased the irrigation volume there leading to a 40 60 cm increase in water table depth therefore even though a traditional ffnn model has strong ability to represent the variation in water table depth it cannot predict water table depth as accurately as the proposed model this further confirms the lstm s ability to process time series data 4 2 dropout effect in order to explore the dropout method that was used to prohibit overfitting the results from the proposed model were compared with a model with same architecture but without applying dropout in the lstm layer the same hyper parameters 40 hidden neurons 10 4 learning rate and 20 000 training iterations were set in the model without dropout and its performance was compared with the proposed model in water table depth prediction training loss and two evaluation metrics were used for evaluating these two models fig 9 shows the prediction results of the proposed model and the model without dropout in three areas the evaluation metrics and training loss are shown in table 3 from fig 9 one can see that the proposed model and model without dropout provided very similar results in the training process in different areas however the results in the validating process showed stronger deviations from the predicted value table 3 shows that the training loss of the proposed model ranged from 7 34 to 11 42 whereas that of model without dropout ranged from 0 725 to 1 204 however the r 2 of the proposed model was higher than that of model without dropout which ranged from 0 368 to 0 874 also the rmse of the proposed model was smaller than that of model without dropout which ranged from 0 114 m to 0 289 m these findings indicate that even though the model without dropout can fit training data perfectly it cannot predict the last two years of water table depth as well as the proposed model this phenomenon is a typical overfitting however from the reported result of the proposed model the conclusion could be drawn that the dropout method can help the proposed model by preventing overfitting 4 3 discussion about model structure note that the proposed model has one layer of lstm and one fully connected layer the proposed model was compared with the ffnn model in section 4 1 to discuss the proposed model s ability to preserve previous information and process time series data therefore in order to discuss the learning ability of the proposed model it was also compared with a model that has different structures but the same architectural scale two hidden layers like a model that has two lstm layers double lstm since a double lstm model has two hidden lstm layers one can intuitively expect that this model can forecast water table depth well in these areas the architecture of the double lstm model is illustrated in fig 6 b similar to section 4 1 two evaluation metrics of these two models were compared the double lstm model is very similar to the proposed model only change the fully connected layer to lstm layer in double lstm model the same hyper parameters were used to train the double lstm model in different areas table 3 shows summarized results of these two models table 3 shows that the r 2 of the proposed model was higher than that of the double lstm model which ranged from 0 170 to 0 864 meanwhile the rmse of the proposed model was smaller than that of the double lstm model which ranged from 0 119 m to 0 331 m fig 10 shows the prediction results of both the proposed and double lstm models one can see that although both the models performed well in capturing variations in the water table depth the double lstm model failed to fit data in the training process as can obviously be seen at the peak values we believe this phenomenon was caused by the insufficient fitting ability of the lstm layer or the lack of an adequate number of hidden cell thus the double lstm model cannot fit the training data in addition the simulation results become worse in the validation process the failure of the double lstm model to predict water table depth further proves that a fully connected layer has strong fitting ability considering the results in table 3 one can conclude that the proposed model is more effective than both the ffnn and double lstm models in water table depth prediction the proposed model cannot only preserve previous hydrologic and climatic information while performing well in the time series process it also has a strong learning ability 5 conclusions in this study a new framework composed by one lstm layer and one fully connected layer is proposed for predicting water table depth in order to help engineers and decision makers to plan and manage groundwater resources in agricultural areas this framework is different from a traditional neural network model and has not been widely used in the field of hydrology the ability of the proposed model to predict monthly water table depth in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district and in the entire district itself were evaluated and discussed in addition the proposed model was also compared with double lstm model the major conclusions are as follows 1 the proposed model provides a promising new method for predicting water table depth as evidenced by satisfactory performance on water table depth prediction in five sub areas and hetao 2 the architecture of the proposed model is reasonable the lstm layer helps to maintain previous information and contributes to learning the time series data the dropout method helps to prevent overfitting during the training process a fully connected layer atop the lstm layer helps to improve the learning and fitting ability of the model 3 the newly proposed model provides a valuable tool for predicting water table depth it can serve as an alternative model to predict water table depth in places with complex hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain in the future we can design a deeper wider and more robust lstm based model in order to provide more accurate water table depth prediction worldwide in addition the proposed model also can be combined with other methods such as pca and wavelet transform furthermore the proposed model can be applied to other time series prediction tasks such as soil water change and streamflow prediction acknowledgments the

prediction 
7316,predicting water table depth over the long term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics boundary conditions and human activities also nonlinear interactions occur among these factors therefore a new time series model based on long short term memory lstm was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models the proposed model is composed of an lstm layer with another fully connected layer on top of it with a dropout method applied in the first lstm layer in this study the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district in arid northwestern china using data of 14 years 2000 2013 the proposed model uses monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input data to predict water table depth a simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre process data to ensure data on the same scale 14 years of data are separated into two sets training set 2000 2011 and validation set 2012 2013 in the experiment as expected the proposed model achieves higher r 2 scores 0 789 0 952 in water table depth prediction when compared with the results of traditional feed forward neural network ffnn which only reaches relatively low r 2 scores 0 004 0 495 proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well furthermore the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model s architecture are discussed through experimentation the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly in addition comparisons between the r 2 scores of the proposed model and double lstm model r 2 scores range from 0 170 to 0 864 further prove that the proposed model s architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data thus one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain keywords machine learning model water table depth deep learning lstm hetao irrigation district 1 introduction groundwater provides an important source of water for domestic agricultural and industrial use however groundwater resources are vulnerable to over exploitation climate change and biochemical pollution bouwer 2000 sophocleous 2005 evans and sadler 2008 white and falkland 2010 karandish et al 2015 as a result many areas over the world face groundwater shortages an example of such areas is the hetao irrigation district one of the largest irrigation districts in china that is located in the arid area of the yellow river watershed the yellow river serves as the main source of irrigation water in this district however the availability of irrigation water from the yellow river has decreased dramatically with intensified water resource use in the yellow river watershed yang et al 2003 therefore groundwater has become an important source of supplementary irrigation water in hetao irrigation district the effective management of groundwater resources especially in the context of increased groundwater demands for agriculture use is necessary to provide sustainable use of water resources in hetao irrigation district sustainable groundwater planning and management requires accurate forecasting of water table depth wang et al 2014 an accurate and reliable assessment of water table depth can help engineers and decision makers to 1 develop optimal water resource allocation strategies 2 adjust crop patterns in different sub irrigation areas and 3 develop optimal irrigation schedules while controlling the effects of salinity related to intensive irrigation xu et al 2010 the objective of this study is to develop an effective and accurate method for predicting water table depth that can be used to help engineers and decision makers manage groundwater resources and make management decisions in the last two decades predictions of water table depth have usually been made by using physically based models such as modflow and hydrus e g pang et al 2000 batelaan et al 2003 zume and tarhule 2008 faulkner et al 2009 xu et al 2012 however those models have many practical limitations because they are always data demanding and time consuming during model development and calibration using physically based models to predict water table depth in hetao irrigation district is particularly challenging because the district covers a large area lacks abundant hydrogeological data and has strong spatial and seasonal variability in freeze thaw periods in the last decade many studies have investigated the advantages and disadvantages of various physically based models and evaluated their prediction performance with that of emerging data driven machine learning methods the machine learning methods include multiple linear regression mlr sahoo and jha 2013 support vector regression svr yu et al 2006 yoon et al 2011 belayneh et al 2014 mirzavand and ghazavi 2015 and artificial neural networks ann raman and sunilkumar 1995 daliakopoulos et al 2005 sarangi et al 2006 napolitano et al 2011 parchami araghi et al 2013 seo et al 2015 chang et al 2016 these statistical methods explore the spatial and temporal patterns hidden in historical data without using a physical model because the latter always requires a large number of physical parameters and a deep understanding of the physical processes of the modeling domain in many cases machine learning methods can achieve a better predictive performance than physically based models parkin et al 2007 chu and chang 2009 mohanty et al 2013 karandish and šimunek 2016 for example mohanty et al 2013 found that an ann model provided a better prediction of water table depth than modflow for short term predictions karandish and šimunek 2016 found that both adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system and svm models performed well when compared with hydrus 2d for water stressed conditions therefore machine learning methods provide promising tools for predicting water table depth ann methods are used in this study for predicting water table depth because ann has a strong self learning ability which is suitable for complicated problems however traditional ffnn models do not have the ability to learn time series data because they cannot preserve previous information resulting in limited prediction capability for long term time series data such as data related to water table depth cannas et al 2006 this problem can be resolved by using more advanced ffnn models recently researchers have integrated ffnn with other methods such as genetic algorithms ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 bahrami et al 2016 mehr and kahya 2017 wavelet transform adamowski and chan 2011 kisi and shiri 2012 nourani et al 2015 and singular spectrum analysis sahoo et al 2017 polomčićet al 2017 genetic algorithm can be applied to optimize neural networks wavelet transform and singular spectrum analysis can pre process time series data then add processed time series data into neural networks and thus allow ffnn models to learn time series data very well however these advanced ffnn models require complicated procedures related to data pre processing for example sahoo et al 2017 first employed singular spectrum analysis to decompose time series data into separable and interpretable reconstructed components and then applied genetic algorithm to select the best reconstructed components as inputs of ffnn while this data pre processing can strengthen the ability of a ffnn model to learn time series data subjective user intervention is needed e g choosing the number of different reconstructed components furthermore the pre processing is time consuming because of the calculation of many reconstructed components the present study focuses on a time series prediction task so recurrent neural network rnn rumelhart et al 1986 is a suitable choice a rnn model has internal self looped cells allowing the rnn to remember time series information and making it adept at performing time series tasks in addition in this study lstm a special kind of rnn that works well in processing long term time series data was chosen due to its sophisticated network structure compared with aforementioned advanced ffnn model the proposed lstm based model only applied a very simple data pre processing method lstm is a famous deep learning model it is recurrent where connections between units form a directed cycle allowing data to flow both forwards and backwards within the network then the previous information can be preserved for future use lstm model have already been used as a very advanced model in the field of artificial intelligence and deep learning such as in nature language processing mikolov et al 2010 sundermeyer et al 2012 speech recognition graves and jaitly 2014 machine translation sutskever et al 2014 and automatic image captioning wang et al 2016 however only a few studies have applied rnns or lstms to handle time series data in the field of hydrology silva et al 2013 the goal of this study was to develop a two layer lstm based model for predicting water table depth in hetao irrigation district the model contained one layer of lstm and a fully connected layer atop of the lstm layer the model employed monthly water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature and time as input variables for predicting water table depth in the district the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the study area and observational data are introduced section 3 illustrates rnn lstm dropout regularization the proposed model s architecture and model evaluation criteria section 4 presents the experiment results and discussion finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 study area and observational data 2 1 study area hetao irrigation district lies within bayannaoer city inner mongolia china 106 20 109 29 n 40 14 41 18 e elevation 1020 1050 m a s l the yellow river and wolf mountain form the northern and southern boundaries respectively characterized by narrow strips of flat terrain and fertile land the entire hetao irrigation district has been divided into five sub areas from west to east as follows ulanbuh jiefangzha yongji yichang and urad fig 1 based on management practices mean annual precipitation is 169 4 mm about 70 of which falls during june september the maximum precipitation occurs in august the mean minimum and maximum temperatures were 3 9 c 14 6 c and 28 4 c respectively china meteorological data service center 1954 2013 hetao irrigation district covers 11 073 km2 the central part of the district is about 180 km long and 60 km wide about 52 5740 km2 of the entire terrestrial area is irrigated a total of 227 monitoring wells are used in the district fig 1 with the water table depth measured every 5 days because monthly data are used in the model the measured water table depth is averaged by month 2 2 data and statistical analysis our experiments used 14 years 2000 2013 of time series data from the five sub areas in hetao irrigation district since people in this district use surface water pumping volume is very small so it was omitted in this study therefore at the beginning the data included water diversion precipitation evaporation temperature water table depth area of the region water consumption for industry and domestic use then lasso regression yuan and lin 2006 tibshirani 1996 a statistical method that can be used to select variables was applied to choose important variables from the original data based on regression weights finally only five variables were chosen for this study water diversion precipitation evaporation volume temperature and water table depth time series of these variables are presented for the five sub areas of the district fig 2 from fig 2 these data were found to have periodic characteristics therefore time at the monthly scale has also been used as an input variable to improve the model s ability to generalize creating a sixth variable in the present study the first 12 years of time series data were used as a training set and the next two years of data was used as a validation set a statistic description of the water table depth of different sub areas is shown in table 1 table 1 shows that ulanbuh had the smallest standard deviation 0 331 m and range of water table depth 1 297 m meaning the water table depth of ulanbuh is more stable than that of other areas 2 3 data pre processing as shown in fig 2 the input data varied widely these differences will have a negative effect on the model s ability to learn therefore all six of the variables were standardized to ensure they remain on the same scale this pre processing can guarantee a stable convergence of parameters in the model developed in the present study the standardization formula is as follows 1 x ij new x ij x i σ i where x ij represents data in ith year jth month x i and σ i are the average and standard deviation of data in the ith year respectively 3 methodology 3 1 long short term memory network lstm before introducing lstm we would like to first introduce rnn because lstm is a special kind of rnn rnns were first developed in the 1980s these networks have connections between neurons and form a directed cycle this type of structure creates an internal self looped cell which allows it to display dynamic temporal behavior rnns have chain like structures of repeating modules fig 3 a these structures can help rnns to remember previous information which allows the rnns to process arbitrary long time sequences therefore rnns have been successful in learning sequences forward propagation begins with a specific initial state h 0 0 for each time step from t 1 to t τ the following update equations were applied 2 h t tanh b h wh t 1 ux t 3 o t b o vh t where x t is the input vector at time t and h t 1 is the hidden cell state at time t 1 the parameters are the bias vector b h and b o as well as the weight matrices u w and v for input to hidden hidden to hidden and hidden to output connections respectively the gradients of the rnns can be computed via back propagation through time rumelhart et al 1986 werbos 1990 however back propagation through time is not sufficiently efficient to learn a pattern from long term dependency because of a gradient vanishing problem hochreiter 1998 this problem can be solved by the structure of lstms hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 graves 2012 jozefowicz et al 2015 like rnns lstms also have chain like modules but the repeating modules have more complicated structures each repeating module of lstms contain a memory block this memory block is specifically designed to store information over long time periods the memory block contains four parts a cec the constant error carousel cell in addition to three special multiplicative units called gates the cec cell runs straight down the entire chain without any activation function and thus the gradient does not vanish when back propagation through time is applied to train a lstm therefore lstms have been shown to learn long term dependencies more easily than rnns because information can easily flow along the cells unchanged furthermore the input forget gers et al 2000 and output gates in each memory block can control the flow of information inside memory block the input forget and output gates control the extent to which new input flows into a cec cell information is stored in a cell and output flows of the cell into the rest of the networks respectively a schematic of memory block is shown in fig 3 b it includes block input three gates input forget output and a cec cell similar to rnns lstms computes a mapping from an input sequence x to an output sequence y by calculating the network unit activations using the following equations iteratively from t 1 to t τ with initial values c 0 0 and h 0 0 4 i t σ w i x t u i h t 1 b i 5 f t σ w f x t u f h t 1 b f 6 o t σ w o x t u o h t 1 b o 7 c t tanh w c x t u c h t 1 b c 8 c t f t c t 1 i t c t 9 h t o t tanh c t where w i w f and w o denote the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the input respectively similarly u i u f and u o denote the matrix of weights from the input forget and output gates to the hidden respectively b i b f b o denote the input forget and output gate bias vectors respectively σ is an element wise non linear activation function logistic sigmoid i t f t ot and c t are the input forget output gates and the cell state vectors at time t respectively all of which are the same size as the cell output vector h t the element wise multiplication of two vectors is denoted with 3 2 dropout for neural networks deep neural networks are well suited to process big data however deep neural networks with large number of parameters can easily be overfitting especially when data are limited therefore dropout provides an effective regularization method that can be used to solve this problem hinton et al 2012 srivastava et al 2014 the most important idea of dropout method is that at each training iteration when the neural network is updating a certain layer where the dropout is applied it randomly does not update or dropout some neurons with probability p in this layer this means that a part of the neural network was sampled and it was trained at one iteration in each iteration of training a different part of the network was sampled and trained with dropout the weights of the neurons learned through backpropagation become somewhat more insensitive to the weights of the other neurons thus dropout can help to prevent the networks from relying on certain neurons in the layers too much and reduce the neurons co adaptability at testing time all of the neurons of the networks are retained no dropout but the activations are scaled by p probability of dropout a neural network whose first and second hidden layers have been applied dropout is shown in fig 4 3 3 our proposed model framework in this work we were interested in predicting water table depth this is a time series problem because the current water table depth has changed in a way that is dependent on previous this time series prediction was cast as a regression problem the proposed model is illustrated in fig 6 a the input data were first put into the lstm layer the input gate of the lstm layer will recompose input data and decide which input data is important this process is similar to principal component analysis pca however the lstm layer can preserve previous information which can help to improve the ability of the model to learn time series data a fully connected layer is set atop the lstm layer in order to improve the model s learning ability moreover dropout is set on the lstm layer to prevent overfitting the loss function is defined below 10 loss i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi is measured value at time i and y i is predicted value at time i however this model framework has some limitations first the initial parameters of the proposed model will affect the final results in addition even though an lstm layer has a strong ability to learn time series data its fitting ability may be insufficient therefore a fully connected layer was added atop of a single lstm layer nevertheless exactly how many lstm layers should be used as hidden layers in order to reach the optimized results remained unknown the flowchart of the proposed model framework is displayed in fig 5 all of the code in this study was written in the theano package of python software throughout the computation was performed on an intel core i5 4210u cpu with 4g ram 3 4 model evaluation criteria in this study the root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r 2 were used to evaluate the model s accuracy between the measured and predicted values r 2 measures the degree of how well the outcomes are replicated by the model ranging between 1 where for optimal model prediction an r 2 score close to 1 is preferred the r 2 equation is as follows 11 r 2 i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where yi is measured value at time i y is mean of yi i 1 n and y i is predicted value at time i diverse types of information related to the predictive capacities of the model were measured through rmse rmse measures the prediction precision which creates a positive value by squaring the errors rmse scores range between 0 and the model prediction is ideal if rmse is 0 rmse is defined as 12 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n 4 results and discussions in section 4 1 the first 12 years of data were used including water diversion evaporation precipitation temperature month and water table depth to train the proposed model different models were used for different areas each model was trained using stochastic gradient descent sgd method in order to observe the changes in water table depth in the entire hetao irrigation district the proposed model also has been evaluated in the entire area whose temperature was the average of five sub areas and precipitation water diversion and evaporation volume were sum of five sub areas this all encompassing area was named hetao it is reasonable to expect that the proposed model can work well in the entire area if it can perform well in other sub areas in addition the proposed model was compared with ffnn in the water table depth prediction in section 4 2 the effectiveness of dropout was explored finally section 4 3 discusses the architecture of the proposed model and compares it with a double lstm model 4 1 water table depth prediction results as mentioned above in the training process the first 12 years of data were used to train the proposed model in different areas after the models had been trained each model was validated through use of the validation set and tuned the hyper parameters of the models two performance metrics of different models in different sub areas and hetao were computed in order to obtain the optimal model hyper parameters the number of hidden neurons in the lstm layer and the learning rate the optimal hyper parameters of the proposed model used for water table depth prediction are shown in table 2 first row note that models for different areas use the same hyper parameters in order to illustrate how hyper parameters affect the results different hyper parameters were set for the proposed model and the yongji sub area was used as an example results including training loss r 2 and running time are also displayed in table 2 from table 2 it can be learned that a higher learning rate 10 3 may cause the optimization task to miss the optimal point r 2 was only 0 62 however a lower learning rate 10 5 may help to avoid overshooting but may cause the model to use a longer time to converge too many training iterations may not ensure more optimal results the results from 20 000 and 40 000 training iterations were the same in addition it is common to set a dropout probability to 0 5 in the deep learning field as introduced by hinton et al 2012 moreover too many neurons 70 in this study are computationally expensive 20 000 iterations in 9 76 min and often cause overfitting meanwhile having an insufficient number of neurons 10 in this study may decrease the network s learning ability as can be seen in table 2 therefore during implementation 40 hidden neurons were chosen in the lstm layer to compare the proposed model with ffnn model ffnn model in different areas were also trained using the same hyper parameters as mentioned above results in terms of the two evaluation metrics in different areas are summarized in table 3 from table 3 the r 2 of the proposed model ranged from 0 789 to 0 952 and rmse from 0 070 m to 0 184 m the r 2 of the proposed model was much higher than that of ffnn model which ranged from 0 004 to 0 466 in addition the rmse of the proposed model was much smaller than that of ffnn model with the rmse ranging from 0 239 m to 0 372 m these findings indicate that the proposed model can predict water table depth more accurately than other methods table 3 also shows that the proposed model has the best performance in ulanbuh s water table depth prediction r 2 0 952 rmse 0 070 m we believe this occurred because the range and standard deviation of water table depth in ulanuh were the smallest table 1 meaning the water table depth was more stable in ulanbuh than in other areas the proposed model produced better results with respect to r 2 and rmse than the ffnn model especially in yichang and urad where the performance metrics of the proposed model were much better than the ffnn model s in addition table 3 illustrates that the proposed model also worked well in predicting the water table depth in the hetao area meaning the proposed model can be used to predict the water table depth in the entire hetao irrigation district fig 7 displays the measured and predicted water table depth from both the proposed and the ffnn models in different sub areas for brevity only the results of yichang urad and hetao are presented fig 7 showing both the proposed and the ffnn models can capture the variation trend of water table depth in these three areas however the ffnn model fails to accurately predict the water table depth because it cannot capture the previous information which is further illustrated in fig 8 the ffnn model was found to not accurately predict the water table depth in the first month of 2012 indicating that the ffnn model cannot remember the previous water table depth this phenomenon is especially obvious in yichang and urad because during 2009 2011 the government decreased the irrigation volume there leading to a 40 60 cm increase in water table depth therefore even though a traditional ffnn model has strong ability to represent the variation in water table depth it cannot predict water table depth as accurately as the proposed model this further confirms the lstm s ability to process time series data 4 2 dropout effect in order to explore the dropout method that was used to prohibit overfitting the results from the proposed model were compared with a model with same architecture but without applying dropout in the lstm layer the same hyper parameters 40 hidden neurons 10 4 learning rate and 20 000 training iterations were set in the model without dropout and its performance was compared with the proposed model in water table depth prediction training loss and two evaluation metrics were used for evaluating these two models fig 9 shows the prediction results of the proposed model and the model without dropout in three areas the evaluation metrics and training loss are shown in table 3 from fig 9 one can see that the proposed model and model without dropout provided very similar results in the training process in different areas however the results in the validating process showed stronger deviations from the predicted value table 3 shows that the training loss of the proposed model ranged from 7 34 to 11 42 whereas that of model without dropout ranged from 0 725 to 1 204 however the r 2 of the proposed model was higher than that of model without dropout which ranged from 0 368 to 0 874 also the rmse of the proposed model was smaller than that of model without dropout which ranged from 0 114 m to 0 289 m these findings indicate that even though the model without dropout can fit training data perfectly it cannot predict the last two years of water table depth as well as the proposed model this phenomenon is a typical overfitting however from the reported result of the proposed model the conclusion could be drawn that the dropout method can help the proposed model by preventing overfitting 4 3 discussion about model structure note that the proposed model has one layer of lstm and one fully connected layer the proposed model was compared with the ffnn model in section 4 1 to discuss the proposed model s ability to preserve previous information and process time series data therefore in order to discuss the learning ability of the proposed model it was also compared with a model that has different structures but the same architectural scale two hidden layers like a model that has two lstm layers double lstm since a double lstm model has two hidden lstm layers one can intuitively expect that this model can forecast water table depth well in these areas the architecture of the double lstm model is illustrated in fig 6 b similar to section 4 1 two evaluation metrics of these two models were compared the double lstm model is very similar to the proposed model only change the fully connected layer to lstm layer in double lstm model the same hyper parameters were used to train the double lstm model in different areas table 3 shows summarized results of these two models table 3 shows that the r 2 of the proposed model was higher than that of the double lstm model which ranged from 0 170 to 0 864 meanwhile the rmse of the proposed model was smaller than that of the double lstm model which ranged from 0 119 m to 0 331 m fig 10 shows the prediction results of both the proposed and double lstm models one can see that although both the models performed well in capturing variations in the water table depth the double lstm model failed to fit data in the training process as can obviously be seen at the peak values we believe this phenomenon was caused by the insufficient fitting ability of the lstm layer or the lack of an adequate number of hidden cell thus the double lstm model cannot fit the training data in addition the simulation results become worse in the validation process the failure of the double lstm model to predict water table depth further proves that a fully connected layer has strong fitting ability considering the results in table 3 one can conclude that the proposed model is more effective than both the ffnn and double lstm models in water table depth prediction the proposed model cannot only preserve previous hydrologic and climatic information while performing well in the time series process it also has a strong learning ability 5 conclusions in this study a new framework composed by one lstm layer and one fully connected layer is proposed for predicting water table depth in order to help engineers and decision makers to plan and manage groundwater resources in agricultural areas this framework is different from a traditional neural network model and has not been widely used in the field of hydrology the ability of the proposed model to predict monthly water table depth in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district and in the entire district itself were evaluated and discussed in addition the proposed model was also compared with double lstm model the major conclusions are as follows 1 the proposed model provides a promising new method for predicting water table depth as evidenced by satisfactory performance on water table depth prediction in five sub areas and hetao 2 the architecture of the proposed model is reasonable the lstm layer helps to maintain previous information and contributes to learning the time series data the dropout method helps to prevent overfitting during the training process a fully connected layer atop the lstm layer helps to improve the learning and fitting ability of the model 3 the newly proposed model provides a valuable tool for predicting water table depth it can serve as an alternative model to predict water table depth in places with complex hydrogeological characteristics and hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain in the future we can design a deeper wider and more robust lstm based model in order to provide more accurate water table depth prediction worldwide in addition the proposed model also can be combined with other methods such as pca and wavelet transform furthermore the proposed model can be applied to other time series prediction tasks such as soil water change and streamflow prediction acknowledgments the

7317,hydrological and hydrodynamic models are core tools for simulation of large basins and complex river systems associated to wetlands recent studies have pointed towards the importance of online coupling strategies representing feedbacks between floodplain inundation and vertical hydrology especially across semi arid regions soil floodplain interactions can be strong in this study we included a two way coupling scheme in a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic model mgb and tested different model structures in order to assess which processes are important to be simulated in large semi arid wetlands and how these processes interact with water budget components to demonstrate benefits from this coupling over a validation case the model was applied to the upper niger river basin encompassing the niger inner delta a vast semi arid wetland in the sahel desert simulation was carried out from 1999 to 2014 with daily tmpa 3b42 precipitation as forcing using both in situ and remotely sensed data for calibration and validation model outputs were in good agreement with discharge and water levels at stations both upstream and downstream of the inner delta nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 6 for most gauges as well as for flooded areas within the delta region nse 0 6 r 0 85 model estimates of annual water losses across the delta varied between 20 1 and 30 6 km3 yr while annual evapotranspiration ranged between 760 mm yr and 1130 mm yr evaluation of model structure indicated that representation of both floodplain channels hydrodynamics storage bifurcations lateral connections and vertical hydrological processes floodplain water infiltration into soil column evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water are necessary to correctly simulate flood wave attenuation and evapotranspiration along the basin two way coupled models are necessary to better understand processes in large semi arid wetlands finally such coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling proves to be an important tool for integrated evaluation of hydrological processes in such poorly gauged large scale basins we hope that this model application provides new

model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 modelo de grandes bacias or large basins model is a semi distributed rainfall runoff model developed for simulation of large basins fig 3 in its most recent version river maps are extracted from high resolution dems using a vector based approach and the basin is divided into unit catchments fig 1c each one containing a single river reach with associated floodplain and hydrological vertical water and energy balance within each unit catchment hydrological response units hru s are defined based on soil type and land use fig 1d and for each one the water and energy budget is computed through the soil vegetation system surface subsurface and groundwater outflows from water balance are routed to the main river of the unit catchment using linear reservoirs while flow propagation through drainage networks is computed using the muskingum cunge method or 1d hydrodynamic equations additionally sub basins are defined as macro regions unifying many unit catchments with the same model parameter values fig 1b main model parameters are related to soil water budget for each hru maximum soil water storage wm based on arno rainfall runoff model todini 1996 two equivalent hydraulic conductivities kbas and kint parameter from the variable contributing area model for runoff generation b and three parameters related to surface subsurface and base flow residence time cs ci and cb supplementary material a1 presents model calibrated parameters for the upper niger river basin and a detailed explanation of model parameters is provided by collischonn et al 2007 additionally the hydrodynamic module requires width bankfull depth and bed elevation for each river reach one per unit catchment as well as manning n roughness coefficient and floodplain topography see description in section 3 1 3 model forcing data are precipitation and surface meteorological data for energy budget and evapotranspiration computation wind speed solar radiation relative humidity air pressure and air temperature for each unit catchment observed precipitation is interpolated to the respective centroid using an inverse square distance method while meteorological data values are attributed by nearest neighbor interpolation details on datasets used in the niger model application are presented in section 3 1 3 evapotranspiration is calculated with penman monteith equation following methodology by wigmosta et al 1994 where evaporative demand is first available for evaporation of vegetation interception water and the remaining demand is used for soil evapotranspiration or open water evaporation from flooded areas limited plant evapotranspiration due to soil water deficit is considered by increasing surface resistance under water stress situation collischonn et al 2007 the most recent flood wave routing available method which was used in this study is based on the 1d inertial formulation developed by bates et al 2010 it is a simplification of saint venant s equation by neglecting the local acceleration term and has been recently applied with success in many large scale models including the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 and other areas across the globe férnandez et al 2016 pontes et al 2017 time step is governed by courant freidrichs levy condition bates et al 2010 in mgb model each unit catchment has one river reach with rectangular cross section with pre defined width bankfull depth and manning s n coefficient for each unit catchment a stage area volume relationship is derived from dem using the hand model rennó et al 2008 and following the approach described in yamazaki et al 2013 which is used for estimation of sub grid floodplain topography paiva et al 2011 pontes et al 2017 also bankfull level is automatically derived from the dem as the average elevation pixels along channel pixels for each unit catchment then the bankfull depth a model parameter as defined in the section 3 1 3 is discounted from it to yield the unit catchment channel bed elevation at each time step discharge is calculated between upstream downstream adjacent unit catchments or between neighbor unit catchments with pre defined lateral connection see next section 3 1 3 for description of lateral connections and then those calculated flows are computed in the unit catchment water storage together with evaporation and precipitation over flooded areas and generated streamflow the stage volume relationship is used to convert the unit catchment updated volume into water level yamazaki et al 2011 while the stage area relationship is used to estimate the flooded area within the unit catchment which is then used to calculate open water evaporation 3 1 2 two way coupling scheme in this work we included and evaluated new processes in the mgb model which we refer to as a two way coupling scheme between hydrological and hydrodynamic modules firstly infiltration from flooded areas into unsaturated soil column was implemented this process may be important in regions where flooding occurs from exogenous sources into areas where soils are relatively dry before flood arrival e g niger main stem channel flooding the inner delta secondly the model was allowed to dynamically represent the changes in evapotranspiration and open water evaporation due to variations in land cover during flooding i e differing bare soil vegetation from flooded areas for each unit catchment at each time interval infiltration from floodplain into soil column is computed based on the degree of soil saturation and unit catchment flooding area assuming that infiltration rate is linearly dependent on soil water deficit 1 dinf a fl a kinf 1 w w m where a fl km2 is the flooded area at a given unit catchment a the unit catchment area km2 kinf the infiltration rate that occurs when the whole unit catchment is flooded and soil is totally dry mm day 1 w w m the soil saturation degree kinf has been calibrated together with other vertical hydrological balance parameters see supplementary material a1 for the calibrated parameters and model sensitivity to it is discussed in section 3 4 then the calculated infiltration volume is removed from the unit catchment s flood control volume hydrodynamic module and inserted into unit catchment s soil water storage hydrological module regarding the dynamic evapotranspiration at each time step the flooded fraction of the unit catchment is computed and open water evaporation is calculated for this area while the remaining area is used for soil plant evapotranspiration furthermore it was observed that unrealistic high evaporated volumes from the channel occurred during low flow periods leading to almost dry channels because the assumption of a rectangular cross section led to large widths and thus large channel surface area during low flows then a modification was applied for the open water evaporation computation when water level is below bankfull depth for the computation of open water evaporation only channel surface area was considered zero when river channel was dry ephemeral rivers and increased linearly until bankfull depth where flooded area equaled the channel surface area channel width times length 3 1 3 niger river basin model setup in order to correctly represent the dense network drainage in the niger inner delta we diminished the minimum number of cells required to define the beginning of a river channel from 800 cells default value each cell is 250 250 m to 250 cells in the inner delta the result was a much denser drainage within the inner delta figs 1a and 2 in order to represent channel bifurcation and diffuse flows along niger inner delta floodplain lateral connections rectangular channels with pre defined width and depth values were set between all neighbor unit catchments along the inner delta region including main distributaries diaka river in southern delta and issa ber bara issa and kolikoli branches at the entrance of northern delta given the high density of unit catchments defined throughout the inner delta this approach leads to an unstructured 2d model i e a pseudo 2d in this region this approach was applied by pontes et al 2017 to simulate flooding in the bananal island floodplain central brazil and is similar to the flow bifurcation scheme proposed by yamazaki et al 2014 considering the unit catchment area as a circle the length of the connection channel is computed as the sum of the radiuses of two adjacent unit catchments l a 1 π a 2 π where l is the channel length km and a1 and a2 are the values for the area of the unit catchments connected by the channel km2 the model was run from 1999 to 2014 using tmpa 3b42 v7 daily precipitation product available at https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm huffman et al 2007 as forcing data with 0 25 spatial resolution together with cru 10 long term climatology data monthly climate normals of wind speed solar radiation relative humidity air pressure and air temperature were used new et al 2002 for computation of model evapotranspiration the first year was removed from analysis due to model initial conditions downstream boundary condition at niamey is set as a constant water level slope of 10 cm km which was derived from average values of srtm dem elevation along downstream reaches extraction of drainage networks and sub grid floodplain topography was carried out using the cgiar void filled srtm 250 m digital elevation model available at http srtm csi cgiar org and iph hydrotools package siqueira et al 2016 the basin was discretized into 4307 unit catchments average area 153 km2 standard deviation 182 km2 of equal reach length fig 1c set here to 10 km land use and soil type maps were obtained from ecoclimap masson et al 2003 and their combination led to the definition of 11 hydrological response units fig 1d regarding hydrodynamic module parameters manning s n coefficient was globally set as 0 03 for simplification which is a commonly adopted value in large scale models channel width was obtained from a simple manual extraction of landsat 8 imagery for the niger main stem 800 m wide for the first 750 km 500 m for the following 250 km 700 m along 100 km 600 m along 300 km and 500 m for the last 800 km see fig a1 supplementary material a for the other reaches the following simple geomorphic relationship was used w 0 95 a 0 5 where w is width m and a is the reach upstream drainage area km2 this relationship adjusted well to in situ surveyed cross sections bankfull depth was calibrated against observed discharge for the niger main stem reaches and maintaining coherence with a few surveyed cross sections available from autorité du bassin du niger abn fig a1 bankfull depth was subtracted from channel bankfull elevation computed as average pixels along river reach along a given unit catchment to yield channel bed elevation the following geomorphic relationship was used for the remaining river reaches d 0 15 a 0 25 where d is bankfull depth m it was consistent with surveyed cross sections specific parameterization is justified for the niger main stem since width and depth values do not follow a simple relationship with drainage area in this river fig a1 supplementary material present the final values of width and bankfull depth for river reaches within inner delta the following parameters were adopted width of 30 m and 200 m and bankfull depth of 0 5 m and 1 m for all reaches within southern and northern inner delta regions respectively these values were adopted since the drainage in the region does not follow a dendritic pattern with only one upstream downstream direction and a defined upstream drainage area as given by one direction flow direction maps width values were consistent with landsat 8 imagery while depth ones were adopted for simplicity for each lateral connection channel width was assumed with the same values as adjacent delta river reaches defined as 200 and 30 m for southern and northern areas and bankfull elevation was assumed with the same elevation as the respective connected unit catchments finally specific parameters were manually extracted from landsat 8 for main distributaries that exist along the inner delta diaka river a distributary at the entrance of southern delta that drains a significant part of main stem discharge and three main distributaries that exist downstream of lac débo region at the beginning of northern inner delta issa ber bara issa and kolikoli branches olivry 1993 3 1 4 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated against observed discharge and validated with flood extent and water level for the same 2000 2014 simulation period following the methodology used by paiva et al 2013 the model was manually calibrated with observed daily discharge provided by the niger basin authority abn http www abn ne for the 2000 2014 simulation period disregarding first year spin up period for computation of performance metrics gauges used for calibration are listed in table 2 of results section see fig 1a for their location calibrated parameters related to hydrological vertical balance are presented in supplementary material a1 while niger main stem calibrated depth is presented in fig a1 additionally a sensitivity analysis of model key parameters is performed in section 4 1 4 the model was validated against satellite altimetry and satellite derived flood extent daily water surface elevations wse at seven locations were interpolated from wse series gained by processing the data provided by the jason 2 envisat and saral satellite altimetry missions where the satellite orbits cross the drainage network namely at so called virtual stations vs seven vss fig 1a were used located 1 upstream the inner delta vs1 2 within the inner delta vs4 3 immediately downstream the inner delta vs2 and vs7 and 4 in the vicinity of ansongo vs3 vs5 and vs6 these vss should provide a variety of locations to assess model performance in terms of water levels estimates the analysis was performed for water level anomalies by subtracting daily water levels by the long term water level average the altimetry data were processed manually following the method by santos da silva et al 2010 2012 and using ranges outcoming of the ice 1 retracker which has been shown to provide robust estimates of the water surface elevation in the context of river reaches frappart et al 2006 estimation of the flooded surfaces was obtained from bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 which study was based on classification of modis imagery the product uses 8 day modis data for the period 2000 2013 to yield a 500 m spatial resolution estimation of flooded areas along the niger inner delta and threshold values for classification of pixels are based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and modis band 5 1230 1250 nm values this part of the spectra of the modis band 5 has the capacity to detect very shallow water and water with high concentration of sediments as it is often the case in floodplain in arid regions bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 a total of five classes are provided for the region open water mix water dry land aquatic vegetation vegetation and dry land model performance was evaluated with the following metrics for daily discharges nash sutcliffe nse nash sutcliffe of variable logarithm nse log which enhances errors in low flows delay index di time delay that leads to best pearson correlation between modeled and observed series paiva et al 2013 volume error dv long term model bias and visual inspection water level was evaluated with nse and di and flooded areas were evaluated with nse and pearson correlation metrics 3 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes we assessed the niger inner delta flood patterns and the impact of different model structures on its dynamics through a series of simulation scenarios firstly fluxes over the delta were computed monthly and annual et and precipitation and compared to values from the literature water losses through et were compared in terms of soil vegetation and open water evaporation terms then flood extent maps across the region were evaluated for different periods of the year and through a set of simulation scenarios to evaluate the seasonality patterns and the importance of bifurcations and floodplain channels in the flood dynamics five scenarios were considered a no lateral connections across the whole basin b no lateral connection in southern delta c no lateral connection in northern delta d lateral connection only for diaka river distributary and e default simulation i e with lateral connections for the whole delta region finally a sensitivity analysis section 4 2 1 was carried out to understand the impacts of different key parameters on the delta hydrodynamics the tested parameters were kinf infiltration from floodplain into soil column kinf 0 10 20 30 and 40 mm day lateral connection width for northern and southern delta regions 50 100 500 variation and channel width and depth 20 50 variation results are evaluated for climatology of evapotranspiration et discharge q and flooded areas fa 4 results 4 1 coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulation 4 1 1 calibration with discharge observations mgb was calibrated with in situ observed discharge and calibrated hydrographs are presented in fig 4 table 1 shows performance metrics nse nselog di and dv globally model presents a good performance both upstream and downstream the inner delta region with nse 0 6 for most gauges gauges upstream of the inner delta faranah mandiana banankoro and koulikoro presented nse values between 0 64 and 0 74 while baseflow reflected by nselog were also well simulated some discrepancies occurred however between simulated years in 2008 for instance the rainfall amount from tmpa 3b42 is very high and leads to discharge overestimation in addition as shown by diré gauge station nse 0 81 nselog 0 72 the model also performed well along and downstream of niger inner delta where floodplain effects and hydrological processes within arid regions play an important role a delay index di of 8 days is also satisfactory given the months of delay that the flood wave is subjected to along the delta however in almost all years an overestimation of recession limb can be observed this volume surplus is also observed in downstream gauges e g ansongo and niamey finally it is interesting to note that years with poorest model performance downstream the delta were also the poorest simulated in koulikoro gauge station upstream the delta and the niger confluence with bani river the low model performance in bani basin douna station due to reservoir flow regulation did not seem to affect significantly the calculated hydrograph at diré in the niger right bank downstream of ansongo the red flood tributaries alcongui kakassi and garbey stations presented low nse and nse log performance in comparison to other gauges 4 1 2 validation with satellite altimetry time series of water level anomalies water level subtracted by long term average from the mgb model coincident to virtual stations vs1 7 fig 1a are presented in fig 5 and performance metrics in table 2 the mgb model was also validated with observed in situ water level what is presented in supplementary material b not included here for brevity first mgb model wlas were in agreement with satellite altimetry ones for all vss the shape is preserved and the peak time is mostly respected at most of vss absolute variation i e the difference between maximum and minimum anomaly was similar for both model and satellite estimates at vs2 fig 5b the model tended to overestimate the water level variation principally in high waters at vs4 and vs5 the amplitude was respected but the lower value e g the anomaly at low waters was underestimated the specific case of the 2008 2009 hydrologic year should be highlighted for this period the model presented a high wla that was not observed in the wla time series from satellite altimetry this point was neither observed on in situ discharge time series nor on in situ wla time series supplementary material b and seems to evidence a possible issue in the precipitation rate for this year the performance indicators table 2 corroborate these conclusions nse efficiency coefficient is usually above 0 5 and below it only for vs2 and vs4 for vs2 outliers at high stages are expected to impact negatively nse while for vs4 there seems to be a bias between estimated and observed by satellite altimetry wla rmse values present similar behavior with values below 0 9 m for vs1 vs3 vs5 vs6 and vs7 some discrepancies could have been avoided by filtering altimetry wse time series which clearly contain outliers these outliers could have been removed but we chose to keep the raw time series without any post processing based on model estimated time series shape also as the means used to convert the absolute elevations into anomalies were calculated over distinct periods the nominal period for each kind of data e g 1999 2014 for the model 2008 2014 for jason 2 and 2002 2010 and 2013 2014 for envisat and saral and as the time sampling is not the same neither it is expected that anomalies do not completely agree in terms of absolute value despite these limitations the model performed very well regarding to estimating wla 4 1 3 validation of flooded areas in niger inner delta simulated and observed time series of flooded areas are presented in fig 6 a while monthly climatology of these areas is shown in fig 6b fig 6c shows calculated flooded areas separately for northern and southern delta regions in general there was a good agreement between simulated and observed flooded areas modis classified product from bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 with nse 0 60 and r 0 85 maximum simulated flooded area was 11 000 km2 excluding anomalous 2008 2009 year for the whole delta region while maximum observed with modis was 12 000 km2 peaks were slightly higher for most years in remotely sensed observations and a pronounced overestimation of flooded area recession occurred as shown by monthly climatology southern and northern delta regions showed different flooding dynamics while the former had the largest flooded area 8000 km2 and typically peaks at late october the latter had peak flooded areas 3000 km2 occurring in late december 4 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes in this section we evaluate the impact of model structure and process representativeness on the niger inner delta hydrology by exploring the role of vertical hydrology infiltration rainfall hydrodynamics lateral connections distributaries flow bifurcation and the coupling between them infiltration open water evaporation on the inner delta hydrological response we also perform a sensitivity analysis of main model parameters related to the inner delta fig 7 presents model results of monthly and annual evapotranspiration with and without infiltration from floodplains into unsaturated soil together with tmpa precipitation data et was always larger than p along the delta due to open water evaporation that came from upstream catchments but the inclusion of floodplain infiltration largely increased it annual p varied between 250 mm yr and 600 mm yr while et without infiltration ranged from 420 mm yr to 720 mm yr and et with infiltration from 760 mm yr to 1130 mm yr table 3 presents water losses in southern and northern delta regions in terms of total et soil et and flooded areas open water evaporation total et had an annual maximum of 31 6 km3 yr and a monthly maximum of 10 km3 month northern and southern regions had a similar seasonal cycle monthly et flood peaked in november for both while et soil showed two peaks the first occurring in october due to local rainfall and the second one in january due to soil infiltration from floodplains losses through et soil were higher than et flood maximum et soil calculated values were 0 9 and 1 9 km3 yr for northern and southern regions respectively and et flood values were 0 5 and 1 8 km3 yr also northern region had always lower evapotranspiration losses than southern although observed data indicate that the opposite situation tends to occur mahé et al 2009 this may be explained by the cru long term monthly mean climate data used here local rainfall in the delta has little impact on niger main stem discharge but is important for evapotranspiration estimation and thus for land atmosphere modelling mgb simulations considering zero rainfall in the delta not presented here led to very small changes in diré calculated hydrograph and delta flooded areas but decreased annual total et in the delta from 912 114 mm yr mean sd to 612 114 mm yr regarding flood dynamics in the inner delta fig 8 shows maps of simulated flood water depth for 1st jun 2001 low flow 1st sep 2001 mid rising 20th oct 2001 flooded areas peak 1st jan 2002 mid falling limb and the maximum flood for southern and northern delta regions it can be seen how both areas differ in terms of flooding processes while the southern delta presents a more diffuse flooding pattern the northern delta has flooding mainly along floodplain channels that meander through erg of nianfunké dunes a set of stationary sand dunes running from west to east davies 1996 the seasonal flooding cycle is also evident fig 8b with low stage in june basically channel surfaces yielding flooded areas and peak floods in late october late december for southern northern delta by early january most southern delta flooding areas have already been drained also flooding in northern delta lasts longer than in south fig 8c presenting a higher residence time as noted by remote sensing studies ogilvie et al 2015 bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 fig 9 shows flooding maps for five different simulation scenarios a no lateral connections across the whole basin b no lateral connection in southern delta c no lateral connection in northern delta d lateral connection only for diaka river distributary and e default simulation the results contribute to the sensitivity analysis of the next section by showing spatial patterns of flooding across the delta simulation without lateral connections scenario a increased flooding along the niger main stem and in lower bani river possibly due to main stem backwater lateral connection also ensured important bifurcation that exists in the southern delta entrance diaka river see fig 2 bottom right figure although its only representation scenario d was not enough to flood the whole southern delta area diaka river diverted around 15 of main stem flow long term simulation average annual peaks in diaka varied between 5 and 25 of main stem peak in simulations this value is however sensitive to the hydraulic geometry assumed along the diaka river in turn in the northern delta a smaller sensitivity to lateral connections was observed although their implementation default simulation was important to flood the eastern part of the region as shown in the section of validation of flooded areas the modis product bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 agreed well with model simulated flood extent fig 9f presents the maximum estimated flooding across the inner delta from satellite data a comparison between et q and fa is also presented for the same five scenarios 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the impact of parameter estimation on the model results as well as to explore the niger inner delta functioning fig 10 sensitivity analysis of mgb hydrological vertical balance was performed by collischonn 2001 and paiva et al 2013 while sensitivity of the hydrodynamic routing model was evaluated by paiva et al 2013 for an amazon basin mgb application and by yamazaki et al 2011 for a global application of cama flood model in this study we focus on the model sensitivity in the niger inner delta region given its complex hydrodynamics and the formulation implemented for floodplain simulation in arid wetlands including infiltration from floodplains and lateral connections between neighbor unit catchments evaluated parameters are kinf infiltration from floodplain into soil column kinf 0 10 20 30 and 40 mm day lateral connection width for northern and southern delta regions 50 100 500 variation and channel width and depth 20 50 variation sensitivity results are evaluated for climatology of evapotranspiration et discharge q and flooded areas fa default simulation values as presented in model input data and parameterization section are infiltration kinf 20 mm day northern delta connection width ndeltawidth 200 m southern delta connection width sdeltawidth 30 m channel width and depth values are presented in fig a1 model discharge and flooded areas were more sensitive to channel width followed by channel bankfull depth values which drive similarly calculated et q and fa smaller values of these parameters lead to more water stored on floodplains and thus more attenuation in the hydrograph more water evaporated in the niger inner delta and larger flooded a 50 channel width decrease led to a 25 reduction in peak discharge in diré due to increased floodplain attenuation infiltration parameter kinf largely influenced evapotranspiration water transferred from floodplain into unsaturated soil became available for soil evapotranspiration systematically increasing et rates in contrast considering no infiltration into unsaturated soil kinf 0 led to a distinct behavior in q than did changes in channel width and depth evaporation of soil infiltrated water occurred after the rainfall period since during it soil saturation was relatively high and thus neglecting infiltration processes led to an overestimation of hydrograph recession from peak discharge to low water stage period also there was an upper limit for model sensitivity on this parameter since at very high infiltration rates soil became saturated and thus no more infiltration occurred a change on the widths of lateral connections led to different behaviors of q and fa between northern and southern delta regions high uncertainty is related to this parameter given its conceptual nature and thus a wide range of parameter variation was performed from 100 to 500 generally the model presented higher sensitivity in southern delta than in the northern one while a comparison between scenarios 100 no lateral connection and 500 in the southern area showed a peak discharge alteration of 500 m3 s in the northern one a change of less than 200 m3 s was observed in the southern part smaller connections led to smaller flooded areas across the region and higher flooding along the niger mainstem without connections diaka river distributary could not be represented since in the single downstream connectivity defined by a 1d upstream downstream flow direction i e simulations without bifurcations see mateo et al 2017 such distributaries are not defined in this scenario flooding was restricted to niger main stem leading to reduced total flooded areas across the whole delta and attenuated hydrograph in diré in turn sensitivity to northern delta parameters was much smaller and showed a considerably different pattern along this area flows are channelized between dunes in the original flow direction map with single downstream connectivity many northern delta channels are connected to lac débo region and thus the simulations without lateral connection led to water storage in these channels through backwater from niger main stem and an overall large flooded area at this region see discussion in next paragraph by implementing lateral connections water was allowed to propagate from the lac débo region towards diré gauge throughout the northern delta channels it then decreased flooding across the region by draining its water downstream 5 discussion 5 1 coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulation the development and application of hydrological models for large scale basins have increased recently with application of both global yamazaki et al 2011 decharme et al 2012 and regional models pedinotti et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 paz et al 2014 andersson et al 2017 efforts for such models to improve processes representation point toward better hydrodynamics representation especially in regions with extensive floodplains paiva et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2017 better vertical hydrological processes representation e g multi layer soils instead of bucket type ones guimberteau et al 2014 and coupling between hydrology and hydrodynamics paz et al 2014 hoch et al 2016 the upper niger river basin provides an interesting example for assessing performance of large scale models given its contrasting regions that are representative of many environment types namely the tropical upstream areas with more bani or less niger regulated rivers the semi arid niger inner delta wetland the river floodplain systems downstream from it and the intermittent red flood tributaries in the niger right bank past models applications described in the literature include simplified water balance approaches sutcliffe and parks 1989 conway and mahé 2009 off line coupling between global rainfall runoff conceptual models and simple dadson et al 2010 pedinotti et al 2012 andersson et al 2017 or 1d hydrodynamic flood routing yamazaki et al 2011 and a 2d regional hydrodynamic model of the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 this study collaborates to this context by presenting a new model application for the basin with an innovative two way coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic approach the model performed well for the upstream tropical areas which present a typical saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and is the kind of environment for which this model has been developed e g amazon river basin paiva et al 2013 and araguaia river basin pontes et al 2017 other models have also succeeded in representing this region e g pedinotti et al 2012 andersson et al 2017 in turn arid regions are much more challenging to model given for instance the important losses that need to be dealt with e g channel transmission losses floodplain infiltration into unsaturated soil in the niger red flood tributaries although good nse values nse 0 5 were achieved globally possible mismodelling exists due to infiltration excess mechanisms which predominantly drives runoff generation in many dryland rivers esteves and lapetite 2003 mamadou et al 2015 and were not represented in mgb model also some issues may arise with the soil bucket model with one only soil layer adopted in the study where the first rainfall events in the flood period meet a very dry soil which takes a long time to fill before generating runoff more modelling efforts should be carried out to address these challenges for example the importance of simulating multi layered soils based for instance on the richards equation is an interesting open question in hydrological modelling research guimberteau et al 2014 downstream of the niger inner delta there are also relevant floodplains that alter the floodwave overall shape floodplain 4 km long with quaternary alluvial deposits andersen et al 2005 the observed hydrograph presents important floodplain attenuation and a negative skewness a typical feature of floodplain regulated rivers fleischmann et al 2016 in this reach significant water loss occurs due to open water evaporation as it is common in semi arid rivers with small local runoff contribution and high evaporation rates however other processes such as channel transmission losses may also occur cassé et al 2016 and a 2d hydrologic hydrodynamic model investigation should be carried out to better understand this dynamics e g following methodology similar to jarihani et al 2015 in contrast to our 1d model approach applied to this reach with the simplified adoption of rectangular cross sections and floodplains with only storage effects the role of floodplains in transmission losses in dryland rivers is also currently being discussed in the literature jarihani et al 2015 manmade infrastructures play an important role in the upper niger basin hydrology and were not included in the current model version indeed not representing water abstraction for irrigation in the office du niger region just upstream from the niger inner delta and reservoir operation especially selingué and talo dams added some uncertainty to simulation results and future model developments may deal with it for instance zwarts et al 2005 stated that office du niger takes between 60 and 100 m3 s depending on the month of the year which may account for 50 60 of flowing water during dry period in turn the lowest nse performance was obtained for bani river douna station nse 0 34 due to flow regulation by talo dam near douna station which started activities in 2005 as shown by atypical volume releases during hydrograph recession in comparison to hydrographs before 2005 nse for 2000 2004 period not shown here was improved up to 0 59 regarding model uncertainty this may be related to input and validation data parameterization and model structure while the latter is addressed in the next section especially in the context of the niger inner delta some aspects of input data and model parameterization should be discussed firstly it is important to note that given the remoteness and lack of in situ data in many of global large basins remote sensing data becomes a fundamental tool in this study they were used as both model input srtm digital elevation model tmpa 3b42 precipitation and validation satellite altimetry and flood extent from modis imagery classification data and proved very useful as showed in other studies neal et al 2012 pedinotti et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 jarihani et al 2015 paris et al 2016 garambois et al 2016 although high uncertainties may be associated to them for example discrepancies between modeled and observed variables certainly occurred due to error in model forcing data long term cru climatology and tmpa 3b42 daily precipitation although in general there was a good agreement between simulated and observed discharges in the model application in niger river basin some years featured particular over and underestimations e g in 2008 most gauges presented very unrealistic discharges previous studies gosset et al 2013 cassé et al 2016 showed good performances of this product in the basin but we did not yet have access to an independent set of rain gauges to check the product over the whole upper basin the scarcity of the operational rain gauge network in the upper niger basin and data access issues makes the monthly gauge adjustment performed by tmpa 3b42 less reliable in some data poor regions on the other hand cru long term monthly average climate data were used for computation of penman monteith equation and may certainly contribute to model uncertainty for instance ogilvie et al 2015 showed that cru potential evapotranspiration values are slightly lower than observed ones along the niger inner delta there is also some uncertainty related to discharge data according to abn who provided the in situ discharge information data collection over the niger especially in the upper part is very good over the last two decades at least 90 of the daily discharges are collected on average in addition the rating curves are regularly updated another important source of uncertainty comes from srtm dem errors which directly affects the accuracy of hydrodynamic model estimates although it is generally accepted as the best current dem available worldwide srtm dem has errors related to speckle noise terrain and vegetation bias and stripes yazamaki et al 2017 it is known that srtm presents se ne stripes in the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 and many other flat areas worldwide yamazaki et al 2017 which are evident in the niger inner delta southern region flood maps fig 8 also srtm 90 m presents elevation errors in africa in the order of 5 m rodriguez et al 2006 although dem upscaling as used in this study srtm 250 m decreases dem errors srtm improvements e g yamazaki et al 2017 and new dems may overcome these issues 5 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes which hydrological processes should we represent in large scale models of semi arid wetlands which model structure should we employ to improve simulations and thus our capability of prediction the results presented in this study collaborate to important issues on large dryland wetlands modelling we show that the processes of floodplain infiltration into unsaturated soil column together with explicit simulation of the floodplain channels and diffuse flow were fundamental for an adequate representation of flooding dynamics i e flood extent and duration peak flow magnitude etc water budget components runoff evapotranspiration and related characteristics flooding extent and temporal variation were affected by the improvement of model structure two way coupling between vertical hydrology and hydrodynamics lateral connections scheme which leads to a 2d flow representation in the delta the necessity of coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes in a two way approach has been pointed by the literature paz et al 2014 hoch et al 2016 where offline couplings may not be enough to represent some basins we showed that soil infiltration from flooded areas is an important process to be modeled leading to higher evapotranspiration rates after the flooding passage in the niger inner delta this is in accordance with a water balance computed by ogilvie et al 2015 for this region while mahé et al 2009 argued that infiltration may be important in the northern niger inner delta region or at least higher than in the southern counterpart where there are sandy soils and sandhills a similar phenomena is also found in the okavango delta botswana where it is generally accepted that large volumes infiltrate into very permeable soils during flooding arrival and lead to groundwater level increase milzow et al 2009 in turn paz et al 2014 showed through simulation experiments that the flooding dynamics e g water depth and flood amplitude of the pantanal wetlands were highly sensitive to the inclusion of evapotranspiration and infiltration processes in the flooded areas with the floodplains less connected to the main channel presenting higher sensitivity our results showing the importance of representing vertical feedbacks between soil and floodplain corroborate these such conclusions are not only important for dryland wetlands but may be applicable for any wetland that receives waters from upstream regions e g the llanos de moxos wetlands in the amazon with exogenous processes as source of flooding in many years bourrel et al 2009 furthermore it indicates that estimating water balance with coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model is better than only hydrologic model in arid wetlands these regions often face seasonal flooding and thus evapotranspiration should not be computed only as open water evaporation as many models do actually during part of the year these regions may be converted into bare soil or agricultural lands and thus evapotranspiration calculation should consider this terrain through a dynamic hydrologic response class hru approach the relevance of a dynamic hru was briefly discussed by paiva et al 2013 who showed for the amazon basin that there were small differences between simulation scenarios with and without a variable hru depending on the flood extent however in dryland areas it seems to be much more important given the large differences between evapotranspiration in a water limited soil and open water evaporation also future studies should address the differences existing between open water evaporation and macrophyte transpiration in wetlands which may consistently differ as showed by sánchez carrillo et al 2004 for a dry wetland in spain an additional process that may be relevant in such arid wetlands is related do deep infiltration to groundwater pedinotti et al 2012 although groundwater recharge is believed to be insignificant along the niger inner delta dadson et al 2010 neal et al 2012 indeed major challenges remain in terms of improving surface groundwater interactions which may play an important role in maintaining flooding in dryland wetlands jolly et al 2008 regional groundwater flows are not represented in mgb model and neither in many other land surface models for instance a satisfactory representation of hydrodynamic processes is also fundamental in large wetlands for example the adoption of lateral connections in this study representing a quasi 2d flow pattern across the niger inner delta ensures connectivity along the floodplains and bifurcations this is in accordance with conclusions by yamazaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2017 and pontes et al 2017 for large scale modelling with bifurcation schemes for floodplains in mekong chao phraya and araguaia river basins respectively if only a dendritic drainage network was represented within the model with only one pre defined upstream downstream direction as presented in many previous large scale hydrological models of niger river basin and other large basins with flat areas the niger main stem flood attenuation and delay would not be satisfactorily simulated without representing diffuse flow across the delta neither water divertion through diaka distributary simplified routing models e g one large reservoir for the whole wetland are not able to represent such processes the inclusion of lateral connections is also expected to improve model prediction in the case of applications with finer resolution since flow capacity in floodplains and river channels can differ considerably across multiple scales when assuming only single downstream connectivities mateo et al 2017 finally backwater effects also need to be taken into account when modelling such flat terrains as noted by paiva et al 2013 in the niger inner delta region based on srtm elevation main stem bed elevation decreased by 10 m in a 510 km long reach 2 cm km during high water periods all unit catchments presented roughly the same simulated water level and thus were directly linked to niger main stem and subjected to backwater flow conditions a sensitivity analysis of the mgb model corroborated other studies of large scale hydrodynamic modelling yamazaki et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 emery et al 2016 where model results water levels discharge and flood extent are highly dependent on adopted channel hydraulic geometry width and bankfull depth values improving bathymetry of floodplain and main stem channels is an important way forward for large scale hydrodynamic models e g by assimilating future swot mission and current altimetry data biancaramaria et al 2016 in very flat areas such as the niger inner delta a variation of just one to few meters in the main stem channel bankfull depth may largely change simulation results by altering river floodplain exchange flows and then hydrograph shape this study provided estimates of water loss across the niger inner delta calculated evapotranspiration between 760 and 1130 mm yr is consistent with mahé et al 2009 who estimated evapotranspiration averaging 800 mm yr in the delta and varying between 400 mm yr in 1984 1985 and 1300 mm yr in 1924 1925 the mgb simulation scenario without infiltration from floodplains yielded much smaller values ranging from 420 mm yr to 720 mm yr simulated water loss values between 20 1 and 31 6 km3 yr were of the same order as those estimated by ogilvie et al 2015 annual evaporation losses between 12 km3 and 21 km3 and mahé et al 2009 annual losses between 11 4 and 29 5 km3 yr this study corroborates other studies that argue that large scale arid wetlands are involved in important land atmosphere feedback processes dadson et al 2010 taylor 2010 in the niger inner delta the wet season precedes niger flood arrival and is important in driving soil saturation and thus alterations in precipitation regime may affect antecedent soil moisture and then flood extent in the region regarding flood extent estimates based on a hydrological balance method mahé et al 2009 suggested a total flooded area of 24 000 km2 for the whole delta while a modis based estimation by ogilvie et al 2015 indicated flooded surfaces to range between 3000 km2 and 20 000 km2 estimates that are considerably higher than ours however one must notice that the definition of the area of interest in each of these studies is also different so that a rigorous comparison of values is not possible finally previous large scale models of the niger and other basins with important floodplain attenuation which considered only one defined upstream downstream direction seemed to overpredict discharges in downstream gauges e g dadson et al 2010 pedinotti et al 2012 dadson et al 2010 argued that it may have occurred due to i water abstraction by humans ii groundwater recharge iii uncertainty in discharge observations iv underestimation of evapotranspiration v uncertainty in precipitation or vi uncertainty in flow paths at 0 5 spatial resolution water abstraction and observed data precipitation discharge climate variables uncertainty may certainly contribute to model errors from our results other processes also need to be simulated in order to achieve a satisfactory representation of large dryland wetlands related to i two way coupling between hydrodynamics and hydrology considering infiltration from flooded areas to ensure water availability for soil evapotranspiration and computation of evapotranspiration in a dynamic hru approach and ii representation of flow hydrodynamics flood wave diffusion backwater floodplain storage bifurcations and distributed flow paths along floodplain channels as well as diffuse flow 6 conclusions basins with large scale semi arid wetlands are complex systems and remain challenging for modelling studies in the present study we addressed an important issue of which hydrological and hydrodynamic processes should be included to improve model predictions to deal with this general issue we evaluated a two way coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling of upper niger river basin which comprises niger inner delta one of the main african wetlands this region is a vast wetland area within the sahel desert and was satisfactorily simulated due to a set of model structures i infiltration from flooded areas to unsaturated soil column which largely altered calculation of evapotranspiration and water loss ii computation of evapotranspiration and open water evaporation in a dynamic hydrological response unit approach iii representation of hydrodynamics in the wetland with an explicit simulation of floodplain channels and lateral connections between unit catchments representing diffuse flows and bifurcations in conclusion the present study provides new insights on the way forward for large scale modelling of basins with dryland wetlands worldwide and could be used to improve regional to global scale hydrologic hydraulic models the main outcomes can be summarized as follow a two way coupling approach between hydrology and hydrodynamics had relevant effects on model estimates of a large semi arid wetland through infiltration of floodplains into soil and computation of both open water evaporation and soil evapotranspiration throughout the year it is important to model hydrodynamic processes such as floodplain storage floodplain channels and flow bifurcation to address a satisfactory two way coupling the model was well validated with remote sensing data flood extent and satellite altimetry after calibration with observed discharge in the niger inner delta the model application highlighted contrasting behaviors between southern and northern delta regions with a more diffuse flow in the former and channelized floodplain channels throughout dunes in the latter evapotranspiration estimates in the niger inner delta varied between scenarios with 760 mm yr to 1130 mm yr and without infiltration from floodplains 420 mm yr to 720 mm

7317,hydrological and hydrodynamic models are core tools for simulation of large basins and complex river systems associated to wetlands recent studies have pointed towards the importance of online coupling strategies representing feedbacks between floodplain inundation and vertical hydrology especially across semi arid regions soil floodplain interactions can be strong in this study we included a two way coupling scheme in a large scale hydrological hydrodynamic model mgb and tested different model structures in order to assess which processes are important to be simulated in large semi arid wetlands and how these processes interact with water budget components to demonstrate benefits from this coupling over a validation case the model was applied to the upper niger river basin encompassing the niger inner delta a vast semi arid wetland in the sahel desert simulation was carried out from 1999 to 2014 with daily tmpa 3b42 precipitation as forcing using both in situ and remotely sensed data for calibration and validation model outputs were in good agreement with discharge and water levels at stations both upstream and downstream of the inner delta nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 6 for most gauges as well as for flooded areas within the delta region nse 0 6 r 0 85 model estimates of annual water losses across the delta varied between 20 1 and 30 6 km3 yr while annual evapotranspiration ranged between 760 mm yr and 1130 mm yr evaluation of model structure indicated that representation of both floodplain channels hydrodynamics storage bifurcations lateral connections and vertical hydrological processes floodplain water infiltration into soil column evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water are necessary to correctly simulate flood wave attenuation and evapotranspiration along the basin two way coupled models are necessary to better understand processes in large semi arid wetlands finally such coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling proves to be an important tool for integrated evaluation of hydrological processes in such poorly gauged large scale basins we hope that this model application provides new

site for this work its highly contrasted environments ranging from tropical to semi arid sub basins and the existence of a large semi arid wetland niger inner delta which presents particular interactions between hydrological and floodplain hydrodynamic processes provide an interesting case for evaluation of a two way coupled model as proposed in this study the niger river basin is located in western africa and includes nine countries benin burkina faso cameroon chad côte d ivoire guinea mali niger and nigeria where about 100 million people live andersen et al 2005 fig 1 the river has around 4200 km from its headwaters in the guinean highlands until its mouth in the gulf of guinea in nigeria being the third longest in africa and its hydrologically active basin area is around 1 5 million km2 in this study the upper niger river basin is defined as the drained area of the niger river upstream niamey city this consists in an area of about 657 000 km2 which contains regions that contributes hydrologically to the river and some endorheic areas where the water pathways do not lead to the niger river along its course the river receives most of its water from the tropical guinean

model collischonn et al 2007 pontes et al 2017 modelo de grandes bacias or large basins model is a semi distributed rainfall runoff model developed for simulation of large basins fig 3 in its most recent version river maps are extracted from high resolution dems using a vector based approach and the basin is divided into unit catchments fig 1c each one containing a single river reach with associated floodplain and hydrological vertical water and energy balance within each unit catchment hydrological response units hru s are defined based on soil type and land use fig 1d and for each one the water and energy budget is computed through the soil vegetation system surface subsurface and groundwater outflows from water balance are routed to the main river of the unit catchment using linear reservoirs while flow propagation through drainage networks is computed using the muskingum cunge method or 1d hydrodynamic equations additionally sub basins are defined as macro regions unifying many unit catchments with the same model parameter values fig 1b main model parameters are related to soil water budget for each hru maximum soil water storage wm based on arno rainfall runoff model todini 1996 two equivalent hydraulic conductivities kbas and kint parameter from the variable contributing area model for runoff generation b and three parameters related to surface subsurface and base flow residence time cs ci and cb supplementary material a1 presents model calibrated parameters for the upper niger river basin and a detailed explanation of model parameters is provided by collischonn et al 2007 additionally the hydrodynamic module requires width bankfull depth and bed elevation for each river reach one per unit catchment as well as manning n roughness coefficient and floodplain topography see description in section 3 1 3 model forcing data are precipitation and surface meteorological data for energy budget and evapotranspiration computation wind speed solar radiation relative humidity air pressure and air temperature for each unit catchment observed precipitation is interpolated to the respective centroid using an inverse square distance method while meteorological data values are attributed by nearest neighbor interpolation details on datasets used in the niger model application are presented in section 3 1 3 evapotranspiration is calculated with penman monteith equation following methodology by wigmosta et al 1994 where evaporative demand is first available for evaporation of vegetation interception water and the remaining demand is used for soil evapotranspiration or open water evaporation from flooded areas limited plant evapotranspiration due to soil water deficit is considered by increasing surface resistance under water stress situation collischonn et al 2007 the most recent flood wave routing available method which was used in this study is based on the 1d inertial formulation developed by bates et al 2010 it is a simplification of saint venant s equation by neglecting the local acceleration term and has been recently applied with success in many large scale models including the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 and other areas across the globe férnandez et al 2016 pontes et al 2017 time step is governed by courant freidrichs levy condition bates et al 2010 in mgb model each unit catchment has one river reach with rectangular cross section with pre defined width bankfull depth and manning s n coefficient for each unit catchment a stage area volume relationship is derived from dem using the hand model rennó et al 2008 and following the approach described in yamazaki et al 2013 which is used for estimation of sub grid floodplain topography paiva et al 2011 pontes et al 2017 also bankfull level is automatically derived from the dem as the average elevation pixels along channel pixels for each unit catchment then the bankfull depth a model parameter as defined in the section 3 1 3 is discounted from it to yield the unit catchment channel bed elevation at each time step discharge is calculated between upstream downstream adjacent unit catchments or between neighbor unit catchments with pre defined lateral connection see next section 3 1 3 for description of lateral connections and then those calculated flows are computed in the unit catchment water storage together with evaporation and precipitation over flooded areas and generated streamflow the stage volume relationship is used to convert the unit catchment updated volume into water level yamazaki et al 2011 while the stage area relationship is used to estimate the flooded area within the unit catchment which is then used to calculate open water evaporation 3 1 2 two way coupling scheme in this work we included and evaluated new processes in the mgb model which we refer to as a two way coupling scheme between hydrological and hydrodynamic modules firstly infiltration from flooded areas into unsaturated soil column was implemented this process may be important in regions where flooding occurs from exogenous sources into areas where soils are relatively dry before flood arrival e g niger main stem channel flooding the inner delta secondly the model was allowed to dynamically represent the changes in evapotranspiration and open water evaporation due to variations in land cover during flooding i e differing bare soil vegetation from flooded areas for each unit catchment at each time interval infiltration from floodplain into soil column is computed based on the degree of soil saturation and unit catchment flooding area assuming that infiltration rate is linearly dependent on soil water deficit 1 dinf a fl a kinf 1 w w m where a fl km2 is the flooded area at a given unit catchment a the unit catchment area km2 kinf the infiltration rate that occurs when the whole unit catchment is flooded and soil is totally dry mm day 1 w w m the soil saturation degree kinf has been calibrated together with other vertical hydrological balance parameters see supplementary material a1 for the calibrated parameters and model sensitivity to it is discussed in section 3 4 then the calculated infiltration volume is removed from the unit catchment s flood control volume hydrodynamic module and inserted into unit catchment s soil water storage hydrological module regarding the dynamic evapotranspiration at each time step the flooded fraction of the unit catchment is computed and open water evaporation is calculated for this area while the remaining area is used for soil plant evapotranspiration furthermore it was observed that unrealistic high evaporated volumes from the channel occurred during low flow periods leading to almost dry channels because the assumption of a rectangular cross section led to large widths and thus large channel surface area during low flows then a modification was applied for the open water evaporation computation when water level is below bankfull depth for the computation of open water evaporation only channel surface area was considered zero when river channel was dry ephemeral rivers and increased linearly until bankfull depth where flooded area equaled the channel surface area channel width times length 3 1 3 niger river basin model setup in order to correctly represent the dense network drainage in the niger inner delta we diminished the minimum number of cells required to define the beginning of a river channel from 800 cells default value each cell is 250 250 m to 250 cells in the inner delta the result was a much denser drainage within the inner delta figs 1a and 2 in order to represent channel bifurcation and diffuse flows along niger inner delta floodplain lateral connections rectangular channels with pre defined width and depth values were set between all neighbor unit catchments along the inner delta region including main distributaries diaka river in southern delta and issa ber bara issa and kolikoli branches at the entrance of northern delta given the high density of unit catchments defined throughout the inner delta this approach leads to an unstructured 2d model i e a pseudo 2d in this region this approach was applied by pontes et al 2017 to simulate flooding in the bananal island floodplain central brazil and is similar to the flow bifurcation scheme proposed by yamazaki et al 2014 considering the unit catchment area as a circle the length of the connection channel is computed as the sum of the radiuses of two adjacent unit catchments l a 1 π a 2 π where l is the channel length km and a1 and a2 are the values for the area of the unit catchments connected by the channel km2 the model was run from 1999 to 2014 using tmpa 3b42 v7 daily precipitation product available at https pmm nasa gov data access downloads trmm huffman et al 2007 as forcing data with 0 25 spatial resolution together with cru 10 long term climatology data monthly climate normals of wind speed solar radiation relative humidity air pressure and air temperature were used new et al 2002 for computation of model evapotranspiration the first year was removed from analysis due to model initial conditions downstream boundary condition at niamey is set as a constant water level slope of 10 cm km which was derived from average values of srtm dem elevation along downstream reaches extraction of drainage networks and sub grid floodplain topography was carried out using the cgiar void filled srtm 250 m digital elevation model available at http srtm csi cgiar org and iph hydrotools package siqueira et al 2016 the basin was discretized into 4307 unit catchments average area 153 km2 standard deviation 182 km2 of equal reach length fig 1c set here to 10 km land use and soil type maps were obtained from ecoclimap masson et al 2003 and their combination led to the definition of 11 hydrological response units fig 1d regarding hydrodynamic module parameters manning s n coefficient was globally set as 0 03 for simplification which is a commonly adopted value in large scale models channel width was obtained from a simple manual extraction of landsat 8 imagery for the niger main stem 800 m wide for the first 750 km 500 m for the following 250 km 700 m along 100 km 600 m along 300 km and 500 m for the last 800 km see fig a1 supplementary material a for the other reaches the following simple geomorphic relationship was used w 0 95 a 0 5 where w is width m and a is the reach upstream drainage area km2 this relationship adjusted well to in situ surveyed cross sections bankfull depth was calibrated against observed discharge for the niger main stem reaches and maintaining coherence with a few surveyed cross sections available from autorité du bassin du niger abn fig a1 bankfull depth was subtracted from channel bankfull elevation computed as average pixels along river reach along a given unit catchment to yield channel bed elevation the following geomorphic relationship was used for the remaining river reaches d 0 15 a 0 25 where d is bankfull depth m it was consistent with surveyed cross sections specific parameterization is justified for the niger main stem since width and depth values do not follow a simple relationship with drainage area in this river fig a1 supplementary material present the final values of width and bankfull depth for river reaches within inner delta the following parameters were adopted width of 30 m and 200 m and bankfull depth of 0 5 m and 1 m for all reaches within southern and northern inner delta regions respectively these values were adopted since the drainage in the region does not follow a dendritic pattern with only one upstream downstream direction and a defined upstream drainage area as given by one direction flow direction maps width values were consistent with landsat 8 imagery while depth ones were adopted for simplicity for each lateral connection channel width was assumed with the same values as adjacent delta river reaches defined as 200 and 30 m for southern and northern areas and bankfull elevation was assumed with the same elevation as the respective connected unit catchments finally specific parameters were manually extracted from landsat 8 for main distributaries that exist along the inner delta diaka river a distributary at the entrance of southern delta that drains a significant part of main stem discharge and three main distributaries that exist downstream of lac débo region at the beginning of northern inner delta issa ber bara issa and kolikoli branches olivry 1993 3 1 4 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated against observed discharge and validated with flood extent and water level for the same 2000 2014 simulation period following the methodology used by paiva et al 2013 the model was manually calibrated with observed daily discharge provided by the niger basin authority abn http www abn ne for the 2000 2014 simulation period disregarding first year spin up period for computation of performance metrics gauges used for calibration are listed in table 2 of results section see fig 1a for their location calibrated parameters related to hydrological vertical balance are presented in supplementary material a1 while niger main stem calibrated depth is presented in fig a1 additionally a sensitivity analysis of model key parameters is performed in section 4 1 4 the model was validated against satellite altimetry and satellite derived flood extent daily water surface elevations wse at seven locations were interpolated from wse series gained by processing the data provided by the jason 2 envisat and saral satellite altimetry missions where the satellite orbits cross the drainage network namely at so called virtual stations vs seven vss fig 1a were used located 1 upstream the inner delta vs1 2 within the inner delta vs4 3 immediately downstream the inner delta vs2 and vs7 and 4 in the vicinity of ansongo vs3 vs5 and vs6 these vss should provide a variety of locations to assess model performance in terms of water levels estimates the analysis was performed for water level anomalies by subtracting daily water levels by the long term water level average the altimetry data were processed manually following the method by santos da silva et al 2010 2012 and using ranges outcoming of the ice 1 retracker which has been shown to provide robust estimates of the water surface elevation in the context of river reaches frappart et al 2006 estimation of the flooded surfaces was obtained from bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 which study was based on classification of modis imagery the product uses 8 day modis data for the period 2000 2013 to yield a 500 m spatial resolution estimation of flooded areas along the niger inner delta and threshold values for classification of pixels are based on normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and modis band 5 1230 1250 nm values this part of the spectra of the modis band 5 has the capacity to detect very shallow water and water with high concentration of sediments as it is often the case in floodplain in arid regions bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 a total of five classes are provided for the region open water mix water dry land aquatic vegetation vegetation and dry land model performance was evaluated with the following metrics for daily discharges nash sutcliffe nse nash sutcliffe of variable logarithm nse log which enhances errors in low flows delay index di time delay that leads to best pearson correlation between modeled and observed series paiva et al 2013 volume error dv long term model bias and visual inspection water level was evaluated with nse and di and flooded areas were evaluated with nse and pearson correlation metrics 3 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes we assessed the niger inner delta flood patterns and the impact of different model structures on its dynamics through a series of simulation scenarios firstly fluxes over the delta were computed monthly and annual et and precipitation and compared to values from the literature water losses through et were compared in terms of soil vegetation and open water evaporation terms then flood extent maps across the region were evaluated for different periods of the year and through a set of simulation scenarios to evaluate the seasonality patterns and the importance of bifurcations and floodplain channels in the flood dynamics five scenarios were considered a no lateral connections across the whole basin b no lateral connection in southern delta c no lateral connection in northern delta d lateral connection only for diaka river distributary and e default simulation i e with lateral connections for the whole delta region finally a sensitivity analysis section 4 2 1 was carried out to understand the impacts of different key parameters on the delta hydrodynamics the tested parameters were kinf infiltration from floodplain into soil column kinf 0 10 20 30 and 40 mm day lateral connection width for northern and southern delta regions 50 100 500 variation and channel width and depth 20 50 variation results are evaluated for climatology of evapotranspiration et discharge q and flooded areas fa 4 results 4 1 coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulation 4 1 1 calibration with discharge observations mgb was calibrated with in situ observed discharge and calibrated hydrographs are presented in fig 4 table 1 shows performance metrics nse nselog di and dv globally model presents a good performance both upstream and downstream the inner delta region with nse 0 6 for most gauges gauges upstream of the inner delta faranah mandiana banankoro and koulikoro presented nse values between 0 64 and 0 74 while baseflow reflected by nselog were also well simulated some discrepancies occurred however between simulated years in 2008 for instance the rainfall amount from tmpa 3b42 is very high and leads to discharge overestimation in addition as shown by diré gauge station nse 0 81 nselog 0 72 the model also performed well along and downstream of niger inner delta where floodplain effects and hydrological processes within arid regions play an important role a delay index di of 8 days is also satisfactory given the months of delay that the flood wave is subjected to along the delta however in almost all years an overestimation of recession limb can be observed this volume surplus is also observed in downstream gauges e g ansongo and niamey finally it is interesting to note that years with poorest model performance downstream the delta were also the poorest simulated in koulikoro gauge station upstream the delta and the niger confluence with bani river the low model performance in bani basin douna station due to reservoir flow regulation did not seem to affect significantly the calculated hydrograph at diré in the niger right bank downstream of ansongo the red flood tributaries alcongui kakassi and garbey stations presented low nse and nse log performance in comparison to other gauges 4 1 2 validation with satellite altimetry time series of water level anomalies water level subtracted by long term average from the mgb model coincident to virtual stations vs1 7 fig 1a are presented in fig 5 and performance metrics in table 2 the mgb model was also validated with observed in situ water level what is presented in supplementary material b not included here for brevity first mgb model wlas were in agreement with satellite altimetry ones for all vss the shape is preserved and the peak time is mostly respected at most of vss absolute variation i e the difference between maximum and minimum anomaly was similar for both model and satellite estimates at vs2 fig 5b the model tended to overestimate the water level variation principally in high waters at vs4 and vs5 the amplitude was respected but the lower value e g the anomaly at low waters was underestimated the specific case of the 2008 2009 hydrologic year should be highlighted for this period the model presented a high wla that was not observed in the wla time series from satellite altimetry this point was neither observed on in situ discharge time series nor on in situ wla time series supplementary material b and seems to evidence a possible issue in the precipitation rate for this year the performance indicators table 2 corroborate these conclusions nse efficiency coefficient is usually above 0 5 and below it only for vs2 and vs4 for vs2 outliers at high stages are expected to impact negatively nse while for vs4 there seems to be a bias between estimated and observed by satellite altimetry wla rmse values present similar behavior with values below 0 9 m for vs1 vs3 vs5 vs6 and vs7 some discrepancies could have been avoided by filtering altimetry wse time series which clearly contain outliers these outliers could have been removed but we chose to keep the raw time series without any post processing based on model estimated time series shape also as the means used to convert the absolute elevations into anomalies were calculated over distinct periods the nominal period for each kind of data e g 1999 2014 for the model 2008 2014 for jason 2 and 2002 2010 and 2013 2014 for envisat and saral and as the time sampling is not the same neither it is expected that anomalies do not completely agree in terms of absolute value despite these limitations the model performed very well regarding to estimating wla 4 1 3 validation of flooded areas in niger inner delta simulated and observed time series of flooded areas are presented in fig 6 a while monthly climatology of these areas is shown in fig 6b fig 6c shows calculated flooded areas separately for northern and southern delta regions in general there was a good agreement between simulated and observed flooded areas modis classified product from bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 with nse 0 60 and r 0 85 maximum simulated flooded area was 11 000 km2 excluding anomalous 2008 2009 year for the whole delta region while maximum observed with modis was 12 000 km2 peaks were slightly higher for most years in remotely sensed observations and a pronounced overestimation of flooded area recession occurred as shown by monthly climatology southern and northern delta regions showed different flooding dynamics while the former had the largest flooded area 8000 km2 and typically peaks at late october the latter had peak flooded areas 3000 km2 occurring in late december 4 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes in this section we evaluate the impact of model structure and process representativeness on the niger inner delta hydrology by exploring the role of vertical hydrology infiltration rainfall hydrodynamics lateral connections distributaries flow bifurcation and the coupling between them infiltration open water evaporation on the inner delta hydrological response we also perform a sensitivity analysis of main model parameters related to the inner delta fig 7 presents model results of monthly and annual evapotranspiration with and without infiltration from floodplains into unsaturated soil together with tmpa precipitation data et was always larger than p along the delta due to open water evaporation that came from upstream catchments but the inclusion of floodplain infiltration largely increased it annual p varied between 250 mm yr and 600 mm yr while et without infiltration ranged from 420 mm yr to 720 mm yr and et with infiltration from 760 mm yr to 1130 mm yr table 3 presents water losses in southern and northern delta regions in terms of total et soil et and flooded areas open water evaporation total et had an annual maximum of 31 6 km3 yr and a monthly maximum of 10 km3 month northern and southern regions had a similar seasonal cycle monthly et flood peaked in november for both while et soil showed two peaks the first occurring in october due to local rainfall and the second one in january due to soil infiltration from floodplains losses through et soil were higher than et flood maximum et soil calculated values were 0 9 and 1 9 km3 yr for northern and southern regions respectively and et flood values were 0 5 and 1 8 km3 yr also northern region had always lower evapotranspiration losses than southern although observed data indicate that the opposite situation tends to occur mahé et al 2009 this may be explained by the cru long term monthly mean climate data used here local rainfall in the delta has little impact on niger main stem discharge but is important for evapotranspiration estimation and thus for land atmosphere modelling mgb simulations considering zero rainfall in the delta not presented here led to very small changes in diré calculated hydrograph and delta flooded areas but decreased annual total et in the delta from 912 114 mm yr mean sd to 612 114 mm yr regarding flood dynamics in the inner delta fig 8 shows maps of simulated flood water depth for 1st jun 2001 low flow 1st sep 2001 mid rising 20th oct 2001 flooded areas peak 1st jan 2002 mid falling limb and the maximum flood for southern and northern delta regions it can be seen how both areas differ in terms of flooding processes while the southern delta presents a more diffuse flooding pattern the northern delta has flooding mainly along floodplain channels that meander through erg of nianfunké dunes a set of stationary sand dunes running from west to east davies 1996 the seasonal flooding cycle is also evident fig 8b with low stage in june basically channel surfaces yielding flooded areas and peak floods in late october late december for southern northern delta by early january most southern delta flooding areas have already been drained also flooding in northern delta lasts longer than in south fig 8c presenting a higher residence time as noted by remote sensing studies ogilvie et al 2015 bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 fig 9 shows flooding maps for five different simulation scenarios a no lateral connections across the whole basin b no lateral connection in southern delta c no lateral connection in northern delta d lateral connection only for diaka river distributary and e default simulation the results contribute to the sensitivity analysis of the next section by showing spatial patterns of flooding across the delta simulation without lateral connections scenario a increased flooding along the niger main stem and in lower bani river possibly due to main stem backwater lateral connection also ensured important bifurcation that exists in the southern delta entrance diaka river see fig 2 bottom right figure although its only representation scenario d was not enough to flood the whole southern delta area diaka river diverted around 15 of main stem flow long term simulation average annual peaks in diaka varied between 5 and 25 of main stem peak in simulations this value is however sensitive to the hydraulic geometry assumed along the diaka river in turn in the northern delta a smaller sensitivity to lateral connections was observed although their implementation default simulation was important to flood the eastern part of the region as shown in the section of validation of flooded areas the modis product bergé nguyen and crétaux 2015 agreed well with model simulated flood extent fig 9f presents the maximum estimated flooding across the inner delta from satellite data a comparison between et q and fa is also presented for the same five scenarios 4 2 1 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the impact of parameter estimation on the model results as well as to explore the niger inner delta functioning fig 10 sensitivity analysis of mgb hydrological vertical balance was performed by collischonn 2001 and paiva et al 2013 while sensitivity of the hydrodynamic routing model was evaluated by paiva et al 2013 for an amazon basin mgb application and by yamazaki et al 2011 for a global application of cama flood model in this study we focus on the model sensitivity in the niger inner delta region given its complex hydrodynamics and the formulation implemented for floodplain simulation in arid wetlands including infiltration from floodplains and lateral connections between neighbor unit catchments evaluated parameters are kinf infiltration from floodplain into soil column kinf 0 10 20 30 and 40 mm day lateral connection width for northern and southern delta regions 50 100 500 variation and channel width and depth 20 50 variation sensitivity results are evaluated for climatology of evapotranspiration et discharge q and flooded areas fa default simulation values as presented in model input data and parameterization section are infiltration kinf 20 mm day northern delta connection width ndeltawidth 200 m southern delta connection width sdeltawidth 30 m channel width and depth values are presented in fig a1 model discharge and flooded areas were more sensitive to channel width followed by channel bankfull depth values which drive similarly calculated et q and fa smaller values of these parameters lead to more water stored on floodplains and thus more attenuation in the hydrograph more water evaporated in the niger inner delta and larger flooded a 50 channel width decrease led to a 25 reduction in peak discharge in diré due to increased floodplain attenuation infiltration parameter kinf largely influenced evapotranspiration water transferred from floodplain into unsaturated soil became available for soil evapotranspiration systematically increasing et rates in contrast considering no infiltration into unsaturated soil kinf 0 led to a distinct behavior in q than did changes in channel width and depth evaporation of soil infiltrated water occurred after the rainfall period since during it soil saturation was relatively high and thus neglecting infiltration processes led to an overestimation of hydrograph recession from peak discharge to low water stage period also there was an upper limit for model sensitivity on this parameter since at very high infiltration rates soil became saturated and thus no more infiltration occurred a change on the widths of lateral connections led to different behaviors of q and fa between northern and southern delta regions high uncertainty is related to this parameter given its conceptual nature and thus a wide range of parameter variation was performed from 100 to 500 generally the model presented higher sensitivity in southern delta than in the northern one while a comparison between scenarios 100 no lateral connection and 500 in the southern area showed a peak discharge alteration of 500 m3 s in the northern one a change of less than 200 m3 s was observed in the southern part smaller connections led to smaller flooded areas across the region and higher flooding along the niger mainstem without connections diaka river distributary could not be represented since in the single downstream connectivity defined by a 1d upstream downstream flow direction i e simulations without bifurcations see mateo et al 2017 such distributaries are not defined in this scenario flooding was restricted to niger main stem leading to reduced total flooded areas across the whole delta and attenuated hydrograph in diré in turn sensitivity to northern delta parameters was much smaller and showed a considerably different pattern along this area flows are channelized between dunes in the original flow direction map with single downstream connectivity many northern delta channels are connected to lac débo region and thus the simulations without lateral connection led to water storage in these channels through backwater from niger main stem and an overall large flooded area at this region see discussion in next paragraph by implementing lateral connections water was allowed to propagate from the lac débo region towards diré gauge throughout the northern delta channels it then decreased flooding across the region by draining its water downstream 5 discussion 5 1 coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic simulation the development and application of hydrological models for large scale basins have increased recently with application of both global yamazaki et al 2011 decharme et al 2012 and regional models pedinotti et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 paz et al 2014 andersson et al 2017 efforts for such models to improve processes representation point toward better hydrodynamics representation especially in regions with extensive floodplains paiva et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2017 better vertical hydrological processes representation e g multi layer soils instead of bucket type ones guimberteau et al 2014 and coupling between hydrology and hydrodynamics paz et al 2014 hoch et al 2016 the upper niger river basin provides an interesting example for assessing performance of large scale models given its contrasting regions that are representative of many environment types namely the tropical upstream areas with more bani or less niger regulated rivers the semi arid niger inner delta wetland the river floodplain systems downstream from it and the intermittent red flood tributaries in the niger right bank past models applications described in the literature include simplified water balance approaches sutcliffe and parks 1989 conway and mahé 2009 off line coupling between global rainfall runoff conceptual models and simple dadson et al 2010 pedinotti et al 2012 andersson et al 2017 or 1d hydrodynamic flood routing yamazaki et al 2011 and a 2d regional hydrodynamic model of the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 this study collaborates to this context by presenting a new model application for the basin with an innovative two way coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic approach the model performed well for the upstream tropical areas which present a typical saturation excess runoff generation mechanism and is the kind of environment for which this model has been developed e g amazon river basin paiva et al 2013 and araguaia river basin pontes et al 2017 other models have also succeeded in representing this region e g pedinotti et al 2012 andersson et al 2017 in turn arid regions are much more challenging to model given for instance the important losses that need to be dealt with e g channel transmission losses floodplain infiltration into unsaturated soil in the niger red flood tributaries although good nse values nse 0 5 were achieved globally possible mismodelling exists due to infiltration excess mechanisms which predominantly drives runoff generation in many dryland rivers esteves and lapetite 2003 mamadou et al 2015 and were not represented in mgb model also some issues may arise with the soil bucket model with one only soil layer adopted in the study where the first rainfall events in the flood period meet a very dry soil which takes a long time to fill before generating runoff more modelling efforts should be carried out to address these challenges for example the importance of simulating multi layered soils based for instance on the richards equation is an interesting open question in hydrological modelling research guimberteau et al 2014 downstream of the niger inner delta there are also relevant floodplains that alter the floodwave overall shape floodplain 4 km long with quaternary alluvial deposits andersen et al 2005 the observed hydrograph presents important floodplain attenuation and a negative skewness a typical feature of floodplain regulated rivers fleischmann et al 2016 in this reach significant water loss occurs due to open water evaporation as it is common in semi arid rivers with small local runoff contribution and high evaporation rates however other processes such as channel transmission losses may also occur cassé et al 2016 and a 2d hydrologic hydrodynamic model investigation should be carried out to better understand this dynamics e g following methodology similar to jarihani et al 2015 in contrast to our 1d model approach applied to this reach with the simplified adoption of rectangular cross sections and floodplains with only storage effects the role of floodplains in transmission losses in dryland rivers is also currently being discussed in the literature jarihani et al 2015 manmade infrastructures play an important role in the upper niger basin hydrology and were not included in the current model version indeed not representing water abstraction for irrigation in the office du niger region just upstream from the niger inner delta and reservoir operation especially selingué and talo dams added some uncertainty to simulation results and future model developments may deal with it for instance zwarts et al 2005 stated that office du niger takes between 60 and 100 m3 s depending on the month of the year which may account for 50 60 of flowing water during dry period in turn the lowest nse performance was obtained for bani river douna station nse 0 34 due to flow regulation by talo dam near douna station which started activities in 2005 as shown by atypical volume releases during hydrograph recession in comparison to hydrographs before 2005 nse for 2000 2004 period not shown here was improved up to 0 59 regarding model uncertainty this may be related to input and validation data parameterization and model structure while the latter is addressed in the next section especially in the context of the niger inner delta some aspects of input data and model parameterization should be discussed firstly it is important to note that given the remoteness and lack of in situ data in many of global large basins remote sensing data becomes a fundamental tool in this study they were used as both model input srtm digital elevation model tmpa 3b42 precipitation and validation satellite altimetry and flood extent from modis imagery classification data and proved very useful as showed in other studies neal et al 2012 pedinotti et al 2012 paiva et al 2013 jarihani et al 2015 paris et al 2016 garambois et al 2016 although high uncertainties may be associated to them for example discrepancies between modeled and observed variables certainly occurred due to error in model forcing data long term cru climatology and tmpa 3b42 daily precipitation although in general there was a good agreement between simulated and observed discharges in the model application in niger river basin some years featured particular over and underestimations e g in 2008 most gauges presented very unrealistic discharges previous studies gosset et al 2013 cassé et al 2016 showed good performances of this product in the basin but we did not yet have access to an independent set of rain gauges to check the product over the whole upper basin the scarcity of the operational rain gauge network in the upper niger basin and data access issues makes the monthly gauge adjustment performed by tmpa 3b42 less reliable in some data poor regions on the other hand cru long term monthly average climate data were used for computation of penman monteith equation and may certainly contribute to model uncertainty for instance ogilvie et al 2015 showed that cru potential evapotranspiration values are slightly lower than observed ones along the niger inner delta there is also some uncertainty related to discharge data according to abn who provided the in situ discharge information data collection over the niger especially in the upper part is very good over the last two decades at least 90 of the daily discharges are collected on average in addition the rating curves are regularly updated another important source of uncertainty comes from srtm dem errors which directly affects the accuracy of hydrodynamic model estimates although it is generally accepted as the best current dem available worldwide srtm dem has errors related to speckle noise terrain and vegetation bias and stripes yazamaki et al 2017 it is known that srtm presents se ne stripes in the niger inner delta neal et al 2012 and many other flat areas worldwide yamazaki et al 2017 which are evident in the niger inner delta southern region flood maps fig 8 also srtm 90 m presents elevation errors in africa in the order of 5 m rodriguez et al 2006 although dem upscaling as used in this study srtm 250 m decreases dem errors srtm improvements e g yamazaki et al 2017 and new dems may overcome these issues 5 2 assessment of wetland floodplain dynamics and hydrological processes which hydrological processes should we represent in large scale models of semi arid wetlands which model structure should we employ to improve simulations and thus our capability of prediction the results presented in this study collaborate to important issues on large dryland wetlands modelling we show that the processes of floodplain infiltration into unsaturated soil column together with explicit simulation of the floodplain channels and diffuse flow were fundamental for an adequate representation of flooding dynamics i e flood extent and duration peak flow magnitude etc water budget components runoff evapotranspiration and related characteristics flooding extent and temporal variation were affected by the improvement of model structure two way coupling between vertical hydrology and hydrodynamics lateral connections scheme which leads to a 2d flow representation in the delta the necessity of coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes in a two way approach has been pointed by the literature paz et al 2014 hoch et al 2016 where offline couplings may not be enough to represent some basins we showed that soil infiltration from flooded areas is an important process to be modeled leading to higher evapotranspiration rates after the flooding passage in the niger inner delta this is in accordance with a water balance computed by ogilvie et al 2015 for this region while mahé et al 2009 argued that infiltration may be important in the northern niger inner delta region or at least higher than in the southern counterpart where there are sandy soils and sandhills a similar phenomena is also found in the okavango delta botswana where it is generally accepted that large volumes infiltrate into very permeable soils during flooding arrival and lead to groundwater level increase milzow et al 2009 in turn paz et al 2014 showed through simulation experiments that the flooding dynamics e g water depth and flood amplitude of the pantanal wetlands were highly sensitive to the inclusion of evapotranspiration and infiltration processes in the flooded areas with the floodplains less connected to the main channel presenting higher sensitivity our results showing the importance of representing vertical feedbacks between soil and floodplain corroborate these such conclusions are not only important for dryland wetlands but may be applicable for any wetland that receives waters from upstream regions e g the llanos de moxos wetlands in the amazon with exogenous processes as source of flooding in many years bourrel et al 2009 furthermore it indicates that estimating water balance with coupled hydrologic hydrodynamic model is better than only hydrologic model in arid wetlands these regions often face seasonal flooding and thus evapotranspiration should not be computed only as open water evaporation as many models do actually during part of the year these regions may be converted into bare soil or agricultural lands and thus evapotranspiration calculation should consider this terrain through a dynamic hydrologic response class hru approach the relevance of a dynamic hru was briefly discussed by paiva et al 2013 who showed for the amazon basin that there were small differences between simulation scenarios with and without a variable hru depending on the flood extent however in dryland areas it seems to be much more important given the large differences between evapotranspiration in a water limited soil and open water evaporation also future studies should address the differences existing between open water evaporation and macrophyte transpiration in wetlands which may consistently differ as showed by sánchez carrillo et al 2004 for a dry wetland in spain an additional process that may be relevant in such arid wetlands is related do deep infiltration to groundwater pedinotti et al 2012 although groundwater recharge is believed to be insignificant along the niger inner delta dadson et al 2010 neal et al 2012 indeed major challenges remain in terms of improving surface groundwater interactions which may play an important role in maintaining flooding in dryland wetlands jolly et al 2008 regional groundwater flows are not represented in mgb model and neither in many other land surface models for instance a satisfactory representation of hydrodynamic processes is also fundamental in large wetlands for example the adoption of lateral connections in this study representing a quasi 2d flow pattern across the niger inner delta ensures connectivity along the floodplains and bifurcations this is in accordance with conclusions by yamazaki et al 2014 mateo et al 2017 and pontes et al 2017 for large scale modelling with bifurcation schemes for floodplains in mekong chao phraya and araguaia river basins respectively if only a dendritic drainage network was represented within the model with only one pre defined upstream downstream direction as presented in many previous large scale hydrological models of niger river basin and other large basins with flat areas the niger main stem flood attenuation and delay would not be satisfactorily simulated without representing diffuse flow across the delta neither water divertion through diaka distributary simplified routing models e g one large reservoir for the whole wetland are not able to represent such processes the inclusion of lateral connections is also expected to improve model prediction in the case of applications with finer resolution since flow capacity in floodplains and river channels can differ considerably across multiple scales when assuming only single downstream connectivities mateo et al 2017 finally backwater effects also need to be taken into account when modelling such flat terrains as noted by paiva et al 2013 in the niger inner delta region based on srtm elevation main stem bed elevation decreased by 10 m in a 510 km long reach 2 cm km during high water periods all unit catchments presented roughly the same simulated water level and thus were directly linked to niger main stem and subjected to backwater flow conditions a sensitivity analysis of the mgb model corroborated other studies of large scale hydrodynamic modelling yamazaki et al 2011 paiva et al 2013 emery et al 2016 where model results water levels discharge and flood extent are highly dependent on adopted channel hydraulic geometry width and bankfull depth values improving bathymetry of floodplain and main stem channels is an important way forward for large scale hydrodynamic models e g by assimilating future swot mission and current altimetry data biancaramaria et al 2016 in very flat areas such as the niger inner delta a variation of just one to few meters in the main stem channel bankfull depth may largely change simulation results by altering river floodplain exchange flows and then hydrograph shape this study provided estimates of water loss across the niger inner delta calculated evapotranspiration between 760 and 1130 mm yr is consistent with mahé et al 2009 who estimated evapotranspiration averaging 800 mm yr in the delta and varying between 400 mm yr in 1984 1985 and 1300 mm yr in 1924 1925 the mgb simulation scenario without infiltration from floodplains yielded much smaller values ranging from 420 mm yr to 720 mm yr simulated water loss values between 20 1 and 31 6 km3 yr were of the same order as those estimated by ogilvie et al 2015 annual evaporation losses between 12 km3 and 21 km3 and mahé et al 2009 annual losses between 11 4 and 29 5 km3 yr this study corroborates other studies that argue that large scale arid wetlands are involved in important land atmosphere feedback processes dadson et al 2010 taylor 2010 in the niger inner delta the wet season precedes niger flood arrival and is important in driving soil saturation and thus alterations in precipitation regime may affect antecedent soil moisture and then flood extent in the region regarding flood extent estimates based on a hydrological balance method mahé et al 2009 suggested a total flooded area of 24 000 km2 for the whole delta while a modis based estimation by ogilvie et al 2015 indicated flooded surfaces to range between 3000 km2 and 20 000 km2 estimates that are considerably higher than ours however one must notice that the definition of the area of interest in each of these studies is also different so that a rigorous comparison of values is not possible finally previous large scale models of the niger and other basins with important floodplain attenuation which considered only one defined upstream downstream direction seemed to overpredict discharges in downstream gauges e g dadson et al 2010 pedinotti et al 2012 dadson et al 2010 argued that it may have occurred due to i water abstraction by humans ii groundwater recharge iii uncertainty in discharge observations iv underestimation of evapotranspiration v uncertainty in precipitation or vi uncertainty in flow paths at 0 5 spatial resolution water abstraction and observed data precipitation discharge climate variables uncertainty may certainly contribute to model errors from our results other processes also need to be simulated in order to achieve a satisfactory representation of large dryland wetlands related to i two way coupling between hydrodynamics and hydrology considering infiltration from flooded areas to ensure water availability for soil evapotranspiration and computation of evapotranspiration in a dynamic hru approach and ii representation of flow hydrodynamics flood wave diffusion backwater floodplain storage bifurcations and distributed flow paths along floodplain channels as well as diffuse flow 6 conclusions basins with large scale semi arid wetlands are complex systems and remain challenging for modelling studies in the present study we addressed an important issue of which hydrological and hydrodynamic processes should be included to improve model predictions to deal with this general issue we evaluated a two way coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling of upper niger river basin which comprises niger inner delta one of the main african wetlands this region is a vast wetland area within the sahel desert and was satisfactorily simulated due to a set of model structures i infiltration from flooded areas to unsaturated soil column which largely altered calculation of evapotranspiration and water loss ii computation of evapotranspiration and open water evaporation in a dynamic hydrological response unit approach iii representation of hydrodynamics in the wetland with an explicit simulation of floodplain channels and lateral connections between unit catchments representing diffuse flows and bifurcations in conclusion the present study provides new insights on the way forward for large scale modelling of basins with dryland wetlands worldwide and could be used to improve regional to global scale hydrologic hydraulic models the main outcomes can be summarized as follow a two way coupling approach between hydrology and hydrodynamics had relevant effects on model estimates of a large semi arid wetland through infiltration of floodplains into soil and computation of both open water evaporation and soil evapotranspiration throughout the year it is important to model hydrodynamic processes such as floodplain storage floodplain channels and flow bifurcation to address a satisfactory two way coupling the model was well validated with remote sensing data flood extent and satellite altimetry after calibration with observed discharge in the niger inner delta the model application highlighted contrasting behaviors between southern and northern delta regions with a more diffuse flow in the former and channelized floodplain channels throughout dunes in the latter evapotranspiration estimates in the niger inner delta varied between scenarios with 760 mm yr to 1130 mm yr and without infiltration from floodplains 420 mm yr to 720 mm

7318,current physically based erosion models do not carefully consider the dynamic variations of soil properties during rainfall and are unable to simulate saline sodic soil slope erosion processes the aim of this work was to build upon a complete model framework ssem to simulate runoff and erosion processes for saline sodic soils by coupling dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and soil erodibility kτ sixty rainfall simulation rainfall experiments 2 soil textures 5 sodicity levels 2 slope gradients 3 duplicates provided data for model calibration and validation ssem worked very well for simulating the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silty clay the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non saline soils or soils with higher clay contents thus ssem did not perform very well for some validation events we further examined the model performances of four concepts dynamic ks and kτ case 1 ssem dynamic ks and constant kτ case 2 constant ks and dynamic kτ case 3 and constant ks and constant kτ case 4 the results demonstrated that the model which considers dynamic variations in soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility can provide more reasonable runoff and erosion prediction results for saline sodic soils keywords saline sodic soil soil erosion model dynamic erodibility model validation 1 introduction rainfall induced slope erosion models are summaries of knowledge of how slope surfaces respond to rainfall and overland flow under various conditions their structures depend on hydrological scientists views of physical phenomena in special places such as unpaved roads hillslopes agricultural lands and rangelands sharda et al 1994 cao et al 2015 al hamdan et al 2015 slope erosion models such as rusle weep shesed and h r have been developed sequentially aksoy and kavvas 2005 and each model has its theoretical hypotheses fields of application and limitations for example answers assumes that sediments can be detached by both rainfall and runoff but can only be transported by runoff beasley et al 1980 creams simulates interrill areas and rills separately and detachments in both rill and interrill areas are determined using a modification to usle foster et al 1981 wesp and rhem assume that there are fine particles of sediment that will be available for transport by sheet flow as soon as rainfall exceeds infiltration rate without any resistance to removal al hamdan et al 2015 all mathematical descriptions are simplifications of reality but these simplified forms can obtain high precision results in some cases srinivasan and galvao 1995 schindewolf and schmidt 2012 kim et al 2013 reclamation of coastal saline tidal flats has become an important practice for coastal countries faced with a lack of cultivated lands and increasing populations in rudong county jiangsu province china tidal flat reclamation is accomplished by leaching and draining sediments that have been inundated by sea water which involves the construction of supporting networks of water channels used to control and conserve water resources during the initial phases she et al 2014 that construction generates many excavated soil slopes such as those of the banks of ditches drainage channels streams and rivers xu et al 2013 reported that soil desalinization can require 30 years to yield agricultural land of minimal acceptable quality depending on soil type and local environmental conditions many of the soil materials eroded by rainfall originate in drainage channels and smaller amounts enter channels in runoff water substantial portions of sediments are deposited on the beds of water channels and can severely reduce their efficacies for removing highly saline water this represents a risk of retaining soil sodicity that would in turn further affect future sediment losses simulations of runoff and erosion processes will provide direct insights into the runoff and erosion mechanisms of saline sodic slopes however saline sodic slope runoff and erosion processes have specific characteristics the effects of sodicity on soil responses to rainfall and overland flows should be carefully considered in model structures the kinetic energy of raindrops on soil surfaces cause aggregate breakdown and create compacted layers with reduced porosity and hydraulic conductivity which can form parts of soil surface seals assouline 2004 moreover washed in layers of finer soil particles that enter soil and block pores complete the surface seals agassi et al 1981 this paper represents a first attempt at developing a model for simulating saline sodic soil slope runoff and erosion processes the details and results of simulated rainfall experiments are shown in sections 2 and 3 based on the results of the simulated rainfall experiments model descriptions including assumptions governing equations auto calibration of model parameters global sensitivity analysis and evaluation of model performance are provided in sections 4 and 5 the model parameters were calibrated using a global optimization method with the observed data model verification was subsequently carried out in which simulation results were compared with the observed data finally the model performances of four views are further examined to explain the model structure 2 study area the two study sites are located in rudong county 120 42 to 121 22 e and 32 12 to 32 36 n nantong city jiangsu province china and jiangning district 118 22 to 119 14 e and 31 14

study sites especially intense storms can occur during typhoons daily rainfall data are provided for the periods 1959 2015 and 1951 2015 for rudong county and jiangning district respectively see fig s1 in the supplementary material 3 experimental design 3 1 rainfall simulation experiments sixty rainfall simulation experiments 2 soil textures 5 sodicity levels 2 slope gradients 3 duplicates were used to provide data for calibrating and validating the different modeling approaches those experiments which have been described in detail elsewhere liu and she 2017a are now summarized 1 soil materials to investigate the effects of sodicity on the runoff and erosion processes sodicity levels were induced rather than using different soils from a natural sodicity gradient along which other soil properties are also likely to change five sodicity levels were established in a silt loam and a silty clay with clay contents of 8 5 and 46 0 respectively the five sodicity levels for the silt loam and silty clay soils are designated li and ci i 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively and are reported in table 1 2 treatments the soils which were packed in 50 cm 30 cm 15 cm flumes at two slope gradients 22 and 35 were exposed to 60 min of simulated rainfall deionized water at a constant intensity of 125 mm h 1 3 2 determination of soil water retention curves volumetric water content θ was calculated using the following equation 1 θ ω ρ b ρ w where ω is the gravimetric soil water content kg m 3 ρb is the dry bulk density 1300 kg m 3 in this study and ρw is the density of water 1000 kg m 3 at standard temperature and pressure soil cores were saturated to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks by the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 pairs of data points for the soil water content θ and the soil water potential ψ i e θ ψ were obtained for both soils using the pressure plate method the values of ψ were set to 0 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 8 2 3 5 10 30 and 150 m these points were used to fit the brooks and corey equation to obtain a soil water retention curve θ ψ for each soil brooks and corey 1964 θ ψ was calculated using the b c equation 2 θ ψ θ res θ sat θ res α ψ λ θ sat ψ

unsaturated conditions θ θres and θsat are the measured residual and saturated soil water contents respectively α 1 m 1 and λ dimensionless are unsaturated soil parameters related to the inverse of the air entry suction ψ 0 m and the pore size distribution respectively and se is the effective saturation the corresponding soil hydraulic parameters for each soil are given in table 2 4 model hypothesis 4 1 dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity during rainfall physical based rainfall runoff models often regard soil saturated hydraulic conductivity as a constant value recent investigations have confirmed that soil structure was dynamic during the collision of a raindrop on a bare soil surface han et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 and it is common knowledge that soil saturated hydraulic conductivities are controlled by soil structure for example zhou et al 2013 investigated the effect of rainfall kinetic energy on crusting they indicated that the porosity of the surface soil decreased with cumulative rainfall on the other hand increasing sodicity resulted in greater degrees of aggregate breakdown and lower porosity which led to reduced soil saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was thus changed under the common actions of rainfall and salt chemistry the modeling views which consider saturated hydraulic conductivity to be a constant value were not reliable in theory according to the complexity of the interactions between rainfall and salt chemistry it is very hard or impossible to define the respective responses to rainfall and salt chemistry therefore modeling can be undertaken using physically based quantitative approaches many studies have described the relationship between soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and rainfall characteristics using an exponential decrease equation 4 ks ks steady ks initial ks steady exp β x where ksinitial and kssteady are the initial and steady soil saturated hydraulic conductivities m s 1 β is an empirical parameter that denotes the change in saturated hydraulic conductivity during an event x is either rainfall duration t moore 1981 ahuja 1983 cumulative kinetic energy e brakensiek and rawls 1983 or cumulative rainfall edwards and larson 1969 for this study the above concept was adopted to simulate rainfall induced runoff for saline sodic slopes 4 2 dynamic soil erodibility during rainfall sediment loss sl is estimated by the following equation 5 s l kc f 1 p f 2 r f 3 φ where kc is the soil erodibility term f 1 p is a function of the rainfall intensity p f 2 r is a function of the runoff rate r and f 3 φ is a function of the slope gradient φ it is suggested that the following equation be used to estimate the soil erodibility term kc zhang et al 1998 6 kc s l p 1 r 1 2 tan φ 2 3 the expression in eq 6 was used to quantify the dynamic changes in soil erodibility during seal formation the relationships between soil erodibility kc and cumulative rainfall under different soil textures soil sodicity levels and slope gradients are depicted in fig 2 in most cases the results showed that the soil erodibility kc of silt loam increased exponentially to a peak value and then decreased exponentially it must be noted that under some conditions the soil erodibility kc of silt loam decreased exponentially however as a whole the soil erodibility kc of silty clay increased exponentially to a peak value and then remained relatively constant the above results were consistent with the results of assouline and ben hur 2006 however al hamdan et al 2015 accepted a different concept and indicated that the soil erodibility kc should decrease exponentially based on that concept the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem was improved and was able to simulate the soil erosion processes very well in any event those results and our experimental results suggest that soil erodibility was not constant but dynamic possibly because the soil surface structure and development of surface crust were changed during a storm event the difference between the concepts accepted by al hamdan et al 2015 and assouline and ben hur 2006 probably resulted from the different initial conditions of their experimental designs al hamdan et al 2015 selected disturbed rangeland sites under field conditions for rainfall simulation experiments whereas assouline and ben hur 2006 used packed soil the rangeland soil differed from the packed soil it experienced many wetting and drying periods under the field conditions and its structure was relatively stable thus during a storm event soil erodibility only showed a slowly decreasing trend because of declining sediment availability however for the packed soil the soil surface initially had a loose and dry layer but had low sediment production due to the cohesive strength between soil materials when wetted as the runoff began clay dispersion and aggregate disintegration controlled the sediment supply with the loose layer generally being much more erodible as the rainfall continued the fine soil particles blocked soil pores and the soil seal dominated the sediment transport due to clay dispersion aggregate disintegration and overland flow transportation as a whole the supply of saline sodic soil materials was dynamic and sediment transport response varied during the rainfall events therefore a compatible approach that accounted for the two concepts of al hamdan and assouline was used to build the saline sodic soil erosion model 5 model description the ssem model is composed of three primary components a calculation module auto calibration of model parameters and global sensitivity analysis the calculation module simulates hydrology and erosional responses based on the input parameters auto calibration of the model parameters was used to estimate the optimal parameter sets the global sensitivity analysis was used to determine the most important parameters to reduce the number of parameters for efficient use of ssem a schematic representation of ssem model and steps in ssem model for simulating runoff and erosion of saline sodic soil slopes are shown in fig 3 5 1 calculation module 5 1 1 infiltration when rainfall commences rainfall intensity p m s 1 at the soil surface is lower than the soil infiltration capacity and thus the infiltration process is supply controlled hillel 1998 prior to ponding the infiltration rate i m s 1 is equivalent to the effective rainfall intensity once the rate of rainfall exceeds the soil infiltration capacity which corresponds to the occurrence of ponding the process becomes soil controlled the infiltration rate during rainfall is described by the green ampt model 7 i p cos φ t t

represented by a flow velocity u m s 1 and average depth of flow h m such that discharge per unit width q uh m2 s 1 the mass and momentum equations of the flow are given by 11 r p cos φ i 12 h t uh x

dynamic soil erodibility concept is used the soil erodibility kτ is set to an initial value kτinitial at the beginning of rainfall increases exponentially to a peak value kτ peak because of the increased availability of sediment source aggregate slaking clay swelling and clay dispersion after overland flow starts and then decreases exponentially because of the reduction in the availability

a tendency to overestimate cd coefficient of determination describes the ratio of the scatter of the simulated values and the observed values around the average of the observations r 2 goodness of fit is a measure of the relationship between two data sets and describes the proportion of total variance in the observed data that can be explained by the model emax maximum error shows the maximum difference between the predicted and observed values in a series of data the mocom ua method which is general purpose global multi objective optimization algorithm was used to calibrate the model parameters it involves the initial selection of a population of p points distributed randomly throughout an s dimensional feasible parameter space in this study latin hypercube lh sampling was used to select the initial parameter space van griensven et al 2006 for each point the multi objective vector was calculated and the population was ranked and sorted using a pareto ranking procedure simplexes of s 1 points were then selected from the population using a rank based selection method multi objective downhill simplex evolution mosim was used to improve the worst point and generate a new point that replaced the worst point iterative applications of pareto ranking and mosim cause the population to converge towards the pareto set see fig s2 in supplementary material the mocom ua algorithm terminates automatically when all points in the population are non dominated for more detailed information about the mocom ua algorithm the readers are referred to yapo et al 1996 and gupta et al 1998 the data on runoff rate and sediment loss at slopes of 22 for all soils were selected for model calibration the model has two outputs runoff rate and sediment loss to be matched and therefore the process of calibration included two subprocesses runoff calibration and erosion calibration note that the calibrated parameters of the runoff calibration were the input parameters of the erosion calibration the model was analyzed for different cases and concepts case 1 ssem model dynamic ks and kτ case 1 has 8 parameters to be determined by the process of calibration table 3 a search population size of 200 points was selected on the basis of a model test run that showed that a population size of 200 points provided enough accuracy for the pareto set in the runoff calibration subprocess the runoff rate data were used to calibrate sf σ and β two objective functions crm and rmse were selected for the runoff calibration because there were smaller correlations between those two objective functions e g corr crm rmse 0 001 table 4 the 200 points of the pareto set were analyzed using a one sample t test to determine the optimal parameter for the erosion calibration confidence level 95 the runoff calibration processes for case 1 are shown in figs s3 s6 of the supplementary material in the erosion calibration subprocess sf σ and β were the input parameters for erosion calibration and the sediment loss data were used to calibrate kτinitial bmax bmin λincrease and λdecrease two objective functions r2 and rmse were selected for the erosion calibration because there were relatively smaller correlations between those two objective functions e g corr r2 rmse 0 204 the multi objective function cd r2 and emax r2 were not better because cd and emax were not global measurements finally the 200 points of the pareto set and the model uncertainty due to the calibration were obtained case 2 dynamic ks and constant kτ in case 2 λdecrease and λincrease are set to 0 and bmax and bmin are set to 1 therefore there are 4 parameters sf σ β and kτinitial that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 case 3 constant ks and dynamic kτ in case 3 σ is set to 1 β is set to 0 and there are therefore 6 parameters sf kτinitial λdecrease λincrease bmax and bmin that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 case 4 constant ks and constant kτ in case 4 β λdecrease and λincrease are set to 0 and σ bmax and bmin are set to 1 therefore there are 2 parameters sf and kτinitial that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 5 3 global sensitivity analysis the lh oat method was used to analyze the global sensitivities of the model parameters latin hypercube sampling can ensure that the full ranges of all parameters have been sampled the precision of an oat design assures that the changes in the outputs of each model can be unambiguously attributed to the parameter that was changed it begins with obtaining n latin hypercube sample points and then changing each lh sample point p times by changing each of the p parameters one at a time the partial effect psij for each parameter ei around each latin hypercube point j is calculated using the following equation 31 ps ij m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p 2 f i where m is a model output or objective function fi is the fraction by which the parameter ei is changed and j refers to a latin hypercube point the global effect si of the parameter ei is the average value of the partial effect psij for all n latin hypercube points the global effects of all p parameters can be ranked with the largest effect being given a rank of 1 and the smallest effect being given rank p for more detailed information about the lh oat method readers are referred to van griensven et al 2006 this study analyzed the effects of the input model parameters on the model outputs directly for case 1 which was not needed for the other cases the mean runoff rate and sediment loss in 60 min were selected as the model outputs 500 latin hypercube sample points were selected the fi were set to 5 we divided the global effect into four groups to qualitatively select the most sensitive parameter 0 si 0 05 not important 0 05 si 0 20 slightly important 0 20 si 1 00 important si 1 very important the results of the global sensitivity analysis can indicate which parameters can influence these outputs and hence can be used to reduce the number of parameters for the efficient use of ssem 5 4 evaluation of model performance the data on runoff rate and sediment loss at slopes of 35 for all soils were selected for model verification there were two observations runoff rate and sediment loss to be matched therefore the process of verification included two parts runoff verification and erosion verification the simulated time series runoff rates and sediment losses for the 4 cases case 1 dynamic ks and kτ case 2 dynamic ks and constant kτ case 3 constant ks and dynamic kτ and case 4 constant ks and constant kτ for the different concepts were calculated to compare the simulated and observed values seven statistical evaluation criteria eqs 24 30 were used to evaluate the overall performances of the four cases 6 results 6 1 sensitivity analysis rainfall intensity p table 5 was very important parameter for predicting mean runoff rate when using the ssem model and its global sensitivity was 2 65 in general the mean runoff rate varied by 2 65 times because the rainfall intensity caused a small perturbation of 5 this result indicates that the ssem model depends heavily on rainfall data accuracy rainfall volumes of 60 min were measured using four rain gauges alongside the metal flume and the rainfall intensity was then estimated as the mean value however the rain gauge measured data were subject to large amounts of uncertainty although we followed instructions strictly and collected the data carefully we found that the range of the standard errors of the rainfall data was 4 42 8 34 mm h 1 i e the range of the relative errors was 3 5 6 7 the relative error of 6 7 exceeded the small perturbation of 5 therefore the results of the model calibration and verification were probably influenced by the errors in the rain gauge measured data under some treatments additionally there were 6 important parameters sf φ θs ksinitial θi and σ for simulating the mean runoff rate using the ssem model the global sensitivities of sf φ θs and ksinitial on predicating mean runoff rate were similar and much higher than those of θi and σ during the model calibration and verification the direct measured data on φ θs and ksinitial should be sufficiently accurate and reliable however the values of sf could not be measured directly therefore it was necessary to use a sufficiently large population and design a reasonable initial range to improve calibration precision the global sensitivity of parameter β on predicating runoff rate was only 0 01 gessesse et al 2015 suggested that a parameter should not be considered for further analysis if its global sensitivity is 0 001 according to that suggestion parameter β was not neglected for calibration in this study however parameter β can be regarded as a fixed value when the model precision basically meets the actual requirement the variations in the remaining parameters were found to have non significant effects 0 001 on simulating overland flow and were not considered for further analysis there were 5 very important parameters p φ sf ksinitial and θs for the mean sediment loss simulation those five parameters were also important or very important for the mean runoff rate simulation given that the model precision met the basic requirement that result implied that the ssem model only needed to guarantee the accuracy of those 5 parameters and thus the parameter calibration workload was largely reduced in addition five important parameters kτinitial bmax bmin θi and σ were identified among those five parameters the global sensitivities of kτinitial bmax and bmin were relatively higher than those of θi and σ finally there were 2 slightly important parameters λincrease and λdecrease and 4 not important parameters that did not influence the model output at all the global sensitivities of the first order reaction coefficient u and the dispersion coefficient for the sediment dh were 0 001 this result verified that the approach of dealing with the parameters u and dh in lei et al 1998 was reasonable they considered parameters u and dh as the fixed values in our study parameters u and dh were set to the same values in lei et al 1998 i e u 3 m 1 and dh 0 05 m2 s 1 6 2 model calibration the instantaneous runoff rate and sediment loss values used for calibration are shown with the ssem predicated values in figs 4 and 5 the runoff rate curve for each treatment was well modeled by ssem rmse 15 r 2 0 85 the rapidly increasing processes of runoff rate for silt loam l1 l5 and the slowly increasing processes for silty clay c1 c5 were well reproduced by ssem the predictive uncertainty of the cumulative rainfall to runoff was large which probably resulted from the fewer number of data points for the first few minutes of the runoff on the other hand the variation in sediment loss with cumulative rainfall for each treatment was well predicated rmse 20 r 2 0 85 the peak values of the sediment loss for silt loam l1 l5 were well predicated by ssem however large predictive uncertainties existed for l1 l4 and c3 which may have caused some large errors during model validation table 6 lists the ssem calibration parameter set a comparison of the calibration values with the initial recommended ranges in table 2 shows that the sf kτinitial bmin λincrease and λdecrease calibration values were all in the initial recommended ranges whereas the β and bmax calibration values were not during the calibration processes the initial recommend ranges were not changed this result indicates that the mocom ua method had a high tolerance for the selection of initial recommended ranges according to the sensitivity analysis results see section 6 1 the saturated soil water content θs initial saturated hydraulic conductivity ksinitial and suction head at the wetting front sf were the very important parameters of the ssem model the values of θs and ksinitial were measured from laboratory experiments whereas the value for sf was obtained from the parameter calibration the θs increased linearly with soil esp for silt loam r 2 0 19 whereas the θs decreased linearly with the soil esp for silty clay r 2 0 93 fig 6 the ksinitial decreased linearly with soil esp for silt loam and silty clay r 2 0 83 and 0 92 respectively there were parabolic correlations between sf and soil esp r 2 0 45 and 0 52 respectively 6 3 model validation the variations in runoff rate with cumulative rainfall for the 70 slope gradient were well predicated by ssem fig 7 ssem overpredicted the runoff rates for l4 and l5 given that the cumulative rainfall was between 60 and 80 mm but the runoff rates for the other treatments were well predicted the runoff rate curves for l4 l5 and c1 for a 70 slope gradient were relatively more poorly modeled than those of the other treatments as indicated by the comparatively high values of mae rmse and emax the absolute values of crm and the low cns cd and r 2 values table 7 the error values for the other treatments were reasonable for example the range of rmse for the other treatments was 0 12 0 38 the range of cns was 0 80 0 93 and the range of r 2 was 0 83 0 99 ssem poorly modeled the sediment loss curves for l2 and l3 fig 8 and largely underestimated the values of sediment loss for l2 l3 and c1 given that the cumulative rainfall amounts were between 60 and 80 mm which resulted in the comparatively high values for mae rmse emax the absolute values of crm and the low cns cd and r 2 values table 8 for the other treatments the sediment loss curve predictions well matched those obtained by measurement fig 8 for example mae ranged from 12 98 to 19 85 for silt loam and 0 38 0 88 for silty clay the rmse values were between 0 59 and 0 71 for silt loam and 0 37 0 56 and r 2 exceeded 0 80 for silt loam and 0 70 for silty clay as a result the errors in predicted sediment loss were generally reasonable in addition by comparing the mean predicated errors ssem better simulated the runoff and erosion processes of silty clay the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non saline soils and soils with higher clay contents in addition the primary mathematical descriptions for saline sodic silt loam stemmed from research on nonsaline soils or soils with higher clay contents 8 5 6 4 comparison of the four concepts we further examined the model performances of four concepts dynamic ks and kτ case 1 ssem dynamic ks and constant kτ case 2 constant ks and dynamic kτ case 3 and constant ks and constant kτ case 4 the calibration and validation results for cases 2 3 and 4 are shown in figs s7 s9 of the supplementary materials the dynamic and constant ks methods both predicted the runoff processes very well for both soils but the dynamic ks method provided a more realistic estimate of the runoff processes than the constant ks method for silt loam table 9 although the errors using the dynamic ks method for silty clay were improved a little 1 20 rmse cns and r 2 using the dynamic ks method for silt loam were improved by 49 77 and 61 respectively the errors in the predicted erosion processes when employing the constant kτ method cases 2 and 4 were generally high and unreasonable the model performances for case 1 were slightly better than those for case 3 in comparison with case 4 case 1 improved rmse by 49 and r 2 by 114 for silt loam and rmse by 33 and r 2 by 65 for silty clay table 10 overall the results presented above demonstrate that the model which considers dynamic soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and erodibility can provide more reasonable predicted runoff and soil erosion results 7 discussion and conclusions we have shown a series of findings for saline sodic soil slope erosion processes liu et al 2015 she et al 2016 liu and she 2017a liu and she 2017b that lend strong support to the idea that saline sodic soil slope erosion processes are highly complex and depend on the characteristics of slope gradient rainfall intensity and sodicity levels the common result of these experiments was that as a whole the sediment loss kg m 2 h 1 initially increased to a peak value and then gradually decreased especially for high slope gradients and rainfall intensities which is consistent with observations from other studies fox and bryan 2000 dong et al 2012 assouline and ben hur 2006 mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 initially the constant erodibility concept was used in the models to analyze this result contrary to our expectations the saline sodic soil erosion processes could not be simulated under the constant erodibility concept the saline sodic soil erosion processes remain uncertain for example to what extent if any is saline sodic soil erosion controlled by the presence or absence of aggregate disintegration clay dispersion and surface crusts stage 1 clay dispersion made the loose layer much more erodible the initial gravimetric soil water content was only 5 and the soil material was very dry as runoff began sodium saturation caused the physical separation of soil particles which resulted in sufficient distances between individual soil particles the repulsive forces between molecules exceeded the bonding forces clay dispersion occurred with the loose layer generally being much more erodible in addition the physical dispersion caused by the impacts of raindrops and infiltration water enhanced these processes stage 2 surface structure controlled the sediment supply first after the loose layer was flushed entrainment became more difficult as the soil material was lodged in downslope surface depressions which resulted in surface armoring second transport selectivity played an important role in sediment transport clay sized and silt sized particles were usually transported mainly as primary particles but the sand sized particles were left on the soil surface with the upper layer generally being less erodible shi et al 2013 finally surface crusting may be caused by the physical impact of rainfall and chemical dispersion the physical impact of rainfall made the soil surface more compact whereas the dispersed clay particles clogged soil pores shainberg and letey 1984 guarnieri et al 2005 pearson and bauder 2006 to some extent the dispersive effects of sodium may be greater than the effects of rainfall the process based erosion prediction models did not address the issue of temporal variations in erodibility during a rainfall event kinnell 2005 however there have been three typical studies that have treated this issue from the perspective of an empirical relationship hypothesis ziegler et al 2001 considered the dynamic erodibility using a step function that determined changing erodibility states over the course of a storm they substituted an empirical exponential decay function to simulate the typical sediment transport response for that step function ziegler et al 2002 curiously they indicated that the soil erodibility initially increased for a short time and then decreased as shown in fig 3 of ziegler et al 2002 but they ignored the transient growth in soil erodibility al hamdan et al 2015 applied the dynamic erodibility concept in which concentrated flow erodibility was set to decrease exponentially during a run off event to improve the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem in our study saline sodic soil erosion should be controlled by the presence or absence of aggregate disintegration clay dispersion and surface crust therefore a compatible approach taking into account all concepts constant erodibility decreasing erodibility and increasing decreasing erodibility was used by changing the model parameters using the mocom ua method after model calibration the increasing decreasing erodibility concept was accepted for saline sodic soil slope erosion our results have at least two major implications for soil and water conservation and coastal reclamation based on the sensitivity analysis and the relationships between soil sodicity and the model parameters ssem can be simplified to investigate the effects of soil sodicity effect agroecosystems second this study provides a

7318,current physically based erosion models do not carefully consider the dynamic variations of soil properties during rainfall and are unable to simulate saline sodic soil slope erosion processes the aim of this work was to build upon a complete model framework ssem to simulate runoff and erosion processes for saline sodic soils by coupling dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and soil erodibility kτ sixty rainfall simulation rainfall experiments 2 soil textures 5 sodicity levels 2 slope gradients 3 duplicates provided data for model calibration and validation ssem worked very well for simulating the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silty clay the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non saline soils or soils with higher clay contents thus ssem did not perform very well for some validation events we further examined the model performances of four concepts dynamic ks and kτ case 1 ssem dynamic ks and constant kτ case 2 constant ks and dynamic kτ case 3 and constant ks and constant kτ case 4 the results demonstrated that the model which considers dynamic variations in soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility can provide more reasonable runoff and erosion prediction results for saline sodic soils keywords saline sodic soil soil erosion model dynamic erodibility model validation 1 introduction rainfall induced slope erosion models are summaries of knowledge of how slope surfaces respond to rainfall and overland flow under various conditions their structures depend on hydrological scientists views of physical phenomena in special places such as unpaved roads hillslopes agricultural lands and rangelands sharda et al 1994 cao et al 2015 al hamdan et al 2015 slope erosion models such as rusle weep shesed and h r have been developed sequentially aksoy and kavvas 2005 and each model has its theoretical hypotheses fields of application and limitations for example answers assumes that sediments can be detached by both rainfall and runoff but can only be transported by runoff beasley et al 1980 creams simulates interrill areas and rills separately and detachments in both rill and interrill areas are determined using a modification to usle foster et al 1981 wesp and rhem assume that there are fine particles of sediment that will be available for transport by sheet flow as soon as rainfall exceeds infiltration rate without any resistance to removal al hamdan et al 2015 all mathematical descriptions are simplifications of reality but these simplified forms can obtain high precision results in some cases srinivasan and galvao 1995 schindewolf and schmidt 2012 kim et al 2013 reclamation of coastal saline tidal flats has become an important practice for coastal countries faced with a lack of cultivated lands and increasing populations in rudong county jiangsu province china tidal flat reclamation is accomplished by leaching and draining sediments that have been inundated by sea water which involves the construction of supporting networks of water channels used to control and conserve water resources during the initial phases she et al 2014 that construction generates many excavated soil slopes such as those of the banks of ditches drainage channels streams and rivers xu et al 2013 reported that soil desalinization can require 30 years to yield agricultural land of minimal acceptable quality depending on soil type and local environmental conditions many of the soil materials eroded by rainfall originate in drainage channels and smaller amounts enter channels in runoff water substantial portions of sediments are deposited on the beds of water channels and can severely reduce their efficacies for removing highly saline water this represents a risk of retaining soil sodicity that would in turn further affect future sediment losses simulations of runoff and erosion processes will provide direct insights into the runoff and erosion mechanisms of saline sodic slopes however saline sodic slope runoff and erosion processes have specific characteristics the effects of sodicity on soil responses to rainfall and overland flows should be carefully considered in model structures the kinetic energy of raindrops on soil surfaces cause aggregate breakdown and create compacted layers with reduced porosity and hydraulic conductivity which can form parts of soil surface seals assouline 2004 moreover washed in layers of finer soil particles that enter soil and block pores complete the surface seals agassi et al 1981 this paper represents a first attempt at developing a model for simulating saline sodic soil slope runoff and erosion processes the details and results of simulated rainfall experiments are shown in sections 2 and 3 based on the results of the simulated rainfall experiments model descriptions including assumptions governing equations auto calibration of model parameters global sensitivity analysis and evaluation of model performance are provided in sections 4 and 5 the model parameters were calibrated using a global optimization method with the observed data model verification was subsequently carried out in which simulation results were compared with the observed data finally the model performances of four views are further examined to explain the model structure 2 study area the two study sites are located in rudong county 120 42 to 121 22 e and 32 12 to 32 36 n nantong city jiangsu province china and jiangning district 118 22 to 119 14 e and 31 14 to 32 37 n nanjing city jiangsu province china fig 1 both areas are dominated by a subtropical moist monsoonal climate rudong county has a mean annual rainfall of 1026 mm 68 of which falls between may

study sites especially intense storms can occur during typhoons daily rainfall data are provided for the periods 1959 2015 and 1951 2015 for rudong county and jiangning district respectively see fig s1 in the supplementary material 3 experimental design 3 1 rainfall simulation experiments sixty rainfall simulation experiments 2 soil textures 5 sodicity levels 2 slope gradients 3 duplicates were used to provide data for calibrating and validating the different modeling approaches those experiments which have been described in detail elsewhere liu and she 2017a are now summarized 1 soil materials to investigate the effects of sodicity on the runoff and erosion processes sodicity levels were induced rather than using different soils from a natural sodicity gradient along which other soil properties are also likely to change five sodicity levels were established in a silt loam and a silty clay with clay contents of 8 5 and 46 0 respectively the five sodicity levels for the silt loam and silty clay soils are designated li and ci i 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively and are reported in table 1 2 treatments the soils which were packed in 50 cm 30 cm 15 cm flumes at two slope gradients 22 and 35 were exposed to 60 min of simulated rainfall deionized water at a constant intensity of 125 mm h 1 3 2 determination of soil water retention curves volumetric water content θ was calculated using the following equation 1 θ ω ρ b ρ w where ω is the gravimetric soil water content kg m 3 ρb is the dry bulk density 1300 kg m 3 in this study and ρw is the density of water 1000 kg m 3 at standard temperature and pressure soil cores were saturated to measure saturated hydraulic conductivity ks by the constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 pairs of data points for the soil water content θ and the soil water potential ψ i e θ ψ were obtained for both soils using the pressure plate method the values of ψ were set to 0 0 01 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 8 2 3 5 10 30 and 150 m these points were used to fit the brooks and corey equation to obtain a soil water retention curve θ ψ for each soil brooks and corey 1964 θ ψ was calculated using the b c equation 2 θ ψ θ res θ sat θ res α ψ λ θ sat ψ 0 ψ 0 3 se θ θ res θ sat θ res where ψ is the soil water potential which is equivalent to the pressure head in these experiments m and which is positive under saturated conditions and negative under unsaturated conditions θ θres and θsat are the measured residual and saturated soil water contents respectively α 1 m 1 and λ dimensionless are unsaturated soil parameters related to the inverse of the air entry suction ψ 0 m and the pore size distribution respectively and se is the effective saturation the corresponding soil hydraulic parameters for each soil are given in table 2 4 model hypothesis 4 1 dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity during rainfall physical based rainfall runoff models often regard soil saturated hydraulic conductivity as a constant value recent investigations have confirmed that soil structure was dynamic during the collision of a raindrop on a bare soil surface han et al 2016 zhou et al 2013 and it is common knowledge that soil saturated hydraulic conductivities are controlled by soil structure for example zhou et al 2013 investigated the effect of rainfall kinetic energy on crusting they indicated that the porosity of the surface soil decreased with cumulative rainfall on the other hand increasing sodicity resulted in greater degrees of aggregate breakdown and lower porosity which led to reduced soil saturated hydraulic conductivity table 1 the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was thus changed under the common actions of rainfall and salt chemistry the modeling views which consider saturated hydraulic conductivity to be a constant value were not reliable in theory according to the complexity of the interactions between rainfall and salt chemistry it is very hard or impossible to define the respective responses to rainfall and salt chemistry therefore modeling can be undertaken using physically based quantitative approaches many studies have described the relationship between soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and rainfall characteristics using an exponential decrease equation 4 ks ks steady ks initial ks steady exp β x where ksinitial and kssteady are the initial and steady soil saturated hydraulic conductivities m s 1 β is an empirical parameter that denotes the change in saturated hydraulic conductivity during an event x is either rainfall duration t moore 1981 ahuja 1983 cumulative kinetic energy e brakensiek and rawls 1983 or cumulative rainfall edwards and larson 1969 for this study the above concept was adopted to simulate rainfall induced runoff for saline sodic slopes 4 2 dynamic soil erodibility during rainfall sediment loss sl is estimated by the following equation 5 s l kc f 1 p f 2 r f 3 φ where kc is the soil erodibility term f 1 p is a function of the rainfall intensity p f 2 r is a function of the runoff rate r and f 3 φ is a function of the slope gradient φ it is suggested that the following equation be used to estimate the soil erodibility term kc zhang et al 1998 6 kc s l p 1 r 1 2 tan φ 2 3 the expression in eq 6 was used to quantify the dynamic changes in soil erodibility during seal formation the relationships between soil erodibility kc and cumulative rainfall under different soil textures soil sodicity levels and slope gradients are depicted in fig 2 in most cases the results showed that the soil erodibility kc of silt loam increased exponentially to a peak value and then decreased exponentially it must be noted that under some conditions the soil erodibility kc of silt loam decreased exponentially however as a whole the soil erodibility kc of silty clay increased exponentially to a peak value and then remained relatively constant the above results were consistent with the results of assouline and ben hur 2006 however al hamdan et al 2015 accepted a different concept and indicated that the soil erodibility kc should decrease exponentially based on that concept the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem was improved and was able to simulate the soil erosion processes very well in any event those results and our experimental results suggest that soil erodibility was not constant but dynamic possibly because the soil surface structure and development of surface crust were changed during a storm event the difference between the concepts accepted by al hamdan et al 2015 and assouline and ben hur 2006 probably resulted from the different initial conditions of their experimental designs al hamdan et al 2015 selected disturbed rangeland sites under field conditions for rainfall simulation experiments whereas assouline and ben hur 2006 used packed soil the rangeland soil differed from the packed soil it experienced many wetting and drying periods under the field conditions and its structure was relatively stable thus during a storm event soil erodibility only showed a slowly decreasing trend because of declining sediment availability however for the packed soil the soil surface initially had a loose and dry layer but had low sediment production due to the cohesive strength between soil materials when wetted as the runoff began clay dispersion and aggregate disintegration controlled the sediment supply with the loose layer generally being much more erodible as the rainfall continued the fine soil particles blocked soil pores and the soil seal dominated the sediment transport due to clay dispersion aggregate disintegration and overland flow transportation as a whole the supply of saline sodic soil materials was dynamic and sediment transport response varied during the rainfall events therefore a compatible approach that accounted for the two concepts of al hamdan and assouline was used to build the saline sodic soil erosion model 5 model description the ssem model is composed of three primary components a calculation module auto calibration of model parameters and global sensitivity analysis the calculation module simulates hydrology and erosional responses based on the input parameters auto calibration of the model parameters was used to estimate the optimal parameter sets the global sensitivity analysis was used to determine the most important parameters to reduce the number of parameters for efficient use of ssem a schematic representation of ssem model and steps in ssem model for simulating runoff and erosion of saline sodic soil slopes are shown in fig 3 5 1 calculation module 5 1 1 infiltration when rainfall commences rainfall intensity p m s 1 at the soil surface is lower than the soil infiltration capacity and thus the infiltration process is supply controlled hillel 1998 prior to ponding the infiltration rate i m s 1 is equivalent to the effective rainfall intensity once the rate of rainfall exceeds the soil infiltration capacity which corresponds to the occurrence of ponding the process becomes soil controlled the infiltration rate during rainfall is described by the green ampt model 7 i p cos φ t t

saturated hydraulic conductivity concept was considered σ was set to 1 and β must be set to 0 because of its physical meaning 5 1 2 overland flow it is assumed that the overland flow can be adequately represented by a flow velocity u m s 1 and average depth of flow h m such that discharge per unit width q uh m2 s 1 the mass and momentum equations of the flow are given by 11 r p cos φ i 12 h t uh x

width m2 s 1 it must be note that in the computer code the above units should not be changed for the uniformity of the dimensions soil detachment capacity dc is calculated using the soil erodibility of the site and hydraulic shear stress srinivasan and galvao 1995 soil detachment is assumed to start when overland flow begins al hamdan et al 2015 the detachment capacity dc can be estimated from 19

dynamic soil erodibility concept is used the soil erodibility kτ is set to an initial value kτinitial at the beginning of rainfall increases exponentially to a peak value kτ peak because of the increased availability of sediment source aggregate slaking clay swelling and clay dispersion after overland flow starts and then decreases exponentially because of the reduction in the availability

is a measure of the relationship between two data sets and describes the proportion of total variance in the observed data that can be explained by the model emax maximum error shows the maximum difference between the predicted and observed values in a series of data the mocom ua method which is general purpose global multi objective optimization algorithm was used to calibrate the model parameters it involves the initial selection of a population of p points distributed randomly throughout an s dimensional feasible parameter space in this study latin hypercube lh sampling was used to select the initial parameter space van griensven et al 2006 for each point the multi objective vector was calculated and the population was ranked and sorted using a pareto ranking procedure simplexes of s 1 points were then selected from the population using a rank based selection method multi objective downhill simplex evolution mosim was used to improve the worst point and generate a new point that replaced the worst point iterative applications of pareto ranking and mosim cause the population to converge towards the pareto set see fig s2 in supplementary material the mocom ua algorithm terminates automatically when all points in the population are non dominated for more detailed information about the mocom ua algorithm the readers are referred to yapo et al 1996 and gupta et al 1998 the data on runoff rate and sediment loss at slopes of 22 for all soils were selected for model calibration the model has two outputs runoff rate and sediment loss to be matched and therefore the process of calibration included two subprocesses runoff calibration and erosion calibration note that the calibrated parameters of the runoff calibration were the input parameters of the erosion calibration the model was analyzed for different cases and concepts case 1 ssem model dynamic ks and kτ case 1 has 8 parameters to be determined by the process of calibration table 3 a search population size of 200 points was selected on the basis of a model test run that showed that a population size of 200 points provided enough accuracy for the pareto set in the runoff calibration subprocess the runoff rate data were used to calibrate sf σ and β two objective functions crm and rmse were selected for the runoff calibration because there were smaller correlations between those two objective functions e g corr crm rmse 0 001 table 4 the 200 points of the pareto set were analyzed using a one sample t test to determine the optimal parameter for the erosion calibration confidence level 95 the runoff calibration processes for case 1 are shown in figs s3 s6 of the supplementary material in the erosion calibration subprocess sf σ and β were the input parameters for erosion calibration and the sediment loss data were used to calibrate kτinitial bmax bmin λincrease and λdecrease two objective functions r2 and rmse were selected for the erosion calibration because there were relatively smaller correlations between those two objective functions e g corr r2 rmse 0 204 the multi objective function cd r2 and emax r2 were not better because cd and emax were not global measurements finally the 200 points of the pareto set and the model uncertainty due to the calibration were obtained case 2 dynamic ks and constant kτ in case 2 λdecrease and λincrease are set to 0 and bmax and bmin are set to 1 therefore there are 4 parameters sf σ β and kτinitial that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 case 3 constant ks and dynamic kτ in case 3 σ is set to 1 β is set to 0 and there are therefore 6 parameters sf kτinitial λdecrease λincrease bmax and bmin that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 case 4 constant ks and constant kτ in case 4 β λdecrease and λincrease are set to 0 and σ bmax and bmin are set to 1 therefore there are 2 parameters sf and kτinitial that needed to be calibrated the calibration procedure was similar to that for case 1 5 3 global sensitivity analysis the lh oat method was used to analyze the global sensitivities of the model parameters latin hypercube sampling can ensure that the full ranges of all parameters have been sampled the precision of an oat design assures that the changes in the outputs of each model can be unambiguously attributed to the parameter that was changed it begins with obtaining n latin hypercube sample points and then changing each lh sample point p times by changing each of the p parameters one at a time the partial effect psij for each parameter ei around each latin hypercube point j is calculated using the following equation 31 ps ij m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p m e 1 e i 1 f i e p m e 1 e i e p 2 f i where m is a model output or objective function fi is the fraction by which the parameter ei is changed and j refers to a latin hypercube point the global effect si of the parameter ei is the average value of the partial effect psij for all n latin hypercube points the global effects of all p parameters can be ranked with the largest effect being given a rank of 1 and the smallest effect being given rank p for more detailed information about the lh oat method readers are referred to van griensven et al 2006 this study analyzed the effects of the input model parameters on the model outputs directly for case 1 which was not needed for the other cases the mean runoff rate and sediment loss in 60 min were selected as the model outputs 500 latin hypercube sample points were selected the fi were set to 5 we divided the global effect into four groups to qualitatively select the most sensitive parameter 0 si 0 05 not important 0 05 si 0 20 slightly important 0 20 si 1 00 important si 1 very important the results of the global sensitivity analysis can indicate which parameters can influence these outputs and hence can be used to reduce the number of parameters for the efficient use of ssem 5 4 evaluation of model performance the data on runoff rate and sediment loss at slopes of 35 for all soils were selected for model verification there were two observations runoff rate and sediment loss to be matched therefore the process of verification included two parts runoff verification and erosion verification the simulated time series runoff rates and sediment losses for the 4 cases case 1 dynamic ks and kτ case 2 dynamic ks and constant kτ case 3 constant ks and dynamic kτ and case 4 constant ks and constant kτ for the different concepts were calculated to compare the simulated and observed values seven statistical evaluation criteria eqs 24 30 were used to evaluate the overall performances of the four cases 6 results 6 1 sensitivity analysis rainfall intensity p table 5 was very important parameter for predicting mean runoff rate when using the ssem model and its global sensitivity was 2 65 in general the mean runoff rate varied by 2 65 times because the rainfall intensity caused a small perturbation of 5 this result indicates that the ssem model depends heavily on rainfall data accuracy rainfall volumes of 60 min were measured using four rain gauges alongside the metal flume and the rainfall intensity was then estimated as the mean value however the rain gauge measured data were subject to large amounts of uncertainty although we followed instructions strictly and collected the data carefully we found that the range of the standard errors of the rainfall data was 4 42 8 34 mm h 1 i e the range of the relative errors was 3 5 6 7 the relative error of 6 7 exceeded the small perturbation of 5 therefore the results of the model calibration and verification were probably influenced by the errors in the rain gauge measured data under some treatments additionally there were 6 important parameters sf φ θs ksinitial θi and σ for simulating the mean runoff rate using the ssem model the global sensitivities of sf φ θs and ksinitial on predicating mean runoff rate were similar and much higher than those of θi and σ during the model calibration and verification the direct measured data on φ θs and ksinitial should be sufficiently accurate and reliable however the values of sf could not be measured directly therefore it was necessary to use a sufficiently large population and design a reasonable initial range to improve calibration precision the global sensitivity of parameter β on predicating runoff rate was only 0 01 gessesse et al 2015 suggested that a parameter should not be considered for further analysis if its global sensitivity is 0 001 according to that suggestion parameter β was not neglected for calibration in this study however parameter β can be regarded as a fixed value when the model precision basically meets the actual requirement the variations in the remaining parameters were found to have non significant effects 0 001 on simulating overland flow and were not considered for further analysis there were 5 very important parameters p φ sf ksinitial and θs for the mean sediment loss simulation those five parameters were also important or very important for the mean runoff rate simulation given that the model precision met the basic requirement that result implied that the ssem model only needed to guarantee the accuracy of those 5 parameters and thus the parameter calibration workload was largely reduced in addition five important parameters kτinitial bmax bmin θi and σ were identified among those five parameters the global sensitivities of kτinitial bmax and bmin were relatively higher than those of θi and σ finally there were 2 slightly important parameters λincrease and λdecrease and 4 not important parameters that did not influence the model output at all the global sensitivities of the first order reaction coefficient u and the dispersion coefficient for the sediment dh were 0 001 this result verified that the approach of dealing with the parameters u and dh in lei et al 1998 was reasonable they considered parameters u and dh as the fixed values in our study parameters u and dh were set to the same values in lei et al 1998 i e u 3 m 1 and dh 0 05 m2 s 1 6 2 model calibration the instantaneous runoff rate and sediment loss values used for calibration are shown with the ssem predicated values in figs 4 and 5 the runoff rate curve for each treatment was well modeled by ssem rmse 15 r 2 0 85 the rapidly increasing processes of runoff rate for silt loam l1 l5 and the slowly increasing processes for silty clay c1 c5 were well reproduced by ssem the predictive uncertainty of the cumulative rainfall to runoff was large which probably resulted from the fewer number of data points for the first few minutes of the runoff on the other hand the variation in sediment loss with cumulative rainfall for each treatment was well predicated rmse 20 r 2 0 85 the peak values of the sediment loss for silt loam l1 l5 were well predicated by ssem however large predictive uncertainties existed for l1 l4 and c3 which may have caused some large errors during model validation table 6 lists the ssem calibration parameter set a comparison of the calibration values with the initial recommended ranges in table 2 shows that the sf kτinitial bmin λincrease and λdecrease calibration values were all in the initial recommended ranges whereas the β and bmax calibration values were not during the calibration processes the initial recommend ranges were not changed this result indicates that the mocom ua method had a high tolerance for the selection of initial recommended ranges according to the sensitivity analysis results see section 6 1 the saturated soil water content θs initial saturated hydraulic conductivity ksinitial and suction head at the wetting front sf were the very important parameters of the ssem model the values of θs and ksinitial were measured from laboratory experiments whereas the value for sf was obtained from the parameter calibration the θs increased linearly with soil esp for silt loam r 2 0 19 whereas the θs decreased linearly with the soil esp for silty clay r 2 0 93 fig 6 the ksinitial decreased linearly with soil esp for silt loam and silty clay r 2 0 83 and 0 92 respectively there were parabolic correlations between sf and soil esp r 2 0 45 and 0 52 respectively 6 3 model validation the variations in runoff rate with cumulative rainfall for the 70 slope gradient were well predicated by ssem fig 7 ssem overpredicted the runoff rates for l4 and l5 given that the cumulative rainfall was between 60 and 80 mm but the runoff rates for the other treatments were well predicted the runoff rate curves for l4 l5 and c1 for a 70 slope gradient were relatively more poorly modeled than those of the other treatments as indicated by the comparatively high values of mae rmse and emax the absolute values of crm and the low cns cd and r 2 values table 7 the error values for the other treatments were reasonable for example the range of rmse for the other treatments was 0 12 0 38 the range of cns was 0 80 0 93 and the range of r 2 was 0 83 0 99 ssem poorly modeled the sediment loss curves for l2 and l3 fig 8 and largely underestimated the values of sediment loss for l2 l3 and c1 given that the cumulative rainfall amounts were between 60 and 80 mm which resulted in the comparatively high values for mae rmse emax the absolute values of crm and the low cns cd and r 2 values table 8 for the other treatments the sediment loss curve predictions well matched those obtained by measurement fig 8 for example mae ranged from 12 98 to 19 85 for silt loam and 0 38 0 88 for silty clay the rmse values were between 0 59 and 0 71 for silt loam and 0 37 0 56 and r 2 exceeded 0 80 for silt loam and 0 70 for silty clay as a result the errors in predicted sediment loss were generally reasonable in addition by comparing the mean predicated errors ssem better simulated the runoff and erosion processes of silty clay the runoff and erosion processes of saline sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non saline soils and soils with higher clay contents in addition the primary mathematical descriptions for saline sodic silt loam stemmed from research on nonsaline soils or soils with higher clay contents 8 5 6 4 comparison of the four concepts we further examined the model performances of four concepts dynamic ks and kτ case 1 ssem dynamic ks and constant kτ case 2 constant ks and dynamic kτ case 3 and constant ks and constant kτ case 4 the calibration and validation results for cases 2 3 and 4 are shown in figs s7 s9 of the supplementary materials the dynamic and constant ks methods both predicted the runoff processes very well for both soils but the dynamic ks method provided a more realistic estimate of the runoff processes than the constant ks method for silt loam table 9 although the errors using the dynamic ks method for silty clay were improved a little 1 20 rmse cns and r 2 using the dynamic ks method for silt loam were improved by 49 77 and 61 respectively the errors in the predicted erosion processes when employing the constant kτ method cases 2 and 4 were generally high and unreasonable the model performances for case 1 were slightly better than those for case 3 in comparison with case 4 case 1 improved rmse by 49 and r 2 by 114 for silt loam and rmse by 33 and r 2 by 65 for silty clay table 10 overall the results presented above demonstrate that the model which considers dynamic soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and erodibility can provide more reasonable predicted runoff and soil erosion results 7 discussion and conclusions we have shown a series of findings for saline sodic soil slope erosion processes liu et al 2015 she et al 2016 liu and she 2017a liu and she 2017b that lend strong support to the idea that saline sodic soil slope erosion processes are highly complex and depend on the characteristics of slope gradient rainfall intensity and sodicity levels the common result of these experiments was that as a whole the sediment loss kg m 2 h 1 initially increased to a peak value and then gradually decreased especially for high slope gradients and rainfall intensities which is consistent with observations from other studies fox and bryan 2000 dong et al 2012 assouline and ben hur 2006 mahmoodabadi and sajjadi 2016 initially the constant erodibility concept was used in the models to analyze this result contrary to our expectations the saline sodic soil erosion processes could not be simulated under the constant erodibility concept the saline sodic soil erosion processes remain uncertain for example to what extent if any is saline sodic soil erosion controlled by the presence or absence of aggregate disintegration clay dispersion and surface crusts stage 1 clay dispersion made the loose layer much more erodible the initial gravimetric soil water content was only 5 and the soil material was very dry as runoff began sodium saturation caused the physical separation of soil particles which resulted in sufficient distances between individual soil particles the repulsive forces between molecules exceeded the bonding forces clay dispersion occurred with the loose layer generally being much more erodible in addition the physical dispersion caused by the impacts of raindrops and infiltration water enhanced these processes stage 2 surface structure controlled the sediment supply first after the loose layer was flushed entrainment became more difficult as the soil material was lodged in downslope surface depressions which resulted in surface armoring second transport selectivity played an important role in sediment transport clay sized and silt sized particles were usually transported mainly as primary particles but the sand sized particles were left on the soil surface with the upper layer generally being less erodible shi et al 2013 finally surface crusting may be caused by the physical impact of rainfall and chemical dispersion the physical impact of rainfall made the soil surface more compact whereas the dispersed clay particles clogged soil pores shainberg and letey 1984 guarnieri et al 2005 pearson and bauder 2006 to some extent the dispersive effects of sodium may be greater than the effects of rainfall the process based erosion prediction models did not address the issue of temporal variations in erodibility during a rainfall event kinnell 2005 however there have been three typical studies that have treated this issue from the perspective of an empirical relationship hypothesis ziegler et al 2001 considered the dynamic erodibility using a step function that determined changing erodibility states over the course of a storm they substituted an empirical exponential decay function to simulate the typical sediment transport response for that step function ziegler et al 2002 curiously they indicated that the soil erodibility initially increased for a short time and then decreased as shown in fig 3 of ziegler et al 2002 but they ignored the transient growth in soil erodibility al hamdan et al 2015 applied the dynamic erodibility concept in which concentrated flow erodibility was set to decrease exponentially during a run off event to improve the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem in our study saline sodic soil erosion should be controlled by the presence or absence of aggregate disintegration clay dispersion and surface crust therefore a compatible approach taking into account all concepts constant erodibility decreasing erodibility and increasing decreasing erodibility was used by changing the model parameters using the mocom ua method after model calibration the increasing decreasing erodibility concept was accepted for saline sodic soil slope erosion our results have at least two major implications for soil and water conservation and coastal reclamation based on the sensitivity analysis and the relationships between soil sodicity and the model parameters ssem can be simplified to investigate the effects of soil sodicity effect agroecosystems second this study provides a holistic and complete solution for predicting runoff and sediment losses on saline sodic slope we should consider the issue of temporal variations in erodibility in the watershed scale model during

7319,the characterization of droughts and their impacts is very dependent on the time scale that is involved in order to obtain an overall drought assessment the cumulative effects of water deficits over different times need to be examined together for example the recently developed joint deficit index jdi is based on multivariate probabilities of precipitation over various time scales from 1 to 12 months and was constructed from empirical copulas in this paper we examine the gaussian copula model for the jdi we model the covariance across the temporal scales with a two parameter function that is commonly used in the specific context of spatial statistics or geostatistics the validity of the covariance models is demonstrated with long term precipitation series bootstrap experiments indicate that the gaussian copula model has advantages over the empirical copula method in the context of drought severity assessment i it is able to quantify droughts outside the range of the empirical copula ii provides adequate drought quantification and iii provides a better understanding of the uncertainty in the estimation keywords drought joint deficit index gaussian copula geostatistics 1 introduction drought is a major natural hazard with a serious impact on human societies and ecosystems at least 11 of the european population and 17 of its territory have been affected by water shortage and the total cost of droughts in europe over the past thirty years is estimated at eur 100 billion eea 2009 a review of drought definitions is given in wilhite and glantz 1985 where four different drought types are identified meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic drought drought severity can be assessed with indices that are updated at regular times and are based on present meteorological or hydro meteorological conditions for example the widely used palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 uses available precipitation and temperature data another example is the standardized precipitation index spi of mckee et al 1993 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 1985 as the primary meteorological drought index to be used because drought related impacts can be complex drought monitoring based on a single variable or index may be inadequate during the past decades a lot of attention has been paid to the combined use of multiple drought related variables and indices for overall drought assessment we refer to hao and singh 2015 for an exhaustive review for example the u s drought monitor svoboda 2002 produces maps of the overall drought condition and these are based on the integration of multiple drought indices the use of multivariate distributions for drought risk assessment is a relatively new development beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 the joint deficit index jdi of kao and govindaraju 2010 is a multivariate probability based drought index at time scales from 1 to 12 months in kao and govindaraju 2010 it was argued that empirical copulas for the 12 dimensional structure are reliable when the record lengths are quite large say more than 100 years however high quality long term series are scarce and it would be advantageous to have a flexible copula method at our disposal that extends consistently to shorter series this motivates us to investigate the performance of parametric copula models we use a gaussian copula model for the jdi in which the covariance matrix is specified by a flexible two parameter function we show that the dependence structure across the time scales can be greatly simplified by reformulating the problem in terms of the covariance functions from the methodology of spatial statistics 2 drought definitions 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 and is widely used to characterize meteorological droughts over a range of time scales e g 3 6 9 12 24 months let d i be the total precipitation of a certain month and the accumulated values 1 x w m i m w 1 m d i present the w monthly precipitation with respect to month m the main idea of mckee et al 1993 is to express drought severity in terms of the probability of the observed precipitation depth x w m let the precipitation depths be a realization of the random variable x w and f x w the cumulative distribution function i e f x w x w m pr x w x w m as is well known u w f x w x w is uniformly distributed on the interval 0 1 given the input variable x w m the spi at time scale w is computed by 2 spi w ϕ 1 u w where u w f x w x w m is the uniform transformed input variable and ϕ is the standard normal cdf as suggested by mckee et al 1993 f x w can be modeled by a two parameter gamma distribution the cases spi w 0 spi w 0 and spi w 0 indicate wet dry and normal conditions respectively for the w month window the spi can be applied in a similar way to snowpack staudinger et al 2014 streamflow nabaltis and tsakiris 2009 soil moisture sims et al 2002 and ground water bloomfield and marchant 2013 2 2 joint deficit index jdi kao and govindaraju 2010 propose an overall characterization of droughts by examining various temporal scales together by means of multivariate probabilities given accumulated precipitation x 1 m x 12 m with respect to a certain month and over 12 different time scales 1 12 months we need to estimate the multivariate probability pr x 1 x 1 m x 12 x 12 m the influence of marginal aspects on the dependence structure between x w s can be removed by transformation to uniform margins i e pr x 1 x 1 m x 12 x 12 m pr u 1 u 1 m u 12 u 12 m and observing that there is a unique function c such that 3 pr u 1 u 1 m u 12 u 12 m c u 1 m u 12 m the function c is the copula nelsen 2006 it contains complete information about the joint distribution apart from the marginal distributions the kendall distribution function 4 k c q pr c u 1 u 12 q maps multivariate data into one single value for a given q c u 1 m u 12 m the jdi is defined as 5 jdi ϕ 1 k c q kao and govindaraju 2010 employed empirical copulas which are defined as follows given n transformed data points u i u 1 i u 12 i i 1 n the corresponding empirical copula is defined as nelsen 2006 6 c n u 1 u 12 1 n i 1 n 1 u 1 i u 1 u 12 i u 12 however extreme droughts which are outside the observational range cannot be quantified with empirical copulas examples of parametric copulas such as the student t copula and gaussian copula are provided in the appendix of kao and govindaraju 2010 their results suggested that both copulas perform similarly for precipitation jdis since the evaluation of t student copulas is time consuming we selected the gaussian copula in our study 3 the gaussian copula model the gaussian copula c g can be expressed as 7 c g u 1 u 12 σ φ σ ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u 12 with φ σ the multivariate gaussian cdf with zero mean and positive definite covariance matrix σ from eq 2 it follows that the gaussian copula model for the jdi is the joint probability for the spis at time scales 1 12 months the covariances can be estimated empirically from the data however this does not ensure a positive definite resulting covariance matrix renard and lang 2007 furthermore empirical estimations can be physically inconsistent it may happen that for some elements ρ w w of σ the estimations satisfy ρ w w ρ w w for w w w in particular for shorter series our main aim is to overcome these issues by parameterizing the covariance matrix with a specified model we accomplish this by using covariance functions that are known to be positive definite and are commonly used in spatial statistics and geostatistics cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 we extend the random process y w ϕ 1 f x w x w to a continuous spatio temporal random process y w t as a function of accumulation time w and accumulation end time t since w is expressed in months and the number of days differs from month to month we define a month as a 30 day period in the model derivation to make the connection with spatial statistics we view y w t as a random process at location w see appendix a for a general description of random fields a common simplifying assumption for stationary spatial random fields is isotropicity which means that the spatial covariance structure depends only on the distance between two locations in practical applications one mostly uses the euclidean distance but this can never be suited for the present application it seems a reasonable assumption that the correlation between monthly and 2 monthly totals should be approximately equal to the correlation between 3 monthly and 6 monthly precipitation depths and so forth therefore we propose the logarithmic distance between w and w 8 h log w log w as a candidate model in section 6 1 the hypothesis that the covariance cov y w t y w t depends only on the logarithmic distance is shown to be statistically significant at least for w values within the practical range e g from 1 to 12 months this is equivalent to the assumption 9 cov y k w t y k w t cov y w t y w t we denote by ρ h cov y w t y w t the covariance function we summarize the commonly used standard covariance functions cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 the matérn family 10 ρ h 2 κ 1 γ κ 1 h σ κ k κ h σ σ 0 κ 0 in which k κ denotes a modified κ th order bessel function σ is the scale parameter and κ is the shape parameter the powered exponential family 11 ρ h exp h σ κ σ 0 0 κ 2 the exponential family 12 ρ h exp h σ σ 0 which is a particular case of the matérn and powered exponential family for κ 0 5 and κ 1 respectively 4 variogram based estimation the variogram of the stochastic process y w t is 13 γ w w 1 2 var y w t y w t for the isotropic case and given that var y w t 1 eq 13 simplifies to 14 γ h 1 ρ h it can be seen that the variogram and the covariance function are theoretically equivalent but a variogram based analysis offers a number of advantages especially when the data locations form an irregular design for details see cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 given n transformed data points y i y 1 i y 12 i i 1 n the empirical variogram is given by 15 γ w w 1 2 n i 1 n y w i y w i 2 which for an isotropic model results in 16 γ h 1 n h w w n h γ w w where n h denotes the set of pairs w w such that the distance equals h and n h is the number of pairs in the set n h parameter estimation of the correlation functions eqs 10 12 is performed with the ordinary least squares method this estimates the parameters θ to minimize the objective function 17 s θ k 1 n γ h k γ h k θ 2 where γ h θ is the theoretical variogram and n the number of different h values model selection criteria are needed to decide which covariance model eqs 10 12 should be preferred we use the akaike information criterion aic defined as 18 aic 2 n p n ln s θ where n p is the number of model parameters the best model has the lowest aic value 5 data we selected four high quality long term daily precipitation series with at least 100 years of data the stations are located in uccle belgium marseille france milan italy and st petersburg russian federation the uccle series was collected by the royal meteorological institute of belgium rmi and the other series were obtained from the european climate assessment dataset klein tank et al 2002 we summarize the station characteristics in table 1 as in kao and govindaraju 2010 when fitting the marginal distributions of x w the problem of auto correlation and seasonal variability in the data can be resolved by collecting x w m annually for each month the 2 parameter gamma distribution was fitted to x w m separately for each w and each month the goodness of fit was assessed with the cramer von mises test the anderson darling test and the kolmogorv smirnov test at the 5 significance level it was found that the kolmogorv smirnov test only rejected two accumulated series w 5 and w 6 for the month september station uccle consequently the tests lend support to the 2 parameter gamma model for the marginals next once a distribution f x w m was fitted to x w m the application of the transformation u w m f x w m x w m results in uniform transformed data points u i u 1 i u 12 i with i 1 12 n y n y number of years finally normally transformed data y i ϕ 1 u i was obtained 6 results and discussion 6 1 isotropicity as explained in appendix a to check the isotropicity of one dimensional random fields it is sufficient to test for stationarity we used the test of jun and genton 2012 for stationarity of spatial or spatio temporal fields they considered cases where the spatial domain is planar or spherical but the results also apply to one dimensional domains the basic idea is described in appendix a and consists of dividing the spatial domain into two disjoint domains and to use the test statistic that is based on the differences between empirical estimators of covariances at given lags from the sub domains the actual dataset consists of 12 series of normally transformed accumulated precipitation depths 1 12 months which however do not give a sufficient number of pairs whose points share the same distance therefore we extend the dataset to accumulation times w 25 30 35 365 days where accumulation end times correspond with the end of a month this gives rise to 69 series of normally transformed accumulated precipitation depths we consider 1000 randomly sampled divisions of two disjoint domains for each division we search for h values for which there are a sufficient high number of pairs whose points have distance h in the terminology of appendix a this defines space time lags k h u we only consider time lag u 0 because we are only concerned with spatial covariances next we compute the test statistic t l eq a 3 where l refers to the number of lags jun and genton 2012 proved that t l is asymptotically χ 2 distributed with degrees of freedom l under the null hypothesis that the random field is stationary it turned out that for the following percentage of the different divisions stationarity was accepted at the 5 significance level 92 3 uccle 93 7 marseille 93 3 milan and 91 7 st petersburg 6 2 estimation and validation the estimation results listed in table 2 indicate that the powered exponential covariance model is the best choice the empirical and theoretical variogram are shown in fig 1 the corresponding covariance matrices are given in tables b 6 and b 7 of appendix b it can be seen that for uccle and st petersburg the precipitation marginals have a comparable level of temporal correlation on the other hand in marseille the correlation decays faster for increasing h values the case of milan tends to be in the middle of the two the goodness of fit was assessed by comparing the empirical copula with the gaussian copula evaluated at the transformed data points u i u i 1 u i 12 i 1 n denote by σ the estimated covariance matrix and c g u i c g u i σ the estimated gaussian copula the goodness of fit can be visualized by plotting the empirical copula c n u i against the gaussian copula c g u i i 1 n see fig 2 the model works well because the points lie close to the unit diagonal to have an idea of the overall performance we used the following goodness of fit scores table 3 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse bias and maximum error max kao and govindaraju 2010 reported a rmse of 0 0083 for the gaussian copula with empirically estimated covariances which is of the same order of magnitude 6 3 sensitivity to sample size the advantage of a parametric copula method is that it should extend in a consistent way to shorter data series having confirmed the validity of the new method for long term series we now evaluate the effect of the data size on the estimation ideally one needs at least 20 30 years of monthly values for the spi calculation with 50 60 years or more being optimal and preferred wmo 1985 the two main sources of uncertainty in the new methodology are estimation of i the margins and ii the dependence structure between the margins we applied a bootstrap procedure to calculate measures of uncertainty associated with the correlation functions a bootstrap sample was obtained by resampling of the years with replacement from a subseries of the original dataset e g the last 30 years 40 years for each sample an estimate of the parameters σ and κ was computed this process was repeated a large number of times typically 103 or 104 times which provided a sample distribution of the parameter estimates given a significance level α the 1 α confidence bounds are then the α 2 and 1 α 2 quantiles of the sample distribution a commonly used level is α 0 05 in fig 3 we show the covariance parameter estimates as a function of the number of years of data in addition the 0 95 confidence intervals are plotted the bootstrap methodology also directly provided uncertainty estimates for the powered exponential correlation function ρ h see fig 4 for the case h 2 it can be seen that for time windows larger than 40 60 years the estimations are more or less stable 6 4 drought category estimation empirical versus gaussian copula we consider the categories used in the u s drought monitor svoboda 2002 this includes abnormally dry d0 moderate drought d1 severe drought d2 extreme drought d3 and exceptional drought d4 table 4 shows the range of spi values along with their probabilities of occurrence and corresponding drought conditions see also kao and govindaraju 2010 we assessed and compared the ability of the copula models to categorize droughts as follows according to the usual practice the dataset on which the copula model is fitted i e the training set is different from the dataset on which the fitted model calculates the jdi values i e the validation set we considered the entire long term precipitation series table 1 as the validation set the resampled series obtained in section 6 3 were used here as training sets finally for each copula model we counted how many jdi values fall into each drought category we repeated this process 1000 times and we recorded the average occurrence of the jdi values per drought category fig 5 the results are shown for 50 year training sets but other sample sizes 20 100 years gave nearly the same results a necessary condition for the copula models to be eligible for drought quantification is that these percentages correspond to the drought categories d0 d4 table 1 both copulas work sufficiently well for d0 droughts the more severe the drought the worse the performance of the empirical copula in particular several extreme droughts are outside the range of the resampled empirical copulas giving rise to undefined jdi values to give an idea a 50 year training set gives on average 5 8 undefined jdi values for the validation set in contrast the gaussian copula works better but tends to slightly overestimate extreme d3 and exceptional droughts d4 another important aspect to investigate is the standard error of the jdi estimations we selected four drought events in uccle each belonging to a different drought category november 1940 d1 september 1973 d2 october 1911 d3 and september 1959 d4 the confidence intervals of the corresponding jdi estimations were obtained through the foregoing resampling procedure in fig 6 we plotted the jdi estimations as a function of the number of observation years together with the 0 95 confidence intervals for series with 40 years of data or longer the jdi estimations appear to be relatively stable for cases where the drought event was outside the range of the empirical copula the jdi could not be computed the greater the drought or the smaller the dataset the greater the probability that this will happen for this reason it was not always possible to obtain the confidence intervals of the empirical copula based jdi in such a case we tried to gain insight in the degree of uncertainty by using the following criterion the confidence interval is computed only if less than 10 of the total number of jdi samples are undefined the choice of 10 is not motivated by theoretical issues and is rather arbitrary in spite of this rule assessment of uncertainty of the estimation of d0 d1 droughts could only be made for series of moderate length say 50 year or longer for greater droughts d2 d4 confidence intervals could not be determined for the gaussian copula we can produce confidence intervals without difficulty confidence intervals of jdi estimations are not often entirely contained within one drought category which may complicate the drought severity assessment for more than 60 years of data the confidence intervals are covered by two adjacent drought categories and sometimes by a negligible fraction of a third category although uncertainties of this order of magnitude are unavoidable they do not greatly affect the assessment of drought severity 6 5 a case study for uccle precipitation an illustration of the copula based jdi for the uccle precipitation series is shown in fig 7 we added the normal quantiles of the drought categories to the jdi plots we considered both the empirical and gaussian copulas the gaps in the graphs in year 1921 1986 1997 and 2007 are associated with undefined empirical copula based jdi values note that the copulas are fitted on the whole series so that the training set is equal to the validation set a situation which is different from the foregoing experiments an underestimation of severe drought by the empirical copula is thus not to be expected here we investigated whether the d4 droughts agree with major european drought events past european drought events from the 1950s to present are discussed in spinoni et al 2015 also an overview of major european drought events 1959 2007 is contained in the european drought reference edr database which is hosted by the website of the virtual european drought centre edc see www geo uio no edc in table 5 we list the year and jdi peaks of the d4 drought events 1950 present and the associated major european droughts the low jdi value of april 2007 deserves particular attention because the year 2007 was generally a wet year it could not be related to the 2007 drought of eastern europe see edr database the low jdi value is solely due to the fact that there was remarkably enough no precipitation observed during that month some major droughts included in the edr database correspond with a less severe classification for belgium in terms of the jdi the summer of 2003 for example was classified as d1 and thus does not stand out as particularly dry for the first part of the twentieth century few authors have examined european drought incidence because instrumental data at high spatial resolution are not available in van der schrier et al 2016 maps of the monthly palmer drought severity index pdsi have been calculated for the period of 1901 2002 for europe but they focused on summer moisture variability for a comparative study we selected the historical spi values of lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 at various time scales the driest years and peak jdi values in parenthesis are 1899 2 66 1921 1922 4 19 1929 2 62 1933 1934 2 25 1944 2 14 1949 2 66 and these dry periods agree well with the low spi values of south dalton yorkshire uk see fig 5 in lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 7 conclusion in this paper we investigated the possibility to model the jdi for drought characterization by the gaussian copula model we developed a parametric model for the covariance matrix of the gaussian copula unlike the sample covariance matrices the parameterized covariance matrices are consistent and positive definite by construction in our approach this allows us to apply the model to shorter time series in a consistent way more specifically we were able to describe the complex dependence of accumulated precipitation across different temporal scales by a simple and parsimonious model the main idea is to reformulate the problem as a spatial statistics problem by i defining the location of an accumulated rainfall process as the accumulation time and ii considering a suitable distance measure between two accumulation times we considered a suitable set of covariance functions with the

family to long term precipitation data the computation of gaussian copulas is cheap and the new estimation procedure is easy to implement sensitivity studies suggest that one needs at least 40 60 years of monthly values for a reliable copula based jdi computation there are a number of reasons to prefer the gaussian copula over the empirical copula first extreme droughts that are outside the

7319,the characterization of droughts and their impacts is very dependent on the time scale that is involved in order to obtain an overall drought assessment the cumulative effects of water deficits over different times need to be examined together for example the recently developed joint deficit index jdi is based on multivariate probabilities of precipitation over various time scales from 1 to 12 months and was constructed from empirical copulas in this paper we examine the gaussian copula model for the jdi we model the covariance across the temporal scales with a two parameter function that is commonly used in the specific context of spatial statistics or geostatistics the validity of the covariance models is demonstrated with long term precipitation series bootstrap experiments indicate that the gaussian copula model has advantages over the empirical copula method in the context of drought severity assessment i it is able to quantify droughts outside the range of the empirical copula ii provides adequate drought quantification and iii provides a better understanding of the uncertainty in the estimation keywords drought joint deficit index gaussian copula geostatistics 1 introduction drought is a major natural hazard with a serious impact on human societies and ecosystems at least 11 of the european population and 17 of its territory have been affected by water shortage and the total cost of droughts in europe over the past thirty years is estimated at eur 100 billion eea 2009 a review of drought definitions is given in wilhite and glantz 1985 where four different drought types are identified meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic drought drought severity can be assessed with indices that are updated at regular times and are based on present meteorological or hydro meteorological conditions for example the widely used palmer drought severity index palmer 1965 uses available precipitation and temperature data another example is the standardized precipitation index spi of mckee et al 1993 which has been recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo 1985 as the primary meteorological drought index to be used because drought related impacts can be complex drought monitoring based on a single variable or index may be inadequate during the past decades a lot of attention has been paid to the combined use of multiple drought related variables and indices for overall drought assessment we refer to hao and singh 2015 for an exhaustive review for example the u s drought monitor svoboda 2002 produces maps of the overall drought condition and these are based on the integration of multiple drought indices the use of multivariate distributions for drought risk assessment is a relatively new development beersma and buishand 2004 kao and govindaraju 2010 the joint deficit index jdi of kao and govindaraju 2010 is a multivariate probability based drought index at time scales from 1 to 12 months in kao and govindaraju 2010 it was argued that empirical copulas for the 12 dimensional structure are reliable when the record lengths are quite large say more than 100 years however high quality long term series are scarce and it would be advantageous to have a flexible copula method at our disposal that extends consistently to shorter series this motivates us to investigate the performance of parametric copula models we use a gaussian copula model for the jdi in which the covariance matrix is specified by a flexible two parameter function we show that the dependence structure across the time scales can be greatly simplified by reformulating the problem in terms of the covariance functions from the methodology of spatial statistics 2 drought definitions 2 1 standardized precipitation index spi the spi was introduced by mckee et al 1993 and is widely used to characterize meteorological droughts over a range of time scales e g 3 6 9 12 24 months let d i be the total precipitation of a certain month and the accumulated values 1 x w m i m w 1 m d i present the w monthly precipitation with respect to month m the main idea of mckee et al 1993 is to express drought severity in terms of the probability of the observed precipitation depth x w m let the precipitation depths be a realization of the random variable x w and f x w the cumulative distribution function i e f x w x w m pr x w x w m as is well known u w f x w x w is uniformly distributed on the interval 0 1 given the input variable x w m the spi at time scale w is computed by 2 spi w ϕ 1 u w where u w f x w x w m is the uniform transformed input variable and ϕ is the standard normal cdf as suggested by mckee et al 1993 f x w can be modeled by a two parameter gamma distribution the cases spi w 0 spi w 0 and spi w 0 indicate wet dry and normal conditions respectively for the w month window the spi can be applied in a similar way to snowpack staudinger et al 2014 streamflow nabaltis and tsakiris 2009 soil moisture sims et al 2002 and ground water bloomfield and marchant 2013 2 2 joint deficit index jdi kao and govindaraju 2010 propose an overall characterization of droughts by examining various temporal scales together by means of multivariate probabilities given accumulated precipitation x 1 m x 12 m with respect to a certain month and over 12 different time scales 1 12 months we need to estimate the multivariate probability pr x 1 x 1 m x 12 x 12 m the influence of marginal aspects on the dependence structure between x w s can be removed by transformation to uniform margins i e pr x 1 x 1 m x 12 x 12 m pr u 1 u 1 m u 12 u 12 m and observing that there is a unique function c such that 3 pr u 1 u 1 m u 12 u 12 m c u 1 m u 12 m the function c is the copula nelsen 2006 it contains complete information about the joint distribution apart from the marginal distributions the kendall distribution function 4 k c q pr c u 1 u 12 q maps multivariate data into one single value for a given q c u 1 m u 12 m the jdi is defined as 5 jdi ϕ 1 k c q kao and govindaraju 2010 employed empirical copulas which are defined as follows given n transformed data points u i u 1 i u 12 i i 1 n the corresponding empirical copula is defined as nelsen 2006 6 c n u 1 u 12 1 n i 1 n 1 u 1 i u 1 u 12 i u 12 however extreme droughts which are outside the observational range cannot be quantified with empirical copulas examples of parametric copulas such as the student t copula and gaussian copula are provided in the appendix of kao and govindaraju 2010 their results suggested that both copulas perform similarly for precipitation jdis since the evaluation of t student copulas is time consuming we selected the gaussian copula in our study 3 the gaussian copula model the gaussian copula c g can be expressed as 7 c g u 1 u 12 σ φ σ ϕ 1 u 1 ϕ 1 u 12 with φ σ the multivariate gaussian cdf with zero mean and positive definite covariance matrix σ from eq 2 it follows that the gaussian copula model for the jdi is the joint probability for the spis at time scales 1 12 months the covariances can be estimated empirically from the data however this does not ensure a positive definite resulting covariance matrix renard and lang 2007 furthermore empirical estimations can be physically inconsistent it may happen that for some elements ρ w w of σ the estimations satisfy ρ w w ρ w w for w w w in particular for shorter series our main aim is to overcome these issues by parameterizing the covariance matrix with a specified model we accomplish this by using covariance functions that are known to be positive definite and are commonly used in spatial statistics and geostatistics cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 we extend the random process y w ϕ 1 f x w x w to a continuous spatio temporal random process y w t as a function of accumulation time w and accumulation end time t since w is expressed in months and the number of days differs from month to month we define a month as a 30 day period in the model derivation to make the connection with spatial statistics we view y w t as a random process at location w see appendix a for a general description of random fields a common simplifying assumption for stationary spatial random fields is isotropicity which means that the spatial covariance structure depends only on the distance between two locations in practical applications one mostly uses the euclidean distance but this can never be suited for the present application it seems a reasonable assumption that the correlation between monthly and 2 monthly totals should be approximately equal to the correlation between 3 monthly and 6 monthly precipitation depths and so forth therefore we propose the logarithmic distance between w and w 8 h log w log w as a candidate model in section 6 1 the hypothesis that the covariance cov y w t y w t depends only on the logarithmic distance is shown to be statistically significant at least for w values within the practical range e g from 1 to 12 months this is equivalent to the assumption 9 cov y k w t y k w t cov y w t y w t we denote by ρ h cov y w t y w t the covariance function we summarize the commonly used standard covariance functions cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 the matérn family 10 ρ h 2 κ 1 γ κ 1 h σ κ k κ h σ σ 0 κ 0 in which k κ denotes a modified κ th order bessel function σ is the scale parameter and κ is the shape parameter the powered exponential family 11 ρ h exp h σ κ σ 0 0 κ 2 the exponential family 12 ρ h exp h σ σ 0 which is a particular case of the matérn and powered exponential family for κ 0 5 and κ 1 respectively 4 variogram based estimation the variogram of the stochastic process y w t is 13 γ w w 1 2 var y w t y w t for the isotropic case and given that var y w t 1 eq 13 simplifies to 14 γ h 1 ρ h it can be seen that the variogram and the covariance function are theoretically equivalent but a variogram based analysis offers a number of advantages especially when the data locations form an irregular design for details see cressie 1993 diggle and ribeiro 2007 given n transformed data points y i y 1 i y 12 i i 1 n the empirical variogram is given by 15 γ w w 1 2 n i 1 n y w i y w i 2 which for an isotropic model results in 16 γ h 1 n h w w n h γ w w where n h denotes the set of pairs w w such that the distance equals h and n h is the number of pairs in the set n h parameter estimation of the correlation functions eqs 10 12 is performed with the ordinary least squares method this estimates the parameters θ to minimize the objective function 17 s θ k 1 n γ h k γ h k θ 2 where γ h θ is the theoretical variogram and n the number of different h values model selection criteria are needed to decide which covariance model eqs 10 12 should be preferred we use the akaike information criterion aic defined as 18 aic 2 n p n ln s θ where n p is the number of model parameters the best model has the lowest aic value 5 data we selected four high quality long term daily precipitation series with at least 100 years of data the stations are located in uccle belgium marseille france milan italy and st petersburg russian federation the uccle series was collected by the royal meteorological institute of belgium rmi and the other series were obtained from the european climate assessment dataset klein tank et al 2002 we summarize the station characteristics in table 1 as in kao and govindaraju 2010 when fitting the marginal distributions of x w the problem of auto correlation and seasonal variability in the data can be resolved by collecting x w m annually for each month the 2 parameter gamma distribution was fitted to x w m separately for each w and each month the goodness of fit was assessed with the cramer von mises test the anderson darling test and the kolmogorv smirnov test at the 5 significance level it was found that the kolmogorv smirnov test only rejected two accumulated series w 5 and w 6 for the month september station uccle consequently the tests lend support to the 2 parameter gamma model for the marginals next once a distribution f x w m was fitted to x w m the application of the transformation u w m f x w m x w m results in uniform transformed data points u i u 1 i u 12 i with i 1 12 n y n y number of years finally normally transformed data y i ϕ 1 u i was obtained 6 results and discussion 6 1 isotropicity as explained in appendix a to check the isotropicity of one dimensional random fields it is sufficient to test for stationarity we used the test of jun and genton 2012 for stationarity of spatial or spatio temporal fields they considered cases where the spatial domain is planar or spherical but the results also apply to one dimensional domains the basic idea is described in appendix a and consists of dividing the spatial domain into two disjoint domains and to use the test statistic that is based on the differences between empirical estimators of covariances at given lags from the sub domains the actual dataset consists of 12 series of normally transformed accumulated precipitation depths 1 12 months which however do not give a sufficient number of pairs whose points share the same distance therefore we extend the dataset to accumulation times w 25 30 35 365 days where accumulation end times correspond with the end of a month this gives rise to 69 series of normally transformed accumulated precipitation depths we consider 1000 randomly sampled divisions of two disjoint domains for each division we search for h values for which there are a sufficient high number of pairs whose points have distance h in the terminology of appendix a this defines space time lags k h u we only consider time lag u 0 because we are only concerned with spatial covariances next we compute the test statistic t l eq a 3 where l refers to the number of lags jun and genton 2012 proved that t l is asymptotically χ 2 distributed with degrees of freedom l under the null hypothesis that the random field is stationary it turned out that for the following percentage of the different divisions stationarity was accepted at the 5 significance level 92 3 uccle 93 7 marseille 93 3 milan and 91 7 st petersburg 6 2 estimation and validation the estimation results listed in table 2 indicate that the powered exponential covariance model is the best choice the empirical and theoretical variogram are shown in fig 1 the corresponding covariance matrices are given in tables b 6 and b 7 of appendix b it can be seen that for uccle and st petersburg the precipitation marginals have a comparable level of temporal correlation on the other hand in marseille the correlation decays faster for increasing h values the case of milan tends to be in the middle of the two the goodness of fit was assessed by comparing the empirical copula with the gaussian copula evaluated at the transformed data points u i u i 1 u i 12 i 1 n denote by σ the estimated covariance matrix and c g u i c g u i σ the estimated gaussian copula the goodness of fit can be visualized by plotting the empirical copula c n u i against the gaussian copula c g u i i 1 n see fig 2 the model works well because the points lie close to the unit diagonal to have an idea of the overall performance we used the following goodness of fit scores table 3 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse bias and maximum error max kao and govindaraju 2010 reported a rmse of 0 0083 for the gaussian copula with empirically estimated covariances which is of the same order of magnitude 6 3 sensitivity to sample size the advantage of a parametric copula method is that it should extend in a consistent way to shorter data series having confirmed the validity of the new method for long term series we now evaluate the effect of the data size on the estimation ideally one needs at least 20 30 years of monthly values for the spi calculation with 50 60 years or more being optimal and preferred wmo 1985 the two main sources of uncertainty in the new methodology are estimation of i the margins and ii the dependence structure between the margins we applied a bootstrap procedure to calculate measures of uncertainty associated with the correlation functions a bootstrap sample was obtained by resampling of the years with replacement from a subseries of the original dataset e g the last 30 years 40 years for each sample an estimate of the parameters σ and κ was computed this process was repeated a large number of times typically 103 or 104 times which provided a sample distribution of the parameter estimates given a significance level α the 1 α confidence bounds are then the α 2 and 1 α 2 quantiles of the sample distribution a commonly used level is α 0 05 in fig 3 we show the covariance parameter estimates as a function of the number of years of data in addition the 0 95 confidence intervals are plotted the bootstrap methodology also directly provided uncertainty estimates for the powered exponential correlation function ρ h see fig 4 for the case h 2 it can be seen that for time windows larger than 40 60 years the estimations are more or less stable 6 4 drought category estimation empirical versus gaussian copula we consider the categories used in the u s drought monitor svoboda 2002 this includes abnormally dry d0 moderate drought d1 severe drought d2 extreme drought d3 and exceptional drought d4 table 4 shows the range of spi values along with their probabilities of occurrence and corresponding drought conditions see also kao and govindaraju 2010 we assessed and compared the ability of the copula models to categorize droughts as follows according to the usual practice the dataset on which the copula model is fitted i e the training set is different from the dataset on which the fitted model calculates the jdi values i e the validation set we considered the entire long term precipitation series table 1 as the validation set the resampled series obtained in section 6 3 were used here as training sets finally for each copula model we counted how many jdi values fall into each drought category we repeated this process 1000 times and we recorded the average occurrence of the jdi values per drought category fig 5 the results are shown for 50 year training sets but other sample sizes 20 100 years gave nearly the same results a necessary condition for the copula models to be eligible for drought quantification is that these percentages correspond to the drought categories d0 d4 table 1 both copulas work sufficiently well for d0 droughts the more severe the drought the worse the performance of the empirical copula in particular several extreme droughts are outside the range of the resampled empirical copulas giving rise to undefined jdi values to give an idea a 50 year training set gives on average 5 8 undefined jdi values for the validation set in contrast the gaussian copula works better but tends to slightly overestimate extreme d3 and exceptional droughts d4 another important aspect to investigate is the standard error of the jdi estimations we selected four drought events in uccle each belonging to a different drought category november 1940 d1 september 1973 d2 october 1911 d3 and september 1959 d4 the confidence intervals of the corresponding jdi estimations were obtained through the foregoing resampling procedure in fig 6 we plotted the jdi estimations as a function of the number of observation years together with the 0 95 confidence intervals for series with 40 years of data or longer the jdi estimations appear to be relatively stable for cases where the drought event was outside the range of the empirical copula the jdi could not be computed the greater the drought or the smaller the dataset the greater the probability that this will happen for this reason it was not always possible to obtain the confidence intervals of the empirical copula based jdi in such a case we tried to gain insight in the degree of uncertainty by using the following criterion the confidence interval is computed only if less than 10 of the total number of jdi samples are undefined the choice of 10 is not motivated by theoretical issues and is rather arbitrary in spite of this rule assessment of uncertainty of the estimation of d0 d1 droughts could only be made for series of moderate length say 50 year or longer for greater droughts d2 d4 confidence intervals could not be determined for the gaussian copula we can produce confidence intervals without difficulty confidence intervals of jdi estimations are not often entirely contained within one drought category which may complicate the drought severity assessment for more than 60 years of data the confidence intervals are covered by two adjacent drought categories and sometimes by a negligible fraction of a third category although uncertainties of this order of magnitude are unavoidable they do not greatly affect the assessment of drought severity 6 5 a case study for uccle precipitation an illustration of the copula based jdi for the uccle precipitation series is shown in fig 7 we added the normal quantiles of the drought categories to the jdi plots we considered both the empirical and gaussian copulas the gaps in the graphs in year 1921 1986 1997 and 2007 are associated with undefined empirical copula based jdi values note that the copulas are fitted on the whole series so that the training set is equal to the validation set a situation which is different from the foregoing experiments an underestimation of severe drought by the empirical copula is thus not to be expected here we investigated whether the d4 droughts agree with major european drought events past european drought events from the 1950s to present are discussed in spinoni et al 2015 also an overview of major european drought events 1959 2007 is contained in the european drought reference edr database which is hosted by the website of the virtual european drought centre edc see www geo uio no edc in table 5 we list the year and jdi peaks of the d4 drought events 1950 present and the associated major european droughts the low jdi value of april 2007 deserves particular attention because the year 2007 was generally a wet year it could not be related to the 2007 drought of eastern europe see edr database the low jdi value is solely due to the fact that there was remarkably enough no precipitation observed during that month some major droughts included in the edr database correspond with a less severe classification for belgium in terms of the jdi the summer of 2003 for example was classified as d1 and thus does not stand out as particularly dry for the first part of the twentieth century few authors have examined european drought incidence because instrumental data at high spatial resolution are not available in van der schrier et al 2016 maps of the monthly palmer drought severity index pdsi have been calculated for the period of 1901 2002 for europe but they focused on summer moisture variability for a comparative study we selected the historical spi values of lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 at various time scales the driest years and peak jdi values in parenthesis are 1899 2 66 1921 1922 4 19 1929 2 62 1933 1934 2 25 1944 2 14 1949 2 66 and these dry periods agree well with the low spi values of south dalton yorkshire uk see fig 5 in lloyd hughes and saunders 2002 7 conclusion in this paper we investigated the possibility to model the jdi for drought characterization by the gaussian copula model we developed a parametric model for the covariance matrix of the gaussian copula unlike the sample covariance matrices the parameterized covariance matrices are consistent and positive definite by construction in our approach this allows us to apply the model to shorter time series in a consistent way more specifically we were able to describe the complex dependence of accumulated precipitation across different temporal scales by a simple and parsimonious model the main idea is to reformulate the problem as a spatial statistics problem by i defining the location of an accumulated rainfall process as the accumulation time and ii considering a suitable distance measure between two accumulation times we considered a suitable set of covariance functions with the appropriate properties of being positive definite and monotonically decreasing with the distance a variogram based analysis shows an excellent fit of the two parameter powered exponential matérn
