t i x m i s i where ti is biological toxicity value of a heavy metal the ti values are as co ni cu pb 5 mn fe zn 1 cr 2 hakanson et al 1980 3 results and discussions 3 1 spatial distribution of heavy metals in groundwater samples all parameters are in μg l except ph standard unit tds and doc mg l bdl below detection limit heavy metals tds doc and ph during the pre monsoon monsoon seasons are presented in table 2 descriptive statistical analysis showed that the ph of the groundwater ranged from near neutral 6 39 to alkaline 8 34 during pre monsoon and acidic 5 26 to near neutral 7 29 during monsoon seasons one open well in the pre monsoon and fourteen open wells in the monsoon seasons ph were not within the permissible limit of drinking water who 2011 bis 2012 spatial distribution maps fig 2a and c show that acidic ph was observed in the southeastern part during the pre monsoon season and the eastern part during monsoon season the dissolution of minerals present in the granitic rock leads to acidic ph in the monsoon season the ph values largely varied between the seasons due to high rainfall recharge in the monsoon and high evaporation in the pre monsoon season the tds value in the study area ranged between 30 40 and 374 10 mg l during the monsoon season all the samples were within the permissible limits suggested by drinking water standards in both seasons the wells located in the southwestern part of the study area were showed high tds value in both the seasons fig 2b and d this may be due to the influence of saltwater as this portion of the study area is near the coast the tds during the monsoon season was less than the pre monsoon season due to significant dilution process from the rainfall laluraj and gopinath 2006 the mean concentration of doc in the collected groundwater samples was 0 9 mg l in the pre monsoon and 0 52 mg l in the monsoon the maximum values were 3 37 and 3 30 mg l during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively it indicates that organic matter is rare and aerobic environment in the aquifer is substantiated the mean concentration of heavy metals in groundwater samples decreased in the following order mn al fe zn cu ni co cr pb aluminum al concentration ranged from 0 54 to 257 μg l during pre monsoon the maximum concentration observed in the monsoon season was 287 μg l the mean value was higher in monsoon than pre monsoon this is due to the leaching of aluminum from the lateritic soil to the groundwater fig 3a and e showed that two open wells exceeded the prescribed limits of drinking water standard in both seasons the maximum concentration of chromium cr was 1 84 and 1 53 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively all the groundwater samples were within the permissible limit chromium was detected in six samples in pre monsoon and 11 samples in monsoon season more samples had cr in the monsoon because it leaches from the soil during the infiltration process karthikeyan et al 2021 manganese mn concentration ranged from 0 78 to 1614 μg l during pre monsoon and 9 49 687 μg l during monsoon season the mean concentration was higher in pre monsoon than monsoon season three samples in pre monsoon fig 3b and two samples in monsoon season fig 3f exceeded the permissible limit of drinking water these groundwater wells may be contaminated from sewage sridhar et al 2014 the maximum value of iron concentration was 95 9 μg l during pre monsoon and 37 9 μg l during monsoon season spatial distribution map fig 3c g showed that fe concentration was high in most of the open wells during pre monsoon and decreased in the monsoon but all the samples were within the permissible limits dilution of the groundwater during the infiltration process in the monsoon season leads to a decrease in fe concentration mn and fe have similar geochemical behavior and found abundantly in the soil zhang et al 2020 therefore spatial distribution of mn and fe were showing similar trend with high concentration in north west region of the study area tds was also high under the influence of saltwater leading to high ionic strength and low activity coefficient this condition will increase the dissolution of mn and fe in groundwater the maximum concentration of cobalt co was 17 2 and 4 38 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively fig 3d h revealed that high concentrations of co were found to be more in locations where fertilizers were used extensively vetrimuru hgan et al 2017 nickel ni concentration was nearly similar in both the seasons with mean concentration 1 72 μg l in pre monsoon and 1 69 μg l in monsoon fig 4a d the sources of nickel in the study area include effluents from the sewage treatment plant lu et al 2018 the maximum concentration of copper cu was 59 3 μg l in pre monsoon and 20 3 μg l in monsoon seasons fig 4b e shows that spatial distribution pattern of metal was similar in both the seasons high concentrations were observed in the northern part of the study area the possible sources of copper are from the rampant usage of fertilizers and pesticides magesh et al 2017 zinc zn concentration was maximum in monsoon 37 3 μg l than pre monsoon season 30 3 μg l four wells showed a high concentration of zinc and all other wells showed moderate concentration in pre monsoon fig 4c whereas in monsoon season the northern part of the wells were identified as high zinc concentration areas fig 4f zinc concentration is high in the monsoon season due to domestic and agricultural run off infiltrating the groundwater karthikeyan et al 2021 lead pb was not present in all the collected groundwater samples the mean concentration of pb was 0 10 μg l and 0 13 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively co ni cu zn and pb were within the permissible limit in all the groundwater samples cadmium cd was not detected in any of the collected groundwater samples 3 2 pollution level assessment the pollution indices result is listed in table 3 hpi values in the pre monsoon season are higher than in the monsoon season all the samples in both the seasons fall in low category except one sample hpi calculated for sample number 16 kadekar was 41 9 in pre monsoon season which is moderately polluted this could be due to the higher concentrations of mn and co which exceeded the permissible limits in drinking water due to leak in the adjoining soak pit the sampling well s16 has been contaminated hei distribution in the groundwater sample is similar to hpi values based on the classification hei values in all the samples fall into the low category 3 3 human health risk assessment 3 3 1 non carcinogenic risk human non carcinogenic health risk hq and hi of groundwater for infants adults and children during both the seasons are represented in fig 5 hq and hi value 1 is acceptable and 1 is considered as a potential risk for non carcinogenic health effects vetrimurugan et al 2016 nyambura et al 2020 hq values for al cr mn fe ni cu zn and pb were 1 in three different age groups adults children and infants during pre monsoon however hq values of cobalt in adults s16 and s19 children s2 s16 and s19 and infants s16 were 1 this imposes potential human health risk in users of the open wells that found to be hq 1 during monsoon season all the heavy metals in adults and infants found to be hq 1 the spatial distribution of hi fig 5a b and c revealed that children were more prone to non carcinogenic health risk than adults and infants in the pre monsoon season fig 5d e f suggests that no severe potential health risk was identified in the study area during monsoon except one open well in children 3 3 2 carcinogenic risk the standard range of carcinogenic risk values is 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 lu et al 2015 sheng et al 2020 nyambura et al 2020 raja et al 2021 carcinogenic health risk assessment of heavy metals in collected samples is represented in table 4 8 of the samples in pre monsoon season and 20 of samples in monsoon season were in moderate carcinogenic risk the result suggests that children in the study area are more vulnerable to cancer than adults and infants the moderate cancer risk prone wells should require attention the carcinogenic risk is mainly due to cr and ni contamination the cr values showing potential risk are represented in bold 3 4 ecological risk assessment of groundwater the ecological risk index values classify the groundwater into four groups eri 110 low risk 110 eri 200 moderate risk 200 eri 400 considerable risk eri 400 very high risk sharifi et al 2016 maskooni et al 2020 alfaifi et al 2021 the eri evaluation revealed that all the groundwater in both seasons was under low ecological risk fig 6 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis 3 5 1 pearson correlation pearson correlation was performed to understand the relationship among the heavy metals in pre monsoon and monsoon seasons table 5 heavy metals such as cr and pb were below the detection limit in few groundwater samples this led to an unclear relationship with those heavy metals based on the correlation coefficient values the correlation can be high 0 5 1 moderate 0 3 0 49 or low 0 29 0 09 all the values are found to be positive which indicates that both the variables can decrease or increase together a positive correlation between manganese and iron was noticed in the monsoon season it indicates that both are derived from geogenic sources in the pre monsoon season cobalt showed a strong correlation with manganese cobalt had correlation with aluminum and manganese in the monsoon season nickel showed correlation with aluminum cobalt in pre monsoon and aluminum manganese and cobalt in monsoon season copper had a correlation with aluminum and nickel in pre monsoon zinc showed correlation with nickel copper in pre monsoon and aluminum copper in monsoon season lead showed correlation with aluminum nickel copper zinc in pre monsoon and aluminum cobalt zinc in monsoon season the correlation between the pairs of metals suggests a common origin of the metals tariq et al 2008 chabukdhara et al 2017 ph was negatively correlating with zinc it indicates acidic environment is suitable for the release of zinc 3 5 2 factor analysis bartlett s test of sphericity value was ρ 0 001 whereas kaiser meyer olkin kmo test indicated value of 0 824 which indicated variables were fit for factor analysis jayathunga et al 2020 varimax orthogonal rotation method was used to support the components and simplify the variables into small number of components emenike et al 2020 raja et al 2021 a total of four components with eigen values 1 were extracted for groundwater in the pre monsoon season components 1 2 3 and 4 accounts for 33 8 18 4 16 6 and 8 6 of the total variances respectively table 6 component 1 showed a strong correlation with al ni cu zn and pb these are primarily derived from chemical fertilizers and pesticides wagh et al 2018 component 2 showed high loading on mn and fe indicating geogenic sources component 3 showed a correlation between ph and tds this suggests that tds play a significant role in change in the ph component 4 showed a strong correlation with chromium as it was not present in all the samples in the monsoon season total three components with an eigen value 1 were extracted for groundwater the percentage of variance for components 1 2 and 3 are 29 8 24 6 and 20 9 respectively component 1 showed a strong correlation with al cu zn and pb these may be derived from the pesticides and fertilizers used in agricultural activity alfaifi et al 2021 component 2 strongly correlates with mn fe ph and tds mn and fe may be due to dissolution from the soil during the rainwater infiltration process component 3 showed a strong correlation with cr co and ni this could be due to the influence of effluents of sewage treatment plants in the study area 4 conclusions heavy metals in the selected groundwaters of shallow hard rock aquifers in southwestern india were studied to evaluate heavy metals and assess human health risk the present study reported that slightly acidic ph was observed in the monsoon season few groundwater samples have high al mn and zn beyond the prescribed limits of drinking water standards the hpi estimation concluded that heavy metal pollution was detected only at the station kadekar s16 human health risk assessment revealed that children are more vulnerable to non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk than infants and adults in the study area moderate carcinogenic risk was observed in 20 and 8 of the monsoon and pre monsoon seasons samples respectively the study area poses a low ecological risk based on eri evaluation factor analysis suggests that heavy metal concentrations in groundwater are derived from both anthropogenic and geogenic sources anthropogenic sources mainly include agricultural activity leakage from soak pit and effluents from the sewage treatment plant the geostatistical interpolation method in gis provides pollution levels distributed spatially this will be helpful for decision makers to decide on the areas to be considered for water management plans the study recommends treatment of groundwater for drinking purposes since ingestion is the primary pathway for heavy metal exposures the sewage effluents should be properly treated and recycled before discharging into ecosystem this prevents potential human health risk associated with groundwater consumption future research scope to this study lies in soil groundwater interactions and the associated biogeochemical processes funding the first author thanks the manipal academy of higher education mahe for providing dr t m a pai phd fellowship mahe dreg mahescholar phd 2018 dated june 9

metals in groundwater samples all parameters are in μg l except ph standard unit tds and doc mg l bdl below detection limit heavy metals tds doc and ph during the pre monsoon monsoon seasons are presented in table 2 descriptive statistical analysis showed that the ph of the groundwater ranged from near neutral 6 39 to alkaline 8 34 during pre monsoon and acidic 5 26 to near neutral 7 29 during monsoon seasons one open well in the pre monsoon and fourteen open wells in the monsoon seasons ph were not within the permissible limit of drinking water who 2011 bis 2012 spatial distribution maps fig 2a and c show that acidic ph was observed in the southeastern part during the pre monsoon season and the eastern part during monsoon season the dissolution of minerals present in the granitic rock leads to acidic ph in the monsoon season the ph values largely varied between the seasons due to high rainfall recharge in the monsoon and high evaporation in the pre monsoon season the tds value in the study area ranged between 30 40 and 374 10 mg l during the monsoon season all the samples were within the permissible limits suggested by drinking water standards in both seasons the wells located in the southwestern part of the study area were showed high tds value in both the seasons fig 2b and d this may be due to the influence of saltwater as this portion of the study area is near the coast the tds during the monsoon season was less than the pre monsoon season due to significant dilution process from the rainfall laluraj and gopinath 2006 the mean concentration of doc in the collected groundwater samples was 0 9 mg l in the pre monsoon and 0 52 mg l in the monsoon the maximum values were 3 37 and 3 30 mg l during the pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively it indicates that organic matter is rare and aerobic environment in the aquifer is substantiated the mean concentration of heavy metals in groundwater samples decreased in the following order mn al fe zn cu ni co cr pb aluminum al concentration ranged from 0 54 to 257 μg l during pre monsoon the maximum concentration observed in the monsoon season was 287 μg l the mean value was higher in monsoon than pre monsoon this is due to the leaching of aluminum from the lateritic soil to the groundwater fig 3a and e showed that two open wells exceeded the prescribed limits of drinking water standard in both seasons the maximum concentration of chromium cr was 1 84 and 1 53 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively all the groundwater samples were within the permissible limit chromium was detected in six samples in pre monsoon and 11 samples in monsoon season more samples had cr in the monsoon because it leaches from the soil during the infiltration process karthikeyan et al 2021 manganese mn concentration ranged from 0 78 to 1614 μg l during pre monsoon and 9 49 687 μg l during monsoon season the mean concentration was higher in pre monsoon than monsoon season three samples in pre monsoon fig 3b and two samples in monsoon season fig 3f exceeded the permissible limit of drinking water these groundwater wells may be contaminated from sewage sridhar et al 2014 the maximum value of iron concentration was 95 9 μg l during pre monsoon and 37 9 μg l during monsoon season spatial distribution map fig 3c g showed that fe concentration was high in most of the open wells during pre monsoon and decreased in the monsoon but all the samples were within the permissible limits dilution of the groundwater during the infiltration process in the monsoon season leads to a decrease in fe concentration mn and fe have similar geochemical behavior and found abundantly in the soil zhang et al 2020 therefore spatial distribution of mn and fe were showing similar trend with high concentration in north west region of the study area tds was also high under the influence of saltwater leading to high ionic strength and low activity coefficient this condition will increase the dissolution of mn and fe in groundwater the maximum concentration of cobalt co was 17 2 and 4 38 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively fig 3d h revealed that high concentrations of co were found to be more in locations where fertilizers were used extensively vetrimuru hgan et al 2017 nickel ni concentration was nearly similar in both the seasons with mean concentration 1 72 μg l in pre monsoon and 1 69 μg l in monsoon fig 4a d the sources of nickel in the study area include effluents from the sewage treatment plant lu et al 2018 the maximum concentration of copper cu was 59 3 μg l in pre monsoon and 20 3 μg l in monsoon seasons fig 4b e shows that spatial distribution pattern of metal was similar in both the seasons high concentrations were observed in the northern part of the study area the possible sources of copper are from the rampant usage of fertilizers and pesticides magesh et al 2017 zinc zn concentration was maximum in monsoon 37 3 μg l than pre monsoon season 30 3 μg l four wells showed a high concentration of zinc and all other wells showed moderate concentration in pre monsoon fig 4c whereas in monsoon season the northern part of the wells were identified as high zinc concentration areas fig 4f zinc concentration is high in the monsoon season due to domestic and agricultural run off infiltrating the groundwater karthikeyan et al 2021 lead pb was not present in all the collected groundwater samples the mean concentration of pb was 0 10 μg l and 0 13 μg l during pre monsoon and monsoon seasons respectively co ni cu zn and pb were within the permissible limit in all the groundwater samples cadmium cd was not detected in any of the collected groundwater samples 3 2 pollution level assessment the pollution indices result is listed in table 3 hpi values in the pre monsoon season are higher than in the monsoon season all the samples in both the seasons fall in low category except one sample hpi calculated for sample number 16 kadekar was 41 9 in pre monsoon season which is moderately polluted this could be due to the higher concentrations of mn and co which exceeded the permissible limits in drinking water due to leak in the adjoining soak pit the sampling well s16 has been contaminated hei distribution in the groundwater sample is similar to hpi values based on the classification hei values in all the samples fall into the low category 3 3 human health risk assessment 3 3 1 non carcinogenic risk human non carcinogenic health risk hq and hi of groundwater for infants adults and children during both the seasons are represented in fig 5 hq and hi value 1 is acceptable and 1 is considered as a potential risk for non carcinogenic health effects vetrimurugan et al 2016 nyambura et al 2020 hq values for al cr mn fe ni cu zn and pb were 1 in three different age groups adults children and infants during pre monsoon however hq values of cobalt in adults s16 and s19 children s2 s16 and s19 and infants s16 were 1 this imposes potential human health risk in users of the open wells that found to be hq 1 during monsoon season all the heavy metals in adults and infants found to be hq 1 the spatial distribution of hi fig 5a b and c revealed that children were more prone to non carcinogenic health risk than adults and infants in the pre monsoon season fig 5d e f suggests that no severe potential health risk was identified in the study area during monsoon except one open well in children 3 3 2 carcinogenic risk the standard range of carcinogenic risk values is 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 lu et al 2015 sheng et al 2020 nyambura et al 2020 raja et al 2021 carcinogenic health risk assessment of heavy metals in collected samples is represented in table 4 8 of the samples in pre monsoon season and 20 of samples in monsoon season were in moderate carcinogenic risk the result suggests that children in the study area are more vulnerable to cancer than adults and infants the moderate cancer risk prone wells should require attention the carcinogenic risk is mainly due to cr and ni contamination the cr values showing potential risk are represented in bold 3 4 ecological risk assessment of groundwater the ecological risk index values classify the groundwater into four groups eri 110 low risk 110 eri 200 moderate risk 200 eri 400 considerable risk eri 400 very high risk sharifi et al 2016 maskooni et al 2020 alfaifi et al 2021 the eri evaluation revealed that all the groundwater in both seasons was under low ecological risk fig 6 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis 3 5 1 pearson correlation pearson correlation was performed to understand the relationship among the heavy metals in pre monsoon and monsoon seasons table 5 heavy metals such as cr and pb were below the detection limit in few groundwater samples this led to an unclear relationship with those heavy metals based on the correlation coefficient values the correlation can be high 0 5 1 moderate 0 3 0 49 or low 0 29 0 09 all the values are found to be positive which indicates that both the variables can decrease or increase together a positive correlation between manganese and iron was noticed in the monsoon season it indicates that both are derived from geogenic sources in the pre monsoon season cobalt showed a strong correlation with manganese cobalt had correlation with aluminum and manganese in the monsoon season nickel showed correlation with aluminum cobalt in pre monsoon and aluminum manganese and cobalt in monsoon season copper had a correlation with aluminum and nickel in pre monsoon zinc showed correlation with nickel copper in pre monsoon and aluminum copper in monsoon season lead showed correlation with aluminum nickel copper zinc in pre monsoon and aluminum cobalt zinc in monsoon season the correlation between the pairs of metals suggests a common origin of the metals tariq et al 2008 chabukdhara et al 2017 ph was negatively correlating with zinc it indicates acidic environment is suitable for the release of zinc 3 5 2 factor analysis bartlett s test of sphericity value was ρ 0 001 whereas kaiser meyer olkin kmo test indicated value of 0 824 which indicated variables were fit for factor analysis jayathunga et al 2020 varimax orthogonal rotation method was used to support the components and simplify the variables into small number of components emenike et al 2020 raja et al 2021 a total of four components with eigen values 1 were extracted for groundwater in the pre monsoon season components 1 2 3 and 4 accounts for 33 8 18 4 16 6 and 8 6 of the total variances respectively table 6 component 1 showed a strong correlation with al ni cu zn and pb these are primarily derived from chemical fertilizers and pesticides wagh et al 2018 component 2 showed high loading on mn and fe indicating geogenic sources component 3 showed a correlation between ph and tds this suggests that tds play a significant role in change in the ph component 4 showed a strong correlation with chromium as it was not present in all the samples in the monsoon season total three components with an eigen value 1 were extracted for groundwater the percentage of variance for components 1 2 and 3 are 29 8 24 6 and 20 9 respectively component 1 showed a strong correlation with al cu zn and pb these may be derived from the pesticides and fertilizers used in agricultural activity alfaifi et al 2021 component 2 strongly correlates with mn fe ph and tds mn and fe may be due to dissolution from the soil during the rainwater infiltration process component 3 showed a strong correlation with cr co and ni this could be due to the influence of effluents of sewage treatment plants in the study area 4 conclusions heavy metals in the selected groundwaters of shallow hard rock aquifers in southwestern india were studied to evaluate heavy metals and assess human health risk the present study reported that slightly acidic ph was observed in the monsoon season few groundwater samples have high al mn and zn beyond the prescribed limits of drinking water standards the hpi estimation concluded that heavy metal pollution was detected only at the station kadekar s16 human health risk assessment revealed that children are more vulnerable to non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk than infants and adults in the study area moderate carcinogenic risk was observed in 20 and 8 of the monsoon and pre monsoon seasons samples respectively the study area poses a low ecological risk based on eri evaluation factor analysis suggests that heavy metal concentrations in groundwater are derived from both anthropogenic and geogenic sources anthropogenic sources mainly include agricultural activity leakage from soak pit and effluents from the sewage treatment plant the geostatistical interpolation method in gis provides pollution levels distributed spatially this will be helpful for decision makers to decide on the areas to be considered for water management plans the study recommends treatment of groundwater for drinking purposes since ingestion is the primary pathway for heavy metal exposures the sewage effluents should be properly treated and recycled before discharging into ecosystem this prevents potential human health risk associated with groundwater consumption future research scope to this study lies in soil groundwater interactions and the associated biogeochemical processes funding the first author thanks the manipal academy of higher education mahe for providing dr t m a pai phd fellowship mahe dreg mahescholar phd 2018 dated june 9

11746,the groundwater pollution in shallow aquifers is usually an outcome of urbanisation resulting from the discharge of industrial and domestic effluents maps of aquifer vulnerability to pollution are becoming more in demand because it addresses the degree of sensitivity of the groundwater system towards changes in intrinsic and extrinsic factors with this aim the drastic method was adopted to address the vulnerable groundwater zones for shallow aquifers of greater cochin and the surrounding region seven hydrogeological parameters either measured in situ for 98 dug wells or derived from secondary sources and satellite data were integrated into a gis platform and modelled using drastic rating for the drastic factors was derived based on weights assigned to each parameter the resultant map depicted vulnerability index values ranging 79 to 174 reclassified as very high 144 high 144 131 medium 131 to 115 and low 115 about 68 of the total study area characterised by porous and permeable aquifer media with shallow groundwater levels displayed a very high to high vulnerability index value the majority of the highly vulnerable area falls in the urban centre with high population density within the lowland region sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer media has the biggest effect on vulnerability assessment water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 dug wells the degree of contamination was calculated by adding the concentration of metals the susceptible zones based on the degree of contamination cd cross verified with vulnerability index depicted a significant correlation between vulnerability zones the study indicates that contamination and vulnerability to contamination is a main cause of concern for more than 3 82 million people living in the region the study suggests that drastic model can be used as an efficient tool to manage water sensitive urban development and groundwater sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer vulnerability drastic model cd sensitivity analysis hydro chemical signatures 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource for domestic usage especially for drinking purposes due to its low vulnerability to pollution compared to surface water us epa 1985 however due to industrialisation and subsequent urbanisation groundwater contamination has increased from land use activities in the last few decades unscientific groundwater exploitation unplanned drainage systems and localised pollution are the main reasons for increased groundwater contamination nlend et al 2018 howard and gerber 2018 de león gómez et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 urbanisation jeopardised the very stability of rural ecological life supporting systems urbanisation creates more impervious surfaces exacerbating ephemeral runoff causing floods and net loss in groundwater recharge moreover saltwater intrusion would further complicate the situation especially in cities with the sea s proximity creating heavy stress on urban water distribution directly affecting the living standard of residential households with the growing global groundwater stress and the ever increasing demand on water resources scientific water resources management is conceivable through an integrated multidisciplinary approach incorporating various methods of groundwater quality and vulnerability assessment with comprehensive knowledge on the regional and local hydrogeological conditions bernard jannin et al 2017 mondal et al 2019 azimi et al 2018 ray and ray 2019 the term vulnerability of groundwater to contamination was first introduced by margat 1968 valcarce ortega and jimenez reyes 2016 defined groundwater vulnerability as the sensitivity of an aquifer system to contamination activities groundwater vulnerability models convey the sensitivity to pollution in the form of a vulnerability map with different levels of intensity from the contamination point of view el naqa et al 2006 kumar et al 2015 groundwater vulnerability can be of the intrinsic type or specific type intrinsic type means a vulnerability indication to all contaminants while the specific type vulnerability is based on the intrinsic vulnerability combined with the specific contaminant characteristics several studies on groundwater vulnerability assessment of the intrinsic type are available using statistical models process based mathematical simulation methods and index overlay methods kim and hamm 1999 pacheco et al 2015 statistical methods derive relationships between the selected variables and the actual occurrence of pollutants in the groundwater and therefore can be easily influenced by the selected data or methods process based models require a large amount of input data and therefore the method is challenging to apply on a regional scale even though more accurate results are obtained however index based overlay analysis is better due to the simplicity and less data requirement rajput et al 2020 the index based drastic model developed by the united states environmental protection agency aller 1985 is one of the most popular approaches for the creation of an intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment map şener and şener 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 ahmed et al 2022 chakraborty et al 2022 apart from other vulnerability assessment techniques drastic method deals with the inherent physical properties of several hydrogeological regimes and takes a specific approach with regards to the contaminant characteristics and behaviour through various natural components by applying an analytical hierarchy process the parameter weighting and rating method classifies the influencing parameters and also introduces relative weight coefficients for each factor gogu and dassargues 2000 bai et al 2012 tirkey et al 2013 edet et al 2014 nasri et al 2015 ahmed et al 2015 2022 wu et al 2016 douglas et al 2018 el baba and kayastha 2022 several studies are available in the literature on groundwater vulnerability assessment using the drastic model for many parts of india rahman 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 saha and alam 2014 singh et al 2015 tiwari et al 2016 mondal et al 2017 jesiya and gopinath 2019 hasan et al 2019 rajput et al 2020 ghosh et al 2021 chakraborty et al 2022 the technique is still relevant due to the possibilities of modifications in the hydrogeological results of each zone that helps to understand the effect of variation in each parameter in changing the percentage area of vulnerability zone mondal et al 2017 kumar and pramod krishna 2019 jesiya and gopinath 2019 torkashvand et al 2021 denitza et al 2021 umar et al 2022 the area selected for the study is the greater cochin a fast growing metropolis of southern india and its peri urban phreatic aquifers within ernakulam district the area is highly vulnerable to contamination from various anthropogenic activities in the context of industrialisation urbanisation and climate change the study area has a shallow aquifer system with most of the area falling in the highly urbanised region with a dense population the study area s proximity to the sea and the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities including increasing groundwater demand make it a prominent region of interest in terms of vulnerability identification additionally industrialisation and resulting contaminant diffusion from polluted surface water bodies to shallow aquifers along with effects due to fluvial and pluvial flooding landfill leachate and seawater intrusion marks the study area as a most dynamic place of investigation concerning vulnerability zone identification and mapping paul et al 1993 laluraj et al 2006 laluraj and girish 2006 umadevi et al 2010 divya et al 2011 priju et al 2012 sumangala et al 2013 deepa and magudeswaran 2014 preeti and dwarakish 2015 nair et al 2016 aneesh et al 2018 2019 2021 devi and nair 2021 devi et al 2022 moreover recent flooding in the study area resulted in huge natural distractions mathew et al 2021 vijaykumar et al 2021 krishnakumar et al 2022 consequently aquifer vulnerability to pollution is essential in planning future developments in these areas this study emphasises a baseline pre flood hydrologic condition of greater cochin hence this vulnerability model can be used for careful land use planning monitoring and preventing pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is greater cochin with the flanked lowland and midland regions covering 900 sq km lies between 9 48 n and 10 16 n latitude and 76 16 e and 76 25 e longitude within the ernakulum district of kerala india fig 1 the coastal area is a narrow strip of land from chellanam to munambam between the arabian sea and vembanad estuary the lowland is mostly the coastal stretch with a width of about 10 15 km which is plain land with low relief and slopes with maximum elevation up to 5 m above mean sea level amsl the study area have problems of saltwater intrusion during hot summer from march to the middle of may priju et al 2012 laluraj et al 2006 laluraj and girish 2006 sumangala et al 2013 cgwb 2003 the coastal plain is covered with the coastal alluvial soil of recent periods dominated by several backwater channels cgwb 2001 the midland region with an elevation varying between 7 and 75 m amsl rises gently from the coastal plain in the west to east the area is covered with laterite on the west and crystalline rock exposures in the east since this study aims to analyse the impact of urbanisation on aquifer vulnerability the study area was subdivided on the basis of the urban sprawl for this purpose topography land use land cover lulc data and population density were used in classifying the study area as the high density urban hdu peri urban coastal puc and peri urban midland pum regions the high density urban hdu area within the greater cochin is towards north on both sides of nh 47 and covers a portion of peri urban coastal puc and peri urban midland pum region with an area of 277 km2 nair et al 2016 aneesh et al 2018 2019 hydrologically the study region lies within the periyar watershed on the north and the muvattupuzha watershed on the south trellis to sub trellis drainage pattern is shown by the upstream part of the periyar and muvattupuzha river basin river periyar bifurcates at aluva as distributaries towards the northern side that flows to the arabian sea and towards the southern side that drain to the vembanad lake in the study area groundwater occurs in the quaternary unconsolidated sediments under phreatic conditions and semi confined to confined conditions quaternary formations in the study area consists of recent alluvium and laterite followed by warkali beds or vaikom beds at the bottom warkali beds are least extensive restricted to the southern coastal belt with thickness more than 100 m at chellanam in the south to less than 13 m at panangad in the north vaikom beds are generally separated from the overlying warkali formation by quilon beds except in the northern side vaikom beds are underlying the alluvium or laterite in the northern side extending from north to south with increasing thickness of 18 m at panangad to 151 m at chellanam as per the available reports from cgwb 2007 majority of the dug wells in the study region is not penetrating either warkali vaikom or quilon formations the 98 dug wells considered for the present study is penetrating only the topmost laterite and alluvial formations warkali beds are semi confined to confined aquifers similarly vaikom beds are potential confined aquifers in the study region however the dug wells considered for this study are not confined aquifers therefor the drastic model used for the present study considered the topmost part of quaternary formation consisting of laterite and alluvium formation laterites are highly porous and permeable vastly occurring in the midland region of the study area as a result of weathering of crystalline rocks laterites are also found to occur as a weathered product of sedimentary formation especially in the coastal belt along the coastal belt laterite beds are discontinuous in nature and occur between recent alluvium on top and warkali or vaikom beds below most of the dug wells in the mid land area developed in laterites using for domestic and to a limited extent for irrigation the depth of wells in laterite ranges from 3 4 to 14 8 mbgl and depth to water level ranges from 1 55 to 11 06 mbgl the second most prevalent formation is recent alluvium riverine alluvium is restricted to banks of rivers enriched in clay content and plant nutrients suited for paddy cultivation coastal alluvium is encountered in cochin taluk and the western parts of paravur and aluva taluk composed of sand and clay observatory dug wells in alluvial formation are shallower with depth 3 m groundwater is stored in the secondary pores and fractures that control groundwater movement in hard rock formations the study area with a humid tropical climate receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 2900 mm from south west monsoon june to september and north east monsoon october to december out of the total rainfall more than 65 is from the south west monsoon during june to september monsoon and around 20 from the north east monsoon from october to december post monsoon while the remaining 15 of precipitation happens during january to may pre monsoon cgwb 2003 with 132 total number of rainy days 2 2 data collection the parameters required to run the drastic model are depth to groundwater recharge vadose zone aquifer media and topography depth to groundwater and aquifer thickness were measured in situ from 98 monitoring wells in the field from september 2014 to february 2016 fig 1 aquifer properties such as conductivity c transmissivity t and storativity s were estimated through pumping tests from four domestic dug wells representing the entire study area the monitoring wells were selected so that the wells are distributed uniformly by preparing grids of 2 km2 spatially from 1 50000 toposheet in arc gis 10 3 at each monitoring well well location as spatial coordinates and surface elevation was measured using a handheld gps with reference to mean sea level the measurement accuracy using handheld gps is confirmed by resurveying using the total station for 30 of the well locations the validation of the drastic model is done with the quality assessment of water samples collected in 2015

water table aquifer thickness collected from the field were imported into the gis platform as point data inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in arc gis 10 3 was used to convert the point data parameters into a map the seven thematic maps were reclassified by assigning appropriate ratings and subsequently rasterised the assigned suitable weights of parameters table 1 were based mainly on their importance or influence on the index technique the default ratings for each parameter to derive the drastic index is given in table 2 depth to groundwater was measured on a monthly basis using a water level dip meter for eighteen months seasonal average depth to water level was derived from the average water level fluctuations for the corresponding periods the water level measured for 98 well locations were spatially interpolated to generate the map the highest rating of 10 is given to the lowest depth to water table since the lower depth to water level represents less vertical travel time for pollutants from the surface to reach the water table in other words lower depth to water level indicates a higher chance for pollutants to reach the aquifer system similarly recharge was obtained monthly by subtracting the groundwater level of any month from the previous month the highest numerical value of 10 was assigned to the highest recharge rate as higher recharge implies high contamination chances aquifer media is the thickness of the saturated zone singh et al 2003 mondal et al 2017 measured from the bottom of every dug well to the highest water level among all seasons it has a direct influence on the pollution reduction process the higher water level fluctuation indicates more contaminants entering the aquifer so the highest vulnerability rating is given to the highest fluctuation range soil media is the uppermost part of the vadose zone where significant biological activities exist soil type plays a vital role in the recharge process as the infiltration rate depends on the soil type aller et al 1987 the soil map of the study were obtained from cgwb 2003 the lateritic soil has the highest rating of 5 compared to other soil types as water yielding and transmission are significant topography of a region refers to the slope variability of land surface mondal et al 2017 the topography map was prepared from dem and using well s elevation measured in the field using total station the contour map was generated using the elevation from the topography map using the interpolation method the highest rating of 10 is given to the lowest slope range a vadose zone represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone between the land surface and upper phreatic zone through which water infiltrates and reaches the groundwater table the zone is not in a constant mode seasonally and annually in the present study the vadose zone of each well was measured from ground level to the average groundwater table together with any saturated zones vadose zone thickness influences the flow time of pollutants to reach the aquifer hence the lowest rating is assigned to the thicker vadose area and vice versa hydraulic conductivity refers to the horizontal flow of groundwater through an aquifer in the present study a pumping test was carried out for four selected well locations representing physiographic subdivision of the areal average within the regions the highest rating is assigned to the highly conductive zone the seven drastic parameters as thematics map layers were reclassified based on the ratings assigned on a scale of 1 10 except for soil media soil media rating was on a scale of 1 5 the reclassified maps in raster format were used for the weighted overlay analysis method the seven layers were overlapped by the weighted sum tool of overlay analysis in arc gis 10 3 the default drastic index calculation was performed to derive the final vulnerability index map the vulnerability index map was reclassified into four zones by distributing the index values in four classes 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the errors and uncertainties due to the temporal variation in parameters of drastic index the analysis evaluated the dominating factor which decides the drastic index depth to groundwater d net recharge r and aquifer media a showing seasonal variations are the three parameters considered the master data of drastic output was estimated by varying the d r and a for the respective three seasons by preparing respective rating maps resulting in seasonal vulnerability maps 2 5 degree of contamination cd the seasonal variation of hydrochemical parameters represents the hydrodynamic process within an aquifer the validation of drastic model has been done with analysed seasonal water quality data of 41 dug wells 7 ponds 2 rivers and 1 estuarine sample water quality parameters such as ph tds and ec were analysed in situ using a handheld field instrument model eutech cyberscan factord 650 the collected water samples were filtered and acidified with 1 n nitric acid heavy metal concentration in the collected water samples was analysed for eleven elements ie rb sr ba v cr mn mo ag al cd and pb using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms model agilent 7700x the analysis was carried out using 1 ppb of rh as the standard the analytical precision was less than 10 obtained by repeating the analysis of the standard the concentrations of eleven heavy metals derived using icp ms for 41 dug well samples were further analysed to understand the level of contamination the degree of contamination was evaluated by considering the concentration of elements showing analytical value above the standard permissible limit and the concentration exceeding standard values the degree of contamination cd used in the present study was computed by the formula developed by backman et al 1997 as given below 2 c d i 0 n c f i 3 c f i c a i c n i 1 where here cfi denotes the contamination factor of the ith component cai is the analytical value of the ith component cni stands for the upper permissible limit of the ith component n denotes the normative value the cd is grouped into three classes by a mean approach modified scale they are cd 6 low cd 6 12 medium and cd 12 high prasanna et al 2012 the degree of contamination cd acts as a reference tool to estimate the combined effect of metal pollution related to standardised water quality parameters for domestic usage edet and offiong 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 drastic parameters the seven parameters used to derive the drastic vulnerability index is either measured in situ or generated by combining the satellite derived data and data from secondary sources depth to water level d measured in situ for 98 wells shows spatial and seasonal variations the average groundwater table in the study area ranges from 0 39 to 13 27 mbgl meter below ground level table 2 fig 3 the water level recorded in the lowland coastal urban and peri urban regions is exceptionally shallower than that recorded in the midland region the depth to the water table gradually decreases from the midland area towards the lowland urban centre major industries and a significant part of the high density urban areas belongs to the lowland urban area net recharge calculated using monthly water level fluctuations ranges from 0 25 to 1039 mm year with an average of 130 mm year table 2 fig 4 the primary source of recharge for the study area is precipitation and therefore seasonal and annual rainfall fluctuations are captured in the recharge the regional aquifer media map was prepared by using in situ measured water level fluctuation and the aquifer depth aquifer media thickness varies from 0 28 to 7 56 m table 2 fig 5 the thickness of the saturated zone gradually increases towards the midland area where dug wells are located in laterite terrain high groundwater level fluctuation enhances the chances of pollutants reaching the aquifer soil media as a drastic parameter has a vital role in the recharge process as the infiltration rate varies with soil type a significant part of the study area is covered by lateritic soil 74 18 followed by riverine alluvium 15 06 and coastal alluvium 10 74 table 2 fig 6 lateritic soil covers nearly half of the urban and entire midland regions a part of the coastal low land region is covered in patches by hydromorphic saline riverine and coastal alluvium soil types topography as a drastic parameter refers to elevation relative to mean sea level and ranges from 1 to 152 m amsl for the study area table 2 fig 7 the elevation shows a gradual increase towards the eastern side of the study area where agricultural land covers most of the region in lowland regions the slope is gentle and the chances of contaminant infiltration are very high vadose zone thickness for the study area range from 0 68 to 11 81 m table 2 fig 8 vadose zone thickness can show changes in temporal maps dug wells in coastal and lowland areas display a comparatively low vadose zone thickness major industries situated in such zones of low vadose zone thickness can accelerate the chances of contamination hydraulic conductivity increases the contaminant advection resulting in aquifer vulnerability several studies represent the difficulty in measuring and mapping hydraulic conductivity in the field fritch et al 2000 lathamani et al 2015 however as mondal et al 2017 stated hydraulic conductivity is directly proportional to the aquifer transmissivity and therefore can be measured the conductivity c value ranges from 9 54 to 391 00 m2 day table 2 fig 9 the lowest value exists in the urban area and the highest is found in the coastal region 3 2 vulnerability map using drastic model the vulnerability index of the study area in raster format generated using the drastic model display a range of index value from 79 to 174 table 3 fig 10 the final vulnerability map was generated by reclassifying the index values using reclassify tool in the gis spatial analysis the reclassified zones and their corresponding ranges are 79 115 low vulnerable zone 115 131 medium vulnerable zone 131 144 high vulnerable zone and 144 174 very high vulnerable zone drastic index of the study area display that around 68 of the area falls under very high 306 km2 and high vulnerable zones 307 km2 80 of hdu occupied a very high to high vulnerable category characterised by hdu settlements in lowland having a large number of crisscrossing surface water bodies the aquifers in urban zones are composed of coastal and riverine alluvial sandy formations that are more sensitive to contaminants surface water direction ground and surface water interaction soil media and topography affect the quality of these shallow groundwater part of puc laid in the hdu is characterised as a high vulnerable zone while the remaining area is categorised as a medium to the low vulnerable zone groundwater sources within sandy alluvial formations are highly vulnerable zones and are frequently influenced by the diffusion of contaminants from the very high vulnerable zones however aquifers in underlying alluvial clayey formations in these zones are moderate to low permeable strata with low recharge and runoff therefore protecting contaminants from the aquifer the medium and low vulnerable zone covers 60 of the pum region which is mostly covered under agricultural land sub surface hydrogeological structures and low intensity of urbanisation have protected the pum aquifer from the transmission of contaminants into the groundwater but the pum in the northern part of the study area is categorised under very high to high vulnerability which is a commercially developing area the urban centres and surroundings of the study area have numerous large and small scale industries these industries are located in and around the core of the city apparently with no good treatment plant consequently the hazardous waste materials discharged from these industries reach the open fields or are dumped in landfills ultimately reaching the groundwater system raju and tandon 1999 selvam 2015 selvam et al 2014 overall the study reveals that urban growth and related anthropogenic activities resulted in categorising groundwater zones under highly vulnerable zones therefore unplanned developments and lack of monitoring lead to the diffusion of contaminants in groundwater which deteriorate its potable nature in terms of water quality 3 3 sensitivity analysis the spatial and temporal variations of the model parameters influence the drastic index of the total study area here the collected annual field data has been presented separately with respect to different seasons the seven parameters of vulnerability model d depth to groundwater r net recharge and a aquifer media raster layers for each season were reproduced the drastic model was run without changing the band interval hence four vulnerability maps fig 11 a b c d were prepared from the raster data the sensitivity analysis was carried out by calculating the area pixel count and percentage of samples collected for validation table 3 the obtained result implies the variation of very high vulnerable zone with respect to seasonal data it is clear from the observation that other factors such as depth to water table recharge and aquifer media play an important role in a region s vulnerability among these aquifer media is the most effective parameter for controlling the vulnerability zone of the present study area followed by recharge and depth to the water table part of puc and the majority of the hdu in the southwestern side of the study area lies under very high to high vulnerability zones because the western part of the study area is with several crisscrossing water bodies and the rainfall to recharge ratio makes it further sensitive the hydrological flow direction of the area is towards the southwest side subsequently even a slight contamination effect in the upper zone can cause a more vulnerable situation throughout the region 3 4 water quality analysis the pollution status of any system can be assessed by monitoring the pollution parameters at the same time such type of quality assessment requires pollution status concerning several parameters therefore quality indices are employed for estimating the composite influence of overall pollution in drinking water wagh et al 2018 ali et al 2019 raja et al 2021 the routine hydrochemical analysis is an established method to analyse groundwater quality for specific purposes and permissible limits area specified for the same conversely this study envisages the effect of urbanisation and industrialisation in the hydrological regime of a tier ii metro city therefore it is crucial to study the toxicity of metals in terms of the concentration and contamination to the groundwater resource in a region consequently in the present study the degree of contamination cd is derived from the metal concentrations to estimate the combined effect of metal pollution water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 well locations for three seasons a seasonal statistical summary of quality parameters is furnished in table 4 physical parameters of the study area point out that the vulnerable zone is susceptible to ph and tds as per the who standards 51 of the samples exceeds its permissible limit of ph during pre monsoon 77 and 37 for the duration of monsoon and post monsoon the highest ph values are perceived in the coastal area the tds also shows a similar trend relative to the drastic index for seasonal data and exceeds its limit for 11 of samples during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods and 5 for post monsoon 3 5 degree of contamination cd the degree of contamination cd was derived from the metal concentrations using chemical analysis of water samples collected for three seasons from the study area by using equations 1 and 2 table 5 seasonal maps on the degree of contamination were derived by interpolation of the cd values at each sampling location added as point data in the gis platform as depicted in fig 12 a b c here cd values less than 0 cd 0 are plotted as anomalous points the zones with higher cd index values shows the areal extent of the aquifer that is spatially contaminated the modified scale developed by the mean value approach classifies the well 38 location ambalamedu and well 14 padivattom sampling locations under a high degree of contamination for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons with mean values of 5 68 8 51 and 6 11 respectively high concentrations of mn values 593 45 μg l and 980 77 μg l were observed in these two locations confirming that the contamination is mainly anthropogenic driven and could be both industrial and agricultural influences in the pre monsoon season 13 of samples showed high cd index another 13 showed medium cd index and 74 showed low cd index during monsoon season 11 of samples show high cd index 13 of samples show medium cd index and 76 of samples fall within low cd index while in post monsoon season 13 of samples show high cd index 7 of samples show medium cd index and 80 of samples fall within low cd index whereas comparing the cd index values with groundwater vulnerable zones demarcated that the higher index values were noticed in the northeast and urban centre of the study area for all the three seasons which is classed under very high to high vulnerable zones the highest value of cd in pre monsoon is observed for groundwater samples from ambalamedu 38 located near a critical industrial zone with industries like fertilisers and chemicals travancore limited fact and bharat petroleum corporation limited oil refinery periyar river sample r2 shows the highest concentration of mn during monsoon the source specifies as anthropogenic the fertilisers used in the cardamom hills of western ghats reaches the upstream portion of periyar river which flows down through the urban outskirt later bifurcates into several distributaries to the urban core the periyar river act as a primary recharge source in the study area in the post monsoon season the highest value of cd is noticed in the dug well point padivattom 14 located at the central part of urban sprawl and falls near one of the periyar river distributary called cherumuttampuzha this distributary of the periyar river crosses the eloor chemical and fertilisers industrial belt from the spatial and quality analysis it is clear that the area with the highest groundwater vulnerability to contamination has poor water quality 4 conclusion in the present study the drastic model delineated the vulnerable groundwater zones for the shallow aquifers of greater cochin and the surrounding regions greater cochin is a highly urbanised densely populated tier ii metro in south india seven hydrogeological parameters were either measured in situ or derived from secondary sources and satellite data were integrated into the drastic model depth to water level recharge aquifer media and vadose zone thickness are measured in situ from 98 monitoring dug wells rating and weights for the drastic factors were derived based on the influence of each parameter on the vulnerability index the execution of the drastic model resulted in a vulnerability index map with values ranging between 79 and 174 the index values were reclassified into very high 144 high 144 131 medium 131 to 115 and low 115 classes about 68 of the total study area characterised by porous and permeable aquifer media with shallow groundwater levels exhibited a very high to high vulnerability index value about 80 of hdu regions are classified as very high to highly vulnerable zones a part of puc and most coastal regions is also classified under highly vulnerable zones sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer media has the biggest effect on vulnerability assessment the western and central part of the study area is found to be the most sensitive area as per the index values obtained this region has many surface water bodies that crisscross the surface area water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 dug wells the susceptible zones based on the degree of contamination cd cross verified with vulnerability index depicted a significant correlation between vulnerability zones and cd index values the highest value of cd in pre monsoon is observed for groundwater samples from ambalamedu 38 located near a critical industrial zone with industries like fertilisers and chemicals travancore limited fact bharat petroleum corporation limited oil refinery periyar river sample r2 shows the highest concentration of mn during monsoon the source specifies as anthropogenic seasonal variation in vulnerable areas and degree of contamination in the polluted locations are more prevalent in and around the industrial belt the study suggests that the drastic model is effective in depicting vulnerability to contamination and

11746,the groundwater pollution in shallow aquifers is usually an outcome of urbanisation resulting from the discharge of industrial and domestic effluents maps of aquifer vulnerability to pollution are becoming more in demand because it addresses the degree of sensitivity of the groundwater system towards changes in intrinsic and extrinsic factors with this aim the drastic method was adopted to address the vulnerable groundwater zones for shallow aquifers of greater cochin and the surrounding region seven hydrogeological parameters either measured in situ for 98 dug wells or derived from secondary sources and satellite data were integrated into a gis platform and modelled using drastic rating for the drastic factors was derived based on weights assigned to each parameter the resultant map depicted vulnerability index values ranging 79 to 174 reclassified as very high 144 high 144 131 medium 131 to 115 and low 115 about 68 of the total study area characterised by porous and permeable aquifer media with shallow groundwater levels displayed a very high to high vulnerability index value the majority of the highly vulnerable area falls in the urban centre with high population density within the lowland region sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer media has the biggest effect on vulnerability assessment water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 dug wells the degree of contamination was calculated by adding the concentration of metals the susceptible zones based on the degree of contamination cd cross verified with vulnerability index depicted a significant correlation between vulnerability zones the study indicates that contamination and vulnerability to contamination is a main cause of concern for more than 3 82 million people living in the region the study suggests that drastic model can be used as an efficient tool to manage water sensitive urban development and groundwater sustainability graphical abstract image 1 keywords aquifer vulnerability drastic model cd sensitivity analysis hydro chemical signatures 1 introduction groundwater is an essential natural resource for domestic usage especially for drinking purposes due to its low vulnerability to pollution compared to surface water us epa 1985 however due to industrialisation and subsequent urbanisation groundwater contamination has increased from land use activities in the last few decades unscientific groundwater exploitation unplanned drainage systems and localised pollution are the main reasons for increased groundwater contamination nlend et al 2018 howard and gerber 2018 de león gómez et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 urbanisation jeopardised the very stability of rural ecological life supporting systems urbanisation creates more impervious surfaces exacerbating ephemeral runoff causing floods and net loss in groundwater recharge moreover saltwater intrusion would further complicate the situation especially in cities with the sea s proximity creating heavy stress on urban water distribution directly affecting the living standard of residential households with the growing global groundwater stress and the ever increasing demand on water resources scientific water resources management is conceivable through an integrated multidisciplinary approach incorporating various methods of groundwater quality and vulnerability assessment with comprehensive knowledge on the regional and local hydrogeological conditions bernard jannin et al 2017 mondal et al 2019 azimi et al 2018 ray and ray 2019 the term vulnerability of groundwater to contamination was first introduced by margat 1968 valcarce ortega and jimenez reyes 2016 defined groundwater vulnerability as the sensitivity of an aquifer system to contamination activities groundwater vulnerability models convey the sensitivity to pollution in the form of a vulnerability map with different levels of intensity from the contamination point of view el naqa et al 2006 kumar et al 2015 groundwater vulnerability can be of the intrinsic type or specific type intrinsic type means a vulnerability indication to all contaminants while the specific type vulnerability is based on the intrinsic vulnerability combined with the specific contaminant characteristics several studies on groundwater vulnerability assessment of the intrinsic type are available using statistical models process based mathematical simulation methods and index overlay methods kim and hamm 1999 pacheco et al 2015 statistical methods derive relationships between the selected variables and the actual occurrence of pollutants in the groundwater and therefore can be easily influenced by the selected data or methods process based models require a large amount of input data and therefore the method is challenging to apply on a regional scale even though more accurate results are obtained however index based overlay analysis is better due to the simplicity and less data requirement rajput et al 2020 the index based drastic model developed by the united states environmental protection agency aller 1985 is one of the most popular approaches for the creation of an intrinsic groundwater vulnerability assessment map şener and şener 2015 ribeiro et al 2017 ahmed et al 2022 chakraborty et al 2022 apart from other vulnerability assessment techniques drastic method deals with the inherent physical properties of several hydrogeological regimes and takes a specific approach with regards to the contaminant characteristics and behaviour through various natural components by applying an analytical hierarchy process the parameter weighting and rating method classifies the influencing parameters and also introduces relative weight coefficients for each factor

modifications in the hydrogeological results of each zone that helps to understand the effect of variation in each parameter in changing the percentage area of vulnerability zone mondal et al 2017 kumar and pramod krishna 2019 jesiya and gopinath 2019 torkashvand et al 2021 denitza et al 2021 umar et al 2022 the area selected for the study is the greater cochin a fast growing metropolis of southern india and its peri urban phreatic aquifers within ernakulam district the area is highly vulnerable to contamination from various anthropogenic activities in the context of industrialisation urbanisation and climate change the study area has a shallow aquifer system with most of the area falling in the highly urbanised region with a dense population the study area s proximity to the sea and the adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities including increasing groundwater demand make it a prominent region of interest in terms of vulnerability identification additionally industrialisation and resulting contaminant diffusion from polluted surface water bodies to shallow aquifers along with effects due to fluvial and pluvial flooding landfill leachate and seawater intrusion marks the study area as a most dynamic place of investigation concerning vulnerability zone identification and mapping paul et al 1993 laluraj et al 2006 laluraj and girish 2006 umadevi et al 2010 divya et al 2011 priju et al 2012 sumangala et al 2013 deepa and magudeswaran 2014 preeti and dwarakish 2015 nair et al 2016 aneesh et al 2018 2019 2021 devi and nair 2021 devi et al 2022 moreover recent flooding in the study area resulted in huge natural distractions mathew et al 2021 vijaykumar et al 2021 krishnakumar et al 2022 consequently aquifer vulnerability to pollution is essential in planning future developments in these areas this study emphasises a baseline pre flood hydrologic condition of greater cochin hence this vulnerability model can be used for careful land use planning monitoring and preventing pollution 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is greater cochin with the flanked lowland and midland regions covering 900 sq km lies between 9 48 n and 10 16 n latitude and 76 16 e and 76 25 e longitude within the ernakulum district of kerala india fig 1 the coastal area is a narrow strip of land from chellanam to munambam between the arabian sea and vembanad estuary the lowland is mostly the coastal stretch with a width of about 10 15 km which is plain land with low relief and slopes with maximum elevation up to 5 m above mean sea level amsl the study area have problems of saltwater intrusion during hot summer from march to the middle of may priju et al 2012 laluraj et al 2006 laluraj and girish 2006 sumangala et al 2013 cgwb 2003 the coastal plain is covered with the coastal alluvial soil of recent periods dominated by several backwater channels cgwb 2001 the midland region with an elevation varying between 7 and 75 m amsl rises gently from the coastal plain in the west to east the area is covered with laterite on the west and crystalline rock exposures in the east since this study aims to analyse the impact of urbanisation on aquifer vulnerability the study area was subdivided on the basis of the urban sprawl for this purpose topography land use land cover lulc data and population density were used in classifying the study area as the high density urban hdu peri urban coastal puc and peri urban midland pum regions the high density urban hdu area within the greater cochin is towards north on both sides of nh 47 and covers a portion of peri urban coastal puc and peri urban midland pum region with an area of 277 km2 nair et al 2016 aneesh et al 2018 2019 hydrologically the study region lies within the periyar watershed on the north and the muvattupuzha watershed on the south trellis to sub trellis drainage pattern is shown by the upstream part of the periyar and muvattupuzha river basin river periyar bifurcates at aluva as distributaries towards the northern side that flows to the arabian sea and towards the southern side that drain to the vembanad lake in the study area groundwater occurs in the quaternary unconsolidated sediments under phreatic conditions and semi confined to confined conditions quaternary formations in the study area consists of recent alluvium and laterite followed by warkali beds or vaikom beds at the bottom warkali beds are least extensive restricted to the southern coastal belt with thickness more than 100 m at chellanam in the south to less than 13 m at panangad in the north vaikom beds are generally separated from the overlying warkali formation by quilon beds except in the northern side vaikom beds are underlying the alluvium or laterite in the northern side extending from north to south with increasing thickness of 18 m at panangad to 151 m at chellanam as per the available reports from cgwb 2007 majority of the dug wells in the study region is not penetrating either warkali vaikom or quilon formations the 98 dug wells considered for the present study is penetrating only the topmost laterite and alluvial formations warkali beds are semi confined to confined aquifers similarly vaikom beds are potential confined aquifers in the study region however the dug wells considered for this study are not confined aquifers therefor the drastic model used for the present study considered the topmost part of quaternary formation consisting of laterite and alluvium formation laterites are highly porous and permeable vastly occurring in the midland region of the study area as a result of weathering of crystalline rocks laterites are also found to occur as a weathered product of sedimentary formation especially in the coastal belt along the coastal belt laterite beds are discontinuous in nature and occur between recent alluvium on top and warkali or vaikom beds below most of the dug wells in the mid land area developed in laterites using for domestic and to a limited extent for irrigation the depth of wells in laterite ranges from 3 4 to 14 8 mbgl and depth to water level ranges from 1 55 to 11 06 mbgl the second most prevalent formation is recent alluvium riverine alluvium is restricted to banks of rivers enriched in clay content and plant nutrients suited for paddy cultivation coastal alluvium is encountered in cochin taluk and the western parts of paravur and aluva taluk composed of sand and clay observatory dug wells in alluvial formation are shallower with depth 3 m groundwater is stored in the secondary pores and fractures that control groundwater movement in hard rock formations the study area with a humid tropical climate receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 2900 mm from south west monsoon june to september and north east monsoon october to december out of the total rainfall more than 65 is from the south west monsoon during june to september monsoon and around 20 from the north east monsoon from october to december post monsoon while the remaining 15 of precipitation happens during january to may pre monsoon cgwb 2003 with 132 total number of rainy days 2 2 data collection the parameters required to run the drastic model are depth to groundwater recharge vadose zone aquifer media and topography depth to groundwater and aquifer thickness were measured in situ from 98 monitoring wells in the field from september 2014 to february 2016 fig 1 aquifer properties such as conductivity c transmissivity t and storativity s were estimated through pumping tests from four domestic dug wells representing the entire study area the monitoring wells were selected so that the wells are distributed uniformly by preparing grids of 2 km2 spatially from 1 50000 toposheet in arc gis 10 3 at each monitoring well well location as spatial coordinates and surface elevation was measured using a handheld gps with reference to mean sea level the measurement accuracy using handheld gps is confirmed by resurveying using the total station for 30 of the well locations the validation of the drastic model is done with the quality assessment of water samples collected in 2015

weights assigned to each parameter the significant classes of each parameter represent range from 1 to 10 based on their relative effectiveness based on the delphi approach seven parameters are assigned weights from 1 to 5 as per their importance the drastic vulnerability index was finally computed using a linear combination of the ratings and weights of all factors by the given formula 1 drasticindex drdw rrrw araw srsw trtw iriw crcw here capital letters assign corresponding parameters suffix r specify the assigned rates and w indicate the weightage the parameters such as depth to water table aquifer thickness collected from the field were imported into the gis platform as point data inverse distance weighted idw interpolation method in arc gis 10 3 was used to convert the point data parameters into a map the seven thematic maps were reclassified by assigning appropriate ratings and subsequently rasterised the assigned suitable weights of parameters table 1 were based mainly on their importance or influence on the index technique the default ratings for each parameter to derive the drastic index is given in table 2 depth to groundwater was measured on a monthly basis using a water level dip meter for eighteen months seasonal average depth to water level was derived from the average water level fluctuations for the corresponding periods the water level measured for 98 well locations were spatially interpolated to generate the map the highest rating of 10 is given to the lowest depth to water table since the lower depth to water level represents less vertical travel time for pollutants from the surface to reach the water table in other words lower depth to water level indicates a higher chance for pollutants to reach the aquifer system similarly recharge was obtained monthly by subtracting the groundwater level of any month from the previous month the highest numerical value of 10 was assigned to the highest recharge rate as higher recharge implies high contamination chances aquifer media is the thickness of the saturated zone singh et al 2003 mondal et al 2017 measured from the bottom of every dug well to the highest water level among all seasons it has a direct influence on the pollution reduction process the higher water level fluctuation indicates more contaminants entering the aquifer so the highest vulnerability rating is given to the highest fluctuation range soil media is the uppermost part of the vadose zone where significant biological activities exist soil type plays a vital role in the recharge process as the infiltration rate depends on the soil type aller et al 1987 the soil map of the study were obtained from cgwb 2003 the lateritic soil has the highest rating of 5 compared to other soil types as water yielding and transmission are significant topography of a region refers to the slope variability of land surface mondal et al 2017 the topography map was prepared from dem and using well s elevation measured in the field using total station the contour map was generated using the elevation from the topography map using the interpolation method the highest rating of 10 is given to the lowest slope range a vadose zone represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone between the land surface and upper phreatic zone through which water infiltrates and reaches the groundwater table the zone is not in a constant mode seasonally and annually in the present study the vadose zone of each well was measured from ground level to the average groundwater table together with any saturated zones vadose zone thickness influences the flow time of pollutants to reach the aquifer hence the lowest rating is assigned to the thicker vadose area and vice versa hydraulic conductivity refers to the horizontal flow of groundwater through an aquifer in the present study a pumping test was carried out for four selected well locations representing physiographic subdivision of the areal average within the regions the highest rating is assigned to the highly conductive zone the seven drastic parameters as thematics map layers were reclassified based on the ratings assigned on a scale of 1 10 except for soil media soil media rating was on a scale of 1 5 the reclassified maps in raster format were used for the weighted overlay analysis method the seven layers were overlapped by the weighted sum tool of overlay analysis in arc gis 10 3 the default drastic index calculation was performed to derive the final vulnerability index map the vulnerability index map was reclassified into four zones by distributing the index values in four classes 2 4 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the errors and uncertainties due to the temporal variation in parameters of drastic index the analysis evaluated the dominating factor which decides the drastic index depth to groundwater d net recharge r and aquifer media a showing seasonal variations are the three parameters considered the master data of drastic output was estimated by varying the d r and a for the respective three seasons by preparing respective rating maps resulting in seasonal vulnerability maps 2 5 degree of contamination cd the seasonal variation of hydrochemical parameters represents the hydrodynamic process within an aquifer the validation of drastic model has been done with analysed seasonal water quality data of 41 dug wells 7 ponds 2 rivers and 1 estuarine sample water quality parameters such as ph tds and ec were analysed in situ using a handheld field instrument model eutech cyberscan factord 650 the collected water samples were filtered and acidified with 1 n nitric acid heavy metal concentration in the collected water samples was analysed for eleven elements ie rb sr ba v cr mn mo ag al cd and pb using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms model agilent 7700x the analysis was carried out using 1 ppb of rh as the standard the analytical precision was less than 10 obtained by repeating the analysis of the standard the concentrations of eleven heavy metals derived using icp ms for 41 dug well samples were further analysed to understand the level of contamination the degree of contamination was evaluated by considering the concentration of elements showing analytical value above the standard permissible limit and the concentration exceeding standard values the degree of contamination cd used in the present study was computed by the formula developed by backman et al 1997 as given below 2 c d i 0 n c f i 3 c f i c a i c n i 1 where here cfi denotes the contamination factor of the ith component cai is the analytical value of the ith component cni stands for the upper permissible limit of the ith component n denotes the normative value the cd is grouped into three classes by a mean approach modified scale they are cd 6 low cd 6 12 medium and cd 12 high prasanna et al 2012 the degree of contamination cd acts as a reference tool to estimate the combined effect of metal pollution related to standardised water quality parameters for domestic usage edet and offiong 2002 3 results and discussion 3 1 drastic parameters the seven parameters used to derive the drastic vulnerability index is either measured in situ or generated by combining the satellite derived data and data from secondary sources depth to water level d measured in situ for 98 wells shows spatial and seasonal variations the average groundwater table in the study area ranges from 0 39 to 13 27 mbgl meter below ground level table 2 fig 3 the water level recorded in the lowland coastal urban and peri urban regions is exceptionally shallower than that recorded in the midland region the depth to the water table gradually decreases from the midland area towards the lowland urban centre major industries and a significant part of the high density urban areas belongs to the lowland urban area net recharge calculated using monthly water level fluctuations ranges from 0 25 to 1039 mm year with an average of 130 mm year table 2 fig 4 the primary source of recharge for the study area is precipitation and therefore seasonal and annual rainfall fluctuations are captured in the recharge the regional aquifer media map was prepared by using in situ measured water level fluctuation and the aquifer depth aquifer media thickness varies from 0 28 to 7 56 m table 2 fig 5 the thickness of the saturated zone gradually increases towards the midland area where dug wells are located in laterite terrain high groundwater level fluctuation enhances the chances of pollutants reaching the aquifer soil media as a drastic parameter has a vital role in the recharge process as the infiltration rate varies with soil type a significant part of the study area is covered by lateritic soil 74 18 followed by riverine alluvium 15 06 and coastal alluvium 10 74 table 2 fig 6 lateritic soil covers nearly half of the urban and entire midland regions a part of the coastal low land region is covered in patches by hydromorphic saline riverine and coastal alluvium soil types topography as a drastic parameter refers to elevation relative to mean sea level and ranges from 1 to 152 m amsl for the study area table 2 fig 7 the elevation shows a gradual increase towards the eastern side of the study area where agricultural land covers most of the region in lowland regions the slope is gentle and the chances of contaminant infiltration are very high vadose zone thickness for the study area range from 0 68 to 11 81 m table 2 fig 8 vadose zone thickness can show changes in temporal maps dug wells in coastal and lowland areas display a comparatively low vadose zone thickness major industries situated in such zones of low vadose zone thickness can accelerate the chances of contamination hydraulic conductivity increases the contaminant advection resulting in aquifer vulnerability several studies represent the difficulty in measuring and mapping hydraulic conductivity in the field fritch et al 2000 lathamani et al 2015 however as mondal et al 2017 stated hydraulic conductivity is directly proportional to the aquifer transmissivity and therefore can be measured the conductivity c value ranges from 9 54 to 391 00 m2 day table 2 fig 9 the lowest value exists in the urban area and the highest is found in the coastal region 3 2 vulnerability map using drastic model the vulnerability index of the study area in raster format generated using the drastic model display a range of index value from 79 to 174 table 3 fig 10 the final vulnerability map was generated by reclassifying the index values using reclassify tool in the gis spatial analysis the reclassified zones and their corresponding ranges are 79 115 low vulnerable zone 115 131 medium vulnerable zone 131 144 high vulnerable zone and 144 174 very high vulnerable zone drastic index of the study area display that around 68 of the area falls under very high 306 km2 and high vulnerable zones 307 km2 80 of hdu occupied a very high to high vulnerable category characterised by hdu settlements in lowland having a large number of crisscrossing surface water bodies the aquifers in urban zones are composed of coastal and riverine alluvial sandy formations that are more sensitive to contaminants surface water direction ground and surface water interaction soil media and topography affect the quality of these shallow groundwater part of puc laid in the hdu is characterised as a high vulnerable zone while the remaining area is categorised as a medium to the low vulnerable zone groundwater sources within sandy alluvial formations are highly vulnerable zones and are frequently influenced by the diffusion of contaminants from the very high vulnerable zones however aquifers in underlying alluvial clayey formations in these zones are moderate to low permeable strata with low recharge and runoff therefore protecting contaminants from the aquifer the medium and low vulnerable zone covers 60 of the pum region which is mostly covered under agricultural land sub surface hydrogeological structures and low intensity of urbanisation have protected the pum aquifer from the transmission of contaminants into the groundwater but the pum in the northern part of the study area is categorised under very high to high vulnerability which is a commercially developing area the urban centres and surroundings of the study area have numerous large and small scale industries these industries are located in and around the core of the city apparently with no good treatment plant consequently the hazardous waste materials discharged from these industries reach the open fields or are dumped in landfills ultimately reaching the groundwater system raju and tandon 1999 selvam 2015 selvam et al 2014 overall the study reveals that urban growth and related anthropogenic activities resulted in categorising groundwater zones under highly vulnerable zones therefore unplanned developments and lack of monitoring lead to the diffusion of contaminants in groundwater which deteriorate its potable nature in terms of water quality 3 3 sensitivity analysis the spatial and temporal variations of the model parameters influence the drastic index of the total study area here the collected annual field data has been presented separately with respect to different seasons the seven parameters of vulnerability model d depth to groundwater r net recharge and a aquifer media raster layers for each season were reproduced the drastic model was run without changing the band interval hence four vulnerability maps fig 11 a b c d were prepared from the raster data the sensitivity analysis was carried out by calculating the area pixel count and percentage of samples collected for validation table 3 the obtained result implies the variation of very high vulnerable zone with respect to seasonal data it is clear from the observation that other factors such as depth to water table recharge and aquifer media play an important role in a region s vulnerability among these aquifer media is the most effective parameter for controlling the vulnerability zone of the present study area followed by recharge and depth to the water table part of puc and the majority of the hdu in the southwestern side of the study area lies under very high to high vulnerability zones because the western part of the study area is with several crisscrossing water bodies and the rainfall to recharge ratio makes it further sensitive the hydrological flow direction of the area is towards the southwest side subsequently even a slight contamination effect in the upper zone can cause a more vulnerable situation throughout the region 3 4 water quality analysis the pollution status of any system can be assessed by monitoring the pollution parameters at the same time such type of quality assessment requires pollution status concerning several parameters therefore quality indices are employed for estimating the composite influence of overall pollution in drinking water wagh et al 2018 ali et al 2019 raja et al 2021 the routine hydrochemical analysis is an established method to analyse groundwater quality for specific purposes and permissible limits area specified for the same conversely this study envisages the effect of urbanisation and industrialisation in the hydrological regime of a tier ii metro city therefore it is crucial to study the toxicity of metals in terms of the concentration and contamination to the groundwater resource in a region consequently in the present study the degree of contamination cd is derived from the metal concentrations to estimate the combined effect of metal pollution water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 well locations for three seasons a seasonal statistical summary of quality parameters is furnished in table 4 physical parameters of the study area point out that the vulnerable zone is susceptible to ph and tds as per the who standards 51 of the samples exceeds its permissible limit of ph during pre monsoon 77 and 37 for the duration of monsoon and post monsoon the highest ph values are perceived in the coastal area the tds also shows a similar trend relative to the drastic index for seasonal data and exceeds its limit for 11 of samples during the pre monsoon and monsoon periods and 5 for post monsoon 3 5 degree of contamination cd the degree of contamination cd was derived from the metal concentrations using chemical analysis of water samples collected for three seasons from the study area by using equations 1 and 2 table 5 seasonal maps on the degree of contamination were derived by interpolation of the cd values at each sampling location added as point data in the gis platform as depicted in fig 12 a b c here cd values less than 0 cd 0 are plotted as anomalous points the zones with higher cd index values shows the areal extent of the aquifer that is spatially contaminated the modified scale developed by the mean value approach classifies the well 38 location ambalamedu and well 14 padivattom sampling locations under a high degree of contamination for pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons with mean values of 5 68 8 51 and 6 11 respectively high concentrations of mn values 593 45 μg l and 980 77 μg l were observed in these two locations confirming that the contamination is mainly anthropogenic driven and could be both industrial and agricultural influences in the pre monsoon season 13 of samples showed high cd index another 13 showed medium cd index and 74 showed low cd index during monsoon season 11 of samples show high cd index 13 of samples show medium cd index and 76 of samples fall within low cd index while in post monsoon season 13 of samples show high cd index 7 of samples show medium cd index and 80 of samples fall within low cd index whereas comparing the cd index values with groundwater vulnerable zones demarcated that the higher index values were noticed in the northeast and urban centre of the study area for all the three seasons which is classed under very high to high vulnerable zones the highest value of cd in pre monsoon is observed for groundwater samples from ambalamedu 38 located near a critical industrial zone with industries like fertilisers and chemicals travancore limited fact and bharat petroleum corporation limited oil refinery periyar river sample r2 shows the highest concentration of mn during monsoon the source specifies as anthropogenic the fertilisers used in the cardamom hills of western ghats reaches the upstream portion of periyar river which flows down through the urban outskirt later bifurcates into several distributaries to the urban core the periyar river act as a primary recharge source in the study area in the post monsoon season the highest value of cd is noticed in the dug well point padivattom 14 located at the central part of urban sprawl and falls near one of the periyar river distributary called cherumuttampuzha this distributary of the periyar river crosses the eloor chemical and fertilisers industrial belt from the spatial and quality analysis it is clear that the area with the highest groundwater vulnerability to contamination has poor water quality 4 conclusion in the present study the drastic model delineated the vulnerable groundwater zones for the shallow aquifers of greater cochin and the surrounding regions greater cochin is a highly urbanised densely populated tier ii metro in south india seven hydrogeological parameters were either measured in situ or derived from secondary sources and satellite data were integrated into the drastic model depth to water level recharge aquifer media and vadose zone thickness are measured in situ from 98 monitoring dug wells rating and weights for the drastic factors were derived based on the influence of each parameter on the vulnerability index the execution of the drastic model resulted in a vulnerability index map with values ranging between 79 and 174 the index values were reclassified into very high 144 high 144 131 medium 131 to 115 and low 115 classes about 68 of the total study area characterised by porous and permeable aquifer media with shallow groundwater levels exhibited a very high to high vulnerability index value about 80 of hdu regions are classified as very high to highly vulnerable zones a part of puc and most coastal regions is also classified under highly vulnerable zones sensitivity analysis shows that aquifer media has the biggest effect on vulnerability assessment the western and central part of the study area is found to be the most sensitive area as per the index values obtained this region has many surface water bodies that crisscross the surface area water quality analysis was carried out for groundwater samples collected from 41 dug wells the susceptible zones based on the degree of contamination cd cross verified with vulnerability index depicted a significant correlation between vulnerability zones and cd index values the highest value of cd in pre monsoon is observed for groundwater samples from ambalamedu 38 located near a critical industrial zone with industries like fertilisers and chemicals travancore limited fact bharat petroleum corporation limited oil refinery periyar river sample r2 shows the highest concentration of mn during monsoon the source specifies as anthropogenic seasonal variation in vulnerable areas and degree of contamination in the polluted locations are more prevalent in and around the industrial belt the study suggests that the drastic model is effective in depicting vulnerability to contamination and therefore is useful to manage sustainability based water sensitive urban development for the future data availability statement the authors confirm that the data supporting the findings of this study

11747,the presence of fluoride in drinking water can have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of dental caries when its concentration lies in the optimal range of 0 5 0 7 mg l however fluoride intake below and above this range can have negative effects on tooth enamel and skeletal fluorosis in case of prolonged exposure to high concentrations unfortunately in some areas of the world such as rural communities of the east african rift valley earv water is dramatically contaminated by fluoride which may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis because its concentration is often well above the maximum threshold of 1 5 mg l recommended by the world health organisation to tackle this problem experts and policy makers have attempted to introduce defluoridation techniques that as well as being cost effective allow end users to drastically reduce the level of fluoride below the above mentioned threshold however the adoption of these techniques remains quite low because behavioural factors inﬂuencing people s safer water consumption in these areas of the world is poorly understood to fill such a gap in this study we explore how these factors can influence the adoption of a new defluoridator in kenyan and tanzanian rural communities of the earv to achieve this objective 75 people belonging to maasai and meru ethnic groups were interviewed running nine focus groups where these factors were investigated using the ranas risk attitude norm ability self regulation model results show that the drinking behaviour of people living in the earv is dramatically affected by contextual factors and exacerbated by the high level of fluoride naturally contained in drinking and cooking water behavioural insights into how policy makers and marketers could reverse this unhealthy drinking behaviour introducing technological devices that can cut the quantity of fluoride contained naturally are discussed arguing in favour of the possibility of using different behaviour changing techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water fluoride attitudes knowledge risk norms 1 introduction and background excessive fluoride in drinking water affects living conditions and health status of approximately 200 million people worldwide especially in countries such as india china argentina and mexico in africa high fluoride groundwater levels have been reported mostly in the east african rift valley earv that originates in eritrea and extends through ethiopia kenya and tanzania and to malawi ijumulana et al 2020 this problem is accelerated by young volcanic activities occurrence of thermal waters especially those with high ph gases emitted from earth s crust granitic and gneissic rocks ijumulana et al 2020 2021 in kenya and tanzania health problems caused by dental and skeletal fluorosis are associated with high fluoride content contained naturally in surface and groundwater and this correlation has been documented since 1944 grech and latham 1964 in kenia the population exposed to high fluoride intake is estimated at 7 million coetsiers et al 2008 while in tanzania ten million people suffer from the same problem as highlighted by the tanzanian ministry of water and irrigation hawkins 2010 the central kenya rift and arusha district in tanzania where this study was conducted are the regions of the earv most affected by this problem in kenya the highest levels of fluoride in groundwater are found in the volcanic areas of the earv with nairobi and central provinces reporting the highest value of fluoride as 1 640 mg l and 2 800 mg l respectively in lakes elmentaita and nakuru malago et al 2017 in arusha in the area surrounded by mount meru this problem is determined by the relationship between its geology and hydrogeology as described by ghiglieri et al 2010 hydrogeological units host aquifers with different qualities of groundwater where high values of fluoride up to 68 mg l were recorded ghiglieri et al 2010 2012 tomašek et al 2022 studies conducted in this region show that the occurrence of fluoride is space dependent and the presence of many sources with high and few with low fluoride concentrations is one of the challenges affecting the blending technology adopted by arusha urban water supply authority ijumulana et al 2020 2021 as groundwater is the main water resource for human and agricultural needs the geological and hydrogeological conformation of the geographical areas described above seriously challenge the health of people living in rural communities e g about 25 of the tanzanian population depends entirely on groundwater for drinking ligate et al 2021 ijumulana et al 2022 according to the world health organisation who epidemiological evidence suggests that systemic fluoride intake of drinking and cooking water above 1 5 mg l can carry an increased risk of dental fluorosis while progressively higher concentrations lead to risks of skeletal fluorosis ward et al 2009 therefore where the fluoride concentration of groundwater for human consumption might be over beyond 40 mg l dental and skeletal fluorosis dramatically affect the life of kenyan and tanzanian rural communities tekle haimanot et al 2006 ghiglieri et al 2012 njuguna et al 2020 about 90 of people living in these areas are affected by dental fluorosis at different stages of severity and dental and skeletal fluorosis are recognized health problems vuhahula et al 2009 the difficulty to reduce very high levels of fluoride contained in surface and groundwater forced policy makers to set a higher standard of fluoride concentration than that established by the who 1 5 mg l because the latter cannot be guaranteed with the available technology and current socio economic conditions of these rural communities malago et al 2017 for example the standard water fluoride concentration recommended by the tanzania bureau of standards was fixed at 4 mg l due to lack of reliable defluoridation technologies especially in the semiarid rural area mbabaye et al 2018 however recently the standard water fluoride concentration recommended by water supply and sanitation authority of the tanzanian government has been reduced from 4 mg l to the who recommended level of 1 5 mg l ewura 2020 strategies to solve groundwater fluoride contamination are based on an in depth knowledge of the hydrogeology of an area that can help local and government agencies to build wells that intercept good quality water and development of defluoridation methods several defluoridation methods have been extensively studied exploiting different technologies yadav et al 2018 such as reverse osmosis membrane and nanofiltration electrodialysis or various adsorbent and ion exchanger material e g ldh bauxite red soil bio sorbent and bone char and coagulation and precipitation methods e g nalgonda technique calcium based material although a few studies indicate that these different defluoridation technologies effectively remove fluoride from water an applicable and reliable method has not yet been developed due to various contraindications regarding the technical viability and economic feasibility especially for their use in rural areas ayoob et al 2008 usually these technologies are simple and have a relatively low costs of adoption but the reasons behind their poor acceptance and lack of sustainability appear to be complex peal evans van der voorden 2010 argue that poor technology acceptance and use of water quality interventions is affected by the hygiene and sanitation tools of the hardware e g defluoridation devices and by the use of software for example hardware constraints prevent a large scale use of the bone char method especially in rural areas albertus et al 2000 software used to manage these defluoridation devices requires interaction of human beings in a cultural and social sensitive environment that makes it difficult to promote health drinking behaviour through the adoption of new technologies makutsa et al 2001 peal evans and van der voorden 2010 furthermore as fluoride concentration in water is not constant the monitoring of defluoridation performance is a mandatory activity this activity is fundamental to identify when the sorbent material of defluoridation devices runs out and needs to be changed specific equipment and trained personnel are necessary to perform laboratory analyses necessary to identify the fluoride concentration at which these devices start their removal action mbabaye et al 2017 huber et al 2012 2013 2014 also found that the adoption of new defluoridation devices reducing fluoride in drinking water imply the uptake of new behaviour their studies emphasize the importance of acquiring a good knowledge of social and psychological factors behind the use of defluoridation devices this knowledge allows policy makers to plan behavioural change interventions that can encourage the population to adopt innovative technologies and consume drinking water containing acceptable levels of fluoride in order to fill such a gap this study aims at exploring what contextual and behavioural factors can influence the adoption of a new filter system helping kenyan and tanzanian rural communities to switch from untreated drinking water to safe defluoridated water to discover how this device could be accepted and introduced the following research questions were explored what are the water consumption habits and needs of people living in rural communities of the earv what are the difficulties that they face to satisfy their water needs how do people perceive water quality and its relationship with their health what are the behavioural factors that can influence the adoption of new device and healthy drinking behaviour what strategies or policies could be used to nudge rural communities towards healthy drinking behavioural changes the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section two will explain the methodological approach employed in this study to explore the acceptance of the new device section three will discuss results of focus groups conducted with rural communities of kenya and tanzania section four will discuss key findings of contextual and behavioural factors providing insights about policies that government and donors could implement to help these rural communities to adopt healthy drinking behaviour section five will conclude the study 2 methods the objective of this study was to explore via focus group discussion how contextual factors influence unhealthy drinking habits of these rural communities and how insights from behavioural factors affecting the acceptance of the new filter system described below can help rural communities of the earv to switch towards the consumption of fluoride safe water 2 1 characteristics of the new defluoridator an innovative filter system consisting of a new defluoridator device used in conjunction with the sorbent octacalcium phosphate as a means of fluoride removal was developed in the framework of the eu horizon2020 flowered project by idini et al 2019 1 1 for more information about the flowered project see http www floweredproject org this filter system called flowered defluoridator device was conceived with the scope of replicating the natural mechanism of fluoride absorption occurring in the human body and of being highly efficient in rural contexts fig 1 shows that this prototype works with a pump that can be powered by a car battery or a small solar panel system and in case of electricity black out can also work manually the application of the new device shows that a single sorbent dose of 80g can purify 20 l of waters reducing the fluoride contamination below the acceptable drinkable threshold even if the initial concentration of fluoride reaches 21 mg l it can also decrease its contamination by about 50 for extreme rich fluoride water without negative effects on the overall water quality idini et al 2019 2020 the filter uses a fixed amount of sorbent for every defluoridation cycle and at the end of the process a simple filter system removes the sorbent from the water this process was also tested in situ and results showed that this new device can defluoride water with 22 mg l of fluoride concentration well below the who suggested limit of 1 5 mg l in 2 h idini et al 2020 the functioning of this prototype was illustrated to focus group participants showing them fig 1 2 2 the ranas model and the focus group research protocol the adoption of this new defluoridator and the consumption of fluoride safe water can be influenced by many factors such as drinking habits risks connected with perceived vulnerability to illnesses severity and factual knowledge of dental and skeletal fluorosis diseases commitments to healthy drinking behaviour perceived personal capacity to use the devices in terms of daily routine huber mosler 2013 mulopo et al 2020 as the ranas risks attitudes norms abilities and self regulations model fits the exploration of these factors well we developed a focus group research protocol where open ended questions were framed around the elements of this conceptual framework the ranas model was developed by mosler 2012 and has been applied in several studies evaluating people s behaviour in developing in relation to the consumption of fluoride safe water huber et al 2012 huber and mosler 2013 huber et al 2014 entele and lee 2020 and arsenic safe water inauen et al 2013 2014 handwashing contzen et al 2015 lilje mosler 2018 cleaning of water storage containers stocker and mosler 2015 and access to and use of hygienic shared sanitation facilities tumwebaze and mosler 2014 2015 harter et al 2018 nunbogu et al 2019 the ranas model can be used in several steps of water sanitation and hygiene intervention programmes where researchers first use qualitative methods to identify possible behavioural factors and then quantitative tools to measure these factors in order to identify behavioural techniques and strategies to nudge people towards behavioural changes contzen and mosler 2015 insights about perceptions and preferences concerning drinking water quality have also been captured in several qualitative studies jones et al 2005 2007 ward et al 2009 but in this study key aspects of open ended questions were developed to collect information about the elements of the ranas model as illustrated in fig 2 the focus group research protocol was divided into three sections the first sections had the scope of warming up the discussion introducing the project the research theme and to collect information about gender age education and family size of participants participants also received explanations of the role undertaken by the facilitator and that audio recordings would have only been used for the purpose of this study without disclosing their identity they were told to express their opinions freely because their opinions matter and that there were no right or wrong answers sections two and three contained open ended questions related to the ranas model that the moderator asked to participants of selected kenyan and tanzanian rural communities of the earv section two aimed at eliciting information related to contextual factors characterised by social physical and personal contexts influencing water needs management and drinking habits the moderator triggered the discussion around questions exploring sources and availability of water in their villages management and consumption of these resources and the price that they pay for safe and unsafe water section three opened informing interviewees that according to the who more than 200 million of individuals in the world were affected by elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water and that in their living area this impacts negatively on their health to trigger the discussion around the behavioural elements of the ranas model this information was coupled with pictures of people affected by dental and skeletal fluorosis this allowed the moderator to explore participants knowledge of these diseases beliefs and perceived risk of their families when drinking unsafe water after having explored knowledge and risk the moderator explained how this new filter system works showing them fig 1 and highlighting that this device would be available to them both for domestic and community use villages and schools they were also informed that the domestic filter can produce 20 l of fluoride safe water each cycle while the community filter produces 1000 l of fluoride safe water each time the moderator concluded this short presentation stressing that the action of using the defluoridator must be part of the participants daily routine this explanation allowed the moderator to explore their attitudes towards unsafe and safe water obtained with the new device the approval of their communities for domestic and community filters their confidence in using the device and commitment towards the production of fluoride safe water 2 3 sampling and data analysis fig 3 shows the geographical area in which nine focus groups were conducted in october 2018 of the nine focus groups five were conducted interviewing maasai two in kenya and three in tanzania and four meru two in both countries participants of these two ethnic groups were located around nakuru in kenya and mount meru in tanzania zones highly affected by fluorosis in fact these villages were affected by a concentration of fluoride in surface and groundwater ranging between 2 and 18 mg l and thus well above the recommended limit of 1 5 mg l suggested by ward et al 2009 moreover four focus groups were conducted in three kenyan villages gilgil kipkenyo kambi ya moto and five focus groups in four tanzanian villages uwiro oldonyo sambu mkuru ngare nanyuki in each country two focus groups were conducted in the same village and participants were recruited with the help of researchers involved with h2020 flowered project and working for the university of eldoret in kenya and nelson mandela university and the ngo oykos in tanzania the recruitment started in july 2018 contacting the heads of these seven villages who in turn selected focus group participants to be eligible interviewees were required not to have had any experience with focus group discussions to be involved with decisions regarding drinking water for their families and to give their consent to participation and audio recording the interviews were conducted in swahili and maa maasai dialect by one of the authors and by researchers from the institutions mentioned above who took notes on the discussions and group interactions the audio recorded tapes were then translated into english and checked for accuracy by the research team to analyse this data we followed strategies provided by the literature on qualitative data i e reducing data into a manageable size in order to allow fundamental identification of themes and following the theoretical aspects of the proposed conceptual framework bazeley 2013 jackson and bazeley 2019 thus the interviewee s responses were coded into themes related to the ranas model and entered in nvivo 12 the most interesting aspects of these discussions will be reported in italics in the results chapter furthermore because of the relatively high total number of participants where possible some answers where coded and imported into ibmspps to explore mean differences and correlations between maasai and meru performing independent sample t tests and χ 2 square tests 3 results seventy five maasai and meru were interviewed in total and their socio demographic characteristics by focus group can be observed in table 1 the total number of participants was more or less equally distributed by gender 52 male and by country 53 tanzania while for ethnicity more maasai 59 were interviewed because the village leader of focus group three recruited more participants than other leaders furthermore many participants were aged between 31 and 50 59 educated at primary and secondary school 46 and had a family size of between two and five people 41 3 1 understanding management and needs of water resources for domestic uses as regards water collection and administration 86 of participants stated that generally females are responsible for these activities while men in some cases help women with fetching water the total daily average of water collected and used by participants was 100 36 s 43 16 and 81 89 s 38 72 litres in kenya and tanzania respectively and this difference was not significant to the independent sample t test t 1 81 d f 63 p 0 07 we also explored these differences between maasai and meru in both countries in kenya for maasai the daily average stated water consumption was higher than that indicated by meru but these differences were not significant to the independent sample t test 2 2 in kenya maasai s and meru s daily average water consumption were 106 s 31 12 and 93 85 s 54 55 litres respectively t 0 74 d f 26 p 0 47 while in tanzania they were 72 61 s 24 90 and 97 14 s 51 95 litres respectively t 1 94 d f 35 p 0 06 this was also the case for drinking and cooking water where a daily average of 20 l was observed however half the participants seemed to be concerned about water availability because it is not enough to satisfy their families needs and to serve an increasing population especially in relation to the quantity of safe drinking and cooking water maasai participants emphasized the use of water for pastoral purposes because they need to wash cows with medicine that kills insects and therefore sometimes they must use the water they fetch or buy to spray their animals quantity is also reduced both by animals that destroy water supply when they pass through the water channelling and by dirt which impedes people from collecting water some participants appeared to be so concerned about water scarcity that they were planning to migrate especially during the drought season i don t get my 200 l and it is problematic water because you can go for a whole day and pick up six buckets from the morning when you get up till ten o clock our water source satisfies us but sometimes with difficulty because animals destroy the source when they pass through the water channelling and thus they can delay two days the supply of water the population has increased so water is not enough especially during droughts distances and time in water collection appeared to be very important factors for water management according to united nations human settlements programme staff 2003 a distance of 200 m is considered appropriate to fetch water every day for family needs however only 41 3 of participants fetched water within the recommended who distance with maasai walking longer distances than meru on the average in order to fetch water masai walk 2 233 m while meru 784 m and this difference was significant to the independent sample t test t 2 48 d f 73 p 0 01 thus many housewives must spend a disproportionate part of the day in fetching water for the family s needs as confirmed in other studies bartram and howard 2003 graham et al 2016 furthermore water collection appears to be very demanding especially for some maasai participants it is within my neighbourhood and it is able to meet my needs but it serves people as far as 4 km it is roughly 10 km my wife could go using donkeys she takes the donkeys near the stream where the water is sold after she buys the three or four gallons she puts them on donkeys and then takes them home furthermore to cope with scarcity and the demanding time needed to fetch water during focus group interviews maasai and meru participants mentioned the use of different sources of water 260 and 255 times respectively fig 4 shows that in kenya boreholes were the most mentioned sources of water used by maasai 50 and meru 60 in tanzania rain was stated 66 7 by maasai and wells 63 by meru but in kenya the latter never reported wells furthermore water from rivers and lakes was never mentioned among participants of tanzanian rural communities while water gathered from rivers and lakes appeared to be more important for kenyan participants especially maasai 30 even though kenyan and tanzanian participants stated that they had to access and manage different sources of water they underlined again that this was a scarce resource that often is not enough to satisfy the needs of their households members and farm animals they used borehole water during the dry season while harvested and stored rainwater from march to may using strategies like an iron sheet roof or plastic containers boreholes were used more during the dry season because solar pump panels were not efficient during the rainy season during rainy season we get water from the river but in the dry season we use the borehole water the current water borehole does not supply enough because it is solar pumped and in some periods there is not enough sun to pump it the water source depends on solar hence it doesn t pump during the rainy season a long time ago the water was enough but the number of people has increased plus animals so it is not enough these days sometimes participants reduced the distance of fetching water taking advantage of gravity pipeline systems placed usually at the top of hills we use gravity since the hot spring water is at the top of the hill we fetch water from the borehole and piped water from koinaike piped water is available once a week for about 22 of participants the management of water resources is free because they stated that they do not pay anything for the water they fetch however other participants pay for untreated water either for each fetched bucket of water 20 l or a monthly flat fee system payment the latter payment was mentioned by two groups of maasai participants in tanzania where the flat fee covered the price of water and the maintenance of the boreholes for kenyan participants the price of one bucket of water ranged from kessh 2 us 0 02 to kessh 150 us 1 48 with an average price of kessh 15 us 0 15 in tanzania for the same bucket of water ranged from tzssh25 to tsh 500 with an average price of tzssh 226 us 0 098 the observed difference between the average prices of a bucket of water in kenya and tanzania was relevant and significant to the independent sample t test t 2 23 p 0 03 3 2 perceived risks of drinking water and knowledge and beliefs of fluorosis concern over the quality of water was amplified by perceived participants risk for safe drinking and cooking water in both countries only about 30 of maasai and meru participants perceived the water that they consume was safe in some cases their perception was backed up by the opinion of experts non governmental agencies and water companies supplying water for other participants the perceived quality of water was just backed up by their beliefs for example they believed that water is safe because they use it without any treatment or because they see that it does not alter the colour of the food they consume we believe that the water is good because it is from underground and experts said it is good the water i buy is clean water because it comes from a water supply company that get water from welewa i just believe that water is safe because we have been using it without treating it however the majority of maasai and meru participants perceived that water was of bad quality and unsafe because they were exposed to health risks caused by dirtiness and high levels of fluoride water is polluted and contaminated by worms and bacteria and sometimes they must share water with wild animals the tap water is dirty this will be a problem especially due to how we live our lives at times the water i use is evidently not clean it might be as a result of varying rates of contaminations and pollutions as it flows downstream the water for the people and the cattle should be purified from the source of the river they expressed concern over high levels of fluoride in drinking water for themselves future generations but also for livestock and agriculture because fluoride is transferred to food and will affect their health many maasai and meru were also worried about their children when they go to school and thus advise them to take a bottle of safe water from home some participants stated that drinking water has a bad taste and is too salty and they defined this type of water that they drink as isokot the water has a lot of salts such that when left to settle in containers it leaves crystal behind consumed water also has magadi maasai do not understand fluoride it is only these days we know from experts but as maasais we say isokot meaning water with bad taste water with magadi tastes bad and then we understand that water is not good the future generation is at risk of so many health related problems if they will continue to use this water without treating it most of them will have no teeth with crippled legs discussion triggered by pictures of dental and skeletal fluorosis showed that these two diseases were well known across participants and that other than three participants they were aware that the cause was water or food contaminated by fluoride the problem of teeth comes from water and our ancestors told us that the water has a problem making the teeth to look like this because where i was born in makuyuni there are no such disorders when i came and saw the children here i knew it was the water it is also in the foods we eat because the fluoride water is also used to irrigate vegetables so even in foods fluoride is located i do not know i am not sure if it is the water we consume initially we thought the problem in children was as a result of consuming sweets and sugar foodstuffs but later we realized it was not the cause our kids do not eat sweets and yet they are affected prevalence of dental fluorosis appeared to be higher than skeletal fluorosis with nearly 67 of participants households affected by dental fluorosis and only about 17 by skeletal fluorosis in each country no significant differences were observed between maasai and meru participants 3 3 in kenya 75 of maasai and 93 3 of meru stated that they had dental fluorosis in their families χ 2 2 03 d f 1 p 0 15 while in tanzania only 58 3 of maasai and 43 8 of meru declared to have this health problem χ 2 0 82 d f 1 p 0 37 but country comparison shows that dental fluorosis was more prevalent across kenyan households and this difference was significant to the χ 2 test χ 2 7 74 d f 1 p 0 005 as shown in fig 5 this result was likely to be influenced by participants of the mukuru village focus group 5 who stated that their village was not affected neither by dental nor by skeletal fluorosis even if they were aware of the consequences of these diseases in other villages included in this study i have not seen such problems here in our village but in other areas like oldonyo sambu and ngabobo regions the link between the cause and consequences of dental fluorosis emerged clearly during focus group discussions this pattern is evident from the word cloud in fig 6 which depicts the most frequently occurring words emerging from focus group discussions water use were the most recurrent words and they were linked to the management of this resource and to problems caused by fluoride water to their health fig 6 seems to indicate that participants retrieved information following a network of semantic nodes vogel and wanke 2016 where central words more frequent with larger font could represent nodes activated by pictures from their memory while more distant words were activated later less frequent word with smaller fonts thus the most recurrent words water problem fluorosis teeth etc activated concern because it was brown coloured tooth decay and loss of teeth that affect their children families and neighbours participants highlighted that this problem starts in their childhood and inflicts pain and psychological discomfort because sometime people take joke about them and as a result they feel ugly i took two children to nairobi to stay far and use better water i feel bad because these people were not born like these conditions i am one of those affected and my children are affected my teeth were brown like these one and i do not like them at all it started from my childhood we have cases in my family but they are at the early stages of dental fluorosis i am the one affected and future generations are at risk of so many health problems if they will continue to use this water without treating it yes children are at the initial stages of fluorosis while adults have reached the advanced levels and some have already lost their teeth initially their teeth were white but the more they use they use this water the more their teeth turn brown and then started to break besides i am also a victim 10 of my teeth have started to crack in these two photos i see myself i am sure the water is toxic my teeth are bad and people even joke that i smoke cigarettes and i cannot refuse them how can i refuse that my teeth are coloured even if skeletal fluorosis was less prevalent than dental fluorosis the description of its negative health effects was severely described by many maasai and meru participants women were hit more than men and they were sad and concerned about ageing because this process will affect them earlier and more suddenly than in a situation where human beings have enough economic resources to access clean and safe water children were described as having big heads and the occurrence of bowlegs in adults dramatically affect their well being inflicting physical and psychological suffering their knees are weak bodies cannot stand straight and they find it difficult to stand up straight way but only after having walked for a while walking is painful working is hard and people feel a sense of tiredness and show signs of resignation to fight against fluorosis because of poverty poverty does not offer them many water alternatives and they are forced to choose just between lethal and survival health choices i e dying from typhoid or getting fluorosis it is not just bowlegs the body cannot stand straight you cannot also turn the neck very harmful to the bones the body is tired people cannot run and if a person falls slightly they get broken very easily experts say that it also reduces the ability of the brain the brain system lowers down and this is because people use fluoride water without filter we have bowed like them the other day i was passing through the south part of the village i was really sad a lady is old but because of the water the knees are weak and the back bowed i see people hide and i would cry because when i see that my conscious is disturbed children are suffering they have big heads the schools are far so they fail because of the way they are affected until now the problem has no solution i fear a lot this is disability brought by water and when we reach 50 years old we cannot walk completely you can see a woman today and tomorrow she is old long time ago old people had too much energy but nowadays at 40 years men cannot do any labour jobs many women after a few births cannot even leave the house the legs are bowed and then the man is also disabled we cannot even have more children women are affected more if we are invited to a meeting and asked to sit down that is the day you will laugh at people in this area when a woman wants to stand up she will kneel down and start to stand up like an aeroplane taking off in the runway she will stand straight in about 50 m from here poverty is the only reason why we constantly consume this water before using boreholes river rongai used to be the main source of drinking water however the major problem with river was typhoid because it killed so many people as a result it is better to drink fluoride water than dying from typhoid a sense of powerlessness in fighting these diseases was also evident by the fact that the majority of participants think that there are no methods to prevent fluorosis other than using painkillers or procedures based on beliefs that circulate within their rural communities these procedures are used especially for keeping their teeth white and their discussions showed how much they care for their children for example they brush teeth with soil or herbs boil water with a medicine that protects them from bacteria or drink a lot of milk also as adults while their children only drink milk until they are two or three years old i used soil to brush my teeth till they become white i do not think this solves the problem because my teeth became too light and weak and continuing with soil brushing they could have cracked i use herbs known us sununi or loisuki to brush my teeth but we do not know if they prevent tooth decay mostly i drink soups or fats from the cow and so i mix it with herbs but i cannot mix it with water only because it might have side effects we only give children water once or twice a day with boiled medicine called endemelua specific for children it also protects from fluoride in water including bacteria you just boil together with the water we use exclusive milk for children until they are 2 3 years old we give children very little water we use milk here and maasai say that if they drink milk they will have white teeth they only drink a lot of milk and porridge we don t start to feed eat our children earlier children only eat goat oil and mothers milk until they are one year after that they start with animal s milk maasai use milk even when they are adults some maasai in lemanda are badly affected by fluoride because nowadays they have less cattle or their animals do not give birth regularly affecting their milk production we do not have traditional cure we only buy painkillers from shops to relieve the pain the ultimate remedy whenever we have tooth ache because of decay is removing it 3 3 attitudes towards the use of filtered water and perceived costs of defluoridators attitudes towards defluoridated water was challenging to investigate in terms of perceived benefits as only about 30 of respondents had consumed or consume it these participants showed positive attitudes towards defluoridated water because they could experience benefits in terms of taste and impact on their health they stated that defluoridated water tastes sweet and that they felt different because in the morning their bones were lighter than when they drank unfiltered water yes we pick water from our borehole and take it to catholic dioceses of nakuru for treatment the treated water is very sweet and cool when we were supplied with the buckets i used them for about five months when i used defluoridated water it felt different when i woke up in the morning i felt my bones lighter and you do not fill thirsty a lot of times i used filtered water and it was different despite these positive evaluations participants attitudes towards filtered water was also influenced by perceived costs of the defluoridator shown to them some participants stated that they were willing to make a financial sacrifice to get clean and safe water and perceived the defluoridator as a means to save money getting rid of the high price that they must pay for treated water water is life and we can also sacrifice to ensure that we have it clean and safe yes because the purification containers from catholic are very expensive they are being sold at ksh 12 000 however other participants while accepting its usefulness questioned the affordability of the proposed defluoridator poverty appeared to affect the opportunity cost incurred by the adoption of the new device dramatically maasai and meru participants perceived the proposed filtered device to be expensive also when the facilitator explained that the cost of this defluoridator 220 us and its cost of maintenance ocp about 0 02 us per litre of treated water could be obtained with a discount of about 35 of in case of mass production many participants declared that they would not be able to afford to pay for it in cash but that they would be able to pay in instalments i will be one to use filters but the biggest problem is its cost just consider the cost and make it affordable to us this is a lot of money and i can t afford in to raise once and pay cash my first request is to make the defluoridator cheaper and affordable by the majority then i will prefer the instalment mode of payment furthermore interviewees disentangled the cost of the device from that of its maintenance basing their judgements on previous experience some of them were concerned that buying the device without having the financial resources to replace filters would not help them to get rid of fluorosis thus health benefits were traded off especially against hidden costs of the defluoridator determined by the cost that they should sustain to maintain the device efficiently in the long run this issue was also amplified by the lack of trust towards companies that had tried to introduce other defluoridators in their rural communities without disclosing the high hidden costs of these devices lack of transparency towards these companies clearly seemed to undermine attitudes towards the acceptance of the new device some participants called for help on behalf of donors who should recognise this bundling problem and subsidise maintenance costs using it will not be a burden maybe the cost of maintaining it there was a company that tried to intervene by constructing a tank and a treating plant at the borehole but the investor hiked the price of the treated water without consulting the community as a result the community resolved to use the borehole water in its untreated form now it also has a challenge after buying they wanted that every six months to pay you tsh 30 000 fees for them to come to you and to change the bones and the filter so if you miss it so much and you keep using that water you do not know whether the water is safe or not the cost of buying is very expensive and yet every month they will need money to change it thus you can find someone who fails to afford it and decide to use water with fluoride we only used the filter for 3 months and then they stopped filtering this company needs us to pay tsh 10 000 which we cannot afford the only hindrance might be the cost of buying these filters it is my wish that you find a means of subsidising it through donor support so that it is affordable the biggest problem is the poverty levels of most of the residents of this area 3 4 norms ability and self regulation towards the adoption of the new device the acceptance of the proposed defluoridator was influenced very much by the social pressure of maasai and meru rural communities most participants stated that people who are important to them would have approved the adoption of this device because it can help to solve health problems caused by unfiltered water however the strong influence of norms was clearer when participants were asked to choose between domestic and community defluoridators only ten participants exclusively preferred the domestic filter because it allowed them to bypass the long decisional process required by the installation of the community defluoridator to have control over household water demand personally with more responsibility and to manage lack of electricity more efficiently than community filters it is easier to use and to manage water demand in comparison to community filters and each person takes personal responsibility to take care of his her own filter it is better because community filters will take a long time for us to agree on many issues community filters will need free land to construct the filtering point and you see that will be a long process the household filter is good for now even with the manual operation while solar or electricity is being designed we need a filter and the one ready we will use we do not have access to electricity in our region for this reason the hand manual household filter is the best of us another 13 participants also opted for the domestic device but in this case their choice could only be accepted if the private filter would have been available to all or alternatively if a community filter would have also been available to the most vulnerable members of their communities for these participants the choice of the domestic defluoridator appears to be conditional to the improvement of the health status of the whole rural community this behaviour shows altruism and a strong sense of identity and protection towards the most vulnerable people in their communities i e the poor and children away from home for many hours of the day when at school i would prefer the household level filter only if everybody can have one we need the household one but we must be consulted as a community first i like if we get the small filter in every household because it is not very expensive but with the big filter we can put it in every village and this will be applicable to all people i would like all the people to get in the system because i see there is a problem in the society and i cannot be happy about it you just pray that the fluoride problem leaves us i like both the household level filter for my use and the community filter because some families cannot afford and some will not be able to manage the filter the community filter can be centrally managed and this is much better i would prefer the smaller one for my household use but propose the larger one for our schools where our children spend most of the time this sense of identity was even more evident for about 70 of maasai and meru who opted for the community filter preferences for the new device appeared to be dominated by a sense of belonging and a latent feeling of perceived disapproval towards the choice of the private filter to comply with social norms participants were willing to sacrifice their private health benefits for both altruism and solidarity towards the most vulnerable people and a better collective health status of their rural communities if the community could adopt this new filter system they themselves and many neighbours would feel happy to use fluoride filter water i prefer the filter for the whole village as opposed to the individual one everyone will benefit from clean water some people cannot afford the private filter their maintenance may be difficult and so its use i would like all the people to get in the system because i see there is a problem in the society and i cannot be happy about it you just pray that the fluoride problem leaves us i like the village filter so all of us can use it it is not being fair to have mine alone the community filter can be better because of poverty for some participants preferences for the community defluoridator were also influenced by its superiority to satisfy high demand of clean and safe water in terms of ability while some participants appeared to be sure regarding the implementation of the new defluoridator the majority of them were concerned about how to use it without having received adequate training because this is a very different way of managing water resources they expressed lack of ability in handling the defluoridator and adding powder but also lack of confidence to continue healthy drinking behaviour some participants stated that even if many things are delivered to them they fail to take advantage because without education they do not have confidence to perform the behaviour correctly the government and experts should invest in training programmes and education before introducing device because they represent authority are trusted and the benefits of the new device will be accepted i don t have problem to filter water and none will oppose its usage in my home i am going to talk to others to adopt it because if experts have confirmed that it is good for us we will appreciate it we do not know how to filter water we only put it in containers for storage the only thing is that we can educate people on proper utilization of water and how they can use that machine because the things that are brought to us should be approved by the government through the chief the chief should educate people because he is the chief and if he says this has a benefit we will accept because he is the leader i can say that we need education before these filters arrive we receive many things and no education and they always fail after a short time i am requesting for sustainable education that can last so that we can have long term help it would be bad if we receive the filters and we end up not achieving anything you experts should give us education how to use the filters in a safe way you can help us with seminars so that we can help each other to avoid more this fluoride problem this will allow us to us the filter and the water in a safer manner i encourage you to continue training us on the importance of filters so that we can embrace and accept this device continuous training will solve the many negative cultural believes and myths about deflouridation filters finally with regard to self regulation all participants expressed commitment towards the use of the filter and the time necessary to produce filtered water for their families will not affect their planned daily activities it doesn t waste time for me to filter water i am very sure that i will use the filters because it can help me i see i will use it i will not care for two hours to save my life even years and years every morning i will first filter water and i will make sure my family has enough safe drinking water i will be committed and i do not see any constraints also from my family because it is a solution to our problem we shall use it continuously i have liked the prototype equipment and i will use it because it has a solution to our water problems 4 discussion 4 1 influence of contextual factors the healthy drinking behaviour of people is dramatically affected by contextual factors and exacerbated by scarcity of water and high level of fluoride naturally contained in drinking and cooking water scarcity of water was also aggravated by its intermittence and high level of contamination to meet their needs of drinking cooking washing and watering animals participants must use multiple sources of surface water and groundwater during the dry season and harvest rainwater through iron sheet roof or plastic containers in the rainy season some maasai had to travel several kilometres to fulfil their needs expressing concerns over the location of water sources which was well above the of 200 m distance considered appropriate to ensure households daily water needs bartram and howard 2003 howard et al 2020 thus despite the effort and the different strategies that maasai and meru put in place to cope with quantity and quality water supply issues pedo climatic conditions high content of fluoride poverty and lack of infrastructure seriously challenge and threaten the life of people in the earv considering that several studies show a large scale of variability in space of fluoride in ground water ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 more attention should be paid to monitoring practices of this resource in terms of quantity and quality ligate et al 2021 to limit the impact of these contextual factors and to ensure the future sustainability of groundwater resources in earv regional groundwater databases containing all important water quality parameters could be established and updated with the collaboration of private and public sector ligate et al 2021 our findings also corroborate the enormous time and effort that women in these rural communities spend to manage water resources and to prevent water and sanitation related diseases afb 2015 the dynamic of these rural communities appears to be complex and strongly influenced by hofstede s cultural dimensions such as masculinity collectivism and long term orientation hofstede 1987 van der voorn 2008 thus it is important that these socio cultural dimensions are recognized by donors marketers and policy makers minasyan 2016 because lack of such knowledge may lead to cross cultural miscommunication and deficiencies in the participatory process required to nudge people toward the acceptance and implementation of these new defluoridator van der voorn 2008 cultural dimensions and hidden values such as the role of women in earv communities and cooperation across of families van der voorn 2008 could be integrated in the ranas model to further understand people s behaviour and nudge them towards the adoption of the healthy drinking behaviour 4 2 behavioural insights for policy makers and other stakeholders the results of the ranas model offer insights to think about how policy makers and marketers could reverse unhealthy drinking behaviour introducing technological devices that can cut the quantity of fluoride that is naturally contained in water nevertheless the majority of maasai and meru were aware of the link between fluorosis diseases and drinking water yet many believe that the water is safe thus to enhance risk knowledge in these rural communities policy makers could disseminate information about wrong beliefs and the relationship between unhealthy drinking behaviour and fluorosis diseases local authorities could visit these rural communities and stress that it is not possible to cure dental fluorosis using herbs or drinking milk but showing how everyday unhealthy drinking behaviour will lead to these diseases policy makers could also think about changing the unhealthy drinking habits of maasai and meru using behavioural techniques based on visual cues that have been adopted successfully in other contexts like coloured bins helping people to recycle rather than just throwing everything in the same container keramitsoglou and tsagarakis 2018 sörme at al 2019 or traffic light labels placed on food packaging to allow consumers to make more informed healthy choices sonnenberg et al 2013 thorndike et al 2014 for example the sites where maasai and meru collect water could be provided with signposts in different colours in relation to the severity of fluoride contained in water visual cues could alert maasai and meru about this relationship and push them to switch to more healthy drinking behaviour these signposts can help people living in these rural communities first to become aware of their ingrained unhealthy drinking habits and then to raise them to a conscious level because exposure to this information and reflection can help them to consider the merits of defluoridated water the mapping of visual cues in places at high levels of fluoride could be facilitated by the use of integrated geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and gis mapping tools ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 the integration of these techniques as well as providing information about water quality can allow earv rural communities and government to invest in the proposed filter systems in a more efficient way furthermore information campaigns conducted by governmental authorities and ngos as well as stressing the severity of the relationship between water and fluorosis diseases could emphasize key aspects of these findings in relation to attitudes norms and ability for example these messages could highlight the importance of drinking defluoritated water for adults and for children in particular because from focus group discussions concern for future generations emerged clearly as the majority of maasai and meru had never tried fluoride safe water communication campaigns could include witnesses of the few masaai and meru who have had the opportunity to consume and appreciate the benefits of the healthy drinking behaviour in terms of health and taste participants attitudes towards the adoption of healthy drinking behaviour were also strongly influenced by the cost of the new defluoridator costs were perceived as a barrier and several participants complained about bad experience with foreign companies that had tried to introduce similar technologies without disclosing hidden costs thus marketers who want to introduce this new device must first of all regain confidence towards maasai and meru and then be clear about the costs that must be incurred to buy the device and to filter water daily further research could explore how the elements of the ranas model could influence willingness to pay both for the defluoridator and for the powder necessary to filter water therefore as the costs of the new device appear to influence its adoption in a strong way further studies should not only evaluate the private benefits of defluoritated water but also the public benefits derived from saving money for the reduced prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in these areas of the earv such information can help policy makers and donors to assess the net benefits of the adoption of the new technology and thus to decide what water policies could be implemented based on evidence considering the poverty of these rural communities these studies could help local governments and donors to understand to what extent the adoption of the new device could be introduced with or without subsidises the results of the ranas model also show that although people appear to be committed to the use and daily production of fluoride safe water foreign companies who wish to enter these markets should collaborate more with local authorities and invest in promotion and training programmes of the new defluoridator they should convey know how helping people to enact correct drinking behaviour and help rural communities to set up infrastructure norms towards the adoption of the proposed highlight strong sense of belonging and solidarity towards the most vulnerable members of these rural communities and thus support for infrastructure should be oriented towards filters used by the community more than for the adoption by single households 5 conclusion access to fluoride safe water is a fundamental human need and therefore a basic human right however in areas of the earv the consumption of contaminated water jeopardizes both the physical and social health of all people creating a sense of powerlessness and sadness in fighting dental and skeletal fluorosis this situation is an affront to human dignity which must be solved urgently to meet united nations sustainable development goals three and six to meet such goals more collaboration and investments are necessary on behalf of governments international organisations and donors to fund large projects involving multidisciplinary research teams and private companies that can identify the best contextual solutions behavioural changing techniques and policies that can help rural communities of the earv to change their unhealthy drinking habits funding the research was ﬁnancially supported by the flowered project a horizon 2020 european funded project grant agreement n 690378 www floweredproject org en index php declaration

11747,the presence of fluoride in drinking water can have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of dental caries when its concentration lies in the optimal range of 0 5 0 7 mg l however fluoride intake below and above this range can have negative effects on tooth enamel and skeletal fluorosis in case of prolonged exposure to high concentrations unfortunately in some areas of the world such as rural communities of the east african rift valley earv water is dramatically contaminated by fluoride which may cause dental and skeletal fluorosis because its concentration is often well above the maximum threshold of 1 5 mg l recommended by the world health organisation to tackle this problem experts and policy makers have attempted to introduce defluoridation techniques that as well as being cost effective allow end users to drastically reduce the level of fluoride below the above mentioned threshold however the adoption of these techniques remains quite low because behavioural factors inﬂuencing people s safer water consumption in these areas of the world is poorly understood to fill such a gap in this study we explore how these factors can influence the adoption of a new defluoridator in kenyan and tanzanian rural communities of the earv to achieve this objective 75 people belonging to maasai and meru ethnic groups were interviewed running nine focus groups where these factors were investigated using the ranas risk attitude norm ability self regulation model results show that the drinking behaviour of people living in the earv is dramatically affected by contextual factors and exacerbated by the high level of fluoride naturally contained in drinking and cooking water behavioural insights into how policy makers and marketers could reverse this unhealthy drinking behaviour introducing technological devices that can cut the quantity of fluoride contained naturally are discussed arguing in favour of the possibility of using different behaviour changing techniques graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water fluoride attitudes knowledge risk norms 1 introduction and background excessive fluoride in drinking water affects living conditions and health status of approximately 200 million people worldwide especially in countries such as india china argentina and mexico in africa high fluoride groundwater levels have been reported mostly in the east african rift valley earv that originates in eritrea and extends through ethiopia kenya and tanzania and to malawi ijumulana et al 2020 this problem is accelerated by young volcanic activities occurrence of thermal waters especially those with high ph gases emitted from earth s crust granitic and gneissic rocks ijumulana et al 2020 2021 in kenya and tanzania health problems caused by dental and skeletal fluorosis are associated with high fluoride content contained naturally in surface and groundwater and this correlation has been documented since 1944 grech and latham 1964 in kenia the population exposed to high fluoride intake is estimated at 7 million coetsiers et al 2008 while in tanzania ten million people suffer from the same problem as highlighted by the tanzanian ministry of water and irrigation hawkins 2010 the central kenya rift and arusha district in tanzania where this study was conducted are the regions of the earv most affected by this problem in kenya the highest levels of fluoride in groundwater are found in the volcanic areas of the earv with nairobi and central provinces reporting the highest value of fluoride as 1 640 mg l and 2 800 mg l respectively in lakes elmentaita and nakuru malago et al 2017 in arusha in the area surrounded by mount meru this problem is determined by the relationship between its geology and hydrogeology as described by ghiglieri et al 2010 hydrogeological units host aquifers with different qualities of groundwater where high values of fluoride up to 68 mg l were recorded ghiglieri et al 2010 2012 tomašek et al 2022 studies conducted in this region show that the occurrence of fluoride is space dependent and the presence of many sources with high and few with low fluoride concentrations is one of the challenges affecting the blending technology adopted by arusha urban water supply authority ijumulana et al 2020 2021 as groundwater is the main water resource for human and agricultural needs the geological and hydrogeological conformation of the geographical areas described above seriously challenge the health of people living in rural communities e g about 25 of the tanzanian population depends entirely on groundwater for drinking ligate et al 2021 ijumulana et al 2022 according to the world health organisation who epidemiological evidence suggests that systemic fluoride intake of drinking and cooking water above 1 5 mg l can carry an increased risk of dental fluorosis while progressively higher concentrations lead to risks of skeletal fluorosis ward et al 2009 therefore where the fluoride concentration of groundwater for human consumption might be over beyond 40 mg l dental and skeletal fluorosis dramatically affect the life of kenyan and tanzanian rural communities tekle haimanot et al 2006 ghiglieri et al 2012 njuguna et al 2020 about 90 of people living in these areas are affected by dental fluorosis at different stages of severity and dental and skeletal fluorosis are recognized health problems vuhahula et al 2009 the difficulty to reduce very high levels of fluoride contained in surface and groundwater forced policy makers to set a higher standard of fluoride concentration than that established by the who 1 5 mg l because the latter cannot be guaranteed with the available technology and current socio economic conditions of these rural communities malago et al 2017 for example the standard water fluoride concentration recommended by the tanzania bureau of standards was fixed at 4 mg l due to lack of reliable defluoridation technologies especially in the semiarid rural area mbabaye et al 2018 however recently the standard water fluoride concentration recommended by water supply and sanitation authority of the tanzanian government has been reduced from 4 mg l to the who recommended level of 1 5 mg l ewura 2020 strategies to solve groundwater fluoride contamination are based on an in depth knowledge of the hydrogeology of an area that can help local and government agencies to build wells that intercept good quality water and development of defluoridation methods several defluoridation methods have been extensively studied exploiting different technologies yadav et al 2018 such as reverse osmosis membrane and nanofiltration electrodialysis or various adsorbent and ion exchanger material e g ldh bauxite red soil bio sorbent and bone char and coagulation and precipitation methods e g nalgonda technique calcium based material although a few studies indicate that these different defluoridation technologies effectively remove fluoride from water an applicable and reliable method has not yet been developed due to various contraindications regarding the technical viability and economic feasibility especially for their use in rural areas ayoob et al 2008 usually these technologies are simple and have a relatively low costs of adoption but the reasons behind their poor acceptance and lack of sustainability appear to be complex peal evans van der voorden 2010 argue that poor technology acceptance and use of water quality interventions is affected by the hygiene and sanitation tools of the hardware e g defluoridation devices and by the use of software for example hardware constraints prevent a large scale use of the bone char method especially in rural areas albertus et al 2000 software used to manage these defluoridation devices requires interaction of human beings in a cultural and social sensitive environment that makes it difficult to promote health drinking behaviour through the adoption of new technologies makutsa et al 2001 peal evans and van der voorden 2010 furthermore as fluoride concentration in water is not constant the monitoring of defluoridation performance is a mandatory activity this activity is fundamental to identify when the sorbent material of defluoridation devices runs out and needs to be changed specific equipment and trained personnel are necessary to perform laboratory analyses necessary to identify the fluoride concentration at which these devices start their removal action mbabaye et al 2017 huber et al 2012 2013 2014 also found that the adoption of new defluoridation devices reducing fluoride in drinking water imply the uptake of new behaviour their studies emphasize the importance of acquiring a good knowledge of social and psychological factors behind the use of defluoridation devices this knowledge allows policy makers to plan behavioural change interventions that can encourage the population to adopt innovative technologies and consume drinking water containing acceptable levels of fluoride in order to fill such a gap this study aims at exploring what contextual and behavioural factors can influence the adoption of a new filter system helping kenyan and tanzanian rural communities to switch from untreated drinking water to safe defluoridated water to discover how this device could be accepted and introduced the following research questions were explored what are the water consumption habits and needs of people living in rural communities of the earv what are the difficulties that they face to satisfy their water needs how do people perceive water quality and its relationship with their health what are the behavioural factors that can influence the adoption of new device and healthy drinking behaviour what strategies or policies could be used to nudge rural communities towards healthy drinking behavioural changes the remainder of this paper is organised as follows section two will explain the methodological approach employed in this study to explore the acceptance of the new device section three will discuss results of focus groups conducted with rural communities of kenya and tanzania section four will discuss key findings of contextual and behavioural factors providing insights about policies that government and donors could implement to help these rural communities to adopt healthy drinking behaviour section five will conclude the study 2 methods the objective of this study was to explore via focus group discussion how contextual factors influence unhealthy drinking habits of these rural communities and how insights from behavioural factors affecting the acceptance of the new filter system described below can help rural communities of the earv to switch towards the consumption of fluoride safe water 2 1 characteristics of the new defluoridator an innovative filter system consisting of a new defluoridator device used in conjunction with the sorbent octacalcium phosphate as a means of fluoride removal was developed in the framework of the eu horizon2020 flowered project by idini et al 2019 1 1 for more information about the flowered project see http www floweredproject org this filter system called flowered defluoridator device was conceived with the scope of replicating the natural mechanism of fluoride absorption occurring in the human body and of being highly efficient in rural contexts fig 1 shows that this prototype works with a pump that can be powered by a car battery or a small solar panel system and in case of electricity black out can also work manually the application of the new device shows that a single sorbent dose of 80g can purify 20 l of waters reducing the fluoride contamination below the acceptable drinkable threshold even if the initial concentration of fluoride reaches 21 mg l it can also decrease its contamination by about 50 for extreme rich fluoride water without negative effects on the overall water quality idini et al 2019 2020 the filter uses a fixed amount of sorbent for every defluoridation cycle and at the end of the process a simple filter system removes the sorbent from the water this process was also tested in situ and results showed that this new device can defluoride water with 22 mg l of fluoride concentration well below the who suggested limit of 1 5 mg l in 2 h idini et al 2020 the functioning of this prototype was illustrated to focus group participants showing them fig 1 2 2 the ranas model and the focus group research protocol the adoption of this new defluoridator and the consumption of fluoride safe water can be influenced by many factors such as drinking habits risks connected with perceived vulnerability to illnesses severity and factual knowledge of dental and skeletal fluorosis diseases commitments to healthy drinking behaviour perceived personal capacity to use the devices in terms of daily routine huber mosler 2013 mulopo et al 2020 as the ranas risks attitudes norms abilities and self regulations model fits the exploration of these factors well we developed a focus group research protocol where open ended questions were framed around the elements of this conceptual framework the ranas model was developed by mosler 2012 and has been applied in several studies evaluating people s behaviour in developing in relation to the consumption of fluoride safe water huber et al 2012 huber and mosler 2013 huber et al 2014 entele and lee 2020 and arsenic safe water inauen et al 2013 2014 handwashing contzen et al 2015 lilje mosler 2018 cleaning of water storage containers stocker and mosler 2015 and access to and use of hygienic shared sanitation facilities tumwebaze and mosler 2014 2015 harter et al 2018 nunbogu et al 2019 the ranas model can be used in several steps of water sanitation and hygiene intervention programmes where researchers first use qualitative methods to identify possible behavioural factors and then quantitative tools to measure these factors in order to identify behavioural techniques and strategies to nudge people towards behavioural changes contzen and mosler 2015 insights about perceptions and preferences concerning drinking water quality have also been captured in several qualitative studies jones et al 2005 2007 ward et al 2009 but in this study key aspects of open ended questions were developed to collect information about the elements of the ranas model as illustrated in fig 2 the focus group research protocol was divided into three sections the first sections had the scope of warming up the discussion introducing the project the research theme and to collect information about gender age education and family size of participants participants also received explanations of the role undertaken by the facilitator and that audio recordings would have only been used for the purpose of this study without disclosing their identity they were told to express their opinions freely because their opinions matter and that there were no right or wrong answers sections two and three contained open ended questions related to the ranas model that the moderator asked to participants of selected kenyan and tanzanian rural communities of the earv section two aimed at eliciting information related to contextual factors characterised by social physical and personal contexts influencing water needs management and drinking habits the moderator triggered the discussion around questions exploring sources and availability of water in their villages management and consumption of these resources and the price that they pay for safe and unsafe water section three opened informing interviewees that according to the who more than 200 million of individuals in the world were affected by elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water and that in their living area this impacts negatively on their health to trigger the discussion around the behavioural elements of the ranas model this information was coupled with pictures of people affected by dental and skeletal fluorosis this allowed the moderator to explore participants knowledge of these diseases beliefs and perceived risk of their families when drinking unsafe water after having explored knowledge and risk the moderator explained how this new filter system works showing them fig 1 and highlighting that this device would be available to them both for domestic and community use villages and schools they were also informed that the domestic filter can produce 20 l of fluoride safe water each cycle while the community filter produces 1000 l of fluoride safe water each time the moderator concluded this short presentation stressing that the action of using the defluoridator must be part of the participants daily routine this explanation allowed the moderator to explore their attitudes towards unsafe and safe water obtained with the new device the approval of their communities for domestic and community filters their confidence in using the device and commitment towards the production of fluoride safe water 2 3 sampling and data analysis fig 3 shows the geographical area in which nine focus groups were conducted in october 2018 of the nine focus groups five were conducted interviewing maasai two in kenya and three in tanzania and four meru two in both countries participants of these two ethnic groups were located around nakuru in kenya and mount meru in tanzania zones highly affected by fluorosis in fact these villages were affected by a concentration of fluoride in surface and groundwater ranging between 2 and 18 mg l and thus well above the recommended limit of 1 5 mg l suggested by ward et al 2009 moreover four focus groups were conducted in three kenyan villages gilgil kipkenyo kambi ya moto and five focus groups in four tanzanian villages uwiro oldonyo sambu mkuru ngare nanyuki in each country two focus groups were conducted in the same village and participants were recruited with the help of researchers involved with h2020 flowered project and working for the university of eldoret in kenya and nelson mandela university and the ngo oykos in tanzania the recruitment started in july 2018 contacting the heads of these seven villages who in turn selected focus group participants to be eligible interviewees were required not to have had any experience with focus group discussions to be involved with decisions regarding drinking water for their families and to give their consent to participation and audio recording the interviews were conducted in swahili and maa maasai dialect by one of the authors and by researchers from the institutions mentioned above who took notes on the discussions and group interactions the audio recorded tapes were then translated into english and checked for accuracy by the research team to analyse this data we followed strategies provided by the literature on qualitative data i e reducing data into a manageable size in order to allow fundamental identification of themes and following the theoretical aspects of the proposed conceptual framework bazeley 2013 jackson and bazeley 2019 thus the interviewee s responses were coded into themes related to the ranas model and entered in nvivo 12 the most interesting aspects of these discussions will be reported in italics in the results chapter furthermore because of the relatively high total number of participants where possible some answers where coded and imported into ibmspps to explore mean differences and correlations between maasai and meru performing independent sample t tests and χ 2 square tests 3 results seventy five maasai and meru were interviewed in total and their socio demographic characteristics by focus group can be observed in table 1 the total number of participants was more or less equally distributed by gender 52 male and by country 53 tanzania while for ethnicity more maasai 59 were interviewed because the village leader of focus group three recruited more participants than other leaders furthermore many participants were aged between 31 and 50 59 educated at primary and secondary school 46 and had a family size of between two and five people 41 3 1 understanding management and needs of water resources for domestic uses as regards water collection and administration 86 of participants stated that generally females are responsible for these activities while men in some cases help women with fetching water the total daily average of water collected and used by participants was 100 36 s 43 16 and 81 89 s 38 72 litres in kenya and tanzania respectively and this difference was not significant to the independent sample t test t 1 81 d f 63 p 0 07 we also explored these differences between maasai and meru in both countries in kenya for maasai the daily average stated water consumption was higher than that indicated by meru but these differences were not significant to the independent sample t test 2 2 in kenya maasai s and meru s daily average water consumption were 106 s 31 12 and 93 85 s 54 55 litres respectively t 0 74 d f 26 p 0 47 while in tanzania they were 72 61 s 24 90 and 97 14 s 51 95 litres respectively t 1 94 d f 35 p 0 06 this was also the case for drinking and cooking water where a daily average of 20 l was observed however half the participants seemed to be concerned about water availability because it is not enough to satisfy their families needs and to serve an increasing population especially in relation to the quantity of safe drinking and cooking water maasai participants emphasized the use of water for pastoral purposes because they need to wash cows with medicine that kills insects and therefore sometimes they must use the water they fetch or buy to spray their animals quantity is also reduced both by animals that destroy water supply when they pass through the water channelling and by dirt which impedes people from collecting water some participants appeared to be so concerned about water scarcity that they were planning to migrate especially during the drought season i don t get my 200 l and it is problematic water because you can go for a whole day and pick up six buckets from the morning when you get up till ten o clock our water source satisfies us but sometimes with difficulty because animals destroy the source when they pass through the water channelling and thus they can delay two days the supply of water the population has increased so water is not enough especially during droughts distances and time in water collection appeared to be very important factors for water management according to united nations human settlements programme staff 2003 a distance of 200 m is considered appropriate to fetch water every day for family needs however only 41 3 of participants fetched water within the recommended who distance with maasai walking longer distances than meru on the average in order to fetch water masai walk 2 233 m while meru 784 m and this difference was significant to the independent sample t test t 2 48 d f 73 p 0 01 thus many housewives must spend a disproportionate part of the day in fetching water for the family s needs as confirmed in other studies bartram and howard 2003 graham et al 2016 furthermore water collection appears to be very demanding especially for some maasai participants it is within my neighbourhood and it is able to meet my needs but it serves people as far as 4 km it is roughly 10 km my wife could go using donkeys she takes the donkeys near the stream where the water is sold after she buys the three or four gallons she puts them on donkeys and then takes them home furthermore to cope with scarcity and the demanding time needed to fetch water during focus group interviews maasai and meru participants mentioned the use of different sources of water 260 and 255 times respectively fig 4 shows that in kenya boreholes were the most mentioned sources of water used by maasai 50 and meru 60 in tanzania rain was stated 66 7 by maasai and wells 63 by meru but in kenya the latter never reported wells furthermore water from rivers and lakes was never mentioned among participants of tanzanian rural communities while water gathered from rivers and lakes appeared to be more important for kenyan participants especially maasai 30 even though kenyan and tanzanian participants stated that they had to access and manage different sources of water they underlined again that this was a scarce resource that often is not enough to satisfy the needs of their households members and farm animals they used borehole water during the dry season while harvested and stored rainwater from march to may using strategies like an iron sheet roof or plastic containers boreholes were used more during the dry season because solar pump panels were not efficient during the rainy season during rainy season we get water from the river but in the dry season we use the borehole water the current water borehole does not supply enough because it is solar pumped and in some periods there is not enough sun to pump it the water source depends on solar hence it doesn t pump during the rainy season a long time ago the water was enough but the number of people has increased plus animals so it is not enough these days sometimes participants reduced the distance of fetching water taking advantage of gravity pipeline systems placed usually at the top of hills we use gravity since the hot spring water is at the top of the hill we fetch water from the borehole and piped water from koinaike piped water is available once a week for about 22 of participants the management of water resources is free because they stated that they do not pay anything for the water they fetch however other participants pay for untreated water either for each fetched bucket of water 20 l or a monthly flat fee system payment the latter payment was mentioned by two groups of maasai participants in tanzania where the flat fee covered the price of water and the maintenance of the boreholes for kenyan participants the price of one bucket of water ranged from kessh 2 us 0 02 to kessh 150 us 1 48 with an average price of kessh 15 us 0 15 in tanzania for the same bucket of water ranged from tzssh25 to tsh 500 with an average price of tzssh 226 us 0 098 the observed difference between the average prices of a bucket of water in kenya and tanzania was relevant and significant to the independent sample t test t 2 23 p 0 03 3 2 perceived risks of drinking water and knowledge and beliefs of fluorosis concern over the quality of water was amplified by perceived participants risk for safe drinking and cooking water in both countries only about 30 of maasai and meru participants perceived the water that they consume was safe in some cases their perception was backed up by the opinion of experts non governmental agencies and water companies supplying water for other participants the perceived quality of water was just backed up by their beliefs for example they believed that water is safe because they use it without any treatment or because they see that it does not alter the colour of the food they consume we believe that the water is good because it is from underground and experts said it is good the water i buy is clean water because it comes from a water supply company that get water from welewa i just believe that water is safe because we have been using it without treating it however the majority of maasai and meru participants perceived that water was of bad quality and unsafe because they were exposed to health risks caused by dirtiness and high levels of fluoride water is polluted and contaminated by worms and bacteria and sometimes they must share water with wild animals the tap water is dirty this will be a problem especially due to how we live our lives at times the water i use is evidently not clean it might be as a result of varying rates of contaminations and pollutions as it flows downstream the water for the people and the cattle should be purified from the source of the river they expressed concern over high levels of fluoride in drinking water for themselves future generations but also for livestock and agriculture because fluoride is transferred to food and will affect their health many maasai and meru were also worried about their children when they go to school and thus advise them to take a bottle of safe water from home some participants stated that drinking water has a bad taste and is too salty and they defined this type of water that they drink as isokot the water has a lot of salts such that when left to settle in containers it leaves crystal behind consumed water also has magadi maasai do not understand fluoride it is only these days we know from experts but as maasais we say isokot meaning water with bad taste water with magadi tastes bad and then we understand that water is not good the future generation is at risk of so many health related problems if they will continue to use this water without treating it most of them will have no teeth with crippled legs discussion triggered by pictures of dental and skeletal fluorosis showed that these two diseases were well known across participants and that other than three participants they were aware that the cause was water or food contaminated by fluoride the problem of teeth comes from water and our ancestors told us that the water has a problem making the teeth to look like this because where i was born in makuyuni there are no such disorders when i came and saw the children here i knew it was the water it is also in the foods we eat because the fluoride water is also used to irrigate vegetables so even in foods fluoride is located i do not know i am not sure if it is the water we consume initially we thought the problem in children was as a result of consuming sweets and sugar foodstuffs but later we realized it was not the cause our kids do not eat sweets and yet they are affected prevalence of dental fluorosis appeared to be higher than skeletal fluorosis with nearly 67 of participants households affected by dental fluorosis and only about 17 by skeletal fluorosis in each country no significant differences were observed between maasai and meru participants 3 3 in kenya 75 of maasai and 93 3 of meru stated that they had dental fluorosis in their families χ 2 2 03 d f 1 p 0 15 while in tanzania only 58 3 of maasai and 43 8 of meru declared to have this health problem χ 2 0 82 d f 1 p 0 37 but country comparison shows that dental fluorosis was more prevalent across kenyan households and this difference was significant to the χ 2 test χ 2 7 74 d f 1 p 0 005 as shown in fig 5 this result was likely to be influenced by participants of the mukuru village focus group 5 who stated that their village was not affected neither by dental nor by skeletal fluorosis even if they were aware of the consequences of these diseases in other villages included in this study i have not seen such problems here in our village but in other areas like oldonyo sambu and ngabobo regions the link between the cause and consequences of dental fluorosis emerged clearly during focus group discussions this pattern is evident from the word cloud in fig 6 which depicts the most frequently occurring words emerging from focus group discussions water use were the most recurrent words and they were linked to the management of this resource and to problems caused by fluoride water to their health fig 6 seems to indicate that participants retrieved information following a network of semantic nodes vogel and wanke 2016 where central words more frequent with larger font could represent nodes activated by pictures from their memory while more distant words were activated later less frequent word with smaller fonts thus the most recurrent words water problem fluorosis teeth etc activated concern because it was brown coloured tooth decay and loss of teeth that affect their children families and neighbours participants highlighted that this problem starts in their childhood and inflicts pain and psychological discomfort because sometime people take joke about them and as a result they feel ugly i took two children to nairobi to stay far and use better water i feel bad because these people were not born like these conditions i am one of those affected and my children are affected my teeth were brown like these one and i do not like them at all it started from my childhood we have cases in my family but they are at the early stages of dental fluorosis i am the one affected and future generations are at risk of so many health problems if they will continue to use this water without treating it yes children are at the initial stages of fluorosis while adults have reached the advanced levels and some have already lost their teeth initially their teeth were white but the more they use they use this water the more their teeth turn brown and then started to break besides i am also a victim 10 of my teeth have started to crack in these two photos i see myself i am sure the water is toxic my teeth are bad and people even joke that i smoke cigarettes and i cannot refuse them how can i refuse that my teeth are coloured even if skeletal fluorosis was less prevalent than dental fluorosis the description of its negative health effects was severely described by many maasai and meru participants women were hit more than men and they were sad and concerned about ageing because this process will affect them earlier and more suddenly than in a situation where human beings have enough economic resources to access clean and safe water children were described as having big heads and the occurrence of bowlegs in adults dramatically affect their well being inflicting physical and psychological suffering their knees are weak bodies cannot stand straight and they find it difficult to stand up straight way but only after having walked for a while walking is painful working is hard and people feel a sense of tiredness and show signs of resignation to fight against fluorosis because of poverty poverty does not offer them many water alternatives and they are forced to choose just between lethal and survival health choices i e dying from typhoid or getting fluorosis it is not just bowlegs the body cannot stand straight you cannot also turn the neck very harmful to the bones the body is tired people cannot run and if a person falls slightly they get broken very easily experts say that it also reduces the ability of the brain the brain system lowers down and this is because people use fluoride water without filter we have bowed like them the other day i was passing through the south part of the village i was really sad a lady is old but because of the water the knees are weak and the back bowed i see people hide and i would cry because when i see that my conscious is disturbed children are suffering they have big heads the schools are far so they fail because of the way they are affected until now the problem has no solution i fear a lot this is disability brought by water and when we reach 50 years old we cannot walk completely you can see a woman today and tomorrow she is old long time ago old people had too much energy but nowadays at 40 years men cannot do any labour jobs many women after a few births cannot even leave the house the legs are bowed and then the man is also disabled we cannot even have more children women are affected more if we are invited to a meeting and asked to sit down that is the day you will laugh at people in this area when a woman wants to stand up she will kneel down and start to stand up like an aeroplane taking off in the runway she will stand straight in about 50 m from here poverty is the only reason why we constantly consume this water before using boreholes river rongai used to be the main source of drinking water however the major problem with river was typhoid because it killed so many people as a result it is better to drink fluoride water than dying from typhoid a sense of powerlessness in fighting these diseases was also evident by the fact that the majority of participants think that there are no methods to prevent fluorosis other than using painkillers or procedures based on beliefs that circulate within their rural communities these procedures are used especially for keeping their teeth white and their discussions showed how much they care for their children for example they brush teeth with soil or herbs boil water with a medicine that protects them from bacteria or drink a lot of milk also as adults while their children only drink milk until they are two or three years old i used soil to brush my teeth till they become white i do not think this solves the problem because my teeth became too light and weak and continuing with soil brushing they could have cracked i use herbs known us sununi or loisuki to brush my teeth but we do not know if they prevent tooth decay mostly i drink soups or fats from the cow and so i mix it with herbs but i cannot mix it with water only because it might have side effects we only give children water once or twice a day with boiled medicine called endemelua specific for children it also protects from fluoride in water including bacteria you just boil together with the water we use exclusive milk for children until they are 2 3 years old we give children very little water we use milk here and maasai say that if they drink milk they will have white teeth they only drink a lot of milk and porridge we don t start to feed eat our children earlier children only eat goat oil and mothers milk until they are one year after that they start with animal s milk maasai use milk even when they are adults some maasai in lemanda are badly affected by fluoride because nowadays they have less cattle or their animals do not give birth regularly affecting their milk production we do not have traditional cure we only buy painkillers from shops to relieve the pain the ultimate remedy whenever we have tooth ache because of decay is removing it 3 3 attitudes towards the use of filtered water and perceived costs of defluoridators attitudes towards defluoridated water was challenging to investigate in terms of perceived benefits as only about 30 of respondents had consumed or consume it these participants showed positive attitudes towards defluoridated water because they could experience benefits in terms of taste and impact on their health they stated that defluoridated water tastes sweet and that they felt different because in the morning their bones were lighter than when they drank unfiltered water yes we pick water from our borehole and take it to catholic dioceses of nakuru for treatment the treated water is very sweet and cool when we were supplied with the buckets i used them for about five months when i used defluoridated water it felt different when i woke up in the morning i felt my bones lighter and you do not fill thirsty a lot of times i used filtered water and it was different despite these positive evaluations participants attitudes towards filtered water was also influenced by perceived costs of the defluoridator shown to them some participants stated that they were willing to make a financial sacrifice to get clean and safe water and perceived the defluoridator as a means to save money getting rid of the high price that they must pay for treated water water is life and we can also sacrifice to ensure that we have it clean and safe yes because the purification containers from catholic are very expensive they are being sold at ksh 12 000 however other participants while accepting its usefulness questioned the affordability of the proposed defluoridator poverty appeared to affect the opportunity cost incurred by the adoption of the new device dramatically maasai and meru participants perceived the proposed filtered device to be expensive also when the facilitator explained that the cost of this defluoridator 220 us and its cost of maintenance ocp about 0 02 us per litre of treated water could be obtained with a discount of about 35 of in case of mass production many participants declared that they would not be able to afford to pay for it in cash but that they would be able to pay in instalments i will be one to use filters but the biggest problem is its cost just consider the cost and make it affordable to us this is a lot of money and i can t afford in to raise once and pay cash my first request is to make the defluoridator cheaper and affordable by the majority then i will prefer the instalment mode of payment furthermore interviewees disentangled the cost of the device from that of its maintenance basing their judgements on previous experience some of them were concerned that buying the device without having the financial resources to replace filters would not help them to get rid of fluorosis thus health benefits were traded off especially against hidden costs of the defluoridator determined by the cost that they should sustain to maintain the device efficiently in the long run this issue was also amplified by the lack of trust towards companies that had tried to introduce other defluoridators in their rural communities without disclosing the high hidden costs of these devices lack of transparency towards these companies clearly seemed to undermine attitudes towards the acceptance of the new device some participants called for help on behalf of donors who should recognise this bundling problem and subsidise maintenance costs using it will not be a burden maybe the cost of maintaining it there was a company that tried to intervene by constructing a tank and a treating plant at the borehole but the investor hiked the price of the treated water without consulting the community as a result the community resolved to use the borehole water in its untreated form now it also has a challenge after buying they wanted that every six months to pay you tsh 30 000 fees for them to come to you and to change the bones and the filter so if you miss it so much and you keep using that water you do not know whether the water is safe or not the cost of buying is very expensive and yet every month they will need money to change it thus you can find someone who fails to afford it and decide to use water with fluoride we only used the filter for 3 months and then they stopped filtering this company needs us to pay tsh 10 000 which we cannot afford the only hindrance might be the cost of buying these filters it is my wish that you find a means of subsidising it through donor support so that it is affordable the biggest problem is the poverty levels of most of the residents of this area 3 4 norms ability and self regulation towards the adoption of the new device the acceptance of the proposed defluoridator was influenced very much by the social pressure of maasai and meru rural communities most participants stated that people who are important to them would have approved the adoption of this device because it can help to solve health problems caused by unfiltered water however the strong influence of norms was clearer when participants were asked to choose between domestic and community defluoridators only ten participants exclusively preferred the domestic filter because it allowed them to bypass the long decisional process required by the installation of the community defluoridator to have control over household water demand personally with more responsibility and to manage lack of electricity more efficiently than community filters it is easier to use and to manage water demand in comparison to community filters and each person takes personal responsibility to take care of his her own filter it is better because community filters will take a long time for us to agree on many issues community filters will need free land to construct the filtering point and you see that will be a long process the household filter is good for now even with the manual operation while solar or electricity is being designed we need a filter and the one ready we will use we do not have access to electricity in our region for this reason the hand manual household filter is the best of us another 13 participants also opted for the domestic device but in this case their choice could only be accepted if the private filter would have been available to all or alternatively if a community filter would have also been available to the most vulnerable members of their communities for these participants the choice of the domestic defluoridator appears to be conditional to the improvement of the health status of the whole rural community this behaviour shows altruism and a strong sense of identity and protection towards the most vulnerable people in their communities i e the poor and children away from home for many hours of the day when at school i would prefer the household level filter only if everybody can have one we need the household one but we must be consulted as a community first i like if we get the small filter in every household because it is not very expensive but with the big filter we can put it in every village and this will be applicable to all people i would like all the people to get in the system because i see there is a problem in the society and i cannot be happy about it you just pray that the fluoride problem leaves us i like both the household level filter for my use and the community filter because some families cannot afford and some will not be able to manage the filter the community filter can be centrally managed and this is much better i would prefer the smaller one for my household use but propose the larger one for our schools where our children spend most of the time this sense of identity was even more evident for about 70 of maasai and meru who opted for the community filter preferences for the new device appeared to be dominated by a sense of belonging and a latent feeling of perceived disapproval towards the choice of the private filter to comply with social norms participants were willing to sacrifice their private health benefits for both altruism and solidarity towards the most vulnerable people and a better collective health status of their rural communities if the community could adopt this new filter system they themselves and many neighbours would feel happy to use fluoride filter water i prefer the filter for the whole village as opposed to the individual one everyone will benefit from clean water some people cannot afford the private filter their maintenance may be difficult and so its use i would like all the people to get in the system because i see there is a problem in the society and i cannot be happy about it you just pray that the fluoride problem leaves us i like the village filter so all of us can use it it is not being fair to have mine alone the community filter can be better because of poverty for some participants preferences for the community defluoridator were also influenced by its superiority to satisfy high demand of clean and safe water in terms of ability while some participants appeared to be sure regarding the implementation of the new defluoridator the majority of them were concerned about how to use it without having received adequate training because this is a very different way of managing water resources they expressed lack of ability in handling the defluoridator and adding powder but also lack of confidence to continue healthy drinking behaviour some participants stated that even if many things are delivered to them they fail to take advantage because without education they do not have confidence to perform the behaviour correctly the government and experts should invest in training programmes and education before introducing device because they represent authority are trusted and the benefits of the new device will be accepted i don t have problem to filter water and none will oppose its usage in my home i am going to talk to others to adopt it because if experts have confirmed that it is good for us we will appreciate it we do not know how to filter water we only put it in containers for storage the only thing is that we can educate people on proper utilization of water and how they can use that machine because the things that are brought to us should be approved by the government through the chief the chief should educate people because he is the chief and if he says this has a benefit we will accept because he is the leader i can say that we need education before these filters arrive we receive many things and no education and they always fail after a short time i am requesting for sustainable education that can last so that we can have long term help it would be bad if we receive the filters and we end up not achieving anything you experts should give us education how to use the filters in a safe way you can help us with seminars so that we can help each other to avoid more this fluoride problem this will allow us to us the filter and the water in a safer manner i encourage you to continue training us on the importance of filters so that we can embrace and accept this device continuous training will solve the many negative cultural believes and myths about deflouridation filters finally with regard to self regulation all participants expressed commitment towards the use of the filter and the time necessary to produce filtered water for their families will not affect their planned daily activities it doesn t waste time for me to filter water i am very sure that i will use the filters because it can help me i see i will use it i will not care for two hours to save my life even years and years every morning i will first filter water and i will make sure my family has enough safe drinking water i will be committed and i do not see any constraints also from my family because it is a solution to our problem we shall use it continuously i have liked the prototype equipment and i will use it because it has a solution to our water problems 4 discussion 4 1 influence of contextual factors the healthy drinking behaviour of people is dramatically affected by contextual factors and exacerbated by scarcity of water and high level of fluoride naturally contained in drinking and cooking water scarcity of water was also aggravated by its intermittence and high level of contamination to meet their needs of drinking cooking washing and watering animals participants must use multiple sources of surface water and groundwater during the dry season and harvest rainwater through iron sheet roof or plastic containers in the rainy season some maasai had to travel several kilometres to fulfil their needs expressing concerns over the location of water sources which was well above the of 200 m distance considered appropriate to ensure households daily water needs bartram and howard 2003 howard et al 2020 thus despite the effort and the different strategies that maasai and meru put in place to cope with quantity and quality water supply issues pedo climatic conditions high content of fluoride poverty and lack of infrastructure seriously challenge and threaten the life of people in the earv considering that several studies show a large scale of variability in space of fluoride in ground water ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 more attention should be paid to monitoring practices of this resource in terms of quantity and quality ligate et al 2021 to limit the impact of these contextual factors and to ensure the future sustainability of groundwater resources in earv regional groundwater databases containing all important water quality parameters could be established and updated with the collaboration of private and public sector ligate et al 2021 our findings also corroborate the enormous time and effort that women in these rural communities spend to manage water resources and to prevent water and sanitation related diseases afb 2015 the dynamic of these rural communities appears to be complex and strongly influenced by hofstede s cultural dimensions such as masculinity collectivism and long term orientation hofstede 1987 van der voorn 2008 thus it is important that these socio cultural dimensions are recognized by donors marketers and policy makers minasyan 2016 because lack of such knowledge may lead to cross cultural miscommunication and deficiencies in the participatory process required to nudge people toward the acceptance and implementation of these new defluoridator van der voorn 2008 cultural dimensions and hidden values such as the role of women in earv communities and cooperation across of families van der voorn 2008 could be integrated in the ranas model to further understand people s behaviour and nudge them towards the adoption of the healthy drinking behaviour 4 2 behavioural insights for policy makers and other stakeholders the results of the ranas model offer insights to think about how policy makers and marketers could reverse unhealthy drinking behaviour introducing technological devices that can cut the quantity of fluoride that is naturally contained in water nevertheless the majority of maasai and meru were aware of the link between fluorosis diseases and drinking water yet many believe that the water is safe thus to enhance risk knowledge in these rural communities policy makers could disseminate information about wrong beliefs and the relationship between unhealthy drinking behaviour and fluorosis diseases local authorities could visit these rural communities and stress that it is not possible to cure dental fluorosis using herbs or drinking milk but showing how everyday unhealthy drinking behaviour will lead to these diseases policy makers could also think about changing the unhealthy drinking habits of maasai and meru using behavioural techniques based on visual cues that have been adopted successfully in other contexts like coloured bins helping people to recycle rather than just throwing everything in the same container keramitsoglou and tsagarakis 2018 sörme at al 2019 or traffic light labels placed on food packaging to allow consumers to make more informed healthy choices sonnenberg et al 2013 thorndike et al 2014 for example the sites where maasai and meru collect water could be provided with signposts in different colours in relation to the severity of fluoride contained in water visual cues could alert maasai and meru about this relationship and push them to switch to more healthy drinking behaviour these signposts can help people living in these rural communities first to become aware of their ingrained unhealthy drinking habits and then to raise them to a conscious level because exposure to this information and reflection can help them to consider the merits of defluoridated water the mapping of visual cues in places at high levels of fluoride could be facilitated by the use of integrated geostatistical techniques spatial statistical methods and gis mapping tools ijumulana et al 2020 2021 2022 the integration of these techniques as well as providing information about water quality can allow earv rural communities and government to invest in the proposed filter systems in a more efficient way furthermore information campaigns conducted by governmental authorities and ngos as well as stressing the severity of the relationship between water and fluorosis diseases could emphasize key aspects of these findings in relation to attitudes norms and ability for example these messages could highlight the importance of drinking defluoritated water for adults and for children in particular because from focus group discussions concern for future generations emerged clearly as the majority of maasai and meru had never tried fluoride safe water communication campaigns could include witnesses of the few masaai and meru who have had the opportunity to consume and appreciate the benefits of the healthy drinking behaviour in terms of health and taste participants attitudes towards the adoption of healthy drinking behaviour were also strongly influenced by the cost of the new defluoridator costs were perceived as a barrier and several participants complained about bad experience with foreign companies that had tried to introduce similar technologies without disclosing hidden costs thus marketers who want to introduce this new device must first of all regain confidence towards maasai and meru and then be clear about the costs that must be incurred to buy the device and to filter water daily further research could explore how the elements of the ranas model could influence willingness to pay both for the defluoridator and for the powder necessary to filter water therefore as the costs of the new device appear to influence its adoption in a strong way further studies should not only evaluate the private benefits of defluoritated water but also the public benefits derived from saving money for the reduced prevalence of dental and skeletal fluorosis in these areas of the earv such information can help policy makers and donors to assess the net benefits of the adoption of the new technology and thus to decide what water policies could be implemented based on evidence considering the poverty of these rural communities these studies could help local governments and donors to understand to what extent the adoption of the new device could be introduced with or without subsidises the results of the ranas model also show that although people appear to be committed to the use and daily production of fluoride safe water foreign companies who wish to enter these markets should collaborate more with local authorities and invest in promotion and training programmes of the new defluoridator they should convey know how helping people to enact correct drinking behaviour and help rural communities to set up infrastructure norms towards the adoption of the proposed highlight strong sense of belonging and solidarity towards the most vulnerable members of these rural communities and thus support for infrastructure should be oriented towards filters used by the community more than for the adoption by single households 5 conclusion access to fluoride safe water is a fundamental human need and therefore a basic human right however in areas of the earv the consumption of contaminated water jeopardizes both the physical and social health of all people creating a sense of powerlessness and sadness in fighting dental and skeletal fluorosis this situation is an affront to human dignity which must be solved urgently to meet united nations sustainable development goals three and six to meet such goals more collaboration and investments are necessary on behalf of governments international organisations and donors to fund large projects involving multidisciplinary research teams and private companies that can identify the best contextual solutions behavioural changing techniques and policies that can help rural communities of the earv to change their unhealthy drinking habits funding the research was ﬁnancially supported by the flowered project a horizon 2020 european funded project grant agreement n 690378 www floweredproject org en index php declaration

11748,the present study investigates the groundwater solute chemistry hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic as and the assessment of health risks through ingestion and dermal contact pathways to the adults and children of the bahraich district falling under the middle gangetic plain ghaghara river sub basin terai region of india a monte carlo simulation and a sensitivity analysis were also performed to quantify the uncertainties and impact of various input variables in risk calculations respectively concentrations major ions ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 po4 3 no3 hco3 f and cl dissolved organic carbon doc and trace metals as fe and mn as well as physical parameters ec ph and eh were measured on the collected groundwater and river water samples the concentration of as in the groundwater samples was found in range between 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l and 37 of the samples had as 10 μg l who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water river water samples also displayed high as concentrations mean of 14 μg l with 73 of samples having as 10 μg l which could be attributed to infiltration from as enriched sallow groundwater of the nearby regions the groundwater of the study area was predominantly of ca2 mg2 hco3 type bivariate weathering plots showed groundwater was influenced by silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution along with the ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes with a minor contribution from evaporate dissolution most of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations the observed values and correlations between various measured parameters including groundwater as concentrations and saturation indices calculations indicated the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide as the major process for as mobilization in the study area the results of total non carcinogenic risk hi estimated by the deterministic and probabilistic techniques were nearly identical for both adults and children but an overestimation was observed in the case of carcinogenic risk calculated by the deterministic approach health risk results also showed that children were more susceptible to non carcinogenic risk whereas adults were at a higher risk of cancer in the study area sensitivity analysis indicated that the concentration of as in groundwater and exposure duration ed were the most effective variables for non carcinogenic hi and carcinogenic tilcr risk estimation in both adults and children graphical abstract image 1 keywords middle gangetic plain arsenic geochemistry health

threat to millions of people in india as contamination in groundwater was initially reported in 1976 in punjab haryana and himachal pradesh datta and kaul 1976 later on several studies reported groundwater as contamination in the states of west bengal chhattisgarh bihar uttar pradesh jharkhand punjab and assam chatterjee et al 2018 de et al 2022 garat et al 1984 kumar et al 2016 2018 2021

stollenwerk 2002 sridharan and nathan 2017 several previous works have extensively investigated the release mechanism of as in groundwater for different regions worldwide and the reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions in younger alluvial sediments has been suggested as the primary mechanism of as release in groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 kumar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 1998 2000 the bahraich region study area falls under the terai belt of india in the ghaghara basin in the middle gangetic plains of uttar pradesh high as concentrations were reported by various studies in the terai regions of nepal close to the study area diwakar et al 2015 guillot et al 2015 gurung et al 2005 mueller and hug 2018 nakano et al 2014 williams et al 2005 the exposure of inorganic as at chronic levels has adverse effects on human health causing various diseases such as skin disorders cardiovascular diseases respiratory effects and neurological complications ahmad et al 1997 milton et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2003 wang et al 2007 hence quantifying the source and release processes of as in the aquifer and assessing the nature and probability of adverse health effects of as on the exposed human population is very crucial although areas lying in the terai regions of nepal have been extensively studied for groundwater as distribution and mobilization diwakar et al 2015 guillot et al 2015 gurung et al 2005 mueller and hug 2018 nakano et al 2014 williams et al 2005 but there is no systematic investigation of as distribution and mobilization in the current study area except for a previous study mehrotra et al 2016 that performed the mapping of as in bahraich region with gis techniques using uttar pradesh jal nigam data on as testing that was obtained using field kits and blanket testing approach between 2005 and 2008 this study aims to bridge the gap by not just focusing on quantifying the distribution and concentrations of as in groundwater of the study area but also inferring the mobilization mechanisms based on the new results besides there has been no focus on the deterministic or probabilistic health risk estimation due to the consumption of as polluted groundwater despite the fact that understanding the health risks of as is essential for implementing effective measures to improve the groundwater quality in this region hence this study aims to 1 quantify the extent and current status of as contamination and processes controlling the mobility of as in groundwater 2 determine the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk assessment of as using both deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment for adults and children in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study region bahraich fig 1 forms a part of the middle gangetic plain and lies in the terai region in the indian state of uttar pradesh it covers an area of around 4697 square km and is located in the ghaghara floodplain the ghaghara river originates from the matsatung glacier in the high himalayas of southern tibet near mansarowar lake and flows southeast through nepal and enters india via the bahraich district of uttar pradesh and meets the ganga river in the chapra district of bihar after traveling a course of around 1080 km singh and awasthi 2011 singh et al 2017 fig 1 shows the course of the ghagra river as it flows through the terai region of nepal and enters india via bahraich and its subsequent course as it flows through the bahraich district and provides details about the location geomorphology and sample collection locations of the study area 2 2 hydrogeology ghagra and saryu are the two main rivers of the bahraich district of which ghagra the major stream forms the western boundary of the district the entire district is part of the ghagra alluvial plain and can be clearly divided into two distinct units the older and newer alluvium fig 1 the older alluvium comprising the upland plains is of middle pleistocene age whereas the newer alluvium occupies the lowland plains of upper pleistocene to recent age krishnan 1960 mehrotra et al 2016 the north eastern area of the district is bounded by the bhabar tract followed by the tarai extending in the nne sse direction parallel to the trend of the shivalik hills mehrotra et al 2016 groundwater in the district is found to occur in the pore spaces of unconsolidated alluvial sediments such as clay kankar and sand in the zone of saturation rai 2012 the shallow aquifers occurring in unconfined conditions are separated by impermeable clay beds from the deeper aquifers which occur in semiconfined to confined states of disposition rai 2012 2 3 sample collection and preservation groundwater sampling in the bahraich district was carried out during june 2018 and november 2019 altogether 94 groundwater samples and 15 river samples were collected in acid pre washed plastic bottles for each sampling location three separate aliquots of samples were collected which included 1 one unfiltered and unacidified sample for alkalinity determination 60 ml 2 one filtered and unacidified sample for cations and anions analysis 60 ml and 3 one filtered and acidified sample for as mn and fe analysis 15 ml groundwater samples were collected from different depths of hand pumps tube wells and deep borings covering all 14 blocks of the district prior to sample collection the hand pumps were flushed for 15 20 min to expel any standing water following standard guidelines apha 1998 at the time of sample collection the important physical chemical parameters such as redox potential eh the activity of hydrogen ion concentration ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site through a portable multiparameter analyzer toshcon tpc 7 water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filter and preserved with 15 8 m hno 3 for the analysis of metals such as as mn and fe hco3 concentrations of the samples were determined using a titrimetric method on the same day of sampling the geographic coordinates of all sampling locations were determined by gps garmin etrex 30 accurate information about the depth of the hand pumps tube wells and deep boring wells was acquired from the owners of the wells and carefully documented samples were collected with water completely filled into the bottles ensuring that no air bubbles would be present within the samples the water samples were then taken right away to the lab where they were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until analysis 2 4 laboratory measurements the anions so4 2 po4 3 no3 hco3 f and cl and cations ca2 mg2 na k in the studied samples were analyzed using an ion chromatographic unit metrohm ic model 930 compact ic flux analytical facility in the geochemistry laboratory at iit roorkee with a detection limit of 0 005 mg l and an analytical precision of less than 3 the accuracy of the major cations and anion measurements was checked by calculating the cation anion charge balance using the following expression ionic charge balance t z t z t z t z where tz and tz are total cations and total anions respectively the ionic charge balance error was found to be within 10 for all samples the concentration of total as mn and fe were measured by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent technology 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms analytical facility at the institute instrumentation centre iit roorkee the instrument was linearly calibrated with icp multi element standard solution merck kgaa 64 271 germany for as fe and mn yielding r2 of 0 9986 the instrument detection limits of as mn and fe were 0 01 0 1 and 10 μg l respectively replicate analyses were carried out to check the precision of the results which was within the range of 10 for all samples for checking the accuracy of the as measurement standard reference material i e srm 1643f trace elements in water provided by national institute of standards and technology nist gaithersburg md usa was analyzed with the studied samples the mean as concentration measured with icp ms in srm was found very close to the certified value 57 4 μg l nist 2015 carlos and robert 2015 with a recovery of 95 the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in water samples were measured with an aurora toc 1030 analyzer attached to a rotary 1088 auto sampler using wet oxidation mode at 680 c with precision and a detection limit of 10 and 0 05 mg l respectively all the acids and reagents were of ultrapure analytical grade from merck darmstadt germany all the glassware and plastic vials used during analysis were pre cleaned by soaking in 1 hno3 for 24 h and then rinsing with ultrapure water 2 5 geochemical modeling and statistical analysis the saturation index si of the mineral phases in aquifer of the study area were calculated using phreeqc software interactive version 3 7 0 the si value of the minerals indicates the thermodynamic equilibrium i e oversaturation or undersaturation of those minerals in groundwater and hence predicts the possible mineral phases responsible for the presence of various solutes in groundwater before performing the statistical analysis normality test was conducted on the geochemical data using shapiro wilk and kolmogorov smirnova tests due to non normal distribution of the data spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between various physicochemical parameters table 5 table 4 shows the outcome of the factor analysis for groundwater samples that was carried out on log transformed data using statistical package for social sciences spss version 20 0 2 6 human health risk assessment human health risk assessment is a type of evaluation approach used to examine the potentially harmful effects on human health after prolonged exposure to a particular chemical pollutant like as us epa 1989 the possible exposure routes of as to the human population are ingestion dermal and inhalation however in the case of metals in groundwater ingestion and dermal exposure pathways are predominant kim et al 2004 saha et al 2017 while inhalation has been considered insignificant atsdr 2007 hence only ingestion and dermal exposures of groundwater as have been examined in the current study both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies were used to measure the risk for two exposed population sub classes adults and children following the protocols described by usepa 1996 2 6 1 chronic daily intake cdi the chronic daily intake cdi of as via ingestion and dermal pathways were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively following cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019 us epa 1989 zheng et al 2013 1 c d i i n g e s t i o n c i r e f e d b w a t 2 c d i d e r m a l c s a k p e t e f e d 10 b w a t where cdiingestion and cdidermal indicate the exposure dose mg kg 1day 1 via ingestion and dermal pathways respectively c is the measured as mg l concentration in water ir is the water ingestion rate l day 1 ef is the exposure frequency day year 1 ed is the exposure duration years at is the average time ed 365 bw is the body weight kg sa is the surface area of the skin exposed to pollutants cm2 kp is specific dermal permeability for as cm h 1 and et represents the exposure time h day 1 2 6 2 non carcinogenic risk the non carcinogenic risk assessment was carried by calculating the hazard quotient hq which is the ratio of the estimated chronic daily intake cdi to the reference dose rfd of as using eqs 3 and 4 3 hq ingestion c d i i n g e s t i o n r f d i n g e s t i o n 4 hq dermal c d i d e r m a l r f d d e r m a l where hqingestion and hqdermal are the non carcinogenic hazard quotients and rfdingestion and rfddermal are the reference doses for ingestion of water and dermal adsorption of water mgkg 1day 1 respectively to assess the overall potential non carcinogenic risks resulting from a combination of dermal and ingestion exposures the calculated hqingestion and hqdermal were added together and expressed as hazard index hi 5 h i h q i n g e s t i o n h q d e r m a l no harmful health impact is expected on the exposed population while hi 1 indicates the possibility of non carcinogenic health risk saha et al 2017 us epa 1989 yang et al 2012 2 6 3 carcinogenic risk the carcinogenic risk associated with as was estimated using the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr model which is the incremental probability of an individual developing cancer over a lifetime due to exposure to a potential carcinogen the ilcr was estimated using eqs 6 and 7 which is the product of chronic daily intake cdi and cancer slope risk factor csf 6 i l c r i n g e s t i o n c d i i n g e s t i o n c s f i n g e s t i o n 7 i l c r d e r m a l c d i d e r m a l c s f d e r m a l where ilcringestion and ilcrdermal are the carcinogenic risks of ingestion and dermal exposures to as csfingestion and csfdermal are the cancer slope factors for as through ingestion and dermal exposure mgkg 1day 1 1 respectively the total incremental lifetime cancer risk tilcr is calculated by eq 8 8 t i l c r i l c r i n g e s t i o n i l c r d e r m a l the accepted limit for carcinogenic risk is 1 10 6 which implies that 1 person in every million would develop cancer as a consequence of the exposure lim et al 2008 rahman et al 2017 the typical permissible limits are considered to be 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 and the risk 1 10 4 is considered unacceptable usepa 1999 yang et al 2012 2 6 4 monte carlo simulations mcs and sensitivity analyses risk calculation in a deterministic approach employs point or single values of input parameters to estimate the risk of a given population which results in compounding of the uncertainty in the model for example in the case of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment models ingestion rate of water body weight of adults and children concentrations of as in groundwater exposure frequency and duration are all sources of uncertainty that makes risk assessment evaluation somewhat complicated hence uncertainty is an inherent property of the human health risk assessment carried out by the deterministic approaches due to variations in environmental conditions and individual human characteristics uncertainties in these methods could result either in overestimation of the health risk which may cause the wastage of resources on unnecessary remediation efforts or underestimation of the health risk resulting in serious health consequences for the individuals exposed to the as contaminated groundwater orosun 2021 addressing the issue of uncertainty in risk estimation allows for a more realistic approach to the distribution of risk chen and liao 2006 giri et al 2020 to achieve this the monte carlo simulation mcs technique i e a probabilistic approach was employed using oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 850 in the mcs technique random values are continually selected from the probability distribution of a large number of inputted values in order to determine the probability distribution of risk karami et al 2019 orosun et al 2020 and minimize the uncertainties the descriptions of input parameters their values and probability distributions utilized in both deterministic and probabilistic mcs approaches are given in table s1 supplementary data normal lognormal and triangular probability distributions were employed for the variables in mcs in this study various goodness of fit tests e g kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and chi square tests were performed to determine the probability distribution of the measured as concentrations in groundwater the number of iterations for every run was set at 10 000 furthermore in order to identify the input parameters that have a significant impact on the output of risk assessment sensitivity analysis was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater the summary of statistical data for hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater and river water samples collected from bahraich district is given in table 1 the ph of the groundwater samples ranged from 6 9 to 8 2 which indicates near neutral to slightly alkaline conditions the redox potential eh was found to range from 190 to 115 with 61 samples n 57 showing negative eh values which indicated dominantly reducing aquifer conditions in the study area table s3 supplementary data measured electrical conductivity ec values were found to vary within the range of 50 1050 μs cm mean value 644 229 μs cm the major ion chemistry of the studied samples showed that bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in groundwater followed by cl so4 2 and no3 the hco3 concentration was found to vary from 132 to 634 mg l mean value 360 90 1 mg l the observed relatively high concentrations of hco3 in groundwater compared to other anions could be associated with the organic matter oxidation and dissolution of carbonate minerals mukherjee and fryar 2008 smedley et al 2003 cl concentration was found in range between 0 76 and 219 mg l mean value 39 46 7 mg l while the no3 concentration varied from not detected to 152 mg l mean value 12 28 4 mg l the low mean nitrate concentration observed in the study area could be either due to the lack of sufficient recharge or it may be due to the bacterial facilitated nitrate reduction in groundwater chauhan et al 2012 komor and anderson 1993 the concentration of f was found to be very low mean value 0 22 0 09 mg l the so4 2 concentration ranged from 0 02 to 118 mg l mean value 20 7 24 9 mg l but no phosphorus was found in any of the groundwater samples anthropogenic activities in nearby areas could have contributed to the observed high sulfate concentrations up to 118 mg l in groundwater samples li et al 2006 rasool et al 2016 doc concentration in groundwater samples in this study was found to be low range 1 05 8 25 mg l mean value 3 09 1 39 mg l compared to a similar study carried out by chauhan et al 2012 in groundwaters of middle gangetic plain calcium was found to be the dominant cation in groundwater samples followed by mg2 na and k the ca2 concentration varied from 19 5 mg l to 125 mg l mean value 74 8 20 3 mg l while the concentration of mg2 varied from 6 65 to 63 8 mg l mean value 26 2 10 2 mg l the concentrations of na and k ranged from 3 14 to 158 mg l mean value 30 5 26 3 mg l and 0 68 107 mg l mean value 10 2 15 6 mg l respectively 3 2 hydrogeochemical facies and classification of groundwater type fig 2 shows the piper diagrams that have been plotted for the classification of the primary ions present in groundwater and for understanding the key hydrogeochemical contrasts between different water types based on the analysis of the piper diagram plots it was determined that groundwater in the study area was primarily of ca2 mg2 hco3 type 97 fig 2 with only two samples belonging to the ca2 mg2 cl water type and one sample belonging to the na hco3 cl water type the homogenous nature of groundwater with dominating ca2 mg2 hco3 type facies and a small amount of cl bearing facies clearly indicated the fresh water recharge along with the dissolution of carbonate minerals the piper diagram also showed that most of the samples were enriched in ca2 and hco3 ions the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations table 1 highlighted the importance of carbonate dissolution and bicarbonate generation in the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater which eventually influenced the mobility of trace metals mukherjee et al 2008 dissolution of carbonate minerals in the study area was also supported by calculated mean si values of carbonate minerals such as aragonite 0 34 calcite 0 48 and dolomite 0 83 which show the sub saturation of these minerals table 2 mineral dissolution of calcite and dolomite releases hco3 ca2 and mg2 ions into groundwater the molar ratios of these ions serve as a crucial indicator for predicting the origin of hco3 ions hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l ratio 1 indicates that hco3 was formed primarily by silicate weathering or organic matter reduction wagner et al 2005 around 60 of groundwater samples in the study area had an hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio 1 indicating that hco3 ions in groundwater were produced by both silicate weathering or degradation of organic matter with a slight dominance and dissolution of carbonate minerals the ca2 mg2 concentration was also plotted against hco3 mukherjee and fryar 2008 fig 3 a which showed that samples were almost equally distributed on the left and right sides of the equiline suggesting that silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution could be attributed to the release of hco3 in groundwater similarly the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot fig 3b emphasizes the role of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum dissolution in the concentration of these ions in groundwater which is governed by carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering as well as ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes brindha et al 2020 the process of exchanging ions from liquid groundwater to solid calcite dolomite and gypsum or anhydrite is known as ion exchange whereas the process of exchanging ions from solid calcite dolomite and gypsum or anhydrite to liquid groundwater is known as reverse ion exchange khan et al 2019 fig 3b showed the equal distribution of samples both below and above the equiline which signified the role of both silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution the pints close to the hco3 so4 2 side signified the ion exchange process mallick et al 2018 data points falling on the equiline suggested that these ions ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 were derived from the dissolution of carbonate calcite dolomite and sulfate anhydrite gypsum mineral dissolution fisher and mullican 1997 kumar et al 2006 which was also supported by the mean si values of these minerals which showed their saturation to undersaturation i e dissolution in groundwater table 2 some samples were also plotted away from equiline towards the ca2 mg2 side which suggested that some ca2 and mg2 ions were derived from reverse ion exchange processes under the influence of carbonate weathering khan and rai 2022a nakhaei et al 2016 in addition scatter plots of the major ions fig 3c and d have also been used to distinguish between different processes like silicate and carbonate weathering and evaporite dissolution that control the major ion chemistry of groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 zhu et al 2011 the na normalized mg2 versus ca2 fig 3c suggested that silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution were the sources of mg mukherjee and fryar 2008 the na normalized ca2 versus hco3 plot fig 3d suggested that the composition of groundwater samples was strongly influenced by silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution with the evaporate dissolution mechanism playing a minor role 3 3 as fe and mn concentrations in groundwater arsenic concentration in the groundwater samples from this study was not very high mean 16 μg l table 1 compared to the other studies in the alluvial aquifer of the gangetic plain chauhan et al 2012 kumar et al 2010 arsenic concentration ranged from 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l mean value 16 22 6 μg l with 37 of the collected samples exceeding the who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water table 3 arsenic in natural waters e g groundwater predominantly exists as as v arsenate and as iii arsenite smedley and kinniburgh 2002 under oxidizing conditions arsenate species are predominant whereas arsenite predominates in reducing groundwater conditions in the current study samples were found to plot in the stability field of both arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 and arsenite h3aso3 fig 4 a this could be due to the mixed anoxic oxic conditions in the groundwater of the study area as evident from table 1 however we admit that predicting the as fe and other redox sensitive species in the water based on the ph eh diagram implies an uncertain chemical equilibrium because natural water is usually characterized by redox disequilibrium the recorded eh value is a mixed potential resulting from a diverse range of redox processes and pt electrode shows a weak response to many redox pairs ayers et al 2016 saha and rahman 2020 hence the determination of as species using as speciation cartridges mahanta et al 2015 or directly from high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms and other techniques komorowicz and barałkiewicz 2016 is essential for more satisfactory results the spatial distribution of as showed that the maximum as concentration 10 μg l in groundwater samples was found in the samples from mahsi block fig 1 table s2 supplementary data this was followed by the as concentrations measured in samples from mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur and sheopur blocks respectively apart from these locations two samples from huzurpur and one sample each from fakharpur kaisarganj and chitaura were found to have as content exceeding the who prescribed limit of 10 μg l samples from all other blocks were found to be as free in mahsi block out of 13 samples 12 samples had as concentrations above the who guideline of 10 μg l in drinking water a significantly high as concentration greater than 100 μg l was measured in samples from the mihinpurwa block table s2 fig 1 the majority of the hand pumps 86 n 30 containing high as 10 μg l concentrations in groundwater were confined to blocks close to the ghagra river i e mihinpurwa balaha mahsi tajawapur and sheopur in the floodplains of holocene younger alluvium surfaces fig 1 whereas those hand pumps containing low as 10 μg l bearing groundwater samples were generally located in the blocks away from the river nawabganj risia chitaura payagpur and bisheshwarganj in pleistocene older alluvium regions these observations are consistent with previous studies in the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm basin acharyya et al 2000 that reported that the younger sediments were un oxidized in nature and contained highly reactive natural organic carbon and as bearing fe mn hydroxides acharyya and shah 2007 postma et al 2012 this effect would decrease with increasing sediment burial ages this is also supported by the hypothesis of mcarthur et al 2011 that suggests the formation of a palaeo weathering surface during the last glacial maximum which prevented the underlying pleistocene aquifer from getting contaminated with doc and as enriched water the observed negative eh values and comparatively higher concentrations of doc table 1 also supported our observation related to higher concentrations of as found in the younger alluvium region of the study area measured fe concentrations in the collected samples were found to be quite high and varied from 0 06 mg l to 12 2 mg l with a mean value of 1 11 1 73 mg l table 1 around 70 of groundwater samples exceeded the who and bis accepted limit of 0 3 mg l for fe in drinking water table 3 the eh ph plot fig 4b shows that in most of the groundwater samples iron might be present in the reduced ferrous fe2 form as evident from the plotting of the samples with respect to the stability fields of different iron phases the measured mn concentrations in the samples reported in this study were found to be relatively low and variable and ranged from 0 39 μg l to 1423 μg l mean value 146 217 μg l with 11 and 36 of samples surpassing the who and bis acceptable limits of 400 μg l and 100 μg l in drinking water respectively tables 1 and 3 3 4 oxic and anoxic groundwater the groundwater samples collected from the study area were distinguished as oxic or anoxic based on the measured eh values out of 94 groundwater samples 37 samples have been classified as oxic with positive eh values and had high no3 and so4 2 and comparatively low as fe mn and doc concentrations table s3 supplementary data in the samples classified as oxic groundwater only two samples contain as 10 μg l the rest of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic with negative eh and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations table s3 supplementary data which typically characterise the aquifers associated with high as concentration von brömssen et al 2008 of all groundwater samples with negative eh 33 samples had as concentrations of 10 μg l these observations suggested that high as concentrations were associated with reducing groundwater conditions in the study area in such conditions iron oxyhydroxides and no3 can be easily reduced nelson eby 2004 and the release of as along with the fe could coincide with no3 and so4 2 reduction in groundwater kar et al 2010 the presence of dissolved organic carbon in the groundwater system could intensify the reduction of iron oxyhydroxides and the supply of high as in groundwater ravenscroft et al 2001 as also discussed in section 3 6 we found a positive correlation of as with doc r2 0 53 p 0 001 which suggested that the reducing conditions in the study area could be derived from microbial reduction of organic matters in the aquifer sediments facilitating the release of as in groundwater kar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 hence the dominantly reducing nature of the groundwater in this region along with relatively low values of nitrate and sulfate and high values of fe and doc supported the release of as via reductive dissolution mechanism of iron oxyhydroxides 3 5 as and fe content and well depth although there was no linear trend observed for well depth versus as and fe content in groundwater it can be seen that as concentration increases with depth up to 35 m and decreases thereafter fig 5 a similar to the fe concentrations fig 5b maximum as concentrations were measured at depths ranging from 25 to 35 m coinciding with maximum fe concentrations indicating that the depth dependent redox conditions controlling fe dissolution and precipitation also influenced as dissolution and fixation nguyen and itoi 2009 the depth profiles of as and fe in this study were found to be similar to the other studies in as contaminated alluvial aquifers e g the bengal basin karim et al 1997 the jianghan plain china gan et al 2014 and the indus alluvial plain pakistan naseem and mcarthur 2018 3 6 relationship of as in groundwater with other parameters a scatter plot of as with other parameters such as eh doc no3 mn fe so4 2 and hco3 was used to investigate the geochemical behavior and processes influencing as release in groundwaters of the study area fig 6 a g as can be seen from fig 6a as showed a poor correlation with eh r2 0 21 p 0 001 but the majority of high as samples were found to be associated with negative eh values indicating the reducing conditions favored the mobility of as in groundwater groundwater samples of the study area were found to show a positive correlation between as concentrations and doc r2 0 53 p 0 001 fig 6b suggesting that the microbial degradation of organic matter in aquifer sediments resulted in overall reducing conditions that cause the release of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2006 hasan et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2001 redox sensitive species such as no3 mn fe and so4 2 are reduced sequentially in such microbial reduction processes guo et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2008 and as desorption from fe iii oxyhydroxides leads to an increase in as fe and hco3 concentrations mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 2005 since no3 is reduced more readily than fe the samples with elevated as concentrations should contain very low no3 concentrations to account for the as pollution caused by fe reduction mcarthur et al 2012 nickson et al 2000 furthermore in groundwater nitrate has been shown to strongly buffer the redox status and slow the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides resulting in a low as concentration senn and hemond 2002 in this study almost all samples containing high as concentrations 10 μg l showed low no3 concentrations 1 mg l fig 6c supporting the reductive dissolution process for as release in the groundwater of the study area these observations are consistent with similar correlations reported between as and no3 concentrations found in the groundwater studies of the indus alluvial plain pakistan naseem and mcarthur 2018 and the gangetic plain of west bengal india kar et al 2010 arsenic showed a poor correlation with mn r2 0 02 p 0 05 fig 6d which could be explained by the fact that as adsorption desorption from mn oxides hydroxide minerals is not significant for mobilization of as in the aquifer as suggested by von brömssen et al 2007 for the matlab upazila region of bangladesh and mukherjee et al 2008 for the aquifers of west bengal india in addition the as released during the reduction of mn oxyhydroxides could be re adsorbed in to the fe oxyhydroxides present in the aquifer sediments biswas et al 2014a bhattacharya et al 2002 jia et al 2014 stüeben et al 2003 resulting in the poor correlation of mn with as a weak positive correlation r2 0 32 p 0 001 fig 6e between as and fe concentrations was observed in groundwater samples from this study similar to the other studies conducted in the terai regions of india and nepal diwakar et al 2015 singh et al 2018 and also from other areas of the gangetic plain dowling et al 2002 van geen et al 2006 the observed weak correlation between as and fe indicates the decoupling during their mobilization in groundwater diwakar et al 2015 several studies have revealed that the fe ii mediated alteration of weakly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides into more thermodynamically stable crystalline phases can delay the mobilization of as hossain et al 2014 fendorf et al 2010 during reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite the released as remains adsorb to surface until the surface sites of ferrihydrite become saturated after which as is released in to the aqueous phase pedersen et al 2006 this process triggers a delay in the release of as relative to fe2 resulting in an obvious decoupling between fe2 and as mobilization decoupling of fe2 and as may also occur as a result of fe2 sorption onto other surfaces such as clays or precipitation of fe ii minerals such as siderite diwakar et al 2015 around 85 of groundwater samples in bahraich were close to saturation with respect to siderite suggesting the precipitation of fe2 ions in the groundwater as siderite mcarthur et al 2001 thus dissolution and precipitation of fe minerals results in a decoupling between as and fe in addition the lithologically heterogeneous nature of alluvial sediments causes a range of fe as ratios in fe oxyhydroxides and their reductive dissolution results in a decoupling between as and fe naseem and mcarthur 2018 the overall sulfate concentration in groundwater at the study site was found to be high mean value of 20 67 mg l table 1 but the relationship between as and so4 2 showed that in most of the groundwater samples with high as concentrations 10 μg l the so4 2 concentration was found to be low 15 mg l fig 6f indicating the redox dependent release of as in groundwater guo et al 2014 xie et al 2009 2013 similar correlations between as and so4 2 concentrations have also been reported for the alluvial aquifers of bangladesh and for alluvial groundwater of the middle gangetic plain by ahmed et al 2004 and chauhan et al 2012 respectively in addition the poor negative correlation between as and so4 2 r2 0 11 p 0 01 fig 6f indicates that as has not been released by oxidation of as bearing sulfide minerals oinam et al 2011 arsenic shows weak or no correlation with hco3 r2 0 006 p 0 05 fig 6g indicating various sources and sinks of hco3 e g degradation of dissolved organic matter and dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals mahanta et al 2015 and competitive adsorption by bicarbonate might not be the primary mechanism for as mobilization kumar et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 and the occurrence of reductive processes in the study area this is also supported by values calculated for saturation indices of carbonate minerals table 2 overall high concentrations of fe and hco3 in samples with high as concentrations suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as a dominant process of as release in the groundwater of bahraich however a detailed evaluation of the geochemical and mineralogical composition of sub surface sediments and their comparison with the observed geochemical characteristics of groundwater is required to make a more satisfactory conclusion about the release mechanism of as in groundwater of the study area 3 7 effect of anthropogenic activities on groundwater geochemistry high nitrate concentrations in groundwater reported from various parts of india have been attributed to agricultural return flows improper sanitation and human and animal wastes agrawal et al 1999 cgwb 2013 suthar et al 2009 das et al 2020a of all the groundwater samples analyzed in this study only 9 and 11 had no3 concentrations that exceeded the acceptable limits of who 50 mg l and bis 45 mg l in drinking water table 3 the sources whether geogenic e g mineral weathering and dissolution or anthropogenic e g waste water infiltration and controlling factors of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were investigated using cross plots of no3 with ec and hco3 brindha et al 2020 figs s1 a b supplementary data the plots showed that nitrate was derived from both geogenic and anthropogenic sources in the study area the anthropogenic contribution to the nitrate concentrations may be due to the close proximity of constructed toilets and hand pump bore wells as observed during the field survey more specifically the geogenic and anthropogenic components of nitrate concentrations in groundwater could be separated by calculating the natural backgrounds and threshold values of nitrate using different statistical and graphical methods such as pre selection probability plots and component separation methods amiri et al 2021 de caro et al 2017 kim et al 2015 in general doc concentration in unpolluted groundwater ranges from 0 1 to 4 mg l coyte et al 2019 and in several regions where doc concentration was found greater than 4 mg l in unpolluted groundwater they were mainly associated with known organic deposits e g coal deposits peat soils in aquifer sediments under reducing groundwater conditions anawar et al 2003 artinger et al 2000 around 17 of groundwater samples from this study had doc concentrations greater than 4 mg l high doc concentration found in some of the groundwater samples of bahraich is possibly the result of microorganism mediated organic matter degradation in the aquifer sediments or it could be attributed to the local sewerage which is a common source for high doc islam et al 2004 ravenscroft et al 2001 high doc concentration mean value 4 34 mg l up to 9 40 mg l was also observed in a rivulet i e saryu river of bahraich table 1 such local water bodies are often dumps of waste water e g discharge of untreated sewage and human waste and are a potential source of organic matter to groundwater additionally waste water from septic tanks and pit latrines may also have contributed substantial amount of organic matter to groundwater of bahraich mcarthur et al 2012 observations of high no3 concentrations along with high doc concentrations in groundwater samples from certain areas could be indicative of a significant anthropogenic contribution affecting the groundwater quality in those areas of bahraich table s2 3 8 speciation calculations phreeqc version 3 7 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the saturation indices si of mineral species in groundwater this enables predicting the occurrence of reactive mineral phases in aquifer using geochemical data of groundwater samples without collection of any solid samples sridharan and nathan 2017 the si of mineral phases was calculated using following expression s i l o g i a p k s p where iap ionic activity product and ksp solubility product of the mineral the calculated positive and negative si values suggest the oversaturation and undersaturation of groundwater with respect to a particular mineral respectively the input parameters for calculating si of water samples were ph pe 16 9eh volts at 25 oc temperature alkalinity hco3 sodium potassium calcium magnesium fluoride chloride sulfate nitrate iron and manganese table 2 provides the details of the statistical summary of the saturation index calculations on groundwater samples of the bahraich district the mean si values of the minerals indicated that the groundwater was near saturation with carbonate minerals such as aragonite caco3 0 34 calcite caco3 0 48 dolomite camg co3 2 0 83 siderite feco3 0 46 and rhodochrosite mnco3 0 59 these observations suggest the additional sources of high hco3 in groundwater of the study area including the dissolution of carbonate minerals as discussed earlier most probably the oxidation of organic matter present in the aquifer sediments ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 it is also evident from si values of carbonate minerals that their precipitation and dissolution largely influence the groundwater solute chemistry of the region bhowmick et al 2013 the groundwater of the study area was strongly undersaturated with respect to mn oxide hydroxide phases including hausmannite mn3o4 20 6 pyrolusite mno2 17 6 manganite mnooh 9 3 pyrochroite mn oh 2 6 9 suggesting unfavorable conditions for the precipitation of these minerals in groundwater undersaturation of mn oxide minerals e g pyrolusite suggested the predominantly reducing conditions in the aquifer lead to high dissolved mn resulting from the reduction of mn oxide minerals bhowmick et al 2013 das et al 2020b but in contrast low mean mn concentrations in groundwater 146 1 84 μg l may be due to the removal of mn from groundwater by precipitation of rhodochrosite as 34 samples of the study area had near saturation to saturation with respect to rhodochrosite or incorporation by solid solution on to siderite or other carbonate minerals as predicted in the post oxic environment ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2008 verma et al 2016 groundwater samples were found oversaturated with respect to fe oxide hydroxide phases in contrast to mn oxide hydroxide phases such as goethite feooh 5 31 and hematite fe2o3 12 64 indicating the favorable aqueous conditions in study site aquifers for the precipitation of these minerals and they could act as a sink of as in groundwater fuller et al 1993 sappa et al 2014 sridharan and nathan 2017 however another iron oxyhydroxide mineral ferrihydrite had saturation to slightly undersaturated i e indicating dissolution in groundwater suggesting that it could be a possible mineral phase releasing as in bahraich groundwater although the phreeqc modeling technique gives an overview of the possible mineral phases present in aquifers that control the geochemistry of groundwater it should be validated by analyzing the aquifer solid samples deutsch and siegel 1997 merkel and geochemistry 2005 as a result future studies should include a detailed evaluation of the mineralogical composition of subsurface sediments in order to more accurately predict the mechanism of as release and associated as bearing mineral phases in the study area s aquifers 3 9 statistical analysis 3 9 1 factor analysis multivariate factor analysis was done for the identification of geochemical processes and the estimation of the extent and source of groundwater pollution table 4 provides the details of the factor analysis results of physico chemical parameters for groundwater samples along with details about loadings eigen values variability percentage and cumulative variance the total variability which accounted for four factors was found to be 67 0 based on the data reported in this study factor 1 was found to show significant geochemical associations between ec na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 as observed by sridharan and nathan 2017 the role of carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities like application of fertilizers k no3 and so4 2 and sewage disposal no3 and cl being generally responsible for the significant association of these parameters these mechanisms could be significant in influencing bahraich hydrogeochemistry correlation of ca2 mg2 and hco3 suggested dissolution of carbonate minerals like calcite aragonite and dolomite according to saha et al 2009 a moderately high cl and so4 2 loading table 4 indicated anthropogenic sources such as domestic waste and untreated sewage factor 2 was found to show a strong relationship of as with doc and hco3 which suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides via microbial degradation of organic matter causes the release of as in groundwater factor 3 did not show a significant relationship between as and other variables indicating that multiple sources play a role in controlling the occurrences of as in bahraich groundwater 3 9 2 correlation matrix the shapiro wilk and kolmogorov smirnova tests were used table s4 to test the normality of different geochemical parameters if significance value of these tests is greater than 0 05 the data is considered normal while the value smaller than 0 05 indicate the deviation from the normal distribution the results indicate that all geochemical parameters are non normally distributed table s4 the skewness and kurtosis values also confirm non normality of the data hence spearman rank correlation table 5 was used to assess the relationship between various parameters significant correlation was observed in eh no3 as ec na mg2 cl hco3 na mg2 cl no3 so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 hco3 mg2 cl hco3 cl no3 so4 2 no3 so4 2 as and as doc these relationships were consistent with observations made from factor analysis i e carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities dominantly controlled the geochemistry of groundwater in bahraich a good correlation of ca2 with mg2 and hco3 suggested the dissolution of calcite and dolomite sheikhy narany et al 2014 the negative correlation coefficient between as and eh in addition to the observed high fe concentration indicated the redox conditions of the aquifer further the strong positive correlation coefficient between as and doc as also observed from factor analysis suggests the reductive dissolution mechanism as the main process for as release in groundwater nitrate concentrations were found to show a positive correlation with the eh of the groundwater it is evident from the fact that as eh becomes lower e g in reducing conditions denitrification causes the reduction of nitrate højberg et al 2017 thereby lowering its concentrations in groundwater in most of our groundwater samples very low nitrate concentrations were associated with negative low eh values reducing conditions and high as concentrations fig 6c as reducing conditions also favor the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and the mobilization of as gurung et al 2005 the positive correlation between nitrate and eh is also an indirect indicator of the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and the mobilization of as in groundwater moderate correlation coefficient between doc and hco3 suggest that doc is derived in groundwater via degradation of organic matter artinger et al 2000 appelo et al 2002 hasan et al 2007 3 10 river water chemistry in addition to groundwater samples river water samples were collected and analyzed at various sites to better understand the extent of as contamination in bahraich and to assess the effects of groundwater as contamination on the surface water bodies and vice versa this was a crucial exercise considering that the local river stream is dominantly fed by groundwater and its chemistry reflects the chemistry of the groundwater as seen from the data reported in table 1 the hydrogeochemistry of river water samples was found to be similar to groundwater samples from this study with slightly lower total cation and anion concentrations compared to the groundwater samples table 1 river water samples were observed to be relatively more alkaline than the groundwater samples with ph values in the range of slightly alkaline to alkaline 7 7 8 7 the redox potential eh was found to vary between 52 and 220 indicating highly oxidizing conditions table 1 due to direct exposure and contact with the atmosphere the electrical conductivity of all river samples was found in the range of 214 590 μs cm which was relatively lower than the groundwater of adjacent regions iron concentrations for the river water samples were also found to be lower 0 08 2 09 mg l table 1 compared to groundwater samples doc concentrations in river samples were found to be slightly higher 1 46 9 4 mg l mean 2 58 2 58 mg l than groundwater samples which could be due to the dumping of untreated sewage and human and animal waste in contrast to groundwater samples with no detectable phosphate content phosphate concentration was detected in some river water samples nd 11 6 mg l 0 83 mg l which could be attributed to domestic sewage animal wastes and agricultural runoff containing fertilizers arsenic concentration in the major streams of the study area viz ghagra and babai fig 1 was comparatively low mean 6 56 3 89 μg l but almost all samples from the rivulet i e saryu river were found to have a high as concentration mean 17 8 6 73 μg l it was found that the groundwater samples close to the saryu river also had relatively higher as concentrations compared to the regions away from it overall mean as concentrations in river water were slightly lower compared to groundwater but alarmingly 73 of samples n 11 had as greater than 10 μg l table 3 the observed high as concentration in surface water might be the result of infiltration from as enriched shallow groundwater of the nearby regions mukherjee and fryar 2008 or it could be associated with local reductive processes occurring in the hyporheic zone diwakar et al 2015 the other possible factors causing the high as concentrations in surface water could be the application of herbicides and insecticides on agricultural fields as well as the use of untreated wastewater sewage sludge as agricultural fertilizer as observed by other studies in alluvial plain regions arain et al 2008 baig et al 2009 2010 3 11 mechanism of as release in ghagra basin enrichment in low temperature groundwater can be caused by a variety of processes such processes include sulfide oxidation desorption of as from minerals at high ph alkali desorption weathering of minerals like apatite and reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides chowdhury et al 1999 farooqi et al 2007 mallick and rajagopal 1996 mandal et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2001 neumann et al 2010 nickson et al 1998 2000 2005 although williams et al 2005 proposed sulfide oxidation as the dominant mechanism of as release in nepal s terai regions the low concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in this study s groundwater samples combined with observations of high as 10 μg l and relatively high ph mean 7 49 fig 6c and f table 1 do not support this mechanism as the primary source of as dowling et al 2002 in addition sulfide oxidation results in positive correlation of so4 2 with fe and as which is not observed in this study the alkali desorption mechanism of as release is characterized by a generally high ph 8 of groundwater and a positive correlation between ph and as smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the average ph of groundwater samples in the study site 7 49 0 30 with no correlation observed between ph and as tables 4 and 5 this clearly rules out the role of alkali desorption in the high as concentration of the study area in the study area excluding two samples all groundwater samples with high as concentrations 10 μg l were coupled with anoxic groundwater negative eh along with relatively higher values of fe mn and hco3 concentrations and lower values of nitrate and sulfate in addition to the higher concentration of doc table s3 supplementary data these observations indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions which is indicative of the predominantly reducing aquifer conditions similar to the other regions of the gangetic plain singh et al 2018 and the release of as via reductive dissolution mechanism of iron oxyhydroxides in the study area various earlier studies in gangetic floodplain aquifers bhattacharya et al 1997 biswas et al 2014b dowling et al 2002 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 nath et al 2008 seddique et al 2008 zheng et al 2004 khan and rai 2022b have also concluded the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as the major mechanism for high as in anoxic groundwater multiples studies have reported the presence of iron oxide minerals in the sediments of gangetic plain aquifer acharyya 2005 mukherjee 2012 arsenic is strongly adsorbed on these mineral surfaces kocar et al 2009 and they may release as into groundwater during their dissolution harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 3 12 health risk assessment human exposure to as contaminated groundwater has become a serious health problem due to its severe health effects hence in this study both carcinogenic hq and hi and non carcinogenic ilcr and tilcr health risks associated with as in groundwater samples via two exposure pathways ingestion and dermal for two population groups adults and children were estimated applying both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies as expected the calculated chronic daily intake cdi of as via ingestion dominated the dermal exposure table s5 in fact dermal exposure had a negligible impact on total carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk calculations 3 12 1 deterministic approach in terms of non carcinogenic health risks the mean values of hazard index hi estimated for as in groundwater were found to exceed the threshold value 1 for both adults 1 89e 00 and children 3 12e 00 using the deterministic approach table s5 around 40 samples for adults and 52 samples for children in the study area had hi values above the accepted limit it can be seen that children had more sensitive receptors than adults with respect to the non carcinogenic health risks which could be due to their lower body weight than adults the results of this study were found to be similar to the other studies conducted by various researchers fallahzadeh et al 2018 he and wu 2019 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2011 yousefi et al 2019 the calculated mean tilcr i e cancer risk values for as in the study area were 3 65e 04 for adults and 1 20e 04 for children table s5 the results clearly showed that the mean tilcr values of both subgroups i e adults and children significantly exceeded the threshold value of 1e 04 with 55 and 35 samples for adults and children respectively surpassing the accepted value overall it can be inferred from the mean values of tilcr that adults are more prone to carcinogenic risk than children which might be due to higher exposure frequencies and duration skin surface area and intake rate rajasekhar et al 2018 verma and sinha 2022 the results of this study were consistent with other studies that looked at cancer risk estimations saha et al 2017 saha and rahman 2020 zuzolo et al 2020 in terms of the spatial distribution of the calculated health risks in the study area both adults and children are exposed to the highest levels of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks in mahsi as indicated by their mean hi and tilcr values table s6 the blocks such as mahsi mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur huzurpur sheopur and fakharpur were found to have hi values for both adult children above the threshold value of 1 whereas the rest of the blocks were found free of any risk for non carcinogenic health effects the regions with tilcr exceeding the threshold value of 1e 04 for adults were mahsi mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur huzurpur sheopur fakharpur chitaura and kaisarganj the patterns of tilcr spatial distribution for children in the study were found to be similar to that for adults with the difference that sheopur fakharpur chitaura and kaisarganj were relatively safe for cancer risk to children 3 12 2 monte carlo simulation based probabilistic approach in order to minimize the uncertainty in risk estimation via a deterministic approach monte carlo simulations probabilistic method were also performed simulations were run for different input values used by different researchers in previous studies table s1 considering 10 000 iterations in oracle crystal ball software for eqs 5 and 8 to calculate the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks associated with drinking as contaminated groundwater table s4 summarizes the health risk assessment results from probabilistic methods in terms of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects in this study the 5th and 95th percentiles were considered the low and high ends of risk estimation because the estimates for the lowest and highest values obtained from the probabilistic method may lead to underestimation and overestimation of risk respectively kavcar et al 2009 saha et al 2017 saha and rahman 2020 the distribution of hi and tilcr for adults and children is shown in fig 7 the calculated non carcinogenic risk hi using deterministic method were nearly identical to that of the probabilistic approach table s4 however an overestimation was observed in the case of carcinogenic risk tilcr calculated by the deterministic approach overall the results of hi and tilcr warn the study area is at high risk for both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects caused by the consumption of as contaminated groundwater hence the current study calls for a suitable policy intervention to reduce groundwater contamination in addition as should be included in the essential list of parameters to be consistently monitored in groundwater in order to limit the risk to public health 3 12 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the contribution of input variables to the output values of risk estimates in the probabilistic risk assessment model fig 8 shows the results of sensitivity analysis for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for adults and children exposed to as contaminated groundwater the concentration of as in groundwater and exposure duration ed were the most effective variables for non carcinogenic hi and carcinogenic tilcr risk estimation in both adults and children besides averaging time at and ingestion rate ir also had significant influences on estimated non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk outcomes respectively 4 conclusions the hydrochemical behavior fate and health risk assessment of as using deterministic and mcs based probabilistic methods have been investigated in bahraich district located in the middle gangetic plain ghaghara river sub basin terai region of india the groundwater of the study area predominantly belongs to the ca2 mg2 hco3 type hydrochemical facies and is affected by the dissolution of carbonates and silicates along with ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes the concentration of as in the groundwater samples was found in range between 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l and 37 of the samples had as 10 μg l who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water river water samples contained significant as concentrations mean of 14 μg l with approximately 73 of samples containing as concentrations greater than 10 μg l which could be due to infiltration from as enriched shallow groundwater in the surrounding areas the majority of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic with negative eh and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations which indicates predominantly reducing aquifer conditions probably caused by the oxidative degradation of organic matter facilitating the mobilization of as in the groundwater of the study area the health risk analysis found that both the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of exposure to as contaminated groundwater were above the acceptable limits the children were more prone to non carcinogenic risks whereas adults were found more sensitive to carcinogenic risks arsenic concentration and exposure duration were the most influential variables for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk estimations in both adults and children the study highlights the risk of as exposure to humans as well as the substantial health risks associated with drinking as contaminated groundwater hence it is critical to include as in routine monitoring of groundwater quality furthermore given the high spatial variability of as in groundwater it is recommended to apply a blanket testing in the study area using reliable as field kits in order to demarcate the as safe and as contaminated wells and thus offer an option to the residents until a long term remediation strategy is implemented future studies should focus on the geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of sub surface sediments by taking sediment cores at different depths to develop a precise understanding of specifics source of as as well as the mineralogical control and mechanism of as mobilization in the middle gangetic plain furthermore studies should also concentrate on the involvement of microbes in mediating the biogeochemical processes

11748,the present study investigates the groundwater solute chemistry hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic as and the assessment of health risks through ingestion and dermal contact pathways to the adults and children of the bahraich district falling under the middle gangetic plain ghaghara river sub basin terai region of india a monte carlo simulation and a sensitivity analysis were also performed to quantify the uncertainties and impact of various input variables in risk calculations respectively concentrations major ions ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 po4 3 no3 hco3 f and cl dissolved organic carbon doc and trace metals as fe and mn as well as physical parameters ec ph and eh were measured on the collected groundwater and river water samples the concentration of as in the groundwater samples was found in range between 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l and 37 of the samples had as 10 μg l who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water river water samples also displayed high as concentrations mean of 14 μg l with 73 of samples having as 10 μg l which could be attributed to infiltration from as enriched sallow groundwater of the nearby regions the groundwater of the study area was predominantly of ca2 mg2 hco3 type bivariate weathering plots showed groundwater was influenced by silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution along with the ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes with a minor contribution from evaporate dissolution most of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations the observed values and correlations between various measured parameters including groundwater as concentrations and saturation indices calculations indicated the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxide as the major process for as mobilization in the study area the results of total non carcinogenic risk hi estimated by the deterministic and probabilistic techniques were nearly identical for both adults and children but an overestimation was observed in the case of carcinogenic risk calculated by the deterministic approach health risk results also showed that children were more susceptible to non carcinogenic risk whereas adults were at a higher risk of cancer in the study area sensitivity analysis indicated that the concentration of as in groundwater and exposure duration ed were the most effective variables for non carcinogenic hi and carcinogenic tilcr risk estimation in both adults and children graphical abstract image 1 keywords middle gangetic plain arsenic geochemistry health

threat to millions of people in india as contamination in groundwater was initially reported in 1976 in punjab haryana and himachal pradesh datta and kaul 1976 later on several studies reported groundwater as contamination in the states of west bengal chhattisgarh bihar uttar pradesh jharkhand punjab and assam chatterjee et al 2018 de et al 2022 garat et al 1984 kumar et al 2016 2018 2021 kumar and singh 2019 mukherjee et al 2006 nickson et al 2000 ravindra and mor 2019 verma et al 2015 majority of the as contaminated regions in these states have been identified near the floodplains of the ganga bramhaputra and sutlej rivers and their tributaries ghaghara rapti gandak beas chetia et al 2011 das et al 2016 de et al 2022 kar et al 2010 kaur et al 2016 kumar et al 2006 2018 2020 kumar

organic matter in flood plain areas of these rivers could provide favorable conditions for as mobilization via microbial decomposition of organic matter acharyya et al 2000 ahmed et al 2004 lawson et

topography and groundwater age groundwater flow direction anthropogenic inputs and various processes such as adsorption desorption ion exchange dissolution and oxidation reduction control as mobilization through solid phases of an aquifer to aqueous phase bhattacharya et al 2009 fendorf et al 2010 herath et al 2016 hinkle and polette 1999 katsoyiannis et al 2015 welch et al 2000 welch and stollenwerk 2002 sridharan and nathan 2017 several previous works have extensively investigated the release mechanism of as in groundwater for different regions worldwide and the reductive dissolution of metal oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions in younger alluvial sediments has been suggested as the primary mechanism of as release in groundwater bhattacharya et al 1997 kumar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 1998 2000 the bahraich region study area falls under the terai belt of india in the ghaghara basin in the middle gangetic plains of uttar pradesh high as concentrations were reported by various studies in the terai regions of nepal close to the study area diwakar et al 2015 guillot et al 2015 gurung et al 2005 mueller and hug 2018 nakano et al 2014 williams et al 2005 the exposure of inorganic as at chronic levels has adverse effects on human health causing various diseases such as skin disorders cardiovascular diseases respiratory effects and neurological complications ahmad et al 1997 milton et al 2001 mukherjee et al 2003 wang et al 2007 hence quantifying the source and release processes of as in the aquifer and assessing the nature and probability of adverse health effects of as on the exposed human population is very crucial although areas lying in the terai regions of nepal have been extensively studied for groundwater as distribution and mobilization diwakar et al 2015 guillot et al 2015 gurung et al 2005 mueller and hug 2018 nakano et al 2014 williams et al 2005 but there is no systematic investigation of as distribution and mobilization in the current study area except for a previous study mehrotra et al 2016 that performed the mapping of as in bahraich region with gis techniques using uttar pradesh jal nigam data on as testing that was obtained using field kits and blanket testing approach between 2005 and 2008 this study aims to bridge the gap by not just focusing on quantifying the distribution and concentrations of as in groundwater of the study area but also inferring the mobilization mechanisms based on the new results besides there has been no focus on the deterministic or probabilistic health risk estimation due to the consumption of as polluted groundwater despite the fact that understanding the health risks of as is essential for implementing effective measures to improve the groundwater quality in this region hence this study aims to 1 quantify the extent and current status of as contamination and processes controlling the mobility of as in groundwater 2 determine the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risk assessment of as using both deterministic and probabilistic risk assessment for adults and children in the study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study region bahraich fig 1 forms a part of the middle gangetic plain and lies in the terai region in the indian state of uttar pradesh it covers an area of around 4697 square km and is located in the ghaghara floodplain the ghaghara river originates from the matsatung glacier in the high himalayas of southern tibet near mansarowar lake and flows southeast through nepal and enters india via the bahraich district of uttar pradesh and meets the ganga river in the chapra district of bihar after traveling a course of around 1080 km singh and awasthi 2011 singh et al 2017 fig 1 shows the course of the ghagra river as it flows through the terai region of nepal and enters india via bahraich and its subsequent course as it flows through the bahraich district and provides details about the location geomorphology and sample collection locations of the study area 2 2 hydrogeology ghagra and saryu are the two main rivers of the bahraich district of which ghagra the major stream forms the western boundary of the district the entire district is part of the ghagra alluvial plain and can be clearly divided into two distinct units the older and newer alluvium fig 1 the older alluvium comprising the upland plains is of middle pleistocene age whereas the newer alluvium occupies the lowland plains of upper pleistocene to recent age krishnan 1960 mehrotra et al 2016 the north eastern area of the district is bounded by the bhabar tract followed by the tarai extending in the nne sse direction parallel to the trend of the shivalik hills mehrotra et al 2016 groundwater in the district is found to occur in the pore spaces of unconsolidated alluvial sediments such as clay kankar and sand in the zone of saturation rai 2012 the shallow aquifers occurring in unconfined conditions are separated by impermeable clay beds from the deeper aquifers which occur in semiconfined to confined states of disposition rai 2012 2 3 sample collection and preservation groundwater sampling in the bahraich district was carried out during june 2018 and november 2019 altogether 94 groundwater samples and 15 river samples were collected in acid pre washed plastic bottles for each sampling location three separate aliquots of samples were collected which included 1 one unfiltered and unacidified sample for alkalinity determination 60 ml 2 one filtered and unacidified sample for cations and anions analysis 60 ml and 3 one filtered and acidified sample for as mn and fe analysis 15 ml groundwater samples were collected from different depths of hand pumps tube wells and deep borings covering all 14 blocks of the district prior to sample collection the hand pumps were flushed for 15 20 min to expel any standing water following standard guidelines apha 1998 at the time of sample collection the important physical chemical parameters such as redox potential eh the activity of hydrogen ion concentration ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured on site through a portable multiparameter analyzer toshcon tpc 7 water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm millipore filter and preserved with 15 8 m hno 3 for the analysis of metals such as as mn and fe hco3 concentrations of the samples were determined using a titrimetric method on the same day of sampling the geographic coordinates of all sampling locations were determined by gps garmin etrex 30 accurate information about the depth of the hand pumps tube wells and deep boring wells was acquired from the owners of the wells and carefully documented samples were collected with water completely filled into the bottles ensuring that no air bubbles would be present within the samples the water samples were then taken right away to the lab where they were stored in the refrigerator at 4 c until analysis 2 4 laboratory measurements the anions so4 2 po4 3 no3 hco3 f and cl and cations ca2 mg2 na k in the studied samples were analyzed using an ion chromatographic unit metrohm ic model 930 compact ic flux analytical facility in the geochemistry laboratory at iit roorkee with a detection limit of 0 005 mg l and an analytical precision of less than 3 the accuracy of the major cations and anion measurements was checked by calculating the cation anion charge balance using the following expression ionic charge balance t z t z t z t z where tz and tz are total cations and total anions respectively the ionic charge balance error was found to be within 10 for all samples the concentration of total as mn and fe were measured by inductive coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent technology 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms analytical facility at the institute instrumentation centre iit roorkee the instrument was linearly calibrated with icp multi element standard solution merck kgaa 64 271 germany for as fe and mn yielding r2 of 0 9986 the instrument detection limits of as mn and fe were 0 01 0 1 and 10 μg l respectively replicate analyses were carried out to check the precision of the results which was within the range of 10 for all samples for checking the accuracy of the as measurement standard reference material i e srm 1643f trace elements in water provided by national institute of standards and technology nist gaithersburg md usa was analyzed with the studied samples the mean as concentration measured with icp ms in srm was found very close to the certified value 57 4 μg l nist 2015 carlos and robert 2015 with a recovery of 95 the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc in water samples were measured with an aurora toc 1030 analyzer attached to a rotary 1088 auto sampler using wet oxidation mode at 680 c with precision and a detection limit of 10 and 0 05 mg l respectively all the acids and reagents were of ultrapure analytical grade from merck darmstadt germany all the glassware and plastic vials used during analysis were pre cleaned by soaking in 1 hno3 for 24 h and then rinsing with ultrapure water 2 5 geochemical modeling and statistical analysis the saturation index si of the mineral phases in aquifer of the study area were calculated using phreeqc software interactive version 3 7 0 the si value of the minerals indicates the thermodynamic equilibrium i e oversaturation or undersaturation of those minerals in groundwater and hence predicts the possible mineral phases responsible for the presence of various solutes in groundwater before performing the statistical analysis normality test was conducted on the geochemical data using shapiro wilk and kolmogorov smirnova tests due to non normal distribution of the data spearman rank correlation was used to evaluate the relationship between various physicochemical parameters table 5 table 4 shows the outcome of the factor analysis for groundwater samples that was carried out on log transformed data using statistical package for social sciences spss version 20 0 2 6 human health risk assessment human health risk assessment is a type of evaluation approach used to examine the potentially harmful effects on human health after prolonged exposure to a particular chemical pollutant like as us epa 1989 the possible exposure routes of as to the human population are ingestion dermal and inhalation however in the case of metals in groundwater ingestion and dermal exposure pathways are predominant kim et al 2004 saha et al 2017 while inhalation has been considered insignificant atsdr 2007 hence only ingestion and dermal exposures of groundwater as have been examined in the current study both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies were used to measure the risk for two exposed population sub classes adults and children following the protocols described by usepa 1996 2 6 1 chronic daily intake cdi the chronic daily intake cdi of as via ingestion and dermal pathways were calculated using eqs 1 and 2 respectively following cao et al 2017 chen et al 2019 us epa 1989 zheng et al 2013 1 c d i i n g e s t i o n c i r e f e d b w a t 2 c d i d e r m a l c s a k p e t e f e d 10 b w a t where cdiingestion and cdidermal indicate the exposure dose mg kg 1day 1 via ingestion and dermal pathways respectively c is the measured as mg l concentration in water ir is the water ingestion rate l day 1 ef is the exposure frequency day year 1 ed is the exposure duration years at is the average time ed 365 bw is the body weight kg sa is the surface area of the skin exposed to pollutants cm2 kp is specific dermal permeability for as cm h 1 and et represents the exposure time h day 1 2 6 2 non carcinogenic risk the non carcinogenic risk assessment was carried by calculating the hazard quotient hq which is the ratio of the estimated chronic daily intake cdi to the reference dose rfd of as using eqs 3 and 4 3 hq ingestion c d i i n g e s t i o n r f d i n g e s t i o n 4 hq dermal c d i d e r m a l r f d d e r m a l where hqingestion and hqdermal are the non carcinogenic hazard quotients and rfdingestion and rfddermal are the reference doses for ingestion of water and dermal adsorption of water mgkg 1day 1 respectively to assess the overall potential non carcinogenic risks resulting from a combination of dermal and ingestion exposures the calculated hqingestion and hqdermal were added together and expressed as hazard index hi 5 h i h q i n g e s t i o n h q d e r m a l no harmful health impact is expected on the exposed population while hi 1 indicates the possibility of non carcinogenic health risk saha et al 2017 us epa 1989 yang et al 2012 2 6 3 carcinogenic risk the carcinogenic risk associated with as was estimated using the incremental lifetime cancer risk ilcr model which is the incremental probability of an individual developing cancer over a lifetime due to exposure to a potential carcinogen the ilcr was estimated using eqs 6 and 7 which is the product of chronic daily intake cdi and cancer slope risk factor csf 6 i l c r i n g e s t i o n c d i i n g e s t i o n c s f i n g e s t i o n 7 i l c r d e r m a l c d i d e r m a l c s f d e r m a l where ilcringestion and ilcrdermal are the carcinogenic risks of ingestion and dermal exposures to as csfingestion and csfdermal are the cancer slope factors for as through ingestion and dermal exposure mgkg 1day 1 1 respectively the total incremental lifetime cancer risk tilcr is calculated by eq 8 8 t i l c r i l c r i n g e s t i o n i l c r d e r m a l the accepted limit for carcinogenic risk is 1 10 6 which implies that 1 person in every million would develop cancer as a consequence of the exposure lim et al 2008 rahman et al 2017 the typical permissible limits are considered to be 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 and the risk 1 10 4 is considered unacceptable usepa 1999 yang et al 2012 2 6 4 monte carlo simulations mcs and sensitivity analyses risk calculation in a deterministic approach employs point or single values of input parameters to estimate the risk of a given population which results in compounding of the uncertainty in the model for example in the case of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk assessment models ingestion rate of water body weight of adults and children concentrations of as in groundwater exposure frequency and duration are all sources of uncertainty that makes risk assessment evaluation somewhat complicated hence uncertainty is an inherent property of the human health risk assessment carried out by the deterministic approaches due to variations in environmental conditions and individual human characteristics uncertainties in these methods could result either in overestimation of the health risk which may cause the wastage of resources on unnecessary remediation efforts or underestimation of the health risk resulting in serious health consequences for the individuals exposed to the as contaminated groundwater orosun 2021 addressing the issue of uncertainty in risk estimation allows for a more realistic approach to the distribution of risk chen and liao 2006 giri et al 2020 to achieve this the monte carlo simulation mcs technique i e a probabilistic approach was employed using oracle crystal ball software version 11 1 2 4 850 in the mcs technique random values are continually selected from the probability distribution of a large number of inputted values in order to determine the probability distribution of risk karami et al 2019 orosun et al 2020 and minimize the uncertainties the descriptions of input parameters their values and probability distributions utilized in both deterministic and probabilistic mcs approaches are given in table s1 supplementary data normal lognormal and triangular probability distributions were employed for the variables in mcs in this study various goodness of fit tests e g kolmogorov smirnov anderson darling and chi square tests were performed to determine the probability distribution of the measured as concentrations in groundwater the number of iterations for every run was set at 10 000 furthermore in order to identify the input parameters that have a significant impact on the output of risk assessment sensitivity analysis was carried out 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater the summary of statistical data for hydrogeochemical parameters of groundwater and river water samples collected from bahraich district is given in table 1 the ph of the groundwater samples ranged from 6 9 to 8 2 which indicates near neutral to slightly alkaline conditions the redox potential eh was found to range from 190 to 115 with 61 samples n 57 showing negative eh values which indicated dominantly reducing aquifer conditions in the study area table s3 supplementary data measured electrical conductivity ec values were found to vary within the range of 50 1050 μs cm mean value 644 229 μs cm the major ion chemistry of the studied samples showed that bicarbonate hco3 was the dominant anion in groundwater followed by cl so4 2 and no3 the hco3 concentration was found to vary from 132 to 634 mg l mean value 360 90 1 mg l the observed relatively high concentrations of hco3 in groundwater compared to other anions could be associated with the organic matter oxidation and dissolution of carbonate minerals mukherjee and fryar 2008 smedley et al 2003 cl concentration was found in range between 0 76 and 219 mg l mean value 39 46 7 mg l while the no3 concentration varied from not detected to 152 mg l mean value 12 28 4 mg l the low mean nitrate concentration observed in the study area could be either due to the lack of sufficient recharge or it may be due to the bacterial facilitated nitrate reduction in groundwater chauhan et al 2012 komor and anderson 1993 the concentration of f was found to be very low mean value 0 22 0 09 mg l the so4 2 concentration ranged from 0 02 to 118 mg l mean value 20 7 24 9 mg l but no phosphorus was found in any of the groundwater samples anthropogenic activities in nearby areas could have contributed to the observed high sulfate concentrations up to 118 mg l in groundwater samples li et al 2006 rasool et al 2016 doc concentration in groundwater samples in this study was found to be low range 1 05 8 25 mg l mean value 3 09 1 39 mg l compared to a similar study carried out by chauhan et al 2012 in groundwaters of middle gangetic plain calcium was found to be the dominant cation in groundwater samples followed by mg2 na and k the ca2 concentration varied from 19 5 mg l to 125 mg l mean value 74 8 20 3 mg l while the concentration of mg2 varied from 6 65 to 63 8 mg l mean value 26 2 10 2 mg l the concentrations of na and k ranged from 3 14 to 158 mg l mean value 30 5 26 3 mg l and 0 68 107 mg l mean value 10 2 15 6 mg l respectively 3 2 hydrogeochemical facies and classification of groundwater type fig 2 shows the piper diagrams that have been plotted for the classification of the primary ions present in groundwater and for understanding the key hydrogeochemical contrasts between different water types based on the analysis of the piper diagram plots it was determined that groundwater in the study area was primarily of ca2 mg2 hco3 type 97 fig 2 with only two samples belonging to the ca2 mg2 cl water type and one sample belonging to the na hco3 cl water type the homogenous nature of groundwater with dominating ca2 mg2 hco3 type facies and a small amount of cl bearing facies clearly indicated the fresh water recharge along with the dissolution of carbonate minerals the piper diagram also showed that most of the samples were enriched in ca2 and hco3 ions the high ca2 and hco3 concentrations table 1 highlighted the importance of carbonate dissolution and bicarbonate generation in the hydrogeochemical evolution of groundwater which eventually influenced the mobility of trace metals mukherjee et al 2008 dissolution of carbonate minerals in the study area was also supported by calculated mean si values of carbonate minerals such as aragonite 0 34 calcite 0 48 and dolomite 0 83 which show the sub saturation of these minerals table 2 mineral dissolution of calcite and dolomite releases hco3 ca2 and mg2 ions into groundwater the molar ratios of these ions serve as a crucial indicator for predicting the origin of hco3 ions hco3 ca2 mg2 meq l ratio 1 indicates that hco3 was formed primarily by silicate weathering or organic matter reduction wagner et al 2005 around 60 of groundwater samples in the study area had an hco3 ca2 mg2 ratio 1 indicating that hco3 ions in groundwater were produced by both silicate weathering or degradation of organic matter with a slight dominance and dissolution of carbonate minerals the ca2 mg2 concentration was also plotted against hco3 mukherjee and fryar 2008 fig 3 a which showed that samples were almost equally distributed on the left and right sides of the equiline suggesting that silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution could be attributed to the release of hco3 in groundwater similarly the ca2 mg2 vs hco3 so4 2 plot fig 3b emphasizes the role of calcite dolomite anhydrite and gypsum dissolution in the concentration of these ions in groundwater which is governed by carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering as well as ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes brindha et al 2020 the process of exchanging ions from liquid groundwater to solid calcite dolomite and gypsum or anhydrite is known as ion exchange whereas the process of exchanging ions from solid calcite dolomite and gypsum or anhydrite to liquid groundwater is known as reverse ion exchange khan et al 2019 fig 3b showed the equal distribution of samples both below and above the equiline which signified the role of both silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution the pints close to the hco3 so4 2 side signified the ion exchange process mallick et al 2018 data points falling on the equiline suggested that these ions ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 were derived from the dissolution of carbonate calcite dolomite and sulfate anhydrite gypsum mineral dissolution fisher and mullican 1997 kumar et al 2006 which was also supported by the mean si values of these minerals which showed their saturation to undersaturation i e dissolution in groundwater table 2 some samples were also plotted away from equiline towards the ca2 mg2 side which suggested that some ca2 and mg2 ions were derived from reverse ion exchange processes under the influence of carbonate weathering khan and rai 2022a nakhaei et al 2016 in addition scatter plots of the major ions fig 3c and d have also been used to distinguish between different processes like silicate and carbonate weathering and evaporite dissolution that control the major ion chemistry of groundwater gaillardet et al 1999 zhu et al 2011 the na normalized mg2 versus ca2 fig 3c suggested that silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution were the sources of mg mukherjee and fryar 2008 the na normalized ca2 versus hco3 plot fig 3d suggested that the composition of groundwater samples was strongly influenced by silicate weathering and carbonate dissolution with the evaporate dissolution mechanism playing a minor role 3 3 as fe and mn concentrations in groundwater arsenic concentration in the groundwater samples from this study was not very high mean 16 μg l table 1 compared to the other studies in the alluvial aquifer of the gangetic plain chauhan et al 2012 kumar et al 2010 arsenic concentration ranged from 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l mean value 16 22 6 μg l with 37 of the collected samples exceeding the who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water table 3 arsenic in natural waters e g groundwater predominantly exists as as v arsenate and as iii arsenite smedley and kinniburgh 2002 under oxidizing conditions arsenate species are predominant whereas arsenite predominates in reducing groundwater conditions in the current study samples were found to plot in the stability field of both arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 and arsenite h3aso3 fig 4 a this could be due to the mixed anoxic oxic conditions in the groundwater of the study area as evident from table 1 however we admit that predicting the as fe and other redox sensitive species in the water based on the ph eh diagram implies an uncertain chemical equilibrium because natural water is usually characterized by redox disequilibrium the recorded eh value is a mixed potential resulting from a diverse range of redox processes and pt electrode shows a weak response to many redox pairs ayers et al 2016 saha and rahman 2020 hence the determination of as species using as speciation cartridges mahanta et al 2015 or directly from high performance liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hplc icp ms and other techniques komorowicz and barałkiewicz 2016 is essential for more satisfactory results the spatial distribution of as showed that the maximum as concentration 10 μg l in groundwater samples was found in the samples from mahsi block fig 1 table s2 supplementary data this was followed by the as concentrations measured in samples from mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur and sheopur blocks respectively apart from these locations two samples from huzurpur and one sample each from fakharpur kaisarganj and chitaura were found to have as content exceeding the who prescribed limit of 10 μg l samples from all other blocks were found to be as free in mahsi block out of 13 samples 12 samples had as concentrations above the who guideline of 10 μg l in drinking water a significantly high as concentration greater than 100 μg l was measured in samples from the mihinpurwa block table s2 fig 1 the majority of the hand pumps 86 n 30 containing high as 10 μg l concentrations in groundwater were confined to blocks close to the ghagra river i e mihinpurwa balaha mahsi tajawapur and sheopur in the floodplains of holocene younger alluvium surfaces fig 1 whereas those hand pumps containing low as 10 μg l bearing groundwater samples were generally located in the blocks away from the river nawabganj risia chitaura payagpur and bisheshwarganj in pleistocene older alluvium regions these observations are consistent with previous studies in the ganga brahmaputra meghna gbm basin acharyya et al 2000 that reported that the younger sediments were un oxidized in nature and contained highly reactive natural organic carbon and as bearing fe mn hydroxides acharyya and shah 2007 postma et al 2012 this effect would decrease with increasing sediment burial ages this is also supported by the hypothesis of mcarthur et al 2011 that suggests the formation of a palaeo weathering surface during the last glacial maximum which prevented the underlying pleistocene aquifer from getting contaminated with doc and as enriched water the observed negative eh values and comparatively higher concentrations of doc table 1 also supported our observation related to higher concentrations of as found in the younger alluvium region of the study area measured fe concentrations in the collected samples were found to be quite high and varied from 0 06 mg l to 12 2 mg l with a mean value of 1 11 1 73 mg l table 1 around 70 of groundwater samples exceeded the who and bis accepted limit of 0 3 mg l for fe in drinking water table 3 the eh ph plot fig 4b shows that in most of the groundwater samples iron might be present in the reduced ferrous fe2 form as evident from the plotting of the samples with respect to the stability fields of different iron phases the measured mn concentrations in the samples reported in this study were found to be relatively low and variable and ranged from 0 39 μg l to 1423 μg l mean value 146 217 μg l with 11 and 36 of samples surpassing the who and bis acceptable limits of 400 μg l and 100 μg l in drinking water respectively tables 1 and 3 3 4 oxic and anoxic groundwater the groundwater samples collected from the study area were distinguished as oxic or anoxic based on the measured eh values out of 94 groundwater samples 37 samples have been classified as oxic with positive eh values and had high no3 and so4 2 and comparatively low as fe mn and doc concentrations table s3 supplementary data in the samples classified as oxic groundwater only two samples contain as 10 μg l the rest of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic with negative eh and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations table s3 supplementary data which typically characterise the aquifers associated with high as concentration von brömssen et al 2008 of all groundwater samples with negative eh 33 samples had as concentrations of 10 μg l these observations suggested that high as concentrations were associated with reducing groundwater conditions in the study area in such conditions iron oxyhydroxides and no3 can be easily reduced nelson eby 2004 and the release of as along with the fe could coincide with no3 and so4 2 reduction in groundwater kar et al 2010 the presence of dissolved organic carbon in the groundwater system could intensify the reduction of iron oxyhydroxides and the supply of high as in groundwater ravenscroft et al 2001 as also discussed in section 3 6 we found a positive correlation of as with doc r2 0 53 p 0 001 which suggested that the reducing conditions in the study area could be derived from microbial reduction of organic matters in the aquifer sediments facilitating the release of as in groundwater kar et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 hence the dominantly reducing nature of the groundwater in this region along with relatively low values of nitrate and sulfate and high values of fe and doc supported the release of as via reductive dissolution mechanism of iron oxyhydroxides 3 5 as and fe content and well depth although there was no linear trend observed for well depth versus as and fe content in groundwater it can be seen that as concentration increases with depth up to 35 m and decreases thereafter fig 5 a similar to the fe concentrations fig 5b maximum as concentrations were measured at depths ranging from 25 to 35 m coinciding with maximum fe concentrations indicating that the depth dependent redox conditions controlling fe dissolution and precipitation also influenced as dissolution and fixation nguyen and itoi 2009 the depth profiles of as and fe in this study were found to be similar to the other studies in as contaminated alluvial aquifers e g the bengal basin karim et al 1997 the jianghan plain china gan et al 2014 and the indus alluvial plain pakistan naseem and mcarthur 2018 3 6 relationship of as in groundwater with other parameters a scatter plot of as with other parameters such as eh doc no3 mn fe so4 2 and hco3 was used to investigate the geochemical behavior and processes influencing as release in groundwaters of the study area fig 6 a g as can be seen from fig 6a as showed a poor correlation with eh r2 0 21 p 0 001 but the majority of high as samples were found to be associated with negative eh values indicating the reducing conditions favored the mobility of as in groundwater groundwater samples of the study area were found to show a positive correlation between as concentrations and doc r2 0 53 p 0 001 fig 6b suggesting that the microbial degradation of organic matter in aquifer sediments resulted in overall reducing conditions that cause the release of as in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2006 hasan et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2001 redox sensitive species such as no3 mn fe and so4 2 are reduced sequentially in such microbial reduction processes guo et al 2012 mukherjee et al 2008 and as desorption from fe iii oxyhydroxides leads to an increase in as fe and hco3 concentrations mcarthur et al 2001 nickson et al 2005 since no3 is reduced more readily than fe the samples with elevated as concentrations should contain very low no3 concentrations to account for the as pollution caused by fe reduction mcarthur et al 2012 nickson et al 2000 furthermore in groundwater nitrate has been shown to strongly buffer the redox status and slow the reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides resulting in a low as concentration senn and hemond 2002 in this study almost all samples containing high as concentrations 10 μg l showed low no3 concentrations 1 mg l fig 6c supporting the reductive dissolution process for as release in the groundwater of the study area these observations are consistent with similar correlations reported between as and no3 concentrations found in the groundwater studies of the indus alluvial plain pakistan naseem and mcarthur 2018 and the gangetic plain of west bengal india kar et al 2010 arsenic showed a poor correlation with mn r2 0 02 p 0 05 fig 6d which could be explained by the fact that as adsorption desorption from mn oxides hydroxide minerals is not significant for mobilization of as in the aquifer as suggested by von brömssen et al 2007 for the matlab upazila region of bangladesh and mukherjee et al 2008 for the aquifers of west bengal india in addition the as released during the reduction of mn oxyhydroxides could be re adsorbed in to the fe oxyhydroxides present in the aquifer sediments biswas et al 2014a bhattacharya et al 2002 jia et al 2014 stüeben et al 2003 resulting in the poor correlation of mn with as a weak positive correlation r2 0 32 p 0 001 fig 6e between as and fe concentrations was observed in groundwater samples from this study similar to the other studies conducted in the terai regions of india and nepal diwakar et al 2015 singh et al 2018 and also from other areas of the gangetic plain dowling et al 2002 van geen et al 2006 the observed weak correlation between as and fe indicates the decoupling during their mobilization in groundwater diwakar et al 2015 several studies have revealed that the fe ii mediated alteration of weakly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides into more thermodynamically stable crystalline phases can delay the mobilization of as hossain et al 2014 fendorf et al 2010 during reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite the released as remains adsorb to surface until the surface sites of ferrihydrite become saturated after which as is released in to the aqueous phase pedersen et al 2006 this process triggers a delay in the release of as relative to fe2 resulting in an obvious decoupling between fe2 and as mobilization decoupling of fe2 and as may also occur as a result of fe2 sorption onto other surfaces such as clays or precipitation of fe ii minerals such as siderite diwakar et al 2015 around 85 of groundwater samples in bahraich were close to saturation with respect to siderite suggesting the precipitation of fe2 ions in the groundwater as siderite mcarthur et al 2001 thus dissolution and precipitation of fe minerals results in a decoupling between as and fe in addition the lithologically heterogeneous nature of alluvial sediments causes a range of fe as ratios in fe oxyhydroxides and their reductive dissolution results in a decoupling between as and fe naseem and mcarthur 2018 the overall sulfate concentration in groundwater at the study site was found to be high mean value of 20 67 mg l table 1 but the relationship between as and so4 2 showed that in most of the groundwater samples with high as concentrations 10 μg l the so4 2 concentration was found to be low 15 mg l fig 6f indicating the redox dependent release of as in groundwater guo et al 2014 xie et al 2009 2013 similar correlations between as and so4 2 concentrations have also been reported for the alluvial aquifers of bangladesh and for alluvial groundwater of the middle gangetic plain by ahmed et al 2004 and chauhan et al 2012 respectively in addition the poor negative correlation between as and so4 2 r2 0 11 p 0 01 fig 6f indicates that as has not been released by oxidation of as bearing sulfide minerals oinam et al 2011 arsenic shows weak or no correlation with hco3 r2 0 006 p 0 05 fig 6g indicating various sources and sinks of hco3 e g degradation of dissolved organic matter and dissolution precipitation of carbonate minerals mahanta et al 2015 and competitive adsorption by bicarbonate might not be the primary mechanism for as mobilization kumar et al 2021 zhou et al 2017 and the occurrence of reductive processes in the study area this is also supported by values calculated for saturation indices of carbonate minerals table 2 overall high concentrations of fe and hco3 in samples with high as concentrations suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as a dominant process of as release in the groundwater of bahraich however a detailed evaluation of the geochemical and mineralogical composition of sub surface sediments and their comparison with the observed geochemical characteristics of groundwater is required to make a more satisfactory conclusion about the release mechanism of as in groundwater of the study area 3 7 effect of anthropogenic activities on groundwater geochemistry high nitrate concentrations in groundwater reported from various parts of india have been attributed to agricultural return flows improper sanitation and human and animal wastes agrawal et al 1999 cgwb 2013 suthar et al 2009 das et al 2020a of all the groundwater samples analyzed in this study only 9 and 11 had no3 concentrations that exceeded the acceptable limits of who 50 mg l and bis 45 mg l in drinking water table 3 the sources whether geogenic e g mineral weathering and dissolution or anthropogenic e g waste water infiltration and controlling factors of nitrate concentrations in groundwater were investigated using cross plots of no3 with ec and hco3 brindha et al 2020 figs s1 a b supplementary data the plots showed that nitrate was derived from both geogenic and anthropogenic sources in the study area the anthropogenic contribution to the nitrate concentrations may be due to the close proximity of constructed toilets and hand pump bore wells as observed during the field survey more specifically the geogenic and anthropogenic components of nitrate concentrations in groundwater could be separated by calculating the natural backgrounds and threshold values of nitrate using different statistical and graphical methods such as pre selection probability plots and component separation methods amiri et al 2021 de caro et al 2017 kim et al 2015 in general doc concentration in unpolluted groundwater ranges from 0 1 to 4 mg l coyte et al 2019 and in several regions where doc concentration was found greater than 4 mg l in unpolluted groundwater they were mainly associated with known organic deposits e g coal deposits peat soils in aquifer sediments under reducing groundwater conditions anawar et al 2003 artinger et al 2000 around 17 of groundwater samples from this study had doc concentrations greater than 4 mg l high doc concentration found in some of the groundwater samples of bahraich is possibly the result of microorganism mediated organic matter degradation in the aquifer sediments or it could be attributed to the local sewerage which is a common source for high doc islam et al 2004 ravenscroft et al 2001 high doc concentration mean value 4 34 mg l up to 9 40 mg l was also observed in a rivulet i e saryu river of bahraich table 1 such local water bodies are often dumps of waste water e g discharge of untreated sewage and human waste and are a potential source of organic matter to groundwater additionally waste water from septic tanks and pit latrines may also have contributed substantial amount of organic matter to groundwater of bahraich mcarthur et al 2012 observations of high no3 concentrations along with high doc concentrations in groundwater samples from certain areas could be indicative of a significant anthropogenic contribution affecting the groundwater quality in those areas of bahraich table s2 3 8 speciation calculations phreeqc version 3 7 0 parkhurst and appelo 1999 was used to calculate the saturation indices si of mineral species in groundwater this enables predicting the occurrence of reactive mineral phases in aquifer using geochemical data of groundwater samples without collection of any solid samples sridharan and nathan 2017 the si of mineral phases was calculated using following expression s i l o g i a p k s p where iap ionic activity product and ksp solubility product of the mineral the calculated positive and negative si values suggest the oversaturation and undersaturation of groundwater with respect to a particular mineral respectively the input parameters for calculating si of water samples were ph pe 16 9eh volts at 25 oc temperature alkalinity hco3 sodium potassium calcium magnesium fluoride chloride sulfate nitrate iron and manganese table 2 provides the details of the statistical summary of the saturation index calculations on groundwater samples of the bahraich district the mean si values of the minerals indicated that the groundwater was near saturation with carbonate minerals such as aragonite caco3 0 34 calcite caco3 0 48 dolomite camg co3 2 0 83 siderite feco3 0 46 and rhodochrosite mnco3 0 59 these observations suggest the additional sources of high hco3 in groundwater of the study area including the dissolution of carbonate minerals as discussed earlier most probably the oxidation of organic matter present in the aquifer sediments ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008 it is also evident from si values of carbonate minerals that their precipitation and dissolution largely influence the groundwater solute chemistry of the region bhowmick et al 2013 the groundwater of the study area was strongly undersaturated with respect to mn oxide hydroxide phases including hausmannite mn3o4 20 6 pyrolusite mno2 17 6 manganite mnooh 9 3 pyrochroite mn oh 2 6 9 suggesting unfavorable conditions for the precipitation of these minerals in groundwater undersaturation of mn oxide minerals e g pyrolusite suggested the predominantly reducing conditions in the aquifer lead to high dissolved mn resulting from the reduction of mn oxide minerals bhowmick et al 2013 das et al 2020b but in contrast low mean mn concentrations in groundwater 146 1 84 μg l may be due to the removal of mn from groundwater by precipitation of rhodochrosite as 34 samples of the study area had near saturation to saturation with respect to rhodochrosite or incorporation by solid solution on to siderite or other carbonate minerals as predicted in the post oxic environment ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 mukherjee et al 2008 verma et al 2016 groundwater samples were found oversaturated with respect to fe oxide hydroxide phases in contrast to mn oxide hydroxide phases such as goethite feooh 5 31 and hematite fe2o3 12 64 indicating the favorable aqueous conditions in study site aquifers for the precipitation of these minerals and they could act as a sink of as in groundwater fuller et al 1993 sappa et al 2014 sridharan and nathan 2017 however another iron oxyhydroxide mineral ferrihydrite had saturation to slightly undersaturated i e indicating dissolution in groundwater suggesting that it could be a possible mineral phase releasing as in bahraich groundwater although the phreeqc modeling technique gives an overview of the possible mineral phases present in aquifers that control the geochemistry of groundwater it should be validated by analyzing the aquifer solid samples deutsch and siegel 1997 merkel and geochemistry 2005 as a result future studies should include a detailed evaluation of the mineralogical composition of subsurface sediments in order to more accurately predict the mechanism of as release and associated as bearing mineral phases in the study area s aquifers 3 9 statistical analysis 3 9 1 factor analysis multivariate factor analysis was done for the identification of geochemical processes and the estimation of the extent and source of groundwater pollution table 4 provides the details of the factor analysis results of physico chemical parameters for groundwater samples along with details about loadings eigen values variability percentage and cumulative variance the total variability which accounted for four factors was found to be 67 0 based on the data reported in this study factor 1 was found to show significant geochemical associations between ec na k ca2 mg2 cl no3 so4 2 and hco3 as observed by sridharan and nathan 2017 the role of carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities like application of fertilizers k no3 and so4 2 and sewage disposal no3 and cl being generally responsible for the significant association of these parameters these mechanisms could be significant in influencing bahraich hydrogeochemistry correlation of ca2 mg2 and hco3 suggested dissolution of carbonate minerals like calcite aragonite and dolomite according to saha et al 2009 a moderately high cl and so4 2 loading table 4 indicated anthropogenic sources such as domestic waste and untreated sewage factor 2 was found to show a strong relationship of as with doc and hco3 which suggested the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides via microbial degradation of organic matter causes the release of as in groundwater factor 3 did not show a significant relationship between as and other variables indicating that multiple sources play a role in controlling the occurrences of as in bahraich groundwater 3 9 2 correlation matrix the shapiro wilk and kolmogorov smirnova tests were used table s4 to test the normality of different geochemical parameters if significance value of these tests is greater than 0 05 the data is considered normal while the value smaller than 0 05 indicate the deviation from the normal distribution the results indicate that all geochemical parameters are non normally distributed table s4 the skewness and kurtosis values also confirm non normality of the data hence spearman rank correlation table 5 was used to assess the relationship between various parameters significant correlation was observed in eh no3 as ec na mg2 cl hco3 na mg2 cl no3 so4 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 hco3 mg2 cl hco3 cl no3 so4 2 no3 so4 2 as and as doc these relationships were consistent with observations made from factor analysis i e carbonate dissolution and anthropogenic activities dominantly controlled the geochemistry of groundwater in bahraich a good correlation of ca2 with mg2 and hco3 suggested the dissolution of calcite and dolomite sheikhy narany et al 2014 the negative correlation coefficient between as and eh in addition to the observed high fe concentration indicated the redox conditions of the aquifer further the strong positive correlation coefficient between as and doc as also observed from factor analysis suggests the reductive dissolution mechanism as the main process for as release in groundwater nitrate concentrations were found to show a positive correlation with the eh of the groundwater it is evident from the fact that as eh becomes lower e g in reducing conditions denitrification causes the reduction of nitrate højberg et al 2017 thereby lowering its concentrations in groundwater in most of our groundwater samples very low nitrate concentrations were associated with negative low eh values reducing conditions and high as concentrations fig 6c as reducing conditions also favor the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and the mobilization of as gurung et al 2005 the positive correlation between nitrate and eh is also an indirect indicator of the reductive dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and the mobilization of as in groundwater moderate correlation coefficient between doc and hco3 suggest that doc is derived in groundwater via degradation of organic matter artinger et al 2000 appelo et al 2002 hasan et al 2007 3 10 river water chemistry in addition to groundwater samples river water samples were collected and analyzed at various sites to better understand the extent of as contamination in bahraich and to assess the effects of groundwater as contamination on the surface water bodies and vice versa this was a crucial exercise considering that the local river stream is dominantly fed by groundwater and its chemistry reflects the chemistry of the groundwater as seen from the data reported in table 1 the hydrogeochemistry of river water samples was found to be similar to groundwater samples from this study with slightly lower total cation and anion concentrations compared to the groundwater samples table 1 river water samples were observed to be relatively more alkaline than the groundwater samples with ph values in the range of slightly alkaline to alkaline 7 7 8 7 the redox potential eh was found to vary between 52 and 220 indicating highly oxidizing conditions table 1 due to direct exposure and contact with the atmosphere the electrical conductivity of all river samples was found in the range of 214 590 μs cm which was relatively lower than the groundwater of adjacent regions iron concentrations for the river water samples were also found to be lower 0 08 2 09 mg l table 1 compared to groundwater samples doc concentrations in river samples were found to be slightly higher 1 46 9 4 mg l mean 2 58 2 58 mg l than groundwater samples which could be due to the dumping of untreated sewage and human and animal waste in contrast to groundwater samples with no detectable phosphate content phosphate concentration was detected in some river water samples nd 11 6 mg l 0 83 mg l which could be attributed to domestic sewage animal wastes and agricultural runoff containing fertilizers arsenic concentration in the major streams of the study area viz ghagra and babai fig 1 was comparatively low mean 6 56 3 89 μg l but almost all samples from the rivulet i e saryu river were found to have a high as concentration mean 17 8 6 73 μg l it was found that the groundwater samples close to the saryu river also had relatively higher as concentrations compared to the regions away from it overall mean as concentrations in river water were slightly lower compared to groundwater but alarmingly 73 of samples n 11 had as greater than 10 μg l table 3 the observed high as concentration in surface water might be the result of infiltration from as enriched shallow groundwater of the nearby regions mukherjee and fryar 2008 or it could be associated with local reductive processes occurring in the hyporheic zone diwakar et al 2015 the other possible factors causing the high as concentrations in surface water could be the application of herbicides and insecticides on agricultural fields as well as the use of untreated wastewater sewage sludge as agricultural fertilizer as observed by other studies in alluvial plain regions arain et al 2008 baig et al 2009 2010 3 11 mechanism of as release in ghagra basin enrichment in low temperature groundwater can be caused by a variety of processes such processes include sulfide oxidation desorption of as from minerals at high ph alkali desorption weathering of minerals like apatite and reductive dissolution of fe iii oxyhydroxides chowdhury et al 1999 farooqi et al 2007 mallick and rajagopal 1996 mandal et al 1998 mcarthur et al 2001 neumann et al 2010 nickson et al 1998 2000 2005 although williams et al 2005 proposed sulfide oxidation as the dominant mechanism of as release in nepal s terai regions the low concentrations of no3 and so4 2 in this study s groundwater samples combined with observations of high as 10 μg l and relatively high ph mean 7 49 fig 6c and f table 1 do not support this mechanism as the primary source of as dowling et al 2002 in addition sulfide oxidation results in positive correlation of so4 2 with fe and as which is not observed in this study the alkali desorption mechanism of as release is characterized by a generally high ph 8 of groundwater and a positive correlation between ph and as smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the average ph of groundwater samples in the study site 7 49 0 30 with no correlation observed between ph and as tables 4 and 5 this clearly rules out the role of alkali desorption in the high as concentration of the study area in the study area excluding two samples all groundwater samples with high as concentrations 10 μg l were coupled with anoxic groundwater negative eh along with relatively higher values of fe mn and hco3 concentrations and lower values of nitrate and sulfate in addition to the higher concentration of doc table s3 supplementary data these observations indicate predominantly reducing aquifer conditions which is indicative of the predominantly reducing aquifer conditions similar to the other regions of the gangetic plain singh et al 2018 and the release of as via reductive dissolution mechanism of iron oxyhydroxides in the study area various earlier studies in gangetic floodplain aquifers bhattacharya et al 1997 biswas et al 2014b dowling et al 2002 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 nath et al 2008 seddique et al 2008 zheng et al 2004 khan and rai 2022b have also concluded the reductive dissolution of fe oxyhydroxides as the major mechanism for high as in anoxic groundwater multiples studies have reported the presence of iron oxide minerals in the sediments of gangetic plain aquifer acharyya 2005 mukherjee 2012 arsenic is strongly adsorbed on these mineral surfaces kocar et al 2009 and they may release as into groundwater during their dissolution harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 3 12 health risk assessment human exposure to as contaminated groundwater has become a serious health problem due to its severe health effects hence in this study both carcinogenic hq and hi and non carcinogenic ilcr and tilcr health risks associated with as in groundwater samples via two exposure pathways ingestion and dermal for two population groups adults and children were estimated applying both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies as expected the calculated chronic daily intake cdi of as via ingestion dominated the dermal exposure table s5 in fact dermal exposure had a negligible impact on total carcinogenic and non carcinogenic risk calculations 3 12 1 deterministic approach in terms of non carcinogenic health risks the mean values of hazard index hi estimated for as in groundwater were found to exceed the threshold value 1 for both adults 1 89e 00 and children 3 12e 00 using the deterministic approach table s5 around 40 samples for adults and 52 samples for children in the study area had hi values above the accepted limit it can be seen that children had more sensitive receptors than adults with respect to the non carcinogenic health risks which could be due to their lower body weight than adults the results of this study were found to be similar to the other studies conducted by various researchers fallahzadeh et al 2018 he and wu 2019 huang et al 2017 wu et al 2011 yousefi et al 2019 the calculated mean tilcr i e cancer risk values for as in the study area were 3 65e 04 for adults and 1 20e 04 for children table s5 the results clearly showed that the mean tilcr values of both subgroups i e adults and children significantly exceeded the threshold value of 1e 04 with 55 and 35 samples for adults and children respectively surpassing the accepted value overall it can be inferred from the mean values of tilcr that adults are more prone to carcinogenic risk than children which might be due to higher exposure frequencies and duration skin surface area and intake rate rajasekhar et al 2018 verma and sinha 2022 the results of this study were consistent with other studies that looked at cancer risk estimations saha et al 2017 saha and rahman 2020 zuzolo et al 2020 in terms of the spatial distribution of the calculated health risks in the study area both adults and children are exposed to the highest levels of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks in mahsi as indicated by their mean hi and tilcr values table s6 the blocks such as mahsi mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur huzurpur sheopur and fakharpur were found to have hi values for both adult children above the threshold value of 1 whereas the rest of the blocks were found free of any risk for non carcinogenic health effects the regions with tilcr exceeding the threshold value of 1e 04 for adults were mahsi mihinpurwa balaha tajawapur huzurpur sheopur fakharpur chitaura and kaisarganj the patterns of tilcr spatial distribution for children in the study were found to be similar to that for adults with the difference that sheopur fakharpur chitaura and kaisarganj were relatively safe for cancer risk to children 3 12 2 monte carlo simulation based probabilistic approach in order to minimize the uncertainty in risk estimation via a deterministic approach monte carlo simulations probabilistic method were also performed simulations were run for different input values used by different researchers in previous studies table s1 considering 10 000 iterations in oracle crystal ball software for eqs 5 and 8 to calculate the carcinogenic and non carcinogenic health risks associated with drinking as contaminated groundwater table s4 summarizes the health risk assessment results from probabilistic methods in terms of non carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects in this study the 5th and 95th percentiles were considered the low and high ends of risk estimation because the estimates for the lowest and highest values obtained from the probabilistic method may lead to underestimation and overestimation of risk respectively kavcar et al 2009 saha et al 2017 saha and rahman 2020 the distribution of hi and tilcr for adults and children is shown in fig 7 the calculated non carcinogenic risk hi using deterministic method were nearly identical to that of the probabilistic approach table s4 however an overestimation was observed in the case of carcinogenic risk tilcr calculated by the deterministic approach overall the results of hi and tilcr warn the study area is at high risk for both non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health effects caused by the consumption of as contaminated groundwater hence the current study calls for a suitable policy intervention to reduce groundwater contamination in addition as should be included in the essential list of parameters to be consistently monitored in groundwater in order to limit the risk to public health 3 12 3 sensitivity analysis a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the contribution of input variables to the output values of risk estimates in the probabilistic risk assessment model fig 8 shows the results of sensitivity analysis for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks for adults and children exposed to as contaminated groundwater the concentration of as in groundwater and exposure duration ed were the most effective variables for non carcinogenic hi and carcinogenic tilcr risk estimation in both adults and children besides averaging time at and ingestion rate ir also had significant influences on estimated non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk outcomes respectively 4 conclusions the hydrochemical behavior fate and health risk assessment of as using deterministic and mcs based probabilistic methods have been investigated in bahraich district located in the middle gangetic plain ghaghara river sub basin terai region of india the groundwater of the study area predominantly belongs to the ca2 mg2 hco3 type hydrochemical facies and is affected by the dissolution of carbonates and silicates along with ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes the concentration of as in the groundwater samples was found in range between 0 64 μg l to 104 μg l and 37 of the samples had as 10 μg l who and bis acceptable limit of 10 μg l for drinking water river water samples contained significant as concentrations mean of 14 μg l with approximately 73 of samples containing as concentrations greater than 10 μg l which could be due to infiltration from as enriched shallow groundwater in the surrounding areas the majority of the groundwater samples n 57 were anoxic with negative eh and had low so4 2 and no3 and high mn fe and doc concentrations which indicates predominantly reducing aquifer conditions probably caused by the oxidative degradation of organic matter facilitating the mobilization of as in the groundwater of the study area the health risk analysis found that both the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of exposure to as contaminated groundwater were above the acceptable limits the children were more prone to non carcinogenic risks whereas adults were found more sensitive to carcinogenic risks arsenic concentration and exposure duration were the most influential variables for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk estimations in both adults and children the study highlights the risk of as exposure to humans as well as the substantial health risks associated with drinking as contaminated groundwater hence it is critical to include as in routine monitoring of groundwater quality furthermore given the high spatial variability of as in groundwater it is recommended to apply a blanket testing in the study area using reliable as field kits in order to demarcate the as safe and as contaminated wells and thus offer an option to the residents until a long term remediation strategy is implemented future studies should focus on the geochemical and mineralogical characteristics of sub surface sediments by taking sediment cores at different depths to develop a precise understanding of specifics source of as as well as the mineralogical control and mechanism of as mobilization in the middle gangetic plain furthermore studies should also concentrate on the involvement of microbes in mediating the biogeochemical processes

11749,manganese compounds exist naturally in the environment as solids in soils and small particles in water human industrial activities and the burning of fossil fuels increase the manganese concentration in the air studies have shown that exposure to manganese has extremely dangerous toxic effects on humans resulting in ailments such as the metal fume fever which produces symptoms such as metallic taste in the mouth headache fever and chills anxieties chest tightness and cough this has led many researchers to try different techniques to eliminate this harmful metal from the environment among methods adsorption is one of the most effective and efficient for the removal of contaminants such as heavy metals from wastewater we focused on local from saudi arabia and commercial from india bentonite clay to verify the importance of natural bentonite clay as an adsorbent for water treatment while other purification techniques are expensive bentonite clay is cheap natural and accessible therefore we investigated how the concentration of the solution ph temperature adsorbent amount contact time and bentonite procedure washing and heat treatment affect the

communities and industrial discharge of toxins pollute the environment this has encouraged industries to try to eliminate toxic chemicals from aqueous solutions several recent research projects have emphasized the removal of heavy metals from wastewater one of the most effective wastewater treatment techniques is adsorption because it is a simple and convenient method for the removal of any heavy metals the main concern for its success is the availability of inexpensive adsorbents for the remediation of heavy metal contaminated wastewater ahmaruzzaman 2012 chowdhary et al 2018 li et al 2020 ajiboye et al 2021 water pollution due to toxic materials is a major problem worldwide because it damages the quality of the environment plants and human and animal health heavy metals are the most common toxic substances even at very low concentrations the harmfulness of these substances derives from the fact that they are non biodegradable and them bioaccumulate in food chains manganese can be found naturally in a variety of surface and groundwater sources as well as in soils which can infuse manganese into water manganese oxides and their composites have proven to be excellent adsorbents for removing metal ions and pollutants from water and wastewater over time they have gotten a lot of attention as good adsorbents because of their unusual chemical and physical features manganese may develop a potent neurotoxin that affects the nervous system and causes learning disabilities and intellectual impairment in children when it is present in high amounts children exposed to 240 350 g

ground and surface water it is a transition metal with more than five different valence states it is mostly present in the environment in its oxidized chemical forms such as mno2 or mn3o4 manganese is essential for human health and functions as a cofactor in the active centers of a variety of enzymes it is also required for blood sugar balance appropriate development the preservation of neuron and immune cell functioning and the consumption of vitamins among further things overexposure to mn on the other hand can be harmful to a variety of organ systems blanc 2018 abubakar et al 2019 manganese oxides and their composites have proven to be good adsorbents for removing metal ions and pollutants from water and wastewater over time they have been widely used in the adsorbent sector because to their unique chemical and physical features however inappropriate disposal of dry cell batteries or additional harmful wastes from industry can cause manganese concentrations in water to rise over the usual limit posing a significant harm to public health the synthesis characterization and application of bentonite clay and composites for wastewater treatment are demonstrated in this study antonelli et al 2020 saja et al 2020 the features of adsorption as well as the experimental circumstances and mechanisms involved in pollutant removal procedures this study gives a high level review of manganese oxide research and its implementations adsorption is now one of the most successful and efficient strategies for removing any contaminants such as heavy metals from wastewater among all the approaches the development of a variety of cost effective adsorbents for water treatment has resulted in an increase in the number of research articles on heavy metal adsorption using bentonite clay rizzi et al 2020a kausar et al 2020 cao et al 2019 kakaei et al 2020 to verify the importance of natural bentonite clay as an adsorbent for water treatment the current study focused on local from saudi arabia and commercial from india bentonite clay al sheikh et al 2019 2 materials and methods technical details 2 1 experimental procedure and bentonite characterization the used materials including chemicals and instrumentation are listed in supplementary information manganese adsorption with bentonite clay was carried out in a batch method bereket et al 1997 manganese stock and test solutions were made from mn no3 2xh2o and all experiments were conducted with deionized water in the experiment standard manganese solutions ranging from 0 126 to 0 209 g l were created by diluting the stock solutions polyethylene centrifuge tubes containing 0 5 g of bentonite clay and 50 ml of manganese ions with different concentrations 50 400 mg l were used for the adsorption studies the tubes were positioned in a centrifuge after being placed in a water shaker incubator at 25 c and 162 rpm stirring rate under natural ph conditions for a known duration of time it took 60 min to reach equilibrium the concentration of manganese left in the solution after centrifuged was evaluated using inductively coupled plasma optical emission icpoe oleszczuk et al 2007 yerbolov and daumova 2022 both types saudi and indian of clay were utilized in all of the experiments concentration difference methods were utilized to determine manganese ion absorption the manganese adsorbed percentage was calculated as follows adsorption percentage ci cf ci 100 ci is the initial concentration of manganese and cf is the final concentration of the manganese ion the adsorption curves present were estimated using the calculation explained above omri and benzina 2012 ibrahiem et al 2021 we also used a scanning electron microscope sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx to determine the samples structural composition the sem images of the saudi arabian local bentonite and the commercial bentonite clay samples with ultra sonication times of 20 min are shown in fig 1 some differences are observed in the surface structure of the local bentonite and the size but the morphology is almost comparable the sem images show that increasing the ultrasonic treatment time results in a small tightly packed pattern with highly porous and rough surface fig 2 shows the results of chemical analysis of local and commercial bentonite all samples include high oxygen silica and carbon content as well as modest amounts of fe3 ca2 and mg2 ti and cl s cations bentonite from this deposit is a high quality raw material for use in the ceramic industry according to technological and mineralogical study however compared to local samples the commercial bentonite chemical composition exhibits ba ions with small 0 3 wt in both samples the cations weight is comparable which justify the comparison between them in treatment of water 2 2 mineral composition and xrd study a powder x ray diffractometer model xd1180 equipped with a copper target cu k radiation under target voltage 40 kv and current 30 ma in a scanning rate of 2 c min was used to examine the mineralogical composition of a bentonite sample the chemical composition is as follows x ray fluorescence xrf was used to analyze the elements in a bentonite sample using a philips pw 2400 sequential x ray spectrometer the nondestructive analytical technique of x ray diffraction offers information regarding crystallographic structure fig 3 depicts the xrd pattern of a working sample of bentonite the natural bentonite sample contains montmorillonite that appears to be effectively crystallized in the sample as seen in fig 3 blanc 2018 3 results and discussion the percentage of adsorbed manganese in local and commercial bentonite clay was studied at varying bentonite masses 0 5 g 50 ml manganese solution keeping the centrifuge speed 162 rpm temperature 25 c and contact time 60 min constant this experiment was carried out to establish the ideal mass of bentonite both local and commercial required for the most effective manganese ion removal by using bentonite as an adsorbent we studied different parameters for effectively extracting manganese from aqueous solution the results are as follows 3 1 kinetics of adsorption one of the most important metrics used to assess the adsorption efficiency of bentonite clay is adsorption kinetics this parameter evaluates the diffusion of adsorbate in the pores and provides us with a measure of adsorption uptake over time at constant pressure or concentration it was critical in this experiment to determine the adsorption effectiveness of natural bentonite at room temperature 25 c fig 4 shows the effect of contact time on the manganese adsorption rate at 100 mg l the manganese adsorption rate appears to be very fast in this diagram the adsorption of manganese ions increases fast as time passes then slows down until it reaches saturation in around 30 min for the first hour the manganese ions were quickly removed however between the 5th and 6th hours it dropped dramatically before leveling out this is due to the fact that most unoccupied surface sites were available for adsorption during the early stages because of the repulsive forces between the bulk and solid phase molecules the remaining empty spots became impossible to access over time natural bentonite had a fantastic adsorption rate the high removal rate eventually reached a limit beyond which no more manganese ions could be removed from the solution the amount of bentonite adsorbing from the adsorbent and the amount being adsorbed were in a condition of dynamic equilibrium at this time the equilibrium time is the amount of bentonite adsorbed during that period and the amount of bentonite adsorbed during that time indicates the adsorbent s maximal adsorption capacity under the current operating conditions at 5 h equilibrium was reached that is the rate of bentonite uptake was originally higher since all sites on the adsorbent could be accessed and the bentonite concentration was higher but as the number of adsorbent sites was reduced the rate of consumption fell short adsorption timings are preferable for reducing energy consumption this means that bentonite is a slow manganese adsorbent with a 5 h shortened adsorption time 3 2 bentonite dosage effect the study conducted experiments to determine the efficacy of bentonite in removing metal from aqueous solutions this section discusses the findings of our experiment different adsorbent masses were utilized in the test ranging from 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 to 1 5 2 3 4 and 5 gms 50 ml the initial manganese concentration was kept constant at 100 mg l at 25 c and for 30 min of contact time during the experiment we noted that as the adsorbent does rise there was a decrease in the adsorption of manganese maximum removal was observed with the adsorbent dose of 0 5 g as shown in fig 5 the adsorption rate of manganese in mn g reduced as the quantity of bentonite heightened the decline is because of the increase in the repulsion forces which limit the rate of adsorption the experiment indicated that 0 5 g of bentonite adsorb the same quantity of manganese ions as 5 g for this reason industrial production can scale up to make only sufficient amounts 3 3 ph on manganese removal effect when conducting an experiment it is important to test the ph to assess the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent the ph influences the surface properties of the clay adsorbent and the ionic forms of the manganese in the solution the ph studied ranged over 2 4 6 8 10 12 with manganese ions concentration of 126 mg l and 209 mg l keeping all other parameters constant stirring speed 162 rpm for 60 min bentonite does 0 5 g at 25 c furthermore ph was measured before and after manganese adsorption the ph of the manganese solution was circumscribed by using diluted naoh and hcl solutions the ph of the aqueous solution is a key parameter that regulates the adsorption of manganese at the clay water interface the binding of metal ions with surface functional groups is often ph dependent the percentage of sorption of manganese increased as the ph heightened achieving a maximum at ph 6 as illustrated in fig 6 the presence of negatively charged groups in the adsorbent areas is crucial for metal sorption fig 5 demonstrates the impact of ph on mn adsorption into bentonite the experiment used commercial and local bentonite the adsorption rate showed the same trend for both categories of bentonite there was a decline in the ph as the absorption rates increased the maximum absorption was at ph 2 the maximum optimal adsorption was then observed at ph 6 reflecting the existence of a low level of h ions at ph values high enough to compete with manganese cations for the present adsorption sites another important observation was that bentonite surface charge is a strong function of the ph during this study natural bentonite s point of zero charge pzc was roughly at ph 4 this implies that the bentonite surface area is highly protonated at a ph below four rendering it unable to retain manganese ions in these circumstances h is seen competing with the manganese ions making active sites become protonated hence the exclusion of the manganese binding to the bentonite surface this suggests that at higher h concentrations softer ph values bentonite surface areas are positively charged therefore lowering the attraction between the manganese metal cations and the surface when the ph rises past the pzc it triggers more negatively charged surfaces to become available thus facilitating higher metal uptake during the experiments the researchers observed that at a ph above 6 metal precipitation occurred making the clay deteriorate the ph values of the bentonite suspension before and after manganese ion adsorption for both types of clay provided useful information for supporting the conclusions mentioned above the ph values for both types of clay in the bentonite suspension before and after manganese adsorption rudi et al 2020 are displayed in the graph above fig 7 shows that upon manganese adsorption the ph of the final suspension rises noticeably which could be due to the substitution of alkali and alkaline earth metals na k ca mg in the clay s exchange sites with manganese ions present in the solutions furthermore the carbonate in the bentonite structure may have dissolved into the solution resulting in an elevation in the ph of the final solution 3 4 the effect of temperature on mn removal the temperature s effect on the adsorption behavior of manganese into bentonite was tested at 25 35 55 and 55 c all samples were readied by mixing 0 5 g of the clay with 50 ml manganese solution of concentrations ranging around 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 mg l after that the mixture was shaken for 60 min then centrifuged all samples were analyzed by perkinelmer icp oes and carried out in duplicate for both local and commercial clays fig 7 illustrates the amount of manganese that the bentonite local and commercial had adsorbed at varying temperatures 25 35 45 and 55 c from these figures clearly when the temperature rises a rise for manganese adsorbed onto bentonite clay surfaces is triggered netpradit et al 2003 this spike in the adsorptive potential derives from the increasing kinetic energy within the manganese ions during heating hua 2018 fawaz mutar and saleh 2021 the increased kinetic energy generates a higher frequency of collisions between manganese ions and bentonite when heated which increases manganese adsorption onto bentonite surface areas it is important to mention here that this behavior was reproduced in former study about adsorption capacities of the metakaolin based geopolymer where the effects of temperature on the mn ii adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were investigated from 5 c to 50 c li et al 2019 it has been reported that the adsorption capacities of the metakaolin based geopolymer were increased from 30 06 to 32 94 mg g as the temperature rose from 10 to 50 c 3 5 desorption one of the most important stages in the metal ion removal process is the studying of desorption of an adsorbent jakfar et al 2021 rizzi et al 2020b desorption experiments are conducted to assess the ability of soil to produce heavy metal ions under specific conditions like the analysis of adsorption now we examine the effects of temperature ph and organic matter on the adsorption levels of commercial and local bentonite in this adsorption experiment we used deionized water as the desorption agent we loaded the bentonite samples with varying amounts of adsorbed mn ii ions and placed them in 50 ml iodized water after one day we checked and measured the amount of mn desorbed into the water fig 8 highlights the adsorbed and desorbed numbers of mn ions as can be seen there is high retention within bentonite this indicates that there is a strong contact between bentonite surfaces and the mn ions for both commercial and local bentonite gupt et al 2020 this result confirms the mn removal efficiency for ph 9 was significantly reduced as mn remains as a soluble cation in study where extensive experimental work has reported the efficiency in manganese mn removal from aqueous solution by carbonyl iron microparticles using magnetic separation techniques funes et al 2014 the pie chart below fig 9 shows the final percentages of adsorbed manganese ions for clean and burned local and commercial bentonite burned local and commercial bentonite have the highest adsorbed manganese at 34 the clean local bentonite takes 18 while clean commercial has 14 this implies that burned bentonite functions best in adsorbing manganese ions 4 conclusion due to their toxic effects there is an urgent need to remove heavy metals from industrial wastewater various procedures have been deployed to achieve this including ion exchange reverse osmosis electrolysis chemical precipitation solvent extraction and adsorption apart from adsorption all the other techniques are complicated time consuming expensive and in some cases time consuming in conditions of reducing the concentration ranges of heavy metals researchers have found that of all the available techniques adsorption is superior in terms of design simplicity removal efficiency insensitivity to toxic pollutants cost and flexibility bentonite was chosen because it is a low cost adsorbent that is available throughout the world using bentonite as an adsorbent a variety of parameters for successfully extracting mn from aqueous solution were investigated this study established that bentonite clay can serve as an efficient adsorbent for heavy metals such as manganese that often contaminate industrial wastewater based on the results of this study various conclusions could summarize as i this study offers enough proof that bentonite is efficient in the removal of metal from aqueous solutions this is an important economic reason from the perspective of scaling up productions for future industrial applications ii using low masses of bentonite is economically more favorable iii

study however compared to local samples the commercial bentonite chemical composition exhibits ba ions with small 0 3 wt in both samples the cations weight is comparable which justify the comparison between them in treatment of water 2 2 mineral composition and xrd study a powder x ray diffractometer model xd1180 equipped with a copper target cu k radiation under target voltage 40 kv and current 30 ma in a scanning rate of 2 c min was used to examine the mineralogical composition of a bentonite sample the chemical composition is as follows x ray fluorescence xrf was used to analyze the elements in a bentonite sample using a philips pw 2400 sequential x ray spectrometer the nondestructive analytical technique of x ray diffraction offers information regarding crystallographic structure fig 3 depicts the xrd pattern of a working sample of bentonite the natural bentonite sample contains montmorillonite that appears to be effectively crystallized in the sample as seen in fig 3 blanc 2018 3 results and discussion the percentage of adsorbed manganese in local and commercial bentonite clay was studied at varying bentonite masses 0 5 g 50 ml manganese solution keeping the centrifuge speed 162 rpm temperature 25 c and contact time 60 min constant this experiment was carried out to establish the ideal mass of bentonite both local and commercial required for the most effective manganese ion removal by using bentonite as an adsorbent we studied different parameters for effectively extracting manganese from aqueous solution the results are as follows 3 1 kinetics of adsorption one of the most important metrics used to assess the adsorption efficiency of bentonite clay is adsorption kinetics this parameter evaluates the diffusion of adsorbate in the pores and provides us with a measure of adsorption uptake over time at constant pressure or concentration it was critical in this experiment to determine the adsorption effectiveness of natural bentonite at room temperature 25 c fig 4 shows the effect of contact time on the manganese adsorption rate at 100 mg l the manganese adsorption rate appears to be very fast in this diagram the adsorption of manganese ions increases fast as time passes then slows down until it reaches saturation in around 30 min for the first hour the manganese ions were quickly removed however between the 5th and 6th hours it dropped dramatically before leveling out this is due to the fact that most unoccupied surface sites were available for adsorption during the early stages because of the repulsive forces between the bulk and solid phase molecules the remaining empty spots became impossible to access over time natural bentonite had a fantastic adsorption rate the high removal rate eventually reached a limit beyond which no more manganese ions could be removed from the solution the amount of bentonite adsorbing from the adsorbent and the amount being adsorbed were in a condition of dynamic equilibrium at this time the equilibrium time is the amount of bentonite adsorbed during that period and the amount of bentonite adsorbed during that time indicates the adsorbent s maximal adsorption capacity under the current operating conditions at 5 h equilibrium was reached that is the rate of bentonite uptake was originally higher since all sites on the adsorbent could be accessed and the bentonite concentration was higher but as the number of adsorbent sites was reduced the rate of consumption fell short adsorption timings are preferable for reducing energy consumption this means that bentonite is a slow manganese adsorbent with a 5 h shortened adsorption time 3 2 bentonite dosage effect the study conducted experiments to determine the efficacy of bentonite in removing metal from aqueous solutions this section discusses the findings of our experiment different adsorbent masses were utilized in the test ranging from 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 to 1 5 2 3 4 and 5 gms 50 ml the initial manganese concentration was kept constant at 100 mg l at 25 c and for 30 min of contact time during the experiment we noted that as the adsorbent does rise there was a decrease in the adsorption of manganese maximum removal was observed with the adsorbent dose of 0 5 g as shown in fig 5 the adsorption rate of manganese in mn g reduced as the quantity of bentonite heightened the decline is because of the increase in the repulsion forces which limit the rate of adsorption the experiment indicated that 0 5 g of bentonite adsorb the same quantity of manganese ions as 5 g for this reason industrial production can scale up to make only sufficient amounts 3 3 ph on manganese removal effect when conducting an experiment it is important to test the ph to assess the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent the ph influences the surface properties of the clay adsorbent and the ionic forms of the manganese in the solution the ph studied ranged over 2 4 6 8 10 12 with manganese ions concentration of 126 mg l and 209 mg l keeping all other parameters constant stirring speed 162 rpm for 60 min bentonite does 0 5 g at 25 c furthermore ph was measured before and after manganese adsorption the ph of the manganese solution was circumscribed by using diluted naoh and hcl solutions the ph of the aqueous solution is a key parameter that regulates the adsorption of manganese at the clay water interface the binding of metal ions with surface functional groups is often ph dependent the percentage of sorption of manganese increased as the ph heightened achieving a maximum at ph 6 as illustrated in fig 6 the presence of negatively charged groups in the adsorbent areas is crucial for metal sorption fig 5 demonstrates the impact of ph on mn adsorption into bentonite the experiment used commercial and local bentonite the adsorption rate showed the same trend for both categories of bentonite there was a decline in the ph as the absorption rates increased the maximum absorption was at ph 2 the maximum optimal adsorption was then observed at ph 6 reflecting the existence of a low level of h ions at ph values high enough to compete with manganese cations for the present adsorption sites another important observation was that bentonite surface charge is a strong function of the ph during this study natural bentonite s point of zero charge pzc was roughly at ph 4 this implies that the bentonite surface area is highly protonated at a ph below four rendering it unable to retain manganese ions in these circumstances h is seen competing with the manganese ions making active sites become protonated hence the exclusion of the manganese binding to the bentonite surface this suggests that at higher h concentrations softer ph values bentonite surface areas are positively charged therefore lowering the attraction between the manganese metal cations and the surface when the ph rises past the pzc it triggers more negatively charged surfaces to become available thus facilitating higher metal uptake during the experiments the researchers observed that at a ph above 6 metal precipitation occurred making the clay deteriorate the ph values of the bentonite suspension before and after manganese ion adsorption for both types of clay provided useful information for supporting the conclusions mentioned above the ph values for both types of clay in the bentonite suspension before and after manganese adsorption rudi et al 2020 are displayed in the graph above fig 7 shows that upon manganese adsorption the ph of the final suspension rises noticeably which could be due to the substitution of alkali and alkaline earth metals na k ca mg in the clay s exchange sites with manganese ions present in the solutions furthermore the carbonate in the bentonite structure may have dissolved into the solution resulting in an elevation in the ph of the final solution 3 4 the effect of temperature on mn removal the temperature s effect on the adsorption behavior of manganese into bentonite was tested at 25 35 55 and 55 c all samples were readied by mixing 0 5 g of the clay with 50 ml manganese solution of concentrations ranging around 50 100 150 200 250 300 400 mg l after that the mixture was shaken for 60 min then centrifuged all samples were analyzed by perkinelmer icp oes and carried out in duplicate for both local and commercial clays fig 7 illustrates the amount of manganese that the bentonite local and commercial had adsorbed at varying temperatures 25 35 45 and 55 c from these figures clearly when the temperature rises a rise for manganese adsorbed onto bentonite clay surfaces is triggered netpradit et al 2003 this spike in the adsorptive potential derives from the increasing kinetic energy within the manganese ions during heating hua 2018 fawaz mutar and saleh 2021 the increased kinetic energy generates a higher frequency of collisions between manganese ions and bentonite when heated which increases manganese adsorption onto bentonite surface areas it is important to mention here that this behavior was reproduced in former study about adsorption capacities of the metakaolin based geopolymer where the effects of temperature on the mn ii adsorption capacities of the adsorbents were investigated from 5 c to 50 c li et al 2019 it has been reported that the adsorption capacities of the metakaolin based geopolymer were increased from 30 06 to 32 94 mg g as the temperature rose from 10 to 50 c 3 5 desorption one of the most important stages in the metal ion removal process is the studying of desorption of an adsorbent jakfar et al 2021 rizzi et al 2020b desorption experiments are conducted to assess the ability of soil to produce heavy metal ions under specific conditions like the analysis of adsorption now we examine the effects of temperature ph and organic matter on the adsorption levels of commercial and local bentonite in this adsorption experiment we used deionized water as the desorption agent we loaded the bentonite samples with varying amounts of adsorbed mn ii ions and placed them in 50 ml iodized water after one day we checked and measured the amount of mn desorbed into the water fig 8 highlights the adsorbed and desorbed numbers of mn ions as can be seen there is high retention within bentonite this indicates that there is a strong contact between bentonite surfaces and the mn ions for both commercial and local bentonite gupt et al 2020 this result confirms the mn removal efficiency for ph 9 was significantly reduced as mn remains as a soluble cation in study where extensive experimental work has reported the efficiency in manganese mn removal from aqueous solution by carbonyl iron microparticles using magnetic separation techniques funes et al 2014 the pie chart below fig 9 shows the final percentages of adsorbed manganese ions for clean and burned local and commercial bentonite burned local and commercial bentonite have the highest adsorbed manganese at 34 the clean local bentonite takes 18 while clean commercial has 14 this implies that burned bentonite functions best in adsorbing manganese ions 4 conclusion due to their toxic effects there is an urgent need to remove heavy metals from industrial wastewater various procedures have been deployed to achieve this including ion exchange reverse osmosis electrolysis chemical precipitation solvent extraction and adsorption apart from adsorption all the other techniques are complicated time consuming expensive and in some cases time consuming in conditions of reducing the concentration ranges of heavy metals researchers have found that of all the available techniques adsorption is superior in terms of design simplicity removal efficiency insensitivity to toxic pollutants cost and flexibility bentonite was chosen because it is a low cost adsorbent that is available throughout the world using bentonite as an adsorbent a variety of parameters for successfully extracting mn from aqueous solution were investigated this study established that bentonite clay can serve as an efficient adsorbent for heavy metals such as manganese that often contaminate industrial wastewater based on the results of this study various conclusions could summarize as i this study offers enough proof that bentonite is efficient in the removal of metal from aqueous solutions this is an important economic reason from the perspective of scaling up productions for future industrial applications ii using low masses of bentonite is economically more favorable iii
