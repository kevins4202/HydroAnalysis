evapotranspiration temperature soil moisture and vegetation conditions were considered in this study inner mongolia fig 1 is located in central northern china and is also one of the agriculture and livestock husbandry bases however uneven spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation and precipitation deficit enables this region to be sensitive to drought hazards approximately 1 6 105 km2 cropland per year and 3 0 105 km2 grassland per year were negatively influenced by droughts across the inner mongolia meanwhile agricultural drought induced economic loss is up to around 200 million rmb per

integrating vci for vegetation condition spei3 for quantification of relations between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration smci as well for soil moisture conditions 1 idci a i s m c i b i v c i c i s p e i 3 where a b and c are the coefficients for smci vci and spei3 table 1 respectively at station i the vci is for drought monitoring long term avhrr observations kogan 1995 and was obtained by scaling ndvi 2 v c i ndvi i ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min where ndvi i refers to monthly ndvi at location i while ndvi min and ndvi max are the absolute 15 year 2000 2014 minimum and maximum values of ndvi at location i of meteorology station the soil moisture condition index smci is the scaled soil moisture sánchez et al 2016 3 s m c i i j y sm max sm i j y sm max sm min where sm i j y is the reanalysis soil moisture sm at pixel i in the jth month of the yth year while sm max and sm min are respectively the 15 year 2000 2014 absolute maximum and minimum values of smci at pixel i the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei was calculated by the r package https cran r project org web packages spei developed by beguería et al 2014 in this study spei spei3 was analyzed due to the sensitivity of vegetation conditions to soil moisture changes sims et al 2002 santos et al 2010 in addition spei3 was fitted to the log logistic probability distribution using the maximum likelihood method vicente serrano et al 2010 which is expressed as 4 f χ 1 α χ γ β 1 where α β and γ refer to the scale shape and location parameters that are computed based on χ the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration based on idci no drought idci 1 5 mild drought 0 5 idci 1 5 moderate drought 0 5 idci 0 5 severe drought 1 5 idci 0 5 and extreme severe drought idci 1 5 have been classified in this study table 2 3 2 scaled crop yield index scyi the monitoring performance of idci was evaluated using the scaled crop yield index yields of four main crops e g maize wheat potato and soybean were analyzed which account for nearly 90 of the total crop production in nner mongolia the scyi was computed as 5 s c y i i j cy i j m i n c y i m a x c y i m i n c y i where cy i j is the yield of the ith type of crop during the jth year scyi i j is the scaled crop yield index of the ith type of crop during the jth year 3 3 regionalization of climate conditions using fuzzy c means clustering method due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate conditions the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm was applied in climate regionalization meanwhile due to the multidimensional feature of input variables the sammon mapping was also used to reduce the dimensionality sammon 1969 sub regions were identified by the fcm method then the fcm algorithm was used to minimize the variance within the cluster with the inclusion of all stations considered in this study ayvaz et al 2007 6 d v k 1 n x j s k x j c k 2 where c k is the barycenter point for all points n is the summary of clusters s k is the entire point group in the kth cluster and x j is the standardized vector of point j more details can be found in zhang et al 2014 3 4 drought monitoring performance evaluation of idci in this study pearson correlation analysis was done for relations between idci and standing drought indices such as sc pdsi vci and so on in addition the mean of idci and that of sc pdsi were compared furthermore the correlation coefficients were analyzed between idci and soil moisture observations at different soil depths i e 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm in so doing the evaluation of drought monitoring performance of idci was done considering meteorological hydrologic and vegetation conditions 3 5 computation of drought frequency drought frequency is one of the most important temporal characteristics of drought features mckee et al 1993 based on idci this study calculated the frequencies of droughts with moderate and even higher intensities fmude which are the summation of frequencies of droughts with moderate severe and extreme intensities based on in situ observations during the growing season may to september from 2000 to 2014 eq 6 7 fmud e i j n m i j n s i j n e i j n 100 where fmude i j refers to the frequency of droughts with moderate to extreme drought intensities at the station i during month j from 2000 to 2014 nm i j ns i j and ne i j refer to the occurrence times of droughts with moderate severe and extreme drought intensities during 2000 to 2014 respectively n refers to the occurrence times of all drought events considered in this study from 2000 to 2014 4 results and discussions 4 1 regionalization of climate conditions using fuzzy c means clustering method climatic regionalization was done due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate conditions across inner mongolia from the results of the fcm cluster method the study region was subdivided into 3 regions with relatively homogeneous climate conditions with consideration of longitude latitude altitude monthly temperature and annual average precipitation fig 1b besides cropland was observed in the plain cultivated land ppf which accounts for majority of the crop lands in the inner mongolia along the low lying valleys and plains fig 1a 4 2 correlation between idci and sc pdsi the sc pdsi has been widely applied to the monitoring of agricultural drought at different time scales trenberth et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 therefore correlations between idci and sc pdsi were quantified to evaluate the drought monitoring performance of idci fig 2 it can be observed from fig 2 that correlation coefficients between idci and sc pdsi at 41 out of 43 stations were larger than 0 4 besides the mean values of idci and sc pdsi were also analyzed within each sub region the correlation coefficients were diminishing from sub region 1 to 3 with the highest correlation coefficient of 0 61 being in sub region 1 fig 3 b d and f from the viewpoint of temporal changes curves showing changes of idci and sc pdsi ran closely but larger variability of sc pdsi was observed because pdsi tended to overestimate drought conditions and was very sensitive to temperature variations sheffield et al 2012 hence drought monitoring results by idci were relatively stable when compared to those by sc pdsi 4 3 correlations between idci and soil moisture observations due to the direct impact of soil moisture on crop growth and agricultural production soil moisture has been taken as the critical influencing factor behind agricultural drought conditions to demonstrate the agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci relations were quantified between idci and soil moisture observations at different soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm results indicated that correlation between idci and soil moisture was not significant at the 0 01 significance level at only one station at the soil depth of 10 cm however significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were detected at stations considered in this study at the 0 01 significance level at the soil depth of 20 cm besides not significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were observed at only two stations at the soil depth of 50 cm depth fig 4 hence significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were dominant across inner mongolia in addition idci and in situ observed soil moisture were compared fig 5 in general idci can well describe soil moisture changes in other words idci can well describe or monitor agricultural drought conditions from the perspective of variability and availability of soil moisture content 4 4 comparison of correlation coefficients between in situ soil moisture observation idci smci spei3 and vci deficit of soil moisture is the essence behind agricultural drought monitoring and description of soil moisture in real time and in an accurate way is the first step to the monitoring of agricultural drought sims et al 2002 rhee et al 2010 gebrehiwot et al 2011 stepanek et al 2015 fig 6 indicates that idci promoted the detection of soil moisture compared to spei3 stepanek et al 2015 smci sims et al 2002 and vci gebrehiwot et al 2011 rhee et al 2010 on the station scale the correlation coefficient between idci and measured soil moisture was dominant at 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm depths there was only one station e whose correlation coefficient between idci and measured soil moisture was in the second place and just less than vci in the view of depths among 7 stations the maximum values of the correlation coefficients between idci and measured soil moisture were the biggest at all depths amongst smci spei3 and vci their minimum values also reached the biggest value at the 50 cm depth table 3 and fig 6 besides idci was in closer relation with soil moisture at the soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm than other drought indices considered in this study implying better modelling performance of idci in monitoring soil moisture than drought indices considered in the current study table 3 and fig 6 4 5 spatiotemporal pattern of drought frequency based on fmude in the dimension of spatial temporal distribution all of the stations of region 2 faced up to the high possibility in may fig 7 a and tong et al 2018 confirmed this phenomenon it started to drop across the whole region and most areas still were under the drought possibility of 60 80 in june fig 7b when it came to july the fmude of region 2 and region 3 both with four stations in the low frequency 20 40 zone dropped obviously while the fmude of region 1 abated slowly which may be related to the feature of landscape and summer precipitation fig 7c within august the whole region was under low frequency and unlikely met with moderate up drought events fig 7d in september the fmude of region 2 and region 3 started to rise sharply but there were still 7 out of 16 stations under high frequency in region 1 fig 7e in general fig 7 displays that the fmude within the growing season tended to decrease from may to august while rising from august to september with some of them being up to 60 80 in other words drought severity tended to ameliorate from may to august and started to exacerbate after august 4 6 spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural drought based on idci spatiotemporal evolutions of idci based droughts during the growing season were analyzed during 2000 2014 fig 8 in general drought severity fluctuated and was alleviated across the study region in 2001 fig 8b 2005 fig 8f 2007 fig 8h and 2010 fig 8k most parts of inner mongolia underwent moderate drought and serious droughts were found in a few regions across inner mongolia during time intervals when heavy droughts occurred intermittently across inner mongolia consecutive heavy droughts in terms of space and time were observed more often such as consecutive droughts during 2000 2001 fig 8a b 2005 2006 fig 8f g and 2010 2011 fig 8k l the time interval after 2010 witnessed alleviating droughts across the entire inner mongolia tong et al 2018 4 7 agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci evaluated by scyi four major crops can be identified i e maize wheat potato and soybean and the total production of crops accounts for nearly 90 of the whole crop yields of inner mongolia hulunbeier hulanhaote tongliao chifeng and bayanzhuoer are mainly for maize whose total yield accounts for 82 2 of the total maize production fig 9 a b hulunbeier hulanhaote and bayanzhuoer are mainly for wheat with its production accounting for 76 2 of the total wheat production of inner mongolia fig 9e f hulunbeier wulanchabu and chifeng are for potato whose production accounts for 82 3 of the total potato production of inner mongolia fig 9i j hulunbeier is mainly for soybean with its production accounting for up to 86 4 of the total soybean production of inner mongolia fig 9m n hence yields of these four crops can reflect major agricultural production in inner mongolia therefore yields of these four crops were used to evaluate the agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci the scyi of maize is highly related to idci with correlation coefficients up to 0 788 which was greater than smci 0 774 spei3 0 721 and vci 0 352 fig 10 therefore maize production is heavily influenced by agricultural droughts fig 9c scyi performed better than other indices in evaluating drought impacts on maize production in the inner mongolia the scyi of wheat was slightly impacted by agricultural droughts with a correlation coefficient of 0 185 fig 9h which was mainly due to its intense attribute of drought tolerance however when compared to other drought indices such as smci correlation coefficient was 0 052 spei3 correlation coefficient was 0 142 and vci correlation coefficient was 0 129 idci still kept its strength in monitoring drought variations figs 10 and 9g h generally maize has a stronger resistance and higher tolerance to drought induced water shortage therefore higher production of maize in comparison with corn can be expected under similar negative impacts of droughts daryanto et al 2016 however intensified agricultural drought still helped to reduce the scyi of wheat fig 9g the scyi of the potato was also highly related to idci given the occurrence of moderate drought and the correlation coefficient reached 0 530 which was higher than smci 0 461 vci 0 466 and spei3 0 417 figs 9k l and 10 when it came to mild droughts or even no drought the scyi of potato increased faster than did idci fig 9k besides similar correlations were detected between the scyi of soybean and idci and the correlation coefficient reached 0 505 which was higher than other indices figs 9o p and 10 comparisons between fig 9c g k and o indicated that the time interval before 2010 was dominated by better match of curves between idci and scyi of crops in comparison with other indices vci smci and spei3 however the period after 2010 was dominated by alleviating idci based vci based and spei3 based droughts but the insensitive response of scyi it could be due to the limitation of crop area and production capacity 5 conclusions 1 this study built up an integrated drought condition index idci by integrating the climatic drought index spei3 vegetation cover index vci and soil moisture condition index smci compared to spei3 smci and vci idci has the feature of simulating climatic elements including precipitation temperature and the interaction between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vegetation element and soil moisture simultaneously which makes idci perform better than spei3 smci and vci in the detection of agricultural drought besides idci was highly correlated to the measured soil moisture on the station scale at 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm depths and drought index sc pdsi across the study region especially in the middle part of inner mongolia in conclusion idci can be used to monitor agricultural droughts in inner mongolia 2 during the growing season may to september from 2000 to 2014 the frequency of moderate up drought events started abating from may to august and transferred to rise from august to september 3 in the temporal evolution the drought condition tended to weaken from 2000 to 2014 it displayed the away from extreme value phenomenon which means idci tended to go up down when it came to the relative extreme low high value such as the moderate up drought events in 2001 2005 2007 and 2010 in the annual evolution route among the intervals of relative extreme points inner mongolia experienced continuous drought period such as 2000 2001 2005 2006 and 2010 2011 4 among the four main crops maize had the biggest correlation coefficient with idci up to 0 788 potato and soybean were both highly response to the moderate condition with the correlation coefficient equal to 0 530 and 0 505 respectively wheat had the lowest correlation to idci according to the 0 185 correlation coefficient but was highly response to the severe drought condition in general all correlations between idci and crop yields were better than single drought indices smci vci and spei3 conflict of interests we declare on conflict of interests acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the fund for

maximum likelihood method vicente serrano et al 2010 which is expressed as 4 f χ 1 α χ γ β 1 where α β and γ refer to the scale shape and location parameters that are computed based on χ the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration based on idci no drought idci 1 5 mild drought 0 5 idci 1 5 moderate drought 0 5 idci 0 5 severe drought 1 5 idci 0 5 and extreme severe drought idci 1 5 have been classified in this study table 2 3 2 scaled crop yield index scyi the monitoring performance of idci was evaluated using the scaled crop yield index yields of four main crops e g maize wheat potato and soybean were analyzed which account for nearly 90 of the total crop production in nner mongolia the scyi was computed as 5 s c y i i j cy i j m i n c y i m a x c y i m i n c y i where cy i j is the yield of the ith type of crop during the jth year scyi i j is the scaled crop yield index of the ith type of crop during the jth year 3 3 regionalization of climate conditions using fuzzy c means clustering method due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate conditions the fuzzy c means fcm algorithm was applied in climate regionalization meanwhile due to the multidimensional feature of input variables the sammon mapping was also used to reduce the dimensionality sammon 1969 sub regions were identified by the fcm method then the fcm algorithm was used to minimize the variance within the cluster with the inclusion of all stations considered in this study ayvaz et al 2007 6 d v k 1 n x j s k x j c k 2 where c k is the barycenter point for all points n is the summary of clusters s k is the entire point group in the kth cluster and x j is the standardized vector of point j more details can be found in zhang et al 2014 3 4 drought monitoring performance evaluation of idci in this study pearson correlation analysis was done for relations between idci and standing drought indices such as sc pdsi vci and so on in addition the mean of idci and that of sc pdsi were compared furthermore the correlation coefficients were analyzed between idci and soil moisture observations at different soil depths i e 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm in so doing the evaluation of drought monitoring performance of idci was done considering meteorological hydrologic and vegetation conditions 3 5 computation of drought frequency drought frequency is one of the most important temporal characteristics of drought features mckee et al 1993 based on idci this study calculated the frequencies of droughts with moderate and even higher intensities fmude which are the summation of frequencies of droughts with moderate severe and extreme intensities based on in situ observations during the growing season may to september from 2000 to 2014 eq 6 7 fmud e i j n m i j n s i j n e i j n 100 where fmude i j refers to the frequency of droughts with moderate to extreme drought intensities at the station i during month j from 2000 to 2014 nm i j ns i j and ne i j refer to the occurrence times of droughts with moderate severe and extreme drought intensities during 2000 to 2014 respectively n refers to the occurrence times of all drought events considered in this study from 2000 to 2014 4 results and discussions 4 1 regionalization of climate conditions using fuzzy c means clustering method climatic regionalization was done due to the spatial heterogeneity of climate conditions across inner mongolia from the results of the fcm cluster method the study region was subdivided into 3 regions with relatively homogeneous climate conditions with consideration of longitude latitude altitude monthly temperature and annual average precipitation fig 1b besides cropland was observed in the plain cultivated land ppf which accounts for majority of the crop lands in the inner mongolia along the low lying valleys and plains fig 1a 4 2 correlation between idci and sc pdsi the sc pdsi has been widely applied to the monitoring of agricultural drought at different time scales trenberth et al 2014 jiménez muñoz et al 2016 therefore correlations between idci and sc pdsi were quantified to evaluate the drought monitoring performance of idci fig 2 it can be observed from fig 2 that correlation coefficients between idci and sc pdsi at 41 out of 43 stations were larger than 0 4 besides the mean values of idci and sc pdsi were also analyzed within each sub region the correlation coefficients were diminishing from sub region 1 to 3 with the highest correlation coefficient of 0 61 being in sub region 1 fig 3 b d and f from the viewpoint of temporal changes curves showing changes of idci and sc pdsi ran closely but larger variability of sc pdsi was observed because pdsi tended to overestimate drought conditions and was very sensitive to temperature variations sheffield et al 2012 hence drought monitoring results by idci were relatively stable when compared to those by sc pdsi 4 3 correlations between idci and soil moisture observations due to the direct impact of soil moisture on crop growth and agricultural production soil moisture has been taken as the critical influencing factor behind agricultural drought conditions to demonstrate the agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci relations were quantified between idci and soil moisture observations at different soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm results indicated that correlation between idci and soil moisture was not significant at the 0 01 significance level at only one station at the soil depth of 10 cm however significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were detected at stations considered in this study at the 0 01 significance level at the soil depth of 20 cm besides not significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were observed at only two stations at the soil depth of 50 cm depth fig 4 hence significant correlations between idci and soil moisture observations were dominant across inner mongolia in addition idci and in situ observed soil moisture were compared fig 5 in general idci can well describe soil moisture changes in other words idci can well describe or monitor agricultural drought conditions from the perspective of variability and availability of soil moisture content 4 4 comparison of correlation coefficients between in situ soil moisture observation idci smci spei3 and vci deficit of soil moisture is the essence behind agricultural drought monitoring and description of soil moisture in real time and in an accurate way is the first step to the monitoring of agricultural drought sims et al 2002 rhee et al 2010 gebrehiwot et al 2011 stepanek et al 2015 fig 6 indicates that idci promoted the detection of soil moisture compared to spei3 stepanek et al 2015 smci sims et al 2002 and vci gebrehiwot et al 2011 rhee et al 2010 on the station scale the correlation coefficient between idci and measured soil moisture was dominant at 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm depths there was only one station e whose correlation coefficient between idci and measured soil moisture was in the second place and just less than vci in the view of depths among 7 stations the maximum values of the correlation coefficients between idci and measured soil moisture were the biggest at all depths amongst smci spei3 and vci their minimum values also reached the biggest value at the 50 cm depth table 3 and fig 6 besides idci was in closer relation with soil moisture at the soil depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm than other drought indices considered in this study implying better modelling performance of idci in monitoring soil moisture than drought indices considered in the current study table 3 and fig 6 4 5 spatiotemporal pattern of drought frequency based on fmude in the dimension of spatial temporal distribution all of the stations of region 2 faced up to the high possibility in may fig 7 a and tong et al 2018 confirmed this phenomenon it started to drop across the whole region and most areas still were under the drought possibility of 60 80 in june fig 7b when it came to july the fmude of region 2 and region 3 both with four stations in the low frequency 20 40 zone dropped obviously while the fmude of region 1 abated slowly which may be related to the feature of landscape and summer precipitation fig 7c within august the whole region was under low frequency and unlikely met with moderate up drought events fig 7d in september the fmude of region 2 and region 3 started to rise sharply but there were still 7 out of 16 stations under high frequency in region 1 fig 7e in general fig 7 displays that the fmude within the growing season tended to decrease from may to august while rising from august to september with some of them being up to 60 80 in other words drought severity tended to ameliorate from may to august and started to exacerbate after august 4 6 spatiotemporal evolution of agricultural drought based on idci spatiotemporal evolutions of idci based droughts during the growing season were analyzed during 2000 2014 fig 8 in general drought severity fluctuated and was alleviated across the study region in 2001 fig 8b 2005 fig 8f 2007 fig 8h and 2010 fig 8k most parts of inner mongolia underwent moderate drought and serious droughts were found in a few regions across inner mongolia during time intervals when heavy droughts occurred intermittently across inner mongolia consecutive heavy droughts in terms of space and time were observed more often such as consecutive droughts during 2000 2001 fig 8a b 2005 2006 fig 8f g and 2010 2011 fig 8k l the time interval after 2010 witnessed alleviating droughts across the entire inner mongolia tong et al 2018 4 7 agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci evaluated by scyi four major crops can be identified i e maize wheat potato and soybean and the total production of crops accounts for nearly 90 of the whole crop yields of inner mongolia hulunbeier hulanhaote tongliao chifeng and bayanzhuoer are mainly for maize whose total yield accounts for 82 2 of the total maize production fig 9 a b hulunbeier hulanhaote and bayanzhuoer are mainly for wheat with its production accounting for 76 2 of the total wheat production of inner mongolia fig 9e f hulunbeier wulanchabu and chifeng are for potato whose production accounts for 82 3 of the total potato production of inner mongolia fig 9i j hulunbeier is mainly for soybean with its production accounting for up to 86 4 of the total soybean production of inner mongolia fig 9m n hence yields of these four crops can reflect major agricultural production in inner mongolia therefore yields of these four crops were used to evaluate the agricultural drought monitoring performance of idci the scyi of maize is highly related to idci with correlation coefficients up to 0 788 which was greater than smci 0 774 spei3 0 721 and vci 0 352 fig 10 therefore maize production is heavily influenced by agricultural droughts fig 9c scyi performed better than other indices in evaluating drought impacts on maize production in the inner mongolia the scyi of wheat was slightly impacted by agricultural droughts with a correlation coefficient of 0 185 fig 9h which was mainly due to its intense attribute of drought tolerance however when compared to other drought indices such as smci correlation coefficient was 0 052 spei3 correlation coefficient was 0 142 and vci correlation coefficient was 0 129 idci still kept its strength in monitoring drought variations figs 10 and 9g h generally maize has a stronger resistance and higher tolerance to drought induced water shortage therefore higher production of maize in comparison with corn can be expected under similar negative impacts of droughts daryanto et al 2016 however intensified agricultural drought still helped to reduce the scyi of wheat fig 9g the scyi of the potato was also highly related to idci given the occurrence of moderate drought and the correlation coefficient reached 0 530 which was higher than smci 0 461 vci 0 466 and spei3 0 417 figs 9k l and 10 when it came to mild droughts or even no drought the scyi of potato increased faster than did idci fig 9k besides similar correlations were detected between the scyi of soybean and idci and the correlation coefficient reached 0 505 which was higher than other indices figs 9o p and 10 comparisons between fig 9c g k and o indicated that the time interval before 2010 was dominated by better match of curves between idci and scyi of crops in comparison with other indices vci smci and spei3 however the period after 2010 was dominated by alleviating idci based vci based and spei3 based droughts but the insensitive response of scyi it could be due to the limitation of crop area and production capacity 5 conclusions 1 this study built up an integrated drought condition index idci by integrating the climatic drought index spei3 vegetation cover index vci and soil moisture condition index smci compared to spei3 smci and vci idci has the feature of simulating climatic elements including precipitation temperature and the interaction between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration vegetation element and soil moisture simultaneously which makes idci perform better than spei3 smci and vci in the detection of agricultural drought besides idci was highly correlated to the measured soil moisture on the station scale at 10 cm 20 cm and 50 cm depths and drought index sc pdsi across the study region especially in the middle part of inner mongolia in conclusion idci can be used to monitor agricultural droughts in inner mongolia 2 during the growing season may to september from 2000 to 2014 the frequency of moderate up drought events started abating from may to august and transferred to rise from august to september 3 in the temporal evolution the drought condition tended to weaken from 2000 to 2014 it displayed the away from extreme value phenomenon which means idci tended to go up down when it came to the relative extreme low high value such as the moderate up drought events in 2001 2005 2007 and 2010 in the annual evolution route among the intervals of relative extreme points inner mongolia experienced continuous drought period such as 2000 2001 2005 2006 and 2010 2011 4 among the four main crops maize had the biggest correlation coefficient with idci up to 0 788 potato and soybean were both highly response to the moderate condition with the correlation coefficient equal to 0 530 and 0 505 respectively wheat had the lowest correlation to idci according to the 0 185 correlation coefficient but was highly response to the severe drought condition in general all correlations between idci and crop yields were better than single drought indices smci vci and spei3 conflict of interests we declare on conflict of interests acknowledgments this work is financially supported by the fund for

6681,the influence of long term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation this paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance integrated hydrological and two dimensional hydro morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32 year period 1984 2015 covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes durations and intensities three event based hypothetical rainfall scenarios non flood condition 5 year sewer design condition 30 year and river flood condition 100 year rainfall events with 1 h duration were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event based approach and the novel approach presented in this study simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small 5 year and medium 30 year flood events the long term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2 to 69 for 31 of 32 years providing long term water quality benefits downstream however an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river leading to a negative trap efficiency of 11 the spatially averaged sediment deposition rate as predicted by the model varies with a mean sd of 2 1 34 cm year over the study period which resulted in a 24 loss in the pond s volume over 32 years the impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period the results indicate that reduction in the pond s flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium 30 year and extreme 100 year flood events than the frequent small flood 5 year events the variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also explored keywords stormwater pond long term performance urbanisation flood resilience sediment dynamics hydro morphodynamic modelling 1 introduction 1 1 background in recent years stormwater ponds a k a retention ponds wet ponds wet extended detention ponds are increasingly being regarded as the promising option for stormwater management lawrence et al 1996 krishnappan and marsalek 2002a b biggs et al 2005 in the uk and many other countries stormwater ponds provide a range of benefits including flood attenuation sediment trapping treatment of diffuse pollution health and wellbeing and attract a diverse range of water birds and aquatic biota lawrence and breen 1998 bishop et al 2000 persson and pettersson 2009 woods ballard et al 2015 in stormwater quality management sediment control is an essential integral and dynamic part of the system persson and wittgren 2003 the catchment s characteristics and local climate play an important role in the amount and timing of sediment delivery to river systems ashmore and day 1988 asselman et al 2003 lawler et al 2003 yang et al 2003 zhu et al 2008 bussi et al 2016 sedimentation provides various benefits to river ecosystems by supplying nutrients necessary to maintain high floodplain productivity that enables succession and transitions between habitats ward and stanford 1995 mouw et al 2009 however excessive sedimentation in urban rivers may lead to a number of adverse ecological and environmental consequences as the loading of suspended sediment from an urban environment is significantly higher than that in rural catchments arias et al 2013 poleto et al 2009 this is because increased impermeable surfaces in the urban environment shield and arrest sources of coarse material and disproportionally increase fine materials in stormwater runoff brodie and dunn 2009 savage 2005 fine sediments harbour nutrients pollutants and coliform bacteria which are generated from the urban environment and transported by storm runoff jartun et al 2008 this stresses the biological chemical and physical integrity of the receiving water through eutrophication toxification limited permeability and reduced oxygen delivery further siltation reduces the flow capacity of the river channel and functional capacity of the stormwater systems butler and karunaratne 1995 that can increase downstream flood risk moreover contaminants associated with suspended sediment particles and dissolved solutes in stormwater runoff are rather more difficult to manage than those associated with coarse particles birch et al 2006 stormwater ponds are generally regarded as an effective option for suspended sediment trapping which serve as both nature s supermarket and nature s kidneys ponds improve urban runoff quality through a series of processes including sedimentation filtration chemical precipitation microorganism degradation and plant adsorption kantrowitz and woodham 1995 mitsch and gosselink 2007 su et al 2009 bioremediation absorption and oxidation processes facilitate nutrient and heavy metal removal from the stormwater runoff sansalone et al 1998 peng et al 2009 woods ballard et al 2015 vegetation or varying planting density and emergence assists in increasing the surface roughness and enhances fine sediment detention braskerud 2001 furthermore stormwater ponds provide flood storage through interception which minimises the downstream flood risk by attenuating and delaying the urban runoff ellis et al 1995 koskiaho 2003 woods ballard et al 2015 the flood attenuation and improvements in water quality derived from the ponds are strongly interrelated and need to be considered together to optimise their potential benefits and promote local actions lawrence et al 1996 wilkinson et al 2014 despite the recognised multiple benefits there are still concerns over the long term performance of ponds in urban catchments as the performance of the ponds varies considerably with rainfall and flow conditions in the uk most of the guidelines on sustainable drainage systems have come from industry research bodies e g ciria woods ballard et al 2015 so there is relatively limited academic work exploring the long term hydrological performance of the ponds over their whole life cycle using numerical methods this is partly attributed to the complex physical processes associated with the flow and sediment dynamics in the ponds and the lack of good quality finer resolution and long term spatial and temporal field data sets to calibrate and validate numerical modelling techniques hall et al 1993 deletic et al 2000 willems 2013 the long term impact of sediment erosion transport and deposition in ponds on flood attenuation capacity is significant but seldom considered in planning urban ponds verstraeten and poesen 1999 in contrast there are adequate guidelines on hard engineering measures for which models are generally regarded as mathematically more robust and predictable in this context it is essential to develop numerical models and tools to evaluate the long term performance of stormwater ponds to bridge the gap between hard engineering approaches and natural systems 1 2 numerical models numerical models which are typically adopted to evaluate the performance of stormwater ponds can be categorised as black box conceptual and hydrodynamic the first two types are relatively simple and demand modest data compared to the third black box and conceptual models are commonly used to predict averaged net annual sediment budget of a pond however the empirical equations based on the hazen surface loading theory krishnappan and marsalek 2002a b that is mostly used in the first two types of model may not adequately represent underlying physical processes of the systems furthermore the empirical relationship derived for a specific pond system is not always reliably transferable to another due to the uniqueness of each system thus the black box and conceptual models have limited usefulness in capturing the pond system s spatial and temporal dynamics particularly under extreme conditions hydrodynamic models which are based on the deterministic solution of hydraulic equations bruen and yang 2006 can provide more insight into the physical processes that occur within the pond system a review of previous hydrodynamic studies demonstrates that the effect of a pond on flow and sediment dynamics is usually assessed using two or three dimensional event based simulations adamsson et al 2003 benelmouffok and yu 1989 persson 2000 walker 2001 to assess the impact of long term sedimentation pender et al 2016 adopted a one dimensional sediment transport model using hec ras to evaluate changes in the channel capacity after 50 years of sediment transport however these approaches inevitably have inherent limitations when fully capturing the hydrodynamics of the system are concerned firstly the lifespan of stormwater ponds is typically longer than 25 years woods ballard et al 2015 whereas deriving plausible rainfall and corresponding flood events to represent the diversity in the natural rainfall and flow scenarios is often subjective in event based simulations this is because of the variability and intermittent nature of stormwater runoff the runoff duration for different events with comparable peak flows can vary considerably cristiano et al 2017 fletcher et al 2013 gericke and smithers 2014 similarly rainfall exhibits large natural variation in amount and duration the inherent randomness in rainfall runoff and consequent sedimentation processes results in a wide range of event combinations with various sediment loading durations and frequencies of occurrence of flows van buren et al 1997 werner and kadlec 1996 this leads to practical problems in identifying the critical storm event that could yield the highest flow or volume for event based simulations in addition a considerable amount of sediment can accumulate in the retention pond over time and there is a potential for future remobilisation of constituents into the river system during larger flood events which may exacerbate flow and pollutant levels downstream lawrence et al 1996 recent field based research using novel fine sediment tracing methodology has identified that sediment is only temporarily detained in blue green features providing evidence of cumulative rainfall runoff impact on re suspension and conveyance of sediment within and through established blue green features allen et al 2015a b event based simulations capture neither the processes of sediment accumulation in the pond nor remobilisation into the river secondly sediment dynamics in the pond is a three dimensional process with eddies and recirculation adamsson et al 1999 one dimensional long term simulation may not fully capture the morphodynamic processes of the pond system the dominant technical uncertainty in long term performance limits the likely adaptation of stormwater ponds in urban settings in this regard this study aims to provide the first systematic and detailed quantification of long term performance of a retention pond with comprehensive consideration of flow and sediment dynamics this study focuses on a stormwater pond in the newcastle great park in the upstream part of the ouseburn catchment newcastle upon tyne north east england a conceptual hydrological model is used to quantify the urban runoff from the newcastle great park development to the stormwater pond and two dimensional full hydro morphodynamic models are applied to the study pond for simulations of both event based scenarios and long term flow events over a 32 year period 1984 2015 so further investigating the flow and sediment dynamics in the pond 1 3 research questions the study investigates the following research key questions 1 how does the stormwater pond influence flow and sediment dynamics during non flood condition 5 year designed drainage condition 30 year and flood condition 100 year 2 what role does historical rainfall play in flow and sediment dynamics in the stormwater pond 3 how does sedimentation evolve in the pond over time 4 how does sedimentation affect the flood attenuation capacity of the pond over time 5 how annual rainfall influences the annual sediment budget of the pond 2 study area the ouseburn is a 20 km long urban tributary of the river tyne located in north east england and serves as the study region fig 1 the ouseburn catchment 60 5 km2 covers large areas of urban newcastle and north tyneside fig 1b the upper reaches of the ouseburn catchment are predominately agriculture and cultivated grasslands the mid and lower catchment occupies a large residential area with a population of 166 000 people in 70 000 households newcastle city council 2013 in the newcastle upon tyne region fig 1c the catchment geology comprises the carboniferous middle coal measures british geological survey 2016 the large proportion of highly developed areas increases the risk of rapid surface water and fluvial flooding the ouseburn has a history of flooding e g most recent flooding in june and august 2012 which had very serious environmental and socio economic impacts newcastle city council 2011 2013 2016 the standard average annual rainfall saar of the ouseburn catchment is 666 mm calculated between 1985 and 2014 with a minimum 314 mm in 1989 and a maximum of 1 053 mm in 2012 feh 2015 the saar is relatively lower than other regions at a similar latitude in the world due to warming influence of gulf stream through the north atlantic drift furthermore newcastle is in the rain shadow of the northern pennines which protects the city from heavy rainstorms the ouseburn catchment currently fails to comply with the eu water framework directive wfd water quality targets for good status due to high faecal ammonia and phosphate levels which have an adverse impact on the river s ecological health turnbull and bevan 1995 baker et al 2003 newcastle city council 2016 ouseburn river is considered as a typical complex and challenging uk urban river as a result of a variety of pollution sources and their dispersed nature which are difficult to quantify and address the study area focused on the midsection of the ouseburn catchment and newcastle great park development which is the largest housing and commercial development in the north east england encompassing 2 500 residential dwellings commercial premises and community facilities when complete the development site covers 4 85 km2 485 ha sub divided into a number of development cells in order to comply with the environment agency controls on discharge rates to the watercourse based on greenfield equivalent flows a number of stormwater retention ponds are integrated with the development site this study focuses on the impact of a specific pond fig 2 a on long term flow characteristics and suspended sediment dynamics the pond serves a catchment area of 0 4 km2 represented by development cells f and lc immediately north of it fig 2a with a total impermeable area of 0 2 km2 cell lc consists of a school a community centre and a health centre and cell f is primarily residential 850 properties and transportation land uses urban runoff from cells f and lc is discharged into the pond through sewer network fig 2a the pond can be bounded within a rectangular shape 67 m 77 m length width and it has a surface area of about 2400 m2 and an average depth of 2 2 m volume of 6 533 m3 a 3 5 m long concrete apron is placed in front of the inlet to the pond to ensure the flow entering the pond is evenly distributed so that stagnant zones do not develop over time in the pond the pond is densely covered with emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation fig 2b the weir at the outfall regulates the rate of discharge to the ouseburn river for a range of water levels thereby filling the pond during storm events 3 data and methodology the study adopts revitalised flood hydrograph refh rainfall runoff model to translate historical rainfall series into flow series which is then fed into the two dimensional layer based hydro morphodynamic model lhmm to understand long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond geometry the methodology adopted in the integrated hydrological and hydro morphodynamic model setup and simulation is shown in fig 3 the ouseburn catchment s topography rainfall land use and sediment data sets were systematically collated from data provided by the environment agency and the uk ordnance survey along with design drawings of the newcastle great park and field investigations the digital terrain model dtm data sets at 1 m resolution were obtained from the environment agency and represent the topography of the ouseburn catchment to assess relative impact of the pond on flood event hydrological and morphological responses two dtm data sets were incorporated in lhmm model setup the current dtm represents the existing topography with pond condition fig 4 c d and the dtm from the year 2000 represents the predevelopment stage of the terrain without pond fig 4a b scenario in the hydro morphodynamic model in addition a river survey data along the ouseburn was obtained from the environment agency isis now known as flood modeller pro river model the survey data were used to modify the channel and bank elevations in the dtm further design drawings of the retention ponds were obtained from newcastle city council which were used to incorporate finer details such as design levels of the inlet outfall weir control elevation and existing links with other ponds in the lhmm model as part of the study a number of field visits have been made to assess existing geographic and environmental features of the stormwater pond and newcastle great park development the field surveys allowed verification of the available data sets and maximised their usage by integrating them in the model development 4 numerical modelling 4 1 refh hydrological model setup the refh model is a physically based conceptual rainfall runoff model kjeldsen et al 2005 kjeldsen 2007 the refh model includes three submodels a loss model routing model and a base flow model the refh model allows a direct and transparent quantification of flood generating mechanisms and the concept of seasonal variation in soil moisture content and design rainfall the refh rainfall runoff model provides a basis for hydrological modelling which will generate an understanding of the erosion process in the stormwater pond based on field assessments details of the newcastle great park development master plan fig 2 and northumbrian water drainage network drawings the cells of the development contributing to the study pond are identified through flow schematisation in the next part the newcastle great park os mastermap data sets were used to classify impermeable areas that drain to the pond using systematic gis analysis of land use feature classes the soil data and catchment characteristics of the study region were obtained from the british geological survey and flood estimation handbook data respectively the catchment land use and geology data sets allow establishment of the initial infiltration loss and runoff characteristics in the refh hydrological model in the first part of the study the refh rainfall runoff model is calibrated with the field data sets the continuous flow measurements from 2015 january to may at the pond s inlet were taken as part of this study fig 5 a major proportion of the measured flows are low except for three larger flow events that occurred between 02 may 15 and 11 may 2015 since the low flows are mainly driven by the base flow the rainfall driven larger flow events are used in the refh hydrological model calibration fig 5 the drainage length parameter dplbar which implicitly represents the drainage network of the catchment in the model is iteratively adjusted to match the measured flow at the inlet as part of the calibration process fig 5 shows that the refh model produces inflow hydrographs that compare favourably with measured hydrographs however it should be noted that the limitations of the refh approach are the same as those in most conceptual rainfall runoff models the refh model slightly underestimates the magnitude and timing of the flood peak for most of the simulated hydrograph except the last one this difference is partly due to pipe networks and ground water levels which are not explicitly included in the refh hydrological model and calibration process since the primary aim of the study is to extend runoff series to evaluate long term sediment dynamics this level of variation in the flow input is deemed to be adequate in the next stage the refh model is used to transform three 1 hr duration hypothetical rainfall events into flood hydrographs such as non flood 5 year sewer design 30 year and river flood 100 year conditions fig 7 for event based simulations historical rainfall data sets from the jesmond dene gauging station ea 19356 were obtained from the environment agency the rainfall data sets were carefully analysed for anomalies and infilled for missing data using the neighboring rain gauge data sets the rainfall events which last more than 1 h or rainfall depth which exceeds 1 mm in a shorter time interval are included in the long term sediment simulation fig 7a in total 3896 rainfall events were identified over the 32 year period 1984 2015 from the 15 min interval historical rainfall records their use allows the incorporation of a wide range of rainfall volumes durations and intensity combinations to be incorporated in the hydrological simulations to represent the real life scenario fig 6 the rainfall events show considerable variation in rainfall duration 0 25 42 75 h and amount 0 6 93 8 mm fig 6 a the major proportion of historical storm events in the study period 1984 2015 are small events 5 year however they can have considerable influence on the urban runoff quality as the cumulative effect of a large number of small storms is critical in stormwater quality management as opposed a few extreme events in flood management hall et al 1993 urbonas and stahre 1993 furthermore the more frequent flow events 5 year typically cause sediment hotspots whilst larger events 25 year re suspend the accumulated sediments in stormwater ponds and on floodplains ahilan et al 2016 pender et al 2016 thus it is necessary to incorporate a range of potential flood events in morphodynamic simulations in order to fully capture the dynamics of sediment deposition erosion and transportation processes there is also considerable variation in the intensity of the identified rainfall events over the study period fig 6 b amongst the 3896 studied historical storm events 75 of the rainfall intensities are below 1 6 mm h the long duration less intense frontal rainfall events mostly occur in winter months which can cause fluvial flooding also several short duration high intensity convective rainfall events occur in summer months often leading to pluvial flooding in the urban catchment such as the 20 32 mm h event on 28 june 2012 later dubbed the toon monsoon newcastle city council 2013 and the 20 8 mm h event 02 aug 2014 which caused flooding in newcastle city newcastle city council 2015 2016 the combination of convective and frontal storm events in the data sets enables investigation of the influence of the pond on flow and sediment dynamics in detail over long periods of time in the next part the identified historical rainfall events are continuously routed through the refh hydrological model to generate corresponding flow events the flood peak of the simulated flow events varies from 0 5 m3 s to 3 6 m3 s 4 2 lhmm hydro morphodynamic model setup the lhmm is a two dimensional 2d non equilibrium sediment transport model guan et al 2014 2015a b the model encompasses three modules hydrodynamic sediment transport and bed deformation models the hydrodynamic model incorporates the mass and momentum exchange between flow and non cohesive sediment and updates the hydraulic and sediment quantities per grid cell and per time step the sediment transport model controls the sediment mass conservation whilst the bed deformation model updates the bed elevation under erosion and deposition the model solves the fully coupled shallow water equations swes together with a sediment transport model by using a robust godunov type finite volume method based on rectangular grids the model can be used to simulate flow propagation transport of both bedload and suspended load as well as the resultant morphological change the lhmm has been successfully applied in modelling sediment transport and morphological changes during flooding in a number of laboratory and field based case studies e g ahilan et al 2016 guan et al 2016 guan et al 2018 the hydro morphodynamic simulations allow detailed inspection of flow velocities water levels and suspended sediment dynamics in the retention pond for a range of flood conditions the field evidence in the newcastle great park development shows that suspended load is dominant in the stormwater pond this study therefore adopts lhmm with a suspended load model which is governed by an advection diffusion equation in the model the dtm and river survey data is used to represent the topography of the pond and the outlet fig 4b d the pond is densely covered primarily around the periphery by the native vegetation fig 2b the manning roughness n 0 04 is used to represent the surface roughness in the hydro morphodynamic model sediment surveys were carried out using sediment traps and the particle size distribution psd of samples was determined by laser diffraction using a malvern mastersizer s long bench the psds were obtained from the sampling at the pond inlet d10 5 00 µm fine silt d50 12 µm fine silt d90 50 µm silt and were equally distributed as an input in the upstream boundary the lhmm model requires a relationship between the stream flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration at the upstream boundary in the absence of long term sediment data measurements in the ouseburn catchment the regression relationships between flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration were transferred from the analogue catchment johnson creek portland which exhibited similar land use patterns to the ouseburn catchment ahilan et al 2016 the following regression relationships between stream flow q turbidity t and suspended sediment concentration ssc were established based on the continuous stream flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration measurements over four water years 2007 2010 stonewall and bragg 2012 1 log 10 t 0 455 log 10 q 0 243 2 log 10 s s c 1 024 log 10 t 0 143 log 10 q 0 64 where q in m3 s t in formazin nephelometric units fnu and ssc in mg l the eqs 1 and 2 were used to establish the boundary condition at the pond inlet the model prediction is initially validated with measured sediment data sediment samples were taken in the pond at monthly intervals over six months between 30 jan 2015 and 23 june 2015 samples were collected using standard surface measures british standards institution bsi and sediment traps and core samples from six locations at the bed of the pond one at the pond outlet and three within the receiving water body fig 2c the samples represent the total ssc and total bed deposition at each of the six locations in the model validation flow events between 23 april 2015 to 26 may 2015 were considered and results compared with observed sediment data of this period the other five months are largely dominated by low flow and were excluded from the simulation fig 5 the simulated and observed sedimentation depth at each of the six locations is shown in table 1 the measured and simulated sedimentation depths compare reasonably well for most of the locations in the pond the discrepancies are mainly because of the influence of vegetation on the sediment dynamics and approximation in the input sediment data sets since the primary objective of this study is to understand long term sediment dynamics in the pond this level of variation in the model prediction is deemed to be acceptable 5 results and discussions 5 1 hydrodynamics of the pond fig 7 b d illustrates the hydrodynamic performance of the pond for the three hypothetical flow events non flood condition 5 year sewer design condition 30 year and flood condition 100 year fig 7b d shows that all three flow events experience attenuation and delay in flood peak at the pond outlet however the effects are more pronounced for more frequent flow event 5 year than extreme event 100 year the pond provides flood storage of 4 86 103 m3 and 6 25 103 m3 for 5 and 100 year flood events which reduces the flood peak by 85 and 30 respectively the pond was originally designed to provide green field runoff for the 30 year flood event to the ouseburn river which is equivalent to 0 73 m3 s however simulation results show that attenuated flow for 30 year event is 1 7 m3 s which is much higher than design flow 0 73 m3 s this inefficiency in pond flood attenuation capacity is partly due to pond design pond location within a catchment and the land use within the contributing catchment the pond provides detention times of 0 6 h and 0 2 h for 5 year and 100 year events respectively which is a measure of how much time water is retained in the stormwater pond before being discharged into the river the detention time is estimated by the time lag between the centroid of the inflow and outflow hydrographs the detention time is one of the critical parameters which influences the sedimentation and associated water quality benefits from the pond longer detention times allow sediment to settle in the pond and yield higher water quality benefits to investigate impact of the stormwater pond on historical flow events similar analysis is carried out for the largest 39 historical events from the 3896 events the flood peak and volume of the identified historical events vary from 0 3 m3 s to 3 8 m3 s and 1 950 m3 to 40 632 m3 respectively fig 8 shows the maximum inflow and outflow of the 39 historical events at the pond inlet and outlet respectively it indicates that more frequent small 5 year and medium 30 year flow events experience relatively higher flood peak attenuation e g up to 77 june 6 1990 as a significant proportion of the small and medium flow contributes to filling up the available storage in the stormwater pond analysis has also shown that stormwater pond provides minimum volume of 967 m3 15 of pond volume for these 39 historical events in the higher flow events flood attenuation on inflow hydrographs are diminished as most of the detention storage of the pond is filled with a relatively smaller proportion of flow the largest historical event occurred on september 5 2012 where 15 reduction in the flood peak magnitude at the pond outlet was experienced 5 1 1 variation in detention efficiency and practical implications further analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of the pond on detention efficiency eq 3 of three hypothetical and 39 historical flow events 3 d e t e n t i o n e f f i c i e n c y p e a k d i s c h a r g e r e d u c t i o n a r e a c o n t r o l l e d b y d e t e n t i o n where peak discharge reduction refers to attenuation in inflow peak with respect to its peak and area controlled by detention is the ratio between pond surface area and contributing drainage area respectively fig 9 a and b explore the influence of flow peak and flow volume on detention efficiency of the stormwater pond whereas fig 9 c and d investigate their impacts on the detention time the detention efficiency exponentially decreases with flood magnitude fig 9 a and b small and medium flow events experience higher detention efficiency than larger flow events however detention efficiency varies considerably for small and medium flow events due to the stochastic nature of rainfall and its influence on runoff peak and volume combinations this is partly due to a mixture of different flood types in the historical events which reduces the consistency of the regression relationships between the detention efficiency flow peak and flood volume in the uk the long duration less intense frontal storm events occurring in winter months mostly generate flood events with higher volumes and lower peaks while short duration high intensity convective rainfall events in summer months result in runoff with lower volume and higher peak discharge fig 9 c and d shows the variation in the detention time with flow peak and volume respectively for this pond the detention time exponentially reduces with the flood magnitude fitted with logarithmic distribution the higher flow peak and volume events experience relatively shorter detention time compared with small and medium events the flow volume and flow peak exhibit a relatively stronger relationship with detention efficiency and detention time respectively since detention efficiency and detention time are strongly associated with flood attenuation and sedimentation capacity of the stormwater pond the design of detention basins where attenuation storage is involved should consider both the flood peak and volume of a number of potential flood events gaal et al 2015 given the inherent variability and presence of intrinsic relationships between detention efficiency detention time and hydrograph properties peak volume and duration the design hydrographs of the stormwater pond should be derived from the multivariate joint distribution rather than univariate functions using the joint probability distribution function of rainfall volume and duration together with catchment characteristics a number of studies shiau 2003 de michele et al 2005 chen et al 2010 zegpi and fernandez 2010 graler et al 2013 requena et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2013 gaal et al 2015 have made an attempt to establish a deterministic relationship in hyetograph and hydrograph properties this kind of approach should be integrated with pond design guidelines that will enable the calculation of the effect of inflow on storage and the efficient design of the stormwater pond system 5 2 morphodynamics of the stormwater pond the morphodynamic simulation results for three flow events for both the with and without pond scenarios are shown in fig 10 as expected a considerable proportion of the sediment from the newcastle great park is trapped in the pond under all three event based scenarios compare with and the without pond scenario in the pond scenario the flow depth increases and velocity decreases which causes settling of coarse sediment at the pond inlet density currents during larger flood events transport finer sediment particles closer to the outlet the amount of sediment detained in the pond is 4 24 m3 and 7 04 m3 for 5 year and 100 year event respectively the sediment hotspots in east and west sides of the pond are partly due to localised depression storage and presence of dense vegetation in these regions to proactively increase retention time and facilitate sedimentation the design of the pond could be improved by use of an inlet that dissipates inflow energy to reduce mixing creatation of an island in front of inlet and installation of porous baffles with native vegetation which spreads the flow across the pond and lengthens the flow path east west direction before reach to the pond outlet however under the without pond scenario the volume of sediment deposited is 0 63 m3 and 3 73 m3 for 5 year and 100 year flood events this indicates the significant benefit of the pond on sediment trapping the proportion of the incoming sediment that is captured by the retention pond is called the trap efficiency heinemann 1984 table 2 compares the cumulative amount of sediment deposited into the pond with the total suspended sediment load ssl input at the outfall for different flood events for the with pond scenario a significant proportion of the suspended sediment that comes from the development site is deposited in the retention pond for smaller 5 year and medium 30 year flow events uk ciria and u s epa reported removal of suspended solids by stormwater ponds as high as 67 81 woods ballard et al 2015 and 60 90 u s epa 1983 in addition australian guidelines recommended the suspended sediment removal rate for the similar drainage area ratio pond surface area contributing catchment area of around 80 healthy waterways 2006 water by design 2010 in this case the removal rate is lower because of the short residence times and flow conditions are unfavourable for settling the amount of sediment deposition increases with flood magnitude but the percentage of the sediment trapped in the pond reduces when compared with total suspended sediment input for this pond over these simulated flood events this is because the larger flood event creates high energy and a turbulent environment in the pond which increases the degree of mixing of the fine sediment material in suspension and transports this towards the outlet and subsequently the river the largest event also has the lowest detention time which limits the sediment settling in the pond fig 11 shows the simulated temporal and spatial variation of the sediment deposition in the pond over the 32 year study period 1984 2015 it indicates that over time sediment deposition non linearly increases and moves towards the pond outlet direction most of the historical events with small and medium magnitude lead to temporary sediment detention and sediment aggradation in the pond however an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 year 29 fig 11 influences the overall sediment budget by flushing out the accumulated sediment as a shock load to the river system on one hand this process considerably reduces the sedimentation enabling the pond volume and flood resilience capacity to re establish on the other hand the shock load could lead to elevated concentrations of sediment and pollutants resulting in dissolved oxygen depressions due to oxidation of contaminants this can have adverse impact on water quality and biodiversity however it is difficult to establish the water quality standard for the stormwater systems due to the stochastic nature of rainfall events and the non linear relationship between flow and sediment transport rate the wastewater quality standards are thus unable to be adopted to a stormwater system due to randomness of rainfall events according to the model prediction at the end of the 32 years long term simulation 1 575 m3 of sediment was deposited in the pond which is equivalent to 34 of the total sediment input this resulted in a 24 loss in the pond s volume which is equivalent to a sedimentation depth of 0 65 m throughout the pond the sediment aggradation could diminish the storage capacity while increasing the concentration of contaminants in the pond and eventually the groundwater beneath the pond the temporal and spatial average rate of sediment accumulation of 2 cm year is estimated as the average sedimentation depth divided by the pond cross sectional area and the period of accumulation 32 years this low accumulation rate is supportive of temporary sediment detention within the pond and continuous conveyance of fine urban sediment pollution through the pond over cumulative events indicated by fine sediment tracer studies undertaken within this pond illustrating 5 long term fine sediment detention 5 3 accumulation rates and their comparison with other studies these findings on sediment dynamics in the pond are similar to previous few field based studies e g yousef et al 1994 marsalek et al 1997 for example based on a field survey of the kingston stormwater pond in ontario canada marsalek et al 1997 indicated sediment accumulation with an average rate of 2 cm year this was estimated by dividing the average length of sediment cores by the period of accumulation 10 years and it resulted in a 13 loss in the permanent pond volume yousef et al 1994 indicated a sediment accumulation rate varying from 1 cm year to 4 cm year based on the in situ field measurements of sediment accumulation in nine highway wet ponds in central and south florida usa the analysis undertaken by yousef et al 1994 indicates that the sediment accumulation rate has a negative geometrical correlation with the drainage area ratio there is a negative exponential trend in the sediment accumulation rate with a sharp decline for drainage ratios 0 2 and shallow decline for ratios 2 in the yousef et al 1994 study ponds a drainage area ratio of 1 and 12 yield corresponds to the maximum 4 cm year and minimum 1 cm year sediment accumulation rate for our case study the drainage area ratio is 0 6 and the simulated average sediment accumulation rate vary from 0 2 cm year to 5 cm year lower bound of the simulation results is slightly smaller than field results presented in yousef et al 1994 a number of factors could have contributed to this difference firstly the results presented in yousef et al 1994 are for ponds that have been operational for 7 28 years the modelling undertaken for this pond has extended past this duration to 32 years fine sediment tracing experiments have illustrated the temporary nature of urban sediment detention allen et al 2015b 2017 and thus it could be expected that the long term sediment detention efficiency accumulation rate relative to drainage ratio would be smaller due to ongoing temporary detention and conveyance secondly the differences in the two sets of results might have in part resulted from limitations in the input data for the hydro morphodynamic model these data are obtained from the analogue catchment and are used to establish the regression relationships between suspended sediment concentration turbidity and flow thirdly inherent limitations in the hydro morphodynamic model may hinder accurate representation of the effects of emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation on flow and sediment dynamics in the study pond fig 2b in the model vegetation is represented by a higher roughness manning s n however this representation may not fully capture the interaction of the vegetation in flow processes and sedimentation patterns in the pond the porous vegetation block exerts a drag resistance and alters the streamwise velocity which creates complex 3d flow patterns around them clarke 2002 the vegetation markedly reduces flow velocity and turbulence across the pond and subsequently increasing sediment deposition and trapping by localised advection and porosity the vegetation also hinders scouring and resuspension during heavy rainfall events fourthly climatic variations between newcastle upon tyne uk and florida u s a may result in variations in event occurrence and sediment wash off the influence of a few extreme rainfall events in the study period in newcastle upon tyne could significantly influence the overall sediment accumulation rate and the comparison fifthly associated turbulence resulting from wind shear stress can influence flow fields and sediment dynamics wind influence was not included in this modelling study finally the short circuiting of the flow to the eastern and western boundaries of the study pond to adjacent ponds fig 2c is expected to occur during extreme rainfall events the case study pond and west side pond fig 2c are connected by an overflow pipe 300 mm diameter allowing high flows to be directly diverted into this western pond this diversion and the adjacent connected pond s were not included in this modelling the above factors could influence hydraulic performance and the annual sedimentation rate in the study pond at the newcastle great park development 5 4 overall sediment budget and implications for maintenance schedule water quality and residence time fig 12 shows the cumulative sediment accumulation in the pond over the 32 year study period 1984 2015 sediment continuously accumulates in the pond from 1984 to 2015 except a small reduction in 2012 with an average sediment aggregation rate of 2 cm year however an extreme rainfall event occurred in june 2012 resulting in sediment erosion of 16 m3 the 2012 flash flooding in newcastle upon tyne was caused by the toon monsoon on 28th june the highest rainfall with a total of 51 mm was recorded of which 26 mm fell in 30 min 32 mm in 1 h and 49 min fig 6 the recorded rainfall within the 2 hour period is equivalent to the expected rainfall for the whole month of june in the summer of 2012 which is regarded as the wettest summer in 100 years newcastle city council 2013 the rainfall return period of the june 2012 events was estimated at up to 130 year for periods between 1 and 2 h fig 12 also emphasises that loss of pond storage volume and benefit of sedimentation cannot be co maximised the pond could build up with 20 cm sedimentation over 10 years period with the sediment accumulation rate of 2 cm year as happened between 1984 and 2015 which led to a 7 5 reduction in pond storage although the timing of the sediment dredging is dictated by the actual depth of silt build up it would be necessary to carry out major maintenance on a regular 8 10 year cycle to maintain efficient pond operation sediment dredging should be organised and timed to minimise disturbance to freshwater habitats fig 13 shows the annual variation in sediment input and deposition in the pond and the annual trap efficiency of the pond over the period it indicates that sedimentation occurs in the pond during 31 years of the 32 year study period 1984 2015 resulting in a positive overall trap efficiency during this 31 year period trap efficiency varies from 69 in 1985 to 2 in 2014 however in the year 2012 scouring occurred which resulted in a negative trap efficiency of 11 in other words the range in annual sediment trap efficiency over the 32 year study period is quite large 11 to 69 with the mean sd value of 34 17 the large variations in the trap efficiency due to the randomness in the rainfall emphasises the fact that it is difficult to comprehensively model or set water quality standards for stormwater ponds fig 14 explores the influence of annual rainfall on annual suspended sediment input into the pond and sediment output from the pond over the 32 year study period fig 14 a shows a positive correlation between annual rainfall and annual suspended sediment input into the pond as expected this is because of inherent relationships between rainfall flow and turbidity as described in eqs 1 and 2 which were used to develop inputs for the hydro morphodynamic model since the annual runoff is a product of the annual rainfall both the annual rainfall and the annual runoff depth have been used as a surrogate measure to estimate the annual sediment yield in a number of empirical models such as the hydro physical model carson and kirkby model carson and kirkby 1972 and douglas model douglas 1999 fig 14 b shows a reasonably good correlation between the annual suspended sediment yields from the pond with annual rainfall in a typical year a major proportion of the rainfall events are small 5 year or medium 30 year which generally result in causing sedimentation within the pond however a few extreme rainfall events in a particular year could significantly increase rates of erosion even though the change in annual rainfall is slight the annual rainfall is not always sensitive enough to capture the influence of extreme events on sediment dynamics as it does not delineate the individual event intensity or duration or the time interval between successive events in order to investigate the long term impact of sediment aggradation in the pond on flood attenuation capacity hydrodynamic simulations are carried out after a simulated operational period of 5 years 10 years 20 years and 30 years for the pond with a simulation of three isolated flood events after each operational duration table 3 shows the impact of sediment accumulation in the pond on flow dynamics for the 5 year 30 year and 100 year flood events as expected flood storage reduction in the pond as a result of sediment aggradation increases the peak of the outflow hydrographs and reduces the relative attenuation and hydraulic residence time for all three events as shown in table 3 at the end of the 30 year simulation period the 5 year and 100 year flood events experienced reductions in flood attenuation given as 8 85 77 and 4 30 26 respectively due to sediment aggradation in other words the effects are more pronounced for medium 30 year and extreme 100 year flood events than in more frequent small flood events 5 year the reduction in flood attenuation capacity does not linearly increase over time as sediment dynamics primarily depend on inflow which considerably varies over time for instance the extreme flood events which occur in the intervening period between the 20 and 30 years of the simulation period flush out part of the accumulated sediment major event in 2011 2012 offsetting the loss in flood storage and improving the flood peak attenuation capacity of the pond 6 conclusions this paper examines long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond ne england by adopting integrated hydrological and a two dimensional hydro morphodynamic modelling approach the main conclusions of this paper are as follows simulation results indicate that flow attenuation and sediment trapping in the stormwater pond are more pronounced for more frequent small 5 year and medium 30 year flow events this is beneficial in regulating urban stormwater quality as a major proportion of the historical events encompass small and medium events the annual sediment trap efficiency varies considerably 11 to 69 over the 32 year study period with the mean sd value of 34 17 which reflects that it is difficult to set water quality standards for stormwater pond due to randomness in the rainfall events the spatially averaged sediment accumulation rate varies from 0 2 cm year to 5 cm year with the mean sd value of 2 1 34 cm year long term sedimentation could have negative implications on flood attenuation capacity of the stormwater pond the reduction in flood attenuation because of sediment aggradation is relatively more in medium 30 year and large 100 year flood events regular maintenance would be required after each 8 10 years period to maintain the efficient hydraulic performance of the pond and to reduce the risk of water quality deterioration due to remobilisation of pollutants accumulated in sediments the annual rainfall exhibits a reasonably strong relationship with annual sediment input and output and could be used to estimate the annual sediment budget in the pond however the annual rainfall may not be sensitive enough to capture the influence of extreme rainfall events on sediment dynamics suggesting caution when estimating the annual sediment budget when there are extreme rainfall events in the historical records the overall contribution of this paper has been to improve understanding of the flow and sediment dynamics of a stormwater pond which ultimately may provide guidance to define maintenance needs long term design efficiencies and best practice for pond designers and operators acknowledgements the work described

6681,the influence of long term suspended sediment dynamics on stormwater pond performance should not be ignored but is often neglected in pond design and performance evaluation this paper provides systematic simulated quantification of long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond performance integrated hydrological and two dimensional hydro morphodynamic modelling and simulations were carried over a 32 year period 1984 2015 covering 3896 rainfall events with a wide range of rainfall volumes durations and intensities three event based hypothetical rainfall scenarios non flood condition 5 year sewer design condition 30 year and river flood condition 100 year rainfall events with 1 h duration were also simulated for comparison between the traditional event based approach and the novel approach presented in this study simulation results show that the flood peak attenuation and delay are more pronounced for small 5 year and medium 30 year flood events the long term continuous simulation results indicate that the pond provides positive annual trap efficiencies varying from 2 to 69 for 31 of 32 years providing long term water quality benefits downstream however an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 flush out the accumulated sedimentation as a shock load to the downstream river leading to a negative trap efficiency of 11 the spatially averaged sediment deposition rate as predicted by the model varies with a mean sd of 2 1 34 cm year over the study period which resulted in a 24 loss in the pond s volume over 32 years the impact of the loss in storage on pond flood attenuation capacity are explored at regular time intervals over the study period the results indicate that reduction in the pond s flood attenuation capacity is relatively more pronounced for medium 30 year and extreme 100 year flood events than the frequent small flood 5 year events the variation in annual sediment loading with rainfall quantities and patterns are also

nutrients necessary to maintain high floodplain productivity that enables succession and transitions between habitats ward and stanford 1995 mouw et al 2009 however excessive sedimentation in urban rivers may lead to a number of adverse ecological and environmental consequences as the loading of suspended sediment from an urban environment is significantly higher than that in rural catchments arias et al 2013 poleto et al 2009 this is because increased impermeable surfaces in the urban environment shield and arrest sources of coarse material and disproportionally increase fine materials in

siltation reduces the flow capacity of the river channel and functional capacity of the stormwater systems butler and karunaratne 1995 that can increase downstream flood risk moreover contaminants associated with suspended sediment particles and dissolved solutes in stormwater runoff are rather more difficult to manage than those associated with coarse particles birch et al 2006 stormwater

long term hydrological performance of the ponds over their whole life cycle using numerical methods this is partly attributed to the complex physical processes associated with the flow and sediment dynamics in the ponds and the lack of good quality finer resolution and long term spatial and temporal field data sets to calibrate and validate numerical modelling techniques hall et al 1993 deletic et al 2000 willems 2013 the long term impact of sediment erosion transport and deposition in ponds on flood attenuation capacity is significant but seldom considered in planning urban ponds verstraeten and poesen 1999 in contrast there are adequate guidelines on hard engineering measures for which models are generally regarded as mathematically more robust and predictable in this context it is essential to develop numerical models and tools to evaluate the long term performance of stormwater ponds to bridge the gap between hard engineering approaches and natural systems 1 2 numerical models numerical models which are typically adopted to evaluate the performance of stormwater ponds can be categorised as black box conceptual and hydrodynamic the first two types are relatively simple and demand modest data compared to the third black box and conceptual models are commonly used to predict averaged net annual sediment budget of a pond however the empirical equations based on the hazen surface loading theory krishnappan and marsalek 2002a b that is mostly used in the first two types of model may not adequately represent underlying physical processes of the systems furthermore the empirical relationship derived for a specific pond system is not always reliably transferable to another due to the uniqueness of each system thus the black box and conceptual models have limited usefulness in capturing the pond system s spatial and temporal dynamics particularly under extreme conditions hydrodynamic models which are based on the deterministic solution of hydraulic equations bruen and yang 2006 can provide more insight into the physical processes that occur within the pond system a review of previous hydrodynamic studies demonstrates that the effect of a pond on flow and sediment dynamics is usually assessed using two or three dimensional event based simulations adamsson et al 2003 benelmouffok and yu 1989 persson 2000 walker 2001 to assess the impact of long term sedimentation pender et al 2016 adopted a one dimensional sediment transport model using hec ras to evaluate changes in the channel capacity after 50 years of sediment transport however these approaches inevitably have inherent limitations when fully capturing the hydrodynamics of the system are concerned firstly the lifespan of stormwater ponds is typically longer than 25 years woods ballard et al 2015 whereas deriving plausible rainfall and corresponding flood events to represent the diversity in the natural rainfall and flow scenarios is often subjective in event based simulations this is because of the variability and intermittent nature of stormwater runoff the runoff duration for different events with comparable peak flows can vary considerably cristiano et al 2017 fletcher et al 2013 gericke and smithers 2014 similarly rainfall exhibits large natural variation in amount and duration the inherent randomness in rainfall runoff and consequent sedimentation processes results in a wide range of event combinations with various sediment loading durations and frequencies of occurrence of flows van buren et al 1997 werner and kadlec 1996 this leads to practical problems in identifying the critical storm event that could yield the highest flow or volume for event based simulations in addition a considerable amount of sediment can accumulate in the retention pond over time and there is a potential for future remobilisation of constituents into the river system during larger flood events which may exacerbate flow and pollutant levels downstream lawrence et al 1996 recent field based research using novel fine sediment tracing methodology has identified that sediment is only temporarily detained in blue green features providing evidence of cumulative rainfall runoff impact on re suspension and conveyance of sediment within and through established blue green features allen et al 2015a b event based simulations capture neither the processes of sediment accumulation in the pond nor remobilisation into the river secondly sediment dynamics in the pond is a three dimensional process with eddies and recirculation adamsson et al 1999 one dimensional long term simulation may not fully capture the morphodynamic processes of the pond system the dominant technical uncertainty in long term performance limits the likely adaptation of stormwater ponds in urban settings in this regard this study aims to provide the first systematic and detailed quantification of long term performance of a retention pond with comprehensive consideration of flow and sediment dynamics this study focuses on a stormwater pond in the newcastle great park in the upstream part of the ouseburn catchment newcastle upon tyne north east england a conceptual hydrological model is used to quantify the urban runoff from the newcastle great park development to the stormwater pond and two dimensional full hydro morphodynamic models are applied to the study pond for simulations of both event based scenarios and long term flow events over a 32 year period 1984 2015 so further investigating the flow and sediment dynamics in the pond 1 3 research questions the study investigates the following research key questions 1 how does the stormwater pond influence flow and sediment dynamics during non flood condition 5 year designed drainage condition 30 year and flood condition 100 year 2 what role does historical rainfall play in flow and sediment dynamics in the stormwater pond 3 how does sedimentation evolve in the pond over time 4 how does sedimentation affect the flood attenuation capacity of the pond over time 5 how annual rainfall influences the annual sediment budget of the pond 2 study area the ouseburn is a 20 km long urban tributary of the river tyne located in north east england and serves as the study region fig 1 the ouseburn catchment 60 5 km2 covers large areas of urban newcastle and north tyneside fig 1b the upper reaches of the ouseburn catchment are predominately agriculture and cultivated grasslands the mid and lower catchment occupies a large residential area with a population of 166 000 people in 70 000 households newcastle city council 2013 in the newcastle upon tyne region fig 1c the catchment geology comprises the carboniferous middle coal measures british geological survey 2016 the large proportion of highly developed areas increases the risk of rapid surface water and fluvial flooding the ouseburn has a history of flooding e g most recent flooding in june and august 2012 which had very serious environmental and socio economic impacts newcastle city council 2011 2013 2016 the standard average annual rainfall saar of the ouseburn catchment is 666 mm calculated between 1985 and 2014 with a minimum 314 mm in 1989 and a maximum of 1 053 mm in 2012 feh 2015 the saar is relatively lower than other regions at a similar latitude in the world due to warming influence of gulf stream through the north atlantic drift furthermore newcastle is in the rain shadow of the northern pennines which protects the city from heavy rainstorms the ouseburn catchment currently fails to comply with the eu water framework directive wfd water quality targets for good status due to high faecal ammonia and phosphate levels which have an adverse impact on the river s ecological health turnbull and bevan 1995 baker et al 2003 newcastle city council 2016 ouseburn river is considered as a typical complex and challenging uk urban river as a result of a variety of pollution sources and their dispersed nature which are difficult to quantify and address the study area focused on the midsection of the ouseburn catchment and newcastle great park development which is the largest housing and commercial development in the north east england encompassing 2 500 residential dwellings commercial premises and community facilities when complete the development site covers 4 85 km2 485 ha sub divided into a number of development cells in order to comply with the environment agency controls on discharge rates to the watercourse based on greenfield equivalent flows a number of stormwater retention ponds are integrated with the development site this study focuses on the impact of a specific pond fig 2 a on long term flow characteristics and suspended sediment dynamics the pond serves a catchment area of 0 4 km2 represented by development cells f and lc immediately north of it fig 2a with a total impermeable area of 0 2 km2 cell lc consists of a school a community centre and a health centre and cell f is primarily residential 850 properties and transportation land uses urban runoff from cells f and lc is discharged into the pond through sewer network fig 2a the pond can be bounded within a rectangular shape 67 m 77 m length width and it has a surface area of about 2400 m2 and an average depth of 2 2 m volume of 6 533 m3 a 3 5 m long concrete apron is placed in front of the inlet to the pond to ensure the flow entering the pond is evenly distributed so that stagnant zones do not develop over time in the pond the pond is densely covered with emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation fig 2b the weir at the outfall regulates the rate of discharge to the ouseburn river for a range of water levels thereby filling the pond during storm events 3 data and methodology the study adopts revitalised flood hydrograph refh rainfall runoff model to translate historical rainfall series into flow series which is then fed into the two dimensional layer based hydro morphodynamic model lhmm to understand long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond geometry the methodology adopted in the integrated hydrological and hydro morphodynamic model setup and simulation is shown in fig 3 the ouseburn catchment s topography rainfall land use and sediment data sets were systematically collated from data provided by the environment agency and the uk ordnance survey along with design drawings of the newcastle great park and field investigations the digital terrain model dtm data sets at 1 m resolution were obtained from the environment agency and represent the topography of the ouseburn catchment to assess relative impact of the pond on flood event hydrological and morphological responses two dtm data sets were incorporated in lhmm model setup the current dtm represents the existing topography with pond condition fig 4 c d and the dtm from the year 2000 represents the predevelopment stage of the terrain without pond fig 4a b scenario in the hydro morphodynamic model in addition a river survey data along the ouseburn was obtained from the environment agency isis now known as flood modeller pro river model the survey data were used to modify the channel and bank elevations in the dtm further design drawings of the retention ponds were obtained from newcastle city council which were used to incorporate finer details such as design levels of the inlet outfall weir control elevation and existing links with other ponds in the lhmm model as part of the study a number of field visits have been made to assess existing geographic and environmental features of the stormwater pond and newcastle great park development the field surveys allowed verification of the available data sets and maximised their usage by integrating them in the model development 4 numerical modelling 4 1 refh hydrological model setup the refh model is a physically based conceptual rainfall runoff model kjeldsen et al 2005 kjeldsen 2007 the refh model includes three submodels a loss model routing model and a base flow model the refh model allows a direct and transparent quantification of flood generating mechanisms and the concept of seasonal variation in soil moisture content and design rainfall the refh rainfall runoff model provides a basis for hydrological modelling which will generate an understanding of the erosion process in the stormwater pond based on field assessments details of the newcastle great park development master plan fig 2 and northumbrian water drainage network drawings the cells of the development contributing to the study pond are identified through flow schematisation in the next part the newcastle great park os mastermap data sets were used to classify impermeable areas that drain to the pond using systematic gis analysis of land use feature classes the soil data and catchment characteristics of the study region were obtained from the british geological survey and flood estimation handbook data respectively the catchment land use and geology data sets allow establishment of the initial infiltration loss and runoff characteristics in the refh hydrological model in the first part of the study the refh rainfall runoff model is calibrated with the field data sets the continuous flow measurements from 2015 january to may at the pond s inlet were taken as part of this study fig 5 a major proportion of the measured flows are low except for three larger flow events that occurred between 02 may 15 and 11 may 2015 since the low flows are mainly driven by the base flow the rainfall driven larger flow events are used in the refh hydrological model calibration fig 5 the drainage length parameter dplbar which implicitly represents the drainage network of the catchment in the model is iteratively adjusted to match the measured flow at the inlet as part of the calibration process fig 5 shows that the refh model produces inflow hydrographs that compare favourably with measured hydrographs however it should be noted that the limitations of the refh approach are the same as those in most conceptual rainfall runoff models the refh model slightly underestimates the magnitude and timing of the flood peak for most of the simulated hydrograph except the last one this difference is partly due to pipe networks and ground water levels which are not explicitly included in the refh hydrological model and calibration process since the primary aim of the study is to extend runoff series to evaluate long term sediment dynamics this level of variation in the flow input is deemed to be adequate in the next stage the refh model is used to transform three 1 hr duration hypothetical rainfall events into flood hydrographs such as non flood 5 year sewer design 30 year and river flood 100 year conditions fig 7 for event based simulations historical rainfall data sets from the jesmond dene gauging station ea 19356 were obtained from the environment agency the rainfall data sets were carefully analysed for anomalies and infilled for missing data using the neighboring rain gauge data sets the rainfall events which last more than 1 h or rainfall depth which exceeds 1 mm in a shorter time interval are included in the long term sediment simulation fig 7a in total 3896 rainfall events were identified over the 32 year period 1984 2015 from the 15 min interval historical rainfall records their use allows the incorporation of a wide range of rainfall volumes durations and intensity combinations to be incorporated in the hydrological simulations to represent the real life scenario fig 6 the rainfall events show considerable variation in rainfall duration 0 25 42 75 h and amount 0 6 93 8 mm fig 6 a the major proportion of historical storm events in the study period 1984 2015 are small events 5 year however they can have considerable influence on the urban runoff quality as the cumulative effect of a large number of small storms is critical in stormwater quality management as opposed a few extreme events in flood management hall et al 1993 urbonas and stahre 1993 furthermore the more frequent flow events 5 year typically cause sediment hotspots whilst larger events 25 year re suspend the accumulated sediments in stormwater ponds and on floodplains ahilan et al 2016 pender et al 2016 thus it is necessary to incorporate a range of potential flood events in morphodynamic simulations in order to fully capture the dynamics of sediment deposition erosion and transportation processes there is also considerable variation in the intensity of the identified rainfall events over the study period fig 6 b amongst the 3896 studied historical storm events 75 of the rainfall intensities are below 1 6 mm h the long duration less intense frontal rainfall events mostly occur in winter months which can cause fluvial flooding also several short duration high intensity convective rainfall events occur in summer months often leading to pluvial flooding in the urban catchment such as the 20 32 mm h event on 28 june 2012 later dubbed the toon monsoon newcastle city council 2013 and the 20 8 mm h event 02 aug 2014 which caused flooding in newcastle city newcastle city council 2015 2016 the combination of convective and frontal storm events in the data sets enables investigation of the influence of the pond on flow and sediment dynamics in detail over long periods of time in the next part the identified historical rainfall events are continuously routed through the refh hydrological model to generate corresponding flow events the flood peak of the simulated flow events varies from 0 5 m3 s to 3 6 m3 s 4 2 lhmm hydro morphodynamic model setup the lhmm is a two dimensional 2d non equilibrium sediment transport model guan et al 2014 2015a b the model encompasses three modules hydrodynamic sediment transport and bed deformation models the hydrodynamic model incorporates the mass and momentum exchange between flow and non cohesive sediment and updates the hydraulic and sediment quantities per grid cell and per time step the sediment transport model controls the sediment mass conservation whilst the bed deformation model updates the bed elevation under erosion and deposition the model solves the fully coupled shallow water equations swes together with a sediment transport model by using a robust godunov type finite volume method based on rectangular grids the model can be used to simulate flow propagation transport of both bedload and suspended load as well as the resultant morphological change the lhmm has been successfully applied in modelling sediment transport and morphological changes during flooding in a number of laboratory and field based case studies e g ahilan et al 2016 guan et al 2016 guan et al 2018 the hydro morphodynamic simulations allow detailed inspection of flow velocities water levels and suspended sediment dynamics in the retention pond for a range of flood conditions the field evidence in the newcastle great park development shows that suspended load is dominant in the stormwater pond this study therefore adopts lhmm with a suspended load model which is governed by an advection diffusion equation in the model the dtm and river survey data is used to represent the topography of the pond and the outlet fig 4b d the pond is densely covered primarily around the periphery by the native vegetation fig 2b the manning roughness n 0 04 is used to represent the surface roughness in the hydro morphodynamic model sediment surveys were carried out using sediment traps and the particle size distribution psd of samples was determined by laser diffraction using a malvern mastersizer s long bench the psds were obtained from the sampling at the pond inlet d10 5 00 µm fine silt d50 12 µm fine silt d90 50 µm silt and were equally distributed as an input in the upstream boundary the lhmm model requires a relationship between the stream flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration at the upstream boundary in the absence of long term sediment data measurements in the ouseburn catchment the regression relationships between flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration were transferred from the analogue catchment johnson creek portland which exhibited similar land use patterns to the ouseburn catchment ahilan et al 2016 the following regression relationships between stream flow q turbidity t and suspended sediment concentration ssc were established based on the continuous stream flow turbidity and suspended sediment concentration measurements over four water years 2007 2010 stonewall and bragg 2012 1 log 10 t 0 455 log 10 q 0 243 2 log 10 s s c 1 024 log 10 t 0 143 log 10 q 0 64 where q in m3 s t in formazin nephelometric units fnu and ssc in mg l the eqs 1 and 2 were used to establish the boundary condition at the pond inlet the model prediction is initially validated with measured sediment data sediment samples were taken in the pond at monthly intervals over six months between 30 jan 2015 and 23 june 2015 samples were collected using standard surface measures british standards institution bsi and sediment traps and core samples from six locations at the bed of the pond one at the pond outlet and three within the receiving water body fig 2c the samples represent the total ssc and total bed deposition at each of the six locations in the model validation flow events between 23 april 2015 to 26 may 2015 were considered and results compared with observed sediment data of this period the other five months are largely dominated by low flow and were excluded from the simulation fig 5 the simulated and observed sedimentation depth at each of the six locations is shown in table 1 the measured and simulated sedimentation depths compare reasonably well for most of the locations in the pond the discrepancies are mainly because of the influence of vegetation on the sediment dynamics and approximation in the input sediment data sets since the primary objective of this study is to understand long term sediment dynamics in the pond this level of variation in the model prediction is deemed to be acceptable 5 results and discussions 5 1 hydrodynamics of the pond fig 7 b d illustrates the hydrodynamic performance of the pond for the three hypothetical flow events non flood condition 5 year sewer design condition 30 year and flood condition 100 year fig 7b d shows that all three flow events experience attenuation and delay in flood peak at the pond outlet however the effects are more pronounced for more frequent flow event 5 year than extreme event 100 year the pond provides flood storage of 4 86 103 m3 and 6 25 103 m3 for 5 and 100 year flood events which reduces the flood peak by 85 and 30 respectively the pond was originally designed to provide green field runoff for the 30 year flood event to the ouseburn river which is equivalent to 0 73 m3 s however simulation results show that attenuated flow for 30 year event is 1 7 m3 s which is much higher than design flow 0 73 m3 s this inefficiency in pond flood attenuation capacity is partly due to pond design pond location within a catchment and the land use within the contributing catchment the pond provides detention times of 0 6 h and 0 2 h for 5 year and 100 year events respectively which is a measure of how much time water is retained in the stormwater pond before being discharged into the river the detention time is estimated by the time lag between the centroid of the inflow and outflow hydrographs the detention time is one of the critical parameters which influences the sedimentation and associated water quality benefits from the pond longer detention times allow sediment to settle in the pond and yield higher water quality benefits to investigate impact of the stormwater pond on historical flow events similar analysis is carried out for the largest 39 historical events from the 3896 events the flood peak and volume of the identified historical events vary from 0 3 m3 s to 3 8 m3 s and 1 950 m3 to 40 632 m3 respectively fig 8 shows the maximum inflow and outflow of the 39 historical events at the pond inlet and outlet respectively it indicates that more frequent small 5 year and medium 30 year flow events experience relatively higher flood peak attenuation e g up to 77 june 6 1990 as a significant proportion of the small and medium flow contributes to filling up the available storage in the stormwater pond analysis has also shown that stormwater pond provides minimum volume of 967 m3 15 of pond volume for these 39 historical events in the higher flow events flood attenuation on inflow hydrographs are diminished as most of the detention storage of the pond is filled with a relatively smaller proportion of flow the largest historical event occurred on september 5 2012 where 15 reduction in the flood peak magnitude at the pond outlet was experienced 5 1 1 variation in detention efficiency and practical implications further analysis is carried out to investigate the impact of the pond on detention efficiency eq 3 of three hypothetical and 39 historical flow events 3 d e t e n t i o n e f f i c i e n c y p e a k d i s c h a r g e r e d u c t i o n a r e a c o n t r o l l e d b y d e t e n t i o n where peak discharge reduction refers to attenuation in inflow peak with respect to its peak and area controlled by detention is the ratio between pond surface area and contributing drainage area respectively fig 9 a and b explore the influence of flow peak and flow volume on detention efficiency of the stormwater pond whereas fig 9 c and d investigate their impacts on the detention time the detention efficiency exponentially decreases with flood magnitude fig 9 a and b small and medium flow events experience higher detention efficiency than larger flow events however detention efficiency varies considerably for small and medium flow events due to the stochastic nature of rainfall and its influence on runoff peak and volume combinations this is partly due to a mixture of different flood types in the historical events which reduces the consistency of the regression relationships between the detention efficiency flow peak and flood volume in the uk the long duration less intense frontal storm events occurring in winter months mostly generate flood events with higher volumes and lower peaks while short duration high intensity convective rainfall events in summer months result in runoff with lower volume and higher peak discharge fig 9 c and d shows the variation in the detention time with flow peak and volume respectively for this pond the detention time exponentially reduces with the flood magnitude fitted with logarithmic distribution the higher flow peak and volume events experience relatively shorter detention time compared with small and medium events the flow volume and flow peak exhibit a relatively stronger relationship with detention efficiency and detention time respectively since detention efficiency and detention time are strongly associated with flood attenuation and sedimentation capacity of the stormwater pond the design of detention basins where attenuation storage is involved should consider both the flood peak and volume of a number of potential flood events gaal et al 2015 given the inherent variability and presence of intrinsic relationships between detention efficiency detention time and hydrograph properties peak volume and duration the design hydrographs of the stormwater pond should be derived from the multivariate joint distribution rather than univariate functions using the joint probability distribution function of rainfall volume and duration together with catchment characteristics a number of studies shiau 2003 de michele et al 2005 chen et al 2010 zegpi and fernandez 2010 graler et al 2013 requena et al 2013 serinaldi and kilsby 2013 gaal et al 2015 have made an attempt to establish a deterministic relationship in hyetograph and hydrograph properties this kind of approach should be integrated with pond design guidelines that will enable the calculation of the effect of inflow on storage and the efficient design of the stormwater pond system 5 2 morphodynamics of the stormwater pond the morphodynamic simulation results for three flow events for both the with and without pond scenarios are shown in fig 10 as expected a considerable proportion of the sediment from the newcastle great park is trapped in the pond under all three event based scenarios compare with and the without pond scenario in the pond scenario the flow depth increases and velocity decreases which causes settling of coarse sediment at the pond inlet density currents during larger flood events transport finer sediment particles closer to the outlet the amount of sediment detained in the pond is 4 24 m3 and 7 04 m3 for 5 year and 100 year event respectively the sediment hotspots in east and west sides of the pond are partly due to localised depression storage and presence of dense vegetation in these regions to proactively increase retention time and facilitate sedimentation the design of the pond could be improved by use of an inlet that dissipates inflow energy to reduce mixing creatation of an island in front of inlet and installation of porous baffles with native vegetation which spreads the flow across the pond and lengthens the flow path east west direction before reach to the pond outlet however under the without pond scenario the volume of sediment deposited is 0 63 m3 and 3 73 m3 for 5 year and 100 year flood events this indicates the significant benefit of the pond on sediment trapping the proportion of the incoming sediment that is captured by the retention pond is called the trap efficiency heinemann 1984 table 2 compares the cumulative amount of sediment deposited into the pond with the total suspended sediment load ssl input at the outfall for different flood events for the with pond scenario a significant proportion of the suspended sediment that comes from the development site is deposited in the retention pond for smaller 5 year and medium 30 year flow events uk ciria and u s epa reported removal of suspended solids by stormwater ponds as high as 67 81 woods ballard et al 2015 and 60 90 u s epa 1983 in addition australian guidelines recommended the suspended sediment removal rate for the similar drainage area ratio pond surface area contributing catchment area of around 80 healthy waterways 2006 water by design 2010 in this case the removal rate is lower because of the short residence times and flow conditions are unfavourable for settling the amount of sediment deposition increases with flood magnitude but the percentage of the sediment trapped in the pond reduces when compared with total suspended sediment input for this pond over these simulated flood events this is because the larger flood event creates high energy and a turbulent environment in the pond which increases the degree of mixing of the fine sediment material in suspension and transports this towards the outlet and subsequently the river the largest event also has the lowest detention time which limits the sediment settling in the pond fig 11 shows the simulated temporal and spatial variation of the sediment deposition in the pond over the 32 year study period 1984 2015 it indicates that over time sediment deposition non linearly increases and moves towards the pond outlet direction most of the historical events with small and medium magnitude lead to temporary sediment detention and sediment aggradation in the pond however an extreme rainfall event in year 2012 year 29 fig 11 influences the overall sediment budget by flushing out the accumulated sediment as a shock load to the river system on one hand this process considerably reduces the sedimentation enabling the pond volume and flood resilience capacity to re establish on the other hand the shock load could lead to elevated concentrations of sediment and pollutants resulting in dissolved oxygen depressions due to oxidation of contaminants this can have adverse impact on water quality and biodiversity however it is difficult to establish the water quality standard for the stormwater systems due to the stochastic nature of rainfall events and the non linear relationship between flow and sediment transport rate the wastewater quality standards are thus unable to be adopted to a stormwater system due to randomness of rainfall events according to the model prediction at the end of the 32 years long term simulation 1 575 m3 of sediment was deposited in the pond which is equivalent to 34 of the total sediment input this resulted in a 24 loss in the pond s volume which is equivalent to a sedimentation depth of 0 65 m throughout the pond the sediment aggradation could diminish the storage capacity while increasing the concentration of contaminants in the pond and eventually the groundwater beneath the pond the temporal and spatial average rate of sediment accumulation of 2 cm year is estimated as the average sedimentation depth divided by the pond cross sectional area and the period of accumulation 32 years this low accumulation rate is supportive of temporary sediment detention within the pond and continuous conveyance of fine urban sediment pollution through the pond over cumulative events indicated by fine sediment tracer studies undertaken within this pond illustrating 5 long term fine sediment detention 5 3 accumulation rates and their comparison with other studies these findings on sediment dynamics in the pond are similar to previous few field based studies e g yousef et al 1994 marsalek et al 1997 for example based on a field survey of the kingston stormwater pond in ontario canada marsalek et al 1997 indicated sediment accumulation with an average rate of 2 cm year this was estimated by dividing the average length of sediment cores by the period of accumulation 10 years and it resulted in a 13 loss in the permanent pond volume yousef et al 1994 indicated a sediment accumulation rate varying from 1 cm year to 4 cm year based on the in situ field measurements of sediment accumulation in nine highway wet ponds in central and south florida usa the analysis undertaken by yousef et al 1994 indicates that the sediment accumulation rate has a negative geometrical correlation with the drainage area ratio there is a negative exponential trend in the sediment accumulation rate with a sharp decline for drainage ratios 0 2 and shallow decline for ratios 2 in the yousef et al 1994 study ponds a drainage area ratio of 1 and 12 yield corresponds to the maximum 4 cm year and minimum 1 cm year sediment accumulation rate for our case study the drainage area ratio is 0 6 and the simulated average sediment accumulation rate vary from 0 2 cm year to 5 cm year lower bound of the simulation results is slightly smaller than field results presented in yousef et al 1994 a number of factors could have contributed to this difference firstly the results presented in yousef et al 1994 are for ponds that have been operational for 7 28 years the modelling undertaken for this pond has extended past this duration to 32 years fine sediment tracing experiments have illustrated the temporary nature of urban sediment detention allen et al 2015b 2017 and thus it could be expected that the long term sediment detention efficiency accumulation rate relative to drainage ratio would be smaller due to ongoing temporary detention and conveyance secondly the differences in the two sets of results might have in part resulted from limitations in the input data for the hydro morphodynamic model these data are obtained from the analogue catchment and are used to establish the regression relationships between suspended sediment concentration turbidity and flow thirdly inherent limitations in the hydro morphodynamic model may hinder accurate representation of the effects of emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation on flow and sediment dynamics in the study pond fig 2b in the model vegetation is represented by a higher roughness manning s n however this representation may not fully capture the interaction of the vegetation in flow processes and sedimentation patterns in the pond the porous vegetation block exerts a drag resistance and alters the streamwise velocity which creates complex 3d flow patterns around them clarke 2002 the vegetation markedly reduces flow velocity and turbulence across the pond and subsequently increasing sediment deposition and trapping by localised advection and porosity the vegetation also hinders scouring and resuspension during heavy rainfall events fourthly climatic variations between newcastle upon tyne uk and florida u s a may result in variations in event occurrence and sediment wash off the influence of a few extreme rainfall events in the study period in newcastle upon tyne could significantly influence the overall sediment accumulation rate and the comparison fifthly associated turbulence resulting from wind shear stress can influence flow fields and sediment dynamics wind influence was not included in this modelling study finally the short circuiting of the flow to the eastern and western boundaries of the study pond to adjacent ponds fig 2c is expected to occur during extreme rainfall events the case study pond and west side pond fig 2c are connected by an overflow pipe 300 mm diameter allowing high flows to be directly diverted into this western pond this diversion and the adjacent connected pond s were not included in this modelling the above factors could influence hydraulic performance and the annual sedimentation rate in the study pond at the newcastle great park development 5 4 overall sediment budget and implications for maintenance schedule water quality and residence time fig 12 shows the cumulative sediment accumulation in the pond over the 32 year study period 1984 2015 sediment continuously accumulates in the pond from 1984 to 2015 except a small reduction in 2012 with an average sediment aggregation rate of 2 cm year however an extreme rainfall event occurred in june 2012 resulting in sediment erosion of 16 m3 the 2012 flash flooding in newcastle upon tyne was caused by the toon monsoon on 28th june the highest rainfall with a total of 51 mm was recorded of which 26 mm fell in 30 min 32 mm in 1 h and 49 min fig 6 the recorded rainfall within the 2 hour period is equivalent to the expected rainfall for the whole month of june in the summer of 2012 which is regarded as the wettest summer in 100 years newcastle city council 2013 the rainfall return period of the june 2012 events was estimated at up to 130 year for periods between 1 and 2 h fig 12 also emphasises that loss of pond storage volume and benefit of sedimentation cannot be co maximised the pond could build up with 20 cm sedimentation over 10 years period with the sediment accumulation rate of 2 cm year as happened between 1984 and 2015 which led to a 7 5 reduction in pond storage although the timing of the sediment dredging is dictated by the actual depth of silt build up it would be necessary to carry out major maintenance on a regular 8 10 year cycle to maintain efficient pond operation sediment dredging should be organised and timed to minimise disturbance to freshwater habitats fig 13 shows the annual variation in sediment input and deposition in the pond and the annual trap efficiency of the pond over the period it indicates that sedimentation occurs in the pond during 31 years of the 32 year study period 1984 2015 resulting in a positive overall trap efficiency during this 31 year period trap efficiency varies from 69 in 1985 to 2 in 2014 however in the year 2012 scouring occurred which resulted in a negative trap efficiency of 11 in other words the range in annual sediment trap efficiency over the 32 year study period is quite large 11 to 69 with the mean sd value of 34 17 the large variations in the trap efficiency due to the randomness in the rainfall emphasises the fact that it is difficult to comprehensively model or set water quality standards for stormwater ponds fig 14 explores the influence of annual rainfall on annual suspended sediment input into the pond and sediment output from the pond over the 32 year study period fig 14 a shows a positive correlation between annual rainfall and annual suspended sediment input into the pond as expected this is because of inherent relationships between rainfall flow and turbidity as described in eqs 1 and 2 which were used to develop inputs for the hydro morphodynamic model since the annual runoff is a product of the annual rainfall both the annual rainfall and the annual runoff depth have been used as a surrogate measure to estimate the annual sediment yield in a number of empirical models such as the hydro physical model carson and kirkby model carson and kirkby 1972 and douglas model douglas 1999 fig 14 b shows a reasonably good correlation between the annual suspended sediment yields from the pond with annual rainfall in a typical year a major proportion of the rainfall events are small 5 year or medium 30 year which generally result in causing sedimentation within the pond however a few extreme rainfall events in a particular year could significantly increase rates of erosion even though the change in annual rainfall is slight the annual rainfall is not always sensitive enough to capture the influence of extreme events on sediment dynamics as it does not delineate the individual event intensity or duration or the time interval between successive events in order to investigate the long term impact of sediment aggradation in the pond on flood attenuation capacity hydrodynamic simulations are carried out after a simulated operational period of 5 years 10 years 20 years and 30 years for the pond with a simulation of three isolated flood events after each operational duration table 3 shows the impact of sediment accumulation in the pond on flow dynamics for the 5 year 30 year and 100 year flood events as expected flood storage reduction in the pond as a result of sediment aggradation increases the peak of the outflow hydrographs and reduces the relative attenuation and hydraulic residence time for all three events as shown in table 3 at the end of the 30 year simulation period the 5 year and 100 year flood events experienced reductions in flood attenuation given as 8 85 77 and 4 30 26 respectively due to sediment aggradation in other words the effects are more pronounced for medium 30 year and extreme 100 year flood events than in more frequent small flood events 5 year the reduction in flood attenuation capacity does not linearly increase over time as sediment dynamics primarily depend on inflow which considerably varies over time for instance the extreme flood events which occur in the intervening period between the 20 and 30 years of the simulation period flush out part of the accumulated sediment major event in 2011 2012 offsetting the loss in flood storage and improving the flood peak attenuation capacity of the pond 6 conclusions this paper examines long term suspended sedimentological effects on stormwater pond ne england by adopting integrated hydrological and a two dimensional hydro morphodynamic modelling approach the main conclusions of this paper are as follows simulation results indicate that flow attenuation and sediment trapping in the stormwater pond are more pronounced for more frequent small 5 year and medium 30 year flow events this is beneficial in regulating urban stormwater quality as a major proportion of the historical events encompass small and medium events the annual sediment trap efficiency varies considerably 11 to 69 over the 32 year study period with the mean sd value of 34 17 which reflects that it is difficult to set water quality standards for stormwater pond due to randomness in the rainfall events the spatially averaged sediment accumulation rate varies from 0 2 cm year to 5 cm year with the mean sd value of 2 1 34 cm year long term sedimentation could have negative implications on flood attenuation capacity of the stormwater pond the reduction in flood attenuation because of sediment aggradation is relatively more in medium 30 year and large 100 year flood events regular maintenance would be required after each 8 10 years period to maintain the efficient hydraulic performance of the pond and to reduce the risk of water quality deterioration due to remobilisation of pollutants accumulated in sediments the annual rainfall exhibits a reasonably strong relationship with annual sediment input and output and could be used to estimate the annual sediment budget in the pond however the annual rainfall may not be sensitive enough to capture the influence of extreme rainfall events on sediment dynamics suggesting caution when estimating the annual sediment budget when there are extreme rainfall events in the historical records the overall contribution of this paper has been to improve understanding of the flow and sediment dynamics of a stormwater pond which ultimately may provide guidance to define maintenance needs long term design efficiencies and best practice for pond designers and operators acknowledgements the work described

middle part of subarnarekha river basin hydrological and geological factors are imperative for their formation joint length joint density joint orientation rock hardness variations of fluvial hydraulic bed roughness river bed slope and hydraulic gradient are conducive factors for the development of this geomorphic feature monsoon is the ideal season for carving these features by river turbulence when abrasive work of river is predominant on the river bed monsoon 3000 6500 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 0 50 3 0 k g m 2 s 3 the evolutionary sequence of potholes is from round to oval and then elongated with vertical scouring the relation between pothole radius and depth has been established to explain the process of its expansion joint length shows positive relation r2 0 71 with pothole area while joint density has a negative relation r2 0 29 as these are structurally weaker zones characterised by destruction of these features suspended load is also a hindrance in their

morphological development of potholes after alexander 1932 studies on river potholes have shown significant advancement in the two decades of 21st century s by notable geoscientist the unusual morphology of pothole formation have intrigued eminent scientist to explain the mechanism of its formation on the river bed kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 lima and binda 2015 dhali and biswas

new models to explain the potholes genesis is developed by springer et al 2000 and pelletier et al 2014 in this century the major objective of present research is to develop a model to explain the evolution of potholes size by employing some mathematical equations joint density and pothole length are considered as two related factors responsible for change in the area of potholes for the present research 1707 n river bed pothole samples have been studied from monsoon to post monsoon phase this research provides ample scope for the development of future researches on micro fluvial landforms 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the subarnarekha river basin is paramount plateau river of chota nagpur plateau region which lies in the state of jharkhand orissa and west bengal the present study has been conductedin the middle part of subarnarekha river basin ghatshila to tatangar region jharkhand the basin is the part of singhbhum shear zone ahmad and debi 1965 singh 1956 which is a rejuvenated region mukhopadhyay 1980 dhali and biswas 2017a b riverbed geomorphology of this region is outstanding and is of great morphological significance paul 2014 dhali and sahana 2017 major tributaries of the river are kanchi karkari kharkai raru garanala kharsoti and lokjhoriya to conduct this study subarnarekha kharkai kharsoti garanala and lokjhoriya have been selected as they play a major role on the evolution of riverbed potholes four major confluence zones such as subarnarekha kharkai subarnarekha garanala subarnarekha lokjhoriya and subarnarekha kharsotiand 13 other sites are selected for conducting primary survey n 1707 fig 1 table 1 from selective four tributaries two are left and the other two are right bank tributaries of the prime river the climatic condition of this region changes from arid to humid mukhopadhyay 1980 and maximum rainfall occurs in the monsoon season between june and august when the morpho environ of the potholes is highly affected 2 2 data collection data collection n 1707 potholes process is developed by intensive field survey from 2015 to 2018 monsoon and non monsoon on subarnarekha and its tributaries different photographs and primary data such as joint length cm and m joint orientation arithmetic potholes depth cm and m longest width cm and m bed elevation m potholes evolution side and joint orientation are collected during the field visits some calculations like joint density and pothole size elongated oval and circular were done by different traditional geometric formulas total station ts data and gps garmin extex vista hcx are also used for data collection process horizontal accuracy 3 m evolution of potholes is largely controlled by the action of water and the direction of its flow and also the direction of joint density the data for which was collected through field observation pothole positions were authorized by garmin extex hand gps fig 2 2 3 correlation of joint length joint density and area development of potholes joint density is simply followed by horten 1945 methods which are based on the joint length and coverage area of the particular pothole correlation eq 4 is defined by the correlation regression equation pearson 1895 which ranges between 0 to 1 eq 5 in the field observation many potholes are affected by seasonal water flow and those are under the development stage regional weathering is also responsible for this joint length density and area dhali and biswas 2017a b joint length data of selective potholes is measured by a measuring tape and hence joint area is calculated this data was collected for all the concerned years between 2015 and 2018 joint area is different from the shape of the potholes which are basically oval elongated and circular in shape 1 j

difference between two selective points and rock susceptibility close observation of the potholes in the study area during different monsoon phases over the years stipulates increasing depth of

alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 pelletier et al 2014 dhali and biswas 2017a miscellaneous factors control the growth of potholes in middle part of subarnarekha river basin joint length radius springer et al 2005 depth joint density molnar et al 2007 sengupta and kale 2011 bed elevation stream power water velocity bed roughness shear stress are dominant controls over the evolution of potholes analysis with the help of mca multi criteria analysis it is clearly depicted that the joint density is prime control for potholes dynamicity in this region dhali and biswas 2017b subarnarekha lokjoriya confluence site no 12 is an ideal site for pothole study among all the concerned sites utmost mean potholes depth is observed in tetuldana totojhorna kharsoti river d mean 0 580 m subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence d mean 0 499 m upper part of nscs d mean 0 420 m and subarnarekha near apurpoth d mean 0 720 m these spots are highly affected by seasonal water flow turbulence and eddy flow vertical swirling motion mean potholes radius is maximum in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence r mean 0 451 m maximum and minimum joint length are observed in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence j mean 1 41 m and tetuldanga road bridge j mean 0 35 m but the maximum joint density is found in lower part of nscs 2 jd mean 1 75 sq m overall result indicates that joint cracks fracture regional weathering have influenced over the evolution of potholes table 2 fig 3 the monsoon season kale and gupta 2001 kale 2011 kale and baker 2006 in the study sites 17 sites is characterised by heavy rainfall and witness extraordinary hydraulic actions monthly average flow per unit drainage area in ghatsila region 6 1971 6 2011 are 34 39 mm june 88 7

monthly average sediment load are 8077 tonnes per day august and 9220 tonnes per day september in the rainy season cwc 2015 of this region maximum water discharge was in between 9579 59 and 10 582 m 3 s 1 and minimum water discharge was 0 4 3 8 m 3 s 1 in ghatsila from 04 20 1972 to 03 12 2010 cwc 2015 annual flow from 2012 to 2013 in ghatsila region is 6105 mcm monsoon and 578 mcm non monsoon cwc 2015 fig 4 so it is clearly depicted that fluctuation in the values of fluvial hydraulics and related parameters are very high from wet to dry period in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin in dry season the river bed is dry and exposed and is in going to die condition the development of potholes is witnessed mainly during monsoon in all the selected sites 3 2 joint length joint density and pothole area in the development of potholes the geological structure of the riverbed such as joints cracks and fracture are important phenomena kale and joshi 2004 scott 2015 dhali and biswas 2017b for development of river bed potholes in middle part of subarnarekha river basin joint length joint density and development of potholes are directly correlated these are the results of regional weathering and monsoon flow of water mass the values of mean joint density m sq m ranges between 0 50 and 3 50 m sq m and mean joint length m is between 0 35 and 2 15 m and mean area sq m is 0 10 1 20 sq m in selective 17 sites of chota nagpur plateau region the results of mean joint density joint length and pothole area have been analysed form the collected data of 1707 n potholes fig 5 a positive correlation exists 0 71 between joint length and potholes area which illustrate that large joint length influence over the creation of new potholes fig 6 dominance of this geological factor in the evolution of potholes is ascertained in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence site 12 due to turbulence water enters into joints cracks and fractures and corrodes the potholes thereby increasing their area with time but joint density and potholes area development are negatively correlated for the evolution of potholes 0 29 concentrated joint density zone assists the development of new pothole but it is also a weak zone on the river bed alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 so destruction processes is more dominant than creation 3 3 bed erosion and suspended load bed erosion and suspended load of water is analogous to pothole development foley 1980 dhali and sahana 2017 enormous erosion of left bank of subarnarekha since 2015 in subarnarekha kharsoti confluence site has yielded high suspended sediment thus the potholes here were destroyed by incoming sediment biron et al 1996 uneven bed elevation sinuosity of the channel heavy monsoon water mass and stream power are also influencing factors in potholes development there is a huge gap between the monsoon and non monsoon phase kale 2002 2003 2007 kale and hire 2007 in the rate of riverbed erosion maximum erosion is observed in the lower part of galudih dam monsoon 6341 01 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 2 74 k g m 2 s 3 the lower part of nscs monsoon 5930 75 k g m 2 s 3

mukhopadhyay 1980 dhali and biswas 2017a b and therefore experience maximum bed erosion among all sites in these sites of maximum bed erosion many multidimensional potholes are present on the river bed 3 4 dynamic depth and radius of the potholes 3 4 1 the global trend of depth radius relation potholes inner radius increase rapidly with respect to its depth springer et al 2005 dhali and biswas 2017a since 2005 this methodological technique has proved to be very worthwhile for potholes evolution study the increase of depth radius of the potholes provides ample scope for analysing the genesis and dynamic evolution of riverbed potholes expeditious changes of pothole s radius depth have been observed in kurokawa river in japan sato et al 1987 which is 1 093 m some of consequential river like sandy and deerfield river in usa ji et al 2018 gatineau river in canada ji et al 2018 ocoee river in usa goode 2009 minho river in spain álvarez vázquez and de uña álvarez 2017 orange river in south

river and sunxi river in china ji et al 2018 have portrayed some variation in their values which ranges between 0 and 0 50 m fig 7 at the initial stage circular or semi circular potholes develop having almost same depth d and radius r but it rapidly change during the different monsoon phases as observed in indian subcontinent mean radius and depth variation in respective sites are 0 066 m 0

shows great variation such as granite basalt metabasalt sandstone mudstone metasediment quartzite etc 3 4 2 spatio temporal change of depth radius in study sites in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin geometrical analysis of 1707 n potholes is observed since 2015 in the monsoon to post monsoon for determining the depth radius relation the radius of the pothole is maximum in lokjhoriya subarnarekha confluence 1 14 m and tetuldanga totojhorna kharsoti river 1 02 m the measurement of depth is also higher in these sites most of the potholes 82 5 are showing 0 50 m radius and 0 80 m depth the inspection of mean radius and depth at the confluence zone reveal subsequent results of means radius r kharkai subarnarekha 0 115 m gara subarnarekha 0 404 m lokjhoriya subarnarekha 0 451 m and in kharsoti subarnarekha 0 132 m the mean depths d of the above sites are 0 153 m 0 581 m 0 720 m and 0 178 m respectively in the middle part of the subarnarekha river basin potholes radius increase expeditiously between july and september the radius keep increasing while rate of vertical erosion become slow in the chota nagpur plateau region the relation between the depth and radius of potholes is strongly observed selective 1707 potholes have provided 0 76 correlation value of depth radius relation relation between potholes depth and radius has been explained in four simple

takes place from its radius 3 5 evolution of different potholes evolution process of potholes are dynamic alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 pelletier et al 2014 dhali and biswas 2017a b dhali and sahana 2017 irregular and continuous it is dynamic fig 8 and destroyed fig 9 in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin elongated circular and oval shape potholes are observed the dynamic evolution rate of the pothole is very first and it is differing from confluence to confluence right to left bank and upper to lower part of bridges dhali and biswas 2017b out of 1707 potholes 1132 66 15 potholes are aggraded and rest 33 85 are destroyed since 2015 357 31 54 potholes are of oval shape 147 12 99 are of circular shape and 628 55 47 are elongated from the total aggraded potholes in selective 17 sites dynamic evolution of this oval circular and elongated potholes are depending on corrosion process variation in fluvial hydraulics and structure of river beds in this duration oval and elongated shape pothole evolution is rapidly increased but the evolution to circular shaped potholes is quite slow during this observation period the rate of evolution ranges of oval δ o e circular δ c e and elongated δ e e shape potholes are 0 005 0 60 m 3 0 01 0 25 m 3 and 0 005 0 30 m 3 tables 5 7 from 2015 to 2018 mean oval circular and elongated shape potholes have evolved in middle part of subarnarekha river basin with values of 0 15177 m 3 0 11718 m 3 and 0 15634 m 3 evolution of potholes is highly observed in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence and upper and lower part of nscs sites in this region 4 discussion hydraulic behaviour ayaz et al 2017 such as stream power water velocity water discharge suspended sediment best 1986 1988 hsu et al 1998 the rate of erosion of middle subarnarekha river basin is changing from monsoon to post monsoon period dhali and sahana 2017 thus maximum number of potholes is observed in the monsoon phase on the river bed of the plateau river the huge amount of water mass has destroyed many old potholes by their energetic stream power since 2015 33 85 of potholes have been destroyed during the rainy season not only fluvial hydraulics the joints and fractures are key factors for evolution of potholes sengupta and kale 2011 multi criteria analysis mca is showing consistency 0 8 0 95 of joint for the development of potholes dhali and biswas 2017b joint length has shown positive relation to pothole formation high joint length results in big pothole formation 0 71 correlations in chota nagpur plateau sites but high joint density zone are negatively related to pothole formation 0 29 during field visit it is clearly observed that high joint density zones are structurally very weak thus in rainy season potholes are destroyed by heavy incoming water mass thus large potholes do not develop in zones of high joint density riverbed erosion is helpful for the development of river bed potholes foley 1980 dhali and sahana 2017 being a rejuvenated region the middle part of subarnarekha and its tributaries are showing high bed erosion especially between july and september from monsoon to non monsoon erosion rate reduces from 6500 to 2 kg m 2 s 3 by suspended load erosion equation so there is the huge gap between the monsoons to non monsoon phase many of potholes sites are affected by the heavy suspended load during the rainy season by river bank erosion subarnarekha kharsoti confluence is one of them where potholes get completely destroyed by huge incoming sediment in the month of august 2015 potholes evolution process rapidly multiplies with enlargement of inner radius in relation its increasing depth springer et al 2005 in the subarnarekha

existence to micro fluvial erosional structure called potholes that are carved by the abrasive work of river which are dominant mainly during monsoon studying potholes in the middle part if subarnarekha river has made it clear that the region is characterised by intense hydraulic activity and geological factors are playing crucial role in the accomplishment of such dynamic topography of the region potholes are characteristic feature of the upper course of a river but in subarnarekha river basin these features are present in the middle course because of rejuvenation of this region the rejuvenation has resulted in the development of landforms that are usually present in the upper course of river rejuvenation has also accelerated the erosive work of river as a result rivers become very turbulent in the monsoon season this forms eddy that carves out potholes through scouring several factors have been taken into consideration to analyse the development of these astounding geomorphic features on the river bed among which radius and joint length of the potholes have a strong positive relation to its increasing area while influx of sediments and joint density are negatively related initial potholes are round in shape and then they evolve into oval shape and later become elongated with increase in their depth and radius which thereby increase their area thus these are dynamic micro features on the river bed and show seasonal variation their life span is short but the process of development is very fast they get easily destroyed with influx of suspended sediments analysis of potholes and their presence on the river bed gives a clear picture of the dominating process of the river in that particular zone and thus help in understanding the changing behaviour of the river these outstanding features substantiate the presence of this extraordinary topography and the pre eminent hydrological geomorphological and geological processes that govern this region and have made it a realm of research in past present and future conflict of interest the author declares that he has no conflict of interest acknowledgements i would like to thank cwc central

6682,potholes are an extraordinary abiotic micro geomorphic feature on the granite and quartzite topography of the subarnarekha river basin these erosional features are carved by the running water actions of river subarnarekha and its tributaries the study has been conducted on 17 sites n 1707 which are exemplary for the development of this micro fluvial feature located on the rejuvenated middle part of subarnarekha river basin hydrological and geological factors are imperative for their formation joint length joint density joint orientation rock hardness variations of fluvial hydraulic bed roughness river bed slope and hydraulic gradient are conducive factors for the development of this geomorphic feature monsoon is the ideal season for carving these features by river turbulence when abrasive work of river is predominant on the river bed monsoon 3000 6500 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 0 50 3 0 k g m 2 s 3 the evolutionary sequence of potholes is from round to oval and then elongated with vertical scouring the relation between pothole radius and depth has been established to explain the process of its expansion joint length shows positive relation r2 0 71 with pothole area while joint density has a negative relation r2 0 29 as these are structurally weaker zones characterised by destruction of these features suspended load is also a hindrance in their formation sites with high suspended load are delineated as pothole destructive zones the mean dynamic evolution of circular oval and elongated shaped potholes occurs at spatio temporal level δ o e 0

hydraulics kale et al 1994 1996 1997 ayaz and dhali 2019 and turbulent flow of the river are important phenomena for the evolution of river bed potholes eddy current vertically erodes the river bed and is a massive abrasive agent seidl and dietrich 1992 whipple et al 2000 stock and montgomery 1999 dynamic changes in river bed potholes are the product of changing hydraulic factors like water discharge velocity and stream power the dynamics of river bed potholes varies from temporal to spatial scale hancock et al 1998 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 in the chota nagpur plateau region river bed potholes are utmost features carved by the rivers like subarnarekha lokjhoriya kharsoti kharkai these unique micro features are the outcome of typical hydraulic mechanism at the confluence zones of these rivers dhali and biswas 2017a b and uneven bed surface dhali and sahana 2017 the streams here are rejuvenated antecedent mukhopadhyay 1980 monsoons accelerate kale 1990 1998

morphological development of potholes after alexander 1932 studies on river potholes have shown significant advancement in the two decades of 21st century s by notable geoscientist the unusual morphology of pothole formation have intrigued eminent scientist to explain the mechanism of its formation on the river bed kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 lima and binda 2015 dhali and biswas 2017a sengupta and kale 2011 ortega et al 2014 dhali and biswas 2017b the dynamic nature and scientific mechanisms of pothole development is accorded to springer et al 2005 while the formulation of new models to explain the potholes genesis is developed by springer et al 2000 and pelletier et al 2014 in this century the major objective of present research is to develop a model to explain the evolution of potholes size by employing some mathematical equations joint density and pothole length are considered as two related factors responsible for change in the area of potholes for the present research 1707 n river bed pothole samples have been studied from monsoon to post monsoon phase this research provides ample scope for the development of future researches on micro fluvial landforms 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the subarnarekha river basin is paramount plateau river of chota nagpur plateau region which lies in the state of jharkhand orissa and west bengal the present study has been conductedin the middle part of subarnarekha river basin ghatshila to tatangar region jharkhand the basin is the part of singhbhum shear zone ahmad and debi 1965 singh 1956 which is a rejuvenated region mukhopadhyay 1980 dhali and biswas 2017a b riverbed geomorphology of this region is outstanding and is of great morphological significance paul 2014 dhali and sahana 2017 major tributaries of the river are kanchi karkari kharkai raru garanala kharsoti and lokjhoriya to conduct this study subarnarekha kharkai kharsoti garanala and lokjhoriya have been selected as they play a major role on the evolution of riverbed potholes four major confluence zones such as subarnarekha kharkai subarnarekha garanala subarnarekha lokjhoriya and subarnarekha kharsotiand 13 other sites are selected for conducting primary survey n 1707 fig 1 table 1 from selective four tributaries two are left and the other two are right bank tributaries of the prime river the climatic condition of this region changes from arid to humid mukhopadhyay 1980 and maximum rainfall occurs in the monsoon season between june and august when the morpho environ of the potholes is highly affected 2 2 data collection data collection n 1707 potholes process is developed by intensive field survey from 2015 to 2018 monsoon and non monsoon on subarnarekha and its tributaries different photographs and primary data such as joint length cm and m joint orientation arithmetic potholes depth cm and m longest width cm and m bed elevation m potholes evolution side and joint orientation are collected during the field visits some calculations like joint density and pothole size elongated oval and circular were done by different traditional geometric formulas total station ts data and gps garmin extex vista hcx are also used for data collection process horizontal accuracy 3 m evolution of potholes is largely controlled by the action of water and the direction of its flow and also the direction of joint density the data for which was collected through field observation pothole positions were authorized by garmin extex hand gps fig 2 2 3 correlation of joint length joint density and area development of potholes joint density is simply followed by horten 1945 methods which are based on the joint length and coverage area of the particular pothole correlation eq 4 is defined by the correlation regression equation pearson 1895 which ranges between 0 to 1 eq 5 in the field observation many potholes are affected by seasonal water flow and those are under the development stage regional weathering is also responsible for this joint length density and area dhali and biswas 2017a b joint length data of selective potholes is measured by a measuring tape and hence joint area is calculated this data was collected for all the concerned years between 2015 and 2018 joint area is different from the shape of the potholes which are basically oval elongated and circular in shape 1 j

evolution to understand the evolution of potholes in ghatshila region some mathematical formulae have been applied depth radius relation springer et al 2005 dhali and biswas 2017a and their

difference between two selective points and rock susceptibility close observation of the potholes in the study area during different monsoon phases over the years stipulates increasing depth of

alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 pelletier et al 2014 dhali and biswas 2017a miscellaneous factors control the growth of potholes in middle part of subarnarekha river basin joint length radius springer et al 2005 depth joint density molnar et al 2007 sengupta and kale 2011 bed elevation stream power water velocity bed roughness shear stress are dominant controls over the evolution of potholes analysis with the help of mca multi criteria analysis it is clearly depicted that the joint density is prime control for potholes dynamicity in this region dhali and biswas 2017b subarnarekha lokjoriya confluence site no 12 is an ideal site for pothole study among all the concerned sites utmost mean potholes depth is observed in tetuldana totojhorna kharsoti river d mean 0 580 m subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence d mean 0 499 m upper part of nscs d mean 0 420 m and subarnarekha near apurpoth d mean 0 720 m these spots are highly affected by seasonal water flow turbulence and eddy flow vertical swirling motion mean potholes radius is maximum in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence r mean 0 451 m maximum and minimum joint length are observed in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence j mean 1 41 m and tetuldanga road bridge j mean 0 35 m but the maximum joint density is found in lower part of nscs 2 jd mean 1 75 sq m overall result indicates that joint cracks fracture regional weathering have influenced over the evolution of potholes table 2 fig 3 the monsoon season kale and gupta 2001 kale 2011 kale and baker 2006 in the study sites 17 sites is characterised by heavy rainfall and witness extraordinary hydraulic actions monthly average flow per unit drainage area in ghatsila region 6 1971 6 2011 are 34 39 mm june 88 7 mm july 139 23 mm august 120 83 mm september 51 81 mm october 16 52 mm november 7 13 mm december 4 17 mm january 3 17 mm february 2 4 mm march 2 1 mm april and 3 03 mm may respectively cwc 2015 monthly average sediment load are 8077 tonnes per day august and 9220 tonnes per day september in the rainy season cwc 2015 of this region maximum water discharge was in between 9579 59 and 10 582 m 3 s 1 and minimum water discharge was 0 4 3 8 m 3 s 1 in ghatsila from 04 20 1972 to 03 12 2010 cwc 2015 annual flow from 2012 to 2013 in ghatsila region is 6105 mcm monsoon and 578 mcm non monsoon cwc 2015 fig 4 so it is clearly depicted that fluctuation in the values of fluvial hydraulics and related parameters are very high from wet to dry period in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin in dry season the river bed is dry and exposed and is in going to die condition the development of potholes is witnessed mainly during monsoon in all the selected sites 3 2 joint length joint density and pothole area in the development of potholes the geological structure of the riverbed such as joints cracks and fracture are important phenomena kale and joshi 2004 scott 2015 dhali and biswas 2017b for development of river bed potholes in middle part of subarnarekha river basin joint length joint density and development of potholes are directly correlated these are the results of regional weathering and monsoon flow of water mass the values of mean joint density m sq m ranges between 0 50 and 3 50 m sq m and mean joint length m is between 0 35 and 2 15 m and mean area sq m is 0 10 1 20 sq m in selective 17 sites of chota nagpur plateau region the results of mean joint density joint length and pothole area have been analysed form the collected data of 1707 n potholes fig 5 a positive correlation exists 0 71 between joint length and potholes area which illustrate that large joint length influence over the creation of new potholes fig 6 dominance of this geological factor in the evolution of potholes is ascertained in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence site 12 due to turbulence water enters into joints cracks and fractures and corrodes the potholes thereby increasing their area with time but joint density and potholes area development are negatively correlated for the evolution of potholes 0 29 concentrated joint density zone assists the development of new pothole but it is also a weak zone on the river bed alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 so destruction processes is more dominant than creation 3 3 bed erosion and suspended load bed erosion and suspended load of water is analogous to pothole development foley 1980 dhali and sahana 2017 enormous erosion of left bank of subarnarekha since 2015 in subarnarekha kharsoti confluence site has yielded high suspended sediment thus the potholes here were destroyed by incoming sediment biron et al 1996 uneven bed elevation sinuosity of the channel heavy monsoon water mass and stream power are also influencing factors in potholes development there is a huge gap between the monsoon and non monsoon phase kale 2002 2003 2007 kale and hire 2007 in the rate of riverbed erosion maximum erosion is observed in the lower part of galudih dam monsoon 6341 01 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 2 74 k g m 2 s 3 the lower part of nscs monsoon 5930 75 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 2 07 k g m 2 s 3 and subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence monsoon 6711 50 k g m 2 s 3 non monsoon 2 79 k g m 2 s 3 table 3 the river basin is antecedent rejuvenated in the middle part mukhopadhyay 1980 dhali and biswas 2017a b and therefore experience maximum bed erosion among all sites in these sites of maximum bed erosion many multidimensional potholes are present on the river bed 3 4 dynamic depth and radius of the potholes 3 4 1 the global trend of depth radius relation potholes inner radius increase rapidly with respect to its depth springer et al 2005 dhali and biswas 2017a since 2005 this methodological technique has proved to be very worthwhile for potholes evolution study the increase of depth radius of the potholes provides ample scope for analysing the genesis and dynamic evolution of riverbed potholes expeditious changes of pothole s radius depth have been observed in kurokawa river in japan sato et al 1987 which is 1 093 m some of consequential river like sandy and deerfield river in usa ji et al 2018 gatineau river in canada ji et al 2018 ocoee river in usa goode 2009 minho river in spain álvarez vázquez and de uña álvarez 2017 orange river in south africa springer et al 2005 indrayani kale and shingade 1987 subarnarekha dhali and biswas 2017b and kharoti river dhali and biswas 2017a dhali and sahana 2017 in india wubu ren et al 2015 and somerset river and sunxi river in china ji et al 2018 have portrayed some variation in their values which ranges between 0 and 0 50 m fig 7 at the initial stage circular or semi circular potholes develop having almost same depth d and radius r but it rapidly change during the different monsoon phases as observed in indian subcontinent mean radius and depth variation in respective sites are 0 066 m 0

shows great variation such as granite basalt metabasalt sandstone mudstone metasediment quartzite etc 3 4 2 spatio temporal change of depth radius in study sites in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin geometrical analysis of 1707 n potholes is observed since 2015 in the monsoon to post monsoon for determining the depth radius relation the radius of the pothole is maximum in lokjhoriya subarnarekha confluence 1 14 m and tetuldanga totojhorna kharsoti river 1 02 m the measurement of depth is also higher in these sites most of the potholes 82 5 are showing 0 50 m radius and 0 80 m depth the inspection of mean radius and depth at the confluence zone reveal subsequent results of means radius r kharkai subarnarekha 0 115 m gara subarnarekha 0 404 m lokjhoriya subarnarekha 0 451 m and in kharsoti subarnarekha 0 132 m the mean depths d of the above sites are 0 153 m 0 581 m 0 720 m and 0 178 m respectively in the middle part of the subarnarekha river basin potholes radius increase expeditiously between july and september the radius keep increasing while rate of vertical erosion become slow in the chota nagpur plateau region the relation between the depth and radius of potholes is strongly observed selective 1707 potholes have provided 0 76 correlation value of depth radius relation relation between potholes depth and radius has been explained in four simple

sites table 4 and are close to logarithmic trend equation in the initial stage potholes development mainly started form vertical depth erosion but in the second developmental stage potholes evolution takes place from its radius 3 5 evolution of different potholes evolution process of potholes are dynamic alexander 1932 whipple et al 2000 springer and wohl 2002 kale and joshi 2004 springer et al 2005 pelletier et al 2014 dhali and biswas 2017a b dhali and sahana 2017 irregular and continuous it is dynamic fig 8 and destroyed fig 9 in the middle part of subarnarekha river basin elongated circular and oval shape potholes are observed the dynamic evolution rate of the pothole is very first and it is differing from confluence to confluence right to left bank and upper to lower part of bridges dhali and biswas 2017b out of 1707 potholes 1132 66 15 potholes are aggraded and rest 33 85 are destroyed since 2015 357 31 54 potholes are of oval shape 147 12 99 are of circular shape and 628 55 47 are elongated from the total aggraded potholes in selective 17 sites dynamic evolution of this oval circular and elongated potholes are depending on corrosion process variation in fluvial hydraulics and structure of river beds in this duration oval and elongated shape pothole evolution is rapidly increased but the evolution to circular shaped potholes is quite slow during this observation period the rate of evolution ranges of oval δ o e circular δ c e and elongated δ e e shape potholes are 0 005 0 60 m 3 0 01 0 25 m 3 and 0 005 0 30 m 3 tables 5 7 from 2015 to 2018 mean oval circular and elongated shape potholes have evolved in middle part of subarnarekha river basin with values of 0 15177 m 3 0 11718 m 3 and 0 15634 m 3 evolution of potholes is highly observed in subarnarekha lokjhoriya confluence and upper and lower part of nscs sites in this region 4 discussion hydraulic behaviour ayaz et al 2017 such as stream power water velocity water discharge suspended sediment best 1986 1988 hsu et al 1998 the rate of erosion of middle subarnarekha river basin is changing from monsoon to post monsoon period dhali and sahana 2017 thus maximum number of potholes is observed in the monsoon phase on the river bed of the plateau river the huge amount of water mass has destroyed many old potholes by their energetic stream power since 2015 33 85 of potholes have been destroyed during the rainy season not only fluvial hydraulics the joints and fractures are key factors for evolution of potholes sengupta and kale 2011 multi criteria analysis mca is showing consistency 0 8 0 95 of joint for the development of potholes dhali and biswas 2017b joint length has shown positive relation to pothole formation high joint length results in big pothole formation 0 71 correlations in chota nagpur plateau sites but high joint density zone are negatively related to pothole formation 0 29 during field visit it is clearly observed that high joint density zones are structurally very weak thus in rainy season potholes are destroyed by heavy incoming water mass thus large potholes do not develop in zones of high joint density riverbed erosion is helpful for the development of river bed potholes foley 1980 dhali and sahana 2017 being a rejuvenated region the middle part of subarnarekha and its tributaries are showing high bed erosion especially between july and september from monsoon to non monsoon erosion rate reduces from 6500 to 2 kg m 2 s 3 by suspended load erosion equation so there is the huge gap between the monsoons to non monsoon phase many of potholes sites are affected by the heavy suspended load during the rainy season by river bank erosion subarnarekha kharsoti confluence is one of them where potholes get completely destroyed by huge incoming sediment in the month of august 2015 potholes evolution process rapidly multiplies with enlargement of inner radius in relation its increasing depth springer et al 2005 in the subarnarekha river sites around 66 15 potholes have shown 3 7 times increase in their inner radius in wet period the evolution process of river bed potholes is sustained and dynamic during the observation period the mean evolutions scenario is irregular in spatial and temporal scale maximum mean evolution of oval shape potholes is observed in subarnarekha lokhoriya confluence upper part of nscs and lower part of hurlung bridge which are 0 63685 m 3 0 35848 m 3 and 0 28398 m 3 summarized mean evolution of riverbed potholes is found in lower part of hurlung bridge subarnarekha gara nala confluence and lower part of nscs 2 the values are 0 29661 m 3 0 26048 m 3 and 0 22556 m 3 table 8 fig 10 high joint length water discharge water velocity seasonal turbidity high bed roughness and confluence nature are obliging for the corrosion process the history of potholes geomorphology of these sites is unique and marvellous 5 conclusion rejuvenated granitic and quartzite river bed of subarnarekha river owes existence to micro fluvial erosional structure called potholes that are carved by the abrasive work of river which are dominant mainly during monsoon studying potholes in the middle part if subarnarekha river has made it clear that the region is characterised by intense hydraulic activity and geological factors are playing crucial role in the accomplishment of such dynamic topography of the region potholes are characteristic feature of the upper course of a river but in subarnarekha river basin these features are present in the middle course because of rejuvenation of this region the rejuvenation has resulted in the development of landforms that are usually present in the upper course of river rejuvenation has also accelerated the erosive work of river as a result rivers become very turbulent in the monsoon season this forms eddy that carves out potholes through scouring several factors have been taken into consideration to analyse the development of these astounding geomorphic features on the river bed among which radius and joint length of the potholes have a strong positive relation to its increasing area while influx of sediments and joint density are negatively related initial potholes are round in shape and then they evolve into oval shape and later become elongated with increase in their depth and radius which thereby increase their area thus these are dynamic micro features on the river bed and show seasonal variation their life span is short but the process of development is very fast they get easily destroyed with influx of suspended sediments analysis of potholes and their presence on the river bed gives a clear picture of the dominating process of the river in that particular zone and thus help in understanding the changing behaviour of the river these outstanding features substantiate the presence of this extraordinary topography and the pre eminent hydrological geomorphological and geological processes that govern this

6683,groundwater recharge by precipitation is often assumed by practitioners as well as scientists to be a slow process of filtration through layers of uniform texture analogous to darcy s law in most basins however rainwater also finds its way through macropores and preferential pathways to the shallow unconfined aquifers within hours of falling recharge phases may extend over several days increasing groundwater levels stored volume and hence baseflows into adjoining rivers in this study groundwater recharge and storage are computed from baseflow as separated with a nonlinear reservoir algorithm from time series of daily flows at gauging stations in northern germany results are compared to groundwater level fluctuation in the catchments and to daily seepage rates measured in a lysimeter station peak times of the fast transfer of rain water through the vadose zone are generally the same however while recharge from baseflow ends when baseflow assumes its typical recession the attenuation of lysimeter seepage may last much longer the volume of lysimeter seepage is generally higher than the recharge in catchments due not only to different vegetation but also to rim effects impeding direct runoff furthermore the lysimeter walls allow vertical fluxes only without further evidence or improved devices lysimeter seepage should therefore not be indicated as groundwater recharge for the site or catchment findings also indicate that the shape of derived recharge unit responses is practically time invariant but with a strong seasonal variation in the recharge rainfall ratio of precipitation events 1 introduction the essential proportions of groundwater recharge are the fast and unsteady fluxes through the unsaturated zone in macropores continuous voids created by rainworms plant roots and other natural processes this fast rainwater infiltration through macropores and preferred pathways has long been recognized and has been the subject of considerable research work during the last 40 years e g sklash and farvolden 1979 beven and germann 1982 weiler and naef 2003 krause and bronstert 2007 in spite of this not only in hydrological practice but also in scientific research the whole recharge is mostly assumed to be the very slow and quasi steady process of filtration through layers of uniform texture analogous to the laws of darcy 1856 and richards 1931 in a comprehensive review of the literature by bevens and germann 2013 it is stated that the dominant concept of soil physics in recent hydrological textbooks and models remains the darcy richards equation the rapid mobilization of old water paradox kirchner 2003 has been the subject of considerable research work a common result is that many streams respond promptly to rainstorms even though storm runoff often contains relatively little water that originates from current rainfall berghuijs kirchner 2017 already mcdonnell 1990 explained the process of rapid exfiltration of isotopically old water into a channel during rainfall events as highly transient macropore driven processes of crack infiltration bypass flow and wenninger et al 2004 demonstrated the importance of rapid responding hillslope groundwater by a combination of tracer and hydrometric methods the fast infiltration into natural soils through preferential pathways has been long recognized e g by schumacher 1864 the larger the gaps between the capillaries of the soil and more non capillary spaces are in the soil the easier the water sinks driven by the hydrostatic pressure into it beven 2018 refers to the period in which this traditional knowledge of macropores was disregarded a century of denial the mathematical description of the transfer of infiltrated effective rainfall through the unsaturated zone remains difficult and uncertain because of the inhomogeneous properties of the soil jan and chen 2013 besbes and de marsily 1984 the evaluation of lysimetric data could be as an experimental approach to determine transfer functions lysimeter stations are mainly built and operated for long term balancing of water and solutes in most of these stations leachate rates are only evaluated and made available as monthly or seasonal values harsch et al 2009 the temporal resolution of groundwater recharge its transfer speed and unsteadiness are mostly not considered the dynamics however are important for a realistic assessment of temporal variability and the modeling of water and matter transport e g of fertilizers and pesticides into the groundwater this study aims to stimulate research and discussion about the formation and dynamics of groundwater recharge to achieve this aim time series of groundwater recharge are derived from baseflow separated from total flow at the gauging stations of two neighboring smaller catchments in northeast germany time series of seepage and precipitation of a lysimeter station operated in one of the catchments and the variation of observed groundwater levels allow a direct comparison with the recharge computed from baseflow when questions arose concerning the shape of typical lysimeter seepage hydrographs data of a further catchment in northern germany were viewed for comparison 2 studied catchments and data fig 1 left panel shows an area of north germany with two small catchments of tributaries of the warnow river south of the port city rostock and the ilmenau catchment south of the elbe river the warnow river catchments were the main subject of this study while the data of the ilmenau catchment were also analyzed for clarification of the problem fig 1 right panel shows the topographic watersheds with their river systems of the two smaller tributaries of the warnow river the warnow reaches the baltic sea in rostock the kösterbeck catchment at the gauging station of kessin has an area of 89 km2 the zarnow at reez 51 km2 measurements at the gauging stations kessin and reez started in 1989 and 2002 respectively groundwater levels have been continuously observed since 2009 in the station of dummerstorf it lies roughly between the two catchments with a mean groundwater depth of approximately 3 m below ground surface and is thus considered representative of the two catchments time series of daily flows and groundwater levels were obtained from the middle mecklenburg water authority staatliches amt für landwirtschaft und umwelt mittleres mecklenburg both catchments are characterized by moraines the moderate topographic relief varies between about 0 m and 60 m above mean sea level average annual precipitation measured at ground level is approximately 700 mm the soil is predominantly sandy loam pseudo gley and parabraun earth the area is mainly used for agriculture the catchments were chosen because of their lysimeter station but also because their general characteristics are representative for many watersheds in north germany the groß lüsewitz lysimeter station situated at 54 12 n in the kösterbeck watershed right panel in fig 1 is operated by the university of rostock in groß lüsewitz the cylindrical soil tanks made of steel sheet have each a surface of 1 m2 diameter 1 128 m and a total depth below the soil surface of 2 5 m a rim of about 10 cm height above the surface prevents lateral inflows or outflows the soil monolith of 2 1 m depth is placed on a 40 cm gravel layer so that leachate water can be drained and measured lysimeters are devices used for the measurement of percolation to derive actual evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge their central part is a tank or container filled with an undisturbed soil monolith taken locally lysimeters in groß lüsewitz are of the weighting type infiltration and evapotranspiration can be calculated from precipitation drainage and variation of the weight however they are not equipped with suction cup rakes at the bottom to generate the under pressure field matrix potential corresponding to a representative soil moisture tension measured outside of the lysimeter von unold and fank 2008 following bednorz 2017 the lower boundary condition is important for the short term dynamics of percolation while it does not have much influence on the medium and long term water balance of deep lysimeters this study is based on time series of daily values of discharge at gauging stations provided by the water authorities and of lysimeter seepage both of which are normally difficult to acquire while the commonly used time step of one day may cause some smoothing it will still yield significant results and is significantly better than the use of monthly values 3 baseflow separation and groundwater recharge the discharge of most rivers in many different hydrological and climatic settings and regions of the world consists mainly of baseflow i e groundwater outflow from the shallow aquifers of their catchments this is confirmed by hydrological tracer measurements used to determine the proportion of groundwater in the total flow in rivers chapman and maxwell 1996 herrmann 1997 weiler and naef 2003 even during flood events baseflow is often a significant contribution to discharge into rivers aksoy and wittenberg 2015 however after direct runoff ceases practically the total flow is fed by exfiltrating groundwater analysis of the baseflow recession allows identification of the relationship between groundwater storage and outflow in many cases fast infiltration through macropores and preferential pathways bronstert and plate 1997 raises the level of the unconfined groundwater surface soon after heavy rainfalls the higher hydraulic head in the aquifer increases outflow into the river i e the baseflow which does not consist of new event water but of old groundwater from the vicinity of the river recharge phases after an event typically extend over a few days wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 assuming a uniform distribution of rainfall and infiltration over the catchment the groundwater surface also rises uniformly hence slopes will not change significantly hydraulically the aquifer is a reservoir whose outflow is a function of water level head and outflow height at the river board it should be noted that the fast response of the groundwater to heavy rainfall is not only a specific phenomenon of the catchments studied here but has been observed at more than one hundred gauging stations both in germany wittenberg 1999 and worldwide for regions with quite different characteristics in this study baseflow was separated from the total flow following the method of wittenberg 1999 which has been applied in numerous case studies in germany müller et al 2003 wittenberg 2003 austria zillgens et al 2005 switzerland meyer et al 2011 poland romanowicz and osuch 2011

australia wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 among many others and counts as one of the most widely used models to simulate recession curves arciniaga et al 2017 this broad application in different flow regimes demonstrates the suitability of the approach in climatic zones from arid to humid an exception is rivers without aquifers such as wadis and river reaches without direct contact to aquifers such as the nile and niger the method is based on the nonlinear storage outflow relationship 1 s a qb b of the shallow unconfined groundwater reservoir involved in the annual water cycle for storage s in m3 and outflow baseflow qb in m3 s the factor a has the unit m3 3b sb if the volumes are expressed in depth units i e volume per unit area and the time step is one day then s is in mm qb in mm d and a in mm1 b db the power b is dimensionless the recession of the nonlinear reservoir for b 1 for an initial value qb 0 is 2 qb t qb 0 1 1 b qb 0 1 b ab t 1 b 1 the coefficients a and b can be determined for observed recession hydrographs by an iterative least squares method analysis of observed flow recessions of numerous rivers in different regions reveals a typical value of approximately b 0 5 wittenberg 1999 for shallow unconfined aquifers this empirically found mean value of 0 5 i e discharge proportional to the square of storage can also be derived theoretically e g schoeller 1962 the values a and b used to model a recession are correlated to a certain extent i e a lower value of a causes a higher b and vice versa for most applications it is therefore reasonable to fix the exponent b at this standard value of b 0 5 since it facilitates comparison of the a values found for different recessions or catchments also for this study b is taken as 0 5 the separation of baseflow from time series of total daily flow is carried out by a computer program described in wittenberg 1999 fig 2 showing an observed hydrograph of the kösterbeck river at kessin was used to explain how baseflow is separated from the total flow the calculation starts at the last value of the time series and proceeds backwards along the time axis baseflow at time t δt is determined from baseflow at the time t by inverting eq 2 as 3 qb t δ t qb t 0 5 1 a 2 the time step δt is normally one day baseflow recessions r calculated by eq 3 are connected by transition curves t determined with a digital filter algorithm as described in wittenberg 1999 as follows when the reverse calculated baseflow recession curve intersects the rising limb of the total hydrograph a point which is at the next time step forward from the total flow is adopted as the peak of baseflow similar to the digital filter described by chapman 1999 values of the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph are then found as the calculated recession curve for one time step forward for each given total flow value this is a transition curve t which characterizes the increase of baseflow during groundwater recharge daily effective groundwater recharges gwr are determined from the difference between the recession curves from the rising baseflow during a transition phase 4 gwr t s t s t δ t t t δ t q b d t where s is the actual storage calculated by eq 1 effective groundwater recharge calculated with eq 3 does not consider other possible withdrawals from the groundwater reservoir such as abstractions a or evapotranspiration et from the shallow groundwater a more complete version of eq 4 would thus be 5 gw r i s i s i 1 ti 1 ti q a e t d t the effects of evapotranspiration from the groundwater and of groundwater abstractions are amply treated in wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 and wittenberg 2003 in moderate and cold climates evapotranspiration from the groundwater is normally assumed to be negligible and is not considered in most baseflow studies it is not the aim of this study to analyse the complete water balance of the catchments but to focus on the fast effective groundwater response 4 results of case studies an application for the smaller catchment of the zarnow river at reez is shown in fig 3 it shows that groundwater recharge calculated from the separated baseflow occurs during the days after heavy rainfalls the measured groundwater level which rises accordingly before receding again by baseflow confirms the calculated results the coefficient of determination between the daily values of groundwater storage s which are calculated from the separated baseflow by eq 1 and of measured groundwater level gwl for the indicated time is r2 0 94 the high correlation also holds for longer periods as shown in fig 4 for the year 2011 it is therefore assumed that the method applied to determine groundwater recharge and storage is realistic effective mobile groundwater storage s corresponds to the mobile part of the porosity specific pore volume of the saturated zone which can be stored or released by a rising or falling in the groundwater level other than the pore water which is immobile by adhesion the factor in the linear regression equations depicted in figs 3 and 4 is approximately 20 19 5 and 22 indicating that a 1 m change in groundwater level gwl corresponds to a difference of 20 mm in the mobile groundwater storage s the effective porosity specific yield of 2 is thus low but characteristic for the sandy loams of the studied catchments it is noteworthy that 2 of effective porosity correspond to about 45 of total porosity hölting and coldewey 2019 hence this approach for the determination of groundwater recharge from separated baseflow can also be applied to estimate porosity hydrologically the year 2011 was extraordinary with heavy rainfalls in july miegel et al 2014 and a corresponding rise of the groundwater level fig 4 however contrary to the often heard opinion from the farmers and interested public in the region groundwater recharge in northern germany also takes place in normal summers 5 comparison of groundwater recharge calculated from baseflow with lysimeter data fig 5 shows daily values of rainfall and seepage of lysimeter lys d6 in groß lüsewitz and of computed groundwater recharges for the kösterbeck catchment at kessin in september 2001 as a typical example although the seepage and the groundwater recharge have similar general patterns there are differences these can be mainly assigned to two groups of impacts conditional or random and systematic conditional deviations are due to the difference between point rainfall at groß lüsewitz and basin rainfall these deviations may be significant but they may also be due to different soils topography vegetation measuring errors etc which can cause a difference between seepage and groundwater recharge two systematic differences between the lysimeter seepage and groundwater recharge were observed while the recharge reaction to a heavy rainfall ends relatively abruptly seepage has a longer recession and a higher total volume as can be seen again in fig 6 the short recession of recharge suggests that the unsaturated zone has only a minor retention effect on the passing infiltrated rain water the long recession of seepage however implies the existence of a reservoir in this case temporary storage and attenuation of lysimeter seepage can be assumed for the gravel layer on the bottom of the lysimeter with its narrow outflow tube at this stage of the study due to the differences between the lysimeter seepage and recharge calculated from baseflow it was decided to compare the findings with those obtained for the ilmenau catchment at the bienenbüttel gauging station daily flows obtained from nlwkn the lower saxony water authority office lüneburg and the lysimeter of hohenzethen of the lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology hannover at the eastern border of the watershed fig 1 fig 7 shows daily values of lysimeter seepage schäfer and fier 2009 and of groundwater recharge calculated from baseflow for both the event hydrographs end without long recessions the lysimeter at hohenzethen is fully drained and equipped with a suction cup rake at the bottom to achieve field comparable fluxes by transmitting the field matrix potential into the lysimeter von unold and fank 2008 the matrix potential represents the under pressure conditions which dominate the vertical water fluxes in the soil in order to obtain realistic lysimeter drainage data the suction rake generates the same pressure potential inside of the lysimeter as that measured continuously outside in the field soils and climatic conditions in hohenzethen are similar to those at groß lüsewitz the volume of the lysimeter seepage is higher than that of the groundwater recharge mainly for two reasons a the rim of the lysimeter surface prevents surface outflow that would become direct flow in a catchment but here adds to the seepage this assumption is supported by the higher correlation of monthly values of direct flow with seepage r 2 0 50 than with groundwater recharge r 2 0 12 b vegetation on the lysimeter is grass or field crops while the catchment is partly covered by forests with higher water consumption and the effect of interception lysimeter seepage is therefore significantly higher than groundwater recharge and approaches total flow also scale effects due to a comparatively small lysimeter surface for a whole catchment add to this difference as a lysimeter can never perfectly reproduce the conditions of a catchment this fact has been depicted in fig 8 by using monthly and annual mean flows of the period 1992 2016 6 response function of groundwater recharge on rainfall the response functions of groundwater arrival to a precipitation event in a catchment always have a similar time invariant shape this also applies to the lysimeter seepage as is clearly seen in fig 9 which shows normalized sum 1 lysimeter seepage hydrographs after short heavy rainfall events exceptions to this principle were noticed when the rainfall event happened after a longer dry period and produced a weak and retarded seepage response it is assumed that in such cases first the adhesive pore water and the gravel layer at the bottom of the lysimeter were filled before drainage could begin a unit response can be defined as the travel time distribution in d 1 through the vadose zone of an effective infiltrated rainfall of 1 mm height in the sense of a unit hydrograph besbes and de marsily 1984 and wu et al 1997 derived such unit response functions from soil characteristics and from well and lysimeter data wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 from baseflow and jan et al 2013 from groundwater level fluctuation in this study it was determined from rainfall and groundwater recharge data following the unit hydrograph principle groundwater recharge gwr can be calculated by convolution of infiltrating rain p with a response function h as 6 gwr i k 1 i p i k 1 h k δ t conversely system responses h can be determined from given daily rainfall p and groundwater recharge rate gwr eq 6 then represents with respect to the term h an overdetermined system of linear equations which is solved according to the gaussian criterion of least squares the application of rainfall and recharge data of the kösterbeck catchment for the period july august 2011 yields the response function plotted in fig 9 together with lysimeter seepage responses found in different years and months for all responses the peak is already reached on the second day after the beginning of a rainfall event however the recharge function ends on the fifth day without the significant recessions of the lysimeter responses hence the volume of the recharge response is less than that of the lysimeter seepage response as explained above in fig 10 groundwater recharge gwr determined from baseflow is compared with lysimeter seepage and to groundwater recharge obtained by convolution of measured rainfalls with the unit response which has a volume sum of values of 0 37 in that period because the recharge is only 37 of rainfall the remaining 63 discharge is accounted for by direct flow soil moisture and plant consumption ultimately leaving the catchment by evapotranspiration it is obvious that the convoluted result is closer to the recharge determined from baseflow than the lysimeter seepage as already noted above the summer of 2011 was extraordinary with heavy rainfalls in july 7 conclusions the recharge of a shallow unconfined aquifer after a strong rainfall is essentially a relatively fast process within a few days infiltrating rainwater finds its way through the unsaturated or vadose zone by preferential pathways to the groundwater surface raising level and outflow hence baseflow in adjoining rivers groundwater responses or recharge hydrographs derived from time series of baseflow separated by the nonlinear reservoir algorithm show a fast rise and an ending which is confirmed by the variation of observed groundwater levels seepage hydrographs of lysimeters generally show a similar fast rise after a rainfall but depending on equipment and operation longer recessions may occur particularly when drainage is not perfect and the lysimeter lacks a suction cup rake at the bottom to achieve field comparable fluxes the volume of seepage is normally higher than groundwater recharge since there is no direct surface flow and vegetation of lysimeters is in most cases less water consuming than that of the large catchment areas on the other hand lysimeters are only able to measure vertical flows at one point while groundwater recharge derived from baseflow is an integrative value for the entire catchment i e ignoring the areal distribution of recharge nevertheless the study reveals that the principal characteristics of groundwater recharge and lysimeter seepage are similar lysimeters can yield valuable specific information especially for agriculture and the transport of solutes time series of daily seepage rates could help to better understand the dynamics of groundwater recharge without correction however lysimeter seepage should not be interpreted as groundwater recharge 8

baseflow is separated from the total flow the calculation starts at the last value of the time series and proceeds backwards along the time axis baseflow at time t δt is determined from baseflow at the time t by inverting eq 2 as 3 qb t δ t qb t 0 5 1 a 2 the time step δt is normally one day baseflow recessions r calculated by eq 3 are connected by transition curves t determined with a digital filter algorithm as described in wittenberg 1999 as follows when the reverse calculated baseflow recession curve intersects the rising limb of the total hydrograph a point which is at the next time step forward from the total flow is adopted as the peak of baseflow similar to the digital filter described by chapman 1999 values of the rising limb of the baseflow hydrograph are then found as the calculated recession curve for one time step forward for each given total flow value this is a transition curve t which characterizes the increase of baseflow during groundwater recharge daily effective groundwater recharges gwr are determined from the difference between the recession curves from the rising baseflow during a transition phase 4 gwr t s t s t δ t t t δ t q b d t where s is the actual storage calculated by eq 1 effective groundwater recharge calculated with eq 3 does not consider other possible withdrawals from the groundwater reservoir such as abstractions a or evapotranspiration et from the shallow groundwater a more complete version of eq 4 would thus be 5 gw r i s i s i 1 ti 1 ti q a e t d t the effects of evapotranspiration from the groundwater and of groundwater abstractions are amply treated in wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 and wittenberg 2003 in moderate and cold climates evapotranspiration from the groundwater is normally assumed to be negligible and is not considered in most baseflow studies it is not the aim of this study to analyse the complete water balance of the catchments but to focus on the fast effective groundwater response 4 results of case studies an application for the smaller catchment of the zarnow river at reez is shown in fig 3 it shows that groundwater recharge calculated from the separated baseflow occurs during the days after heavy rainfalls the measured groundwater level which rises accordingly before receding again by baseflow confirms the calculated results the coefficient of determination between the daily values of groundwater storage s which are calculated from the separated baseflow by eq 1 and of measured groundwater level gwl for the indicated time is r2 0 94 the high correlation also holds for longer periods as shown in fig 4 for the year 2011 it is therefore assumed that the method applied to determine groundwater recharge and storage is realistic effective mobile groundwater storage s corresponds to the mobile part of the porosity specific pore volume of the saturated zone which can be stored or released by a rising or falling in the groundwater level other than the pore water which is immobile by adhesion the factor in the linear regression equations depicted in figs 3 and 4 is approximately 20 19 5 and 22 indicating that a 1 m change in groundwater level gwl corresponds to a difference of 20 mm in the mobile groundwater storage s the effective porosity specific yield of 2 is thus low but characteristic for the sandy loams of the studied catchments it is noteworthy that 2 of effective porosity correspond to about 45 of total porosity hölting and coldewey 2019 hence this approach for the determination of groundwater recharge from separated baseflow can also be applied to estimate porosity hydrologically the year 2011 was extraordinary with heavy rainfalls in july miegel et al 2014 and a corresponding rise of the groundwater level fig 4 however contrary to the often heard opinion from the farmers and interested public in the region groundwater recharge in northern germany also takes place in normal summers 5 comparison of groundwater recharge calculated from baseflow with lysimeter data fig 5 shows daily values of rainfall and seepage of lysimeter lys d6 in groß lüsewitz and of computed groundwater recharges for the kösterbeck catchment at kessin in september 2001 as a typical example although the seepage and the groundwater recharge have similar general patterns there are differences these can be mainly assigned to two groups of impacts conditional or random and systematic conditional deviations are due to the difference between point rainfall at groß lüsewitz and basin rainfall these deviations may be significant but they may also be due to different soils topography vegetation measuring errors etc which can cause a difference between seepage and groundwater recharge two systematic differences between the lysimeter seepage and groundwater recharge were observed while the recharge reaction to a heavy rainfall ends relatively abruptly seepage has a longer recession and a higher total volume as can be seen again in fig 6 the short recession of recharge suggests that the unsaturated zone has only a minor retention effect on the passing infiltrated rain water the long recession of seepage however implies the existence of a reservoir in this case temporary storage and attenuation of lysimeter seepage can be assumed for the gravel layer on the bottom of the lysimeter with its narrow outflow tube at this stage of the study due to the differences between the lysimeter seepage and recharge calculated from baseflow it was decided to compare the findings with those obtained for the ilmenau catchment at the bienenbüttel gauging station daily flows obtained from nlwkn the lower saxony water authority office lüneburg and the lysimeter of hohenzethen of the lbeg lower saxony state office for mining energy and geology hannover at the eastern border of the watershed fig 1 fig 7 shows daily values of lysimeter seepage schäfer and fier 2009 and of groundwater recharge calculated from baseflow for both the event hydrographs end without long recessions the lysimeter at hohenzethen is fully drained and equipped with a suction cup rake at the bottom to achieve field comparable fluxes by transmitting the field matrix potential into the lysimeter von unold and fank 2008 the matrix potential represents the under pressure conditions which dominate the vertical water fluxes in the soil in order to obtain realistic lysimeter drainage data the suction rake generates the same pressure potential inside of the lysimeter as that measured continuously outside in the field soils and climatic conditions in hohenzethen are similar to those at groß lüsewitz the volume of the lysimeter seepage is higher than that of the groundwater recharge mainly for two reasons a the rim of the lysimeter surface prevents surface outflow that would become direct flow in a catchment but here adds to the seepage this assumption is supported by the higher correlation of monthly values of direct flow with seepage r 2 0 50 than with groundwater recharge r 2 0 12 b vegetation on the lysimeter is grass or field crops while the catchment is partly covered by forests with higher water consumption and the effect of interception lysimeter seepage is therefore significantly higher than groundwater recharge and approaches total flow also scale effects due to a comparatively small lysimeter surface for a whole catchment add to this difference as a lysimeter can never perfectly reproduce the conditions of a catchment this fact has been depicted in fig 8 by using monthly and annual mean flows of the period 1992 2016 6 response function of groundwater recharge on rainfall the response functions of groundwater arrival to a precipitation event in a catchment always have a similar time invariant shape this also applies to the lysimeter seepage as is clearly seen in fig 9 which shows normalized sum 1 lysimeter seepage hydrographs after short heavy rainfall events exceptions to this principle were noticed when the rainfall event happened after a longer dry period and produced a weak and retarded seepage response it is assumed that in such cases first the adhesive pore water and the gravel layer at the bottom of the lysimeter were filled before drainage could begin a unit response can be defined as the travel time distribution in d 1 through the vadose zone of an effective infiltrated rainfall of 1 mm height in the sense of a unit hydrograph besbes and de marsily 1984 and wu et al 1997 derived such unit response functions from soil characteristics and from well and lysimeter data wittenberg and sivapalan 1999 from baseflow and jan et al 2013 from groundwater level fluctuation in this study it was determined from rainfall and groundwater recharge data following the unit hydrograph principle groundwater recharge gwr can be calculated by convolution of infiltrating rain p with a response function h as 6 gwr i k 1 i p i k 1 h k δ t conversely system responses h can be determined from given daily rainfall p and groundwater recharge rate gwr eq 6 then represents with respect to the term h an overdetermined system of linear equations which is solved according to the gaussian criterion of least squares the application of rainfall and recharge data of the kösterbeck catchment for the period july august 2011 yields the response function plotted in fig 9 together with lysimeter seepage responses found in different years and months for all responses the peak is already reached on the second day after the beginning of a rainfall event however the recharge function ends on the fifth day without the significant recessions of the lysimeter responses hence the volume of the recharge response is less than that of the lysimeter seepage response as explained above in fig 10 groundwater recharge gwr determined from baseflow is compared with lysimeter seepage and to groundwater recharge obtained by convolution of measured rainfalls with the unit response which has a volume sum of values of 0 37 in that period because the recharge is only 37 of rainfall the remaining 63 discharge is accounted for by direct flow soil moisture and plant consumption ultimately leaving the catchment by evapotranspiration it is obvious that the convoluted result is closer to the recharge determined from baseflow than the lysimeter seepage as already noted above the summer of 2011 was extraordinary with heavy rainfalls in july 7 conclusions the recharge of a shallow unconfined aquifer after a strong rainfall is essentially a relatively fast process within a few days infiltrating rainwater finds its way through the unsaturated or vadose zone by preferential pathways to the groundwater surface raising level and outflow hence baseflow in adjoining rivers groundwater responses or recharge hydrographs derived from time series of baseflow separated by the nonlinear reservoir algorithm show a fast rise and an ending which is confirmed by the variation of observed groundwater levels seepage hydrographs of lysimeters generally show a similar fast rise after a rainfall but depending on equipment and operation longer recessions may occur particularly when drainage is not perfect and the lysimeter lacks a suction cup rake at the bottom to achieve field comparable fluxes the volume of seepage is normally higher than groundwater recharge since there is no direct surface flow and vegetation of lysimeters is in most cases less water consuming than that of the large catchment areas on the other hand lysimeters are only able to measure vertical flows at one point while groundwater recharge derived from baseflow is an integrative value for the entire catchment i e ignoring the areal distribution of recharge nevertheless the study reveals that the principal characteristics of groundwater recharge and lysimeter seepage are similar lysimeters can yield valuable specific information especially for agriculture and the transport of solutes time series of daily seepage rates could help to better understand the dynamics of groundwater recharge without correction however lysimeter seepage should not be interpreted as groundwater recharge 8

6684,challenges in balancing freshwater demands and the long term availability of freshwater from small island aquifers warrants responsive management whereby groundwater conditions guide decisions about pumping rates to avoid well salinization we evaluate responsive freshwater lens management for the first time through transient three dimensional dispersive modelling of bonriki island kiribati both responsive and fixed management scenarios are explored including a novel pumping redistribution strategy modelling results reveal that responsive management offers superior lens protection particularly during droughts pumping redistribution produced lower salinities but greater lens depletion all scenarios indicate that the bonriki lens will continue to decline consistent with previous shorter timeframe projections lower lens storage losses are attainable by abstracting groundwater at the maximum acceptable salinity contrary to traditional strategies of seeking the lowest available salinities the methodology developed in this research provides a blueprint for investigating responsive monitor and react management scenarios which we advocate as best practice for balancing freshwater demands with long term lens security keywords atoll island saltwater intrusion wellfield operation sustainable yield drought 1 introduction fresh groundwater in islands is stored in lenses that float above underlying saltwater and are held in delicate balance by buoyancy forces freshwater seawater mixing and aquifer inflows and outflows on small islands freshwater lenses and rainfall are the two main sources of water for human consumption white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 the main threats to freshwater lenses are pollution by anthropogenic contaminants and salinization by seawater safeguarding the available freshwater resources calls for water management strategies that are tailored towards the unique physiographic conditions encountered on islands the abstraction of fresh groundwater from islands results in thinning of the lens widening of the transition zone between the fresh groundwater and seawater and in many cases up coning e g werner et al 2017 due to the increasing demand for water mainly driven by population growth the withdrawal of groundwater has increased in many islands e g ibrahim et al 2002 and future changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect freshwater availability alsumaiei and bailey 2018 without sufficient knowledge of the groundwater system and recharge rates there is a serious risk of over exploitation much effort has therefore been devoted to determining the sustainable yield of freshwater lenses broadly defined as the rate at which groundwater can be extracted without adverse effects the sustainable yield is often expressed as a percentage of the recharge for example ranging between 25 50 for atoll islands hunt and peterson 1980 white and falkland 2010 numerical groundwater models play a key role in water management decision making and have been applied to a number of islands see werner et al 2017 for a recent overview of atoll island examples they provide a versatile tool for the comprehensive assessment of factors that may impact the sustainable yield of island aquifers such as transient recharge and pumping variability and solute mixing processes the latter is particularly important given the greater thickness of the transition zone relative to that of the freshwater lens in many cases e g buddemeier and oberdorfer 2004 therefore numerical models that simulate dispersive mixing may be the only appropriate tool to assess abstraction effects in the context of the island s sustainable yield their application for sustainable yield estimation is limited though to islands where sufficient hydrogeological data are available several studies have adopted numerical models to design groundwater supply systems for atoll islands griggs and peterson 1993 modelled the freshwater lens of the laura area on the majuro atoll marshall islands they varied design criteria such as abstraction rate number of wells and well depth it was concluded that the sustainable yield of horizontal galleries was roughly double that of individual pumping centres i e drilled vertical wells they also noted the absence of steady state conditions due to the high temporal variability of recharge rates and contended that a higher sustainable yield would be calculated when monthly recharge rates were modelled instead of yearly averages as the latter underestimated actual recharge ghassemi et al 1999 found that using monthly recharge rates instead of quarterly averages led to improvement in their model s ability to simulate observed groundwater salinities they concluded that it is vital to consider the transience of the system at an appropriate temporal resolution during calibration post et al 2018 investigated the long term effects of abstraction from the freshwater lens of bonriki island tarawa atoll kiribati groundwater is withdrawn using a network of infiltration galleries which has been in operation since 1987 growing water demand and upward revisions of the sustainable yield estimates have led to the abstraction of ever greater amounts of groundwater water balance calculations by post et al 2018 based on a calibrated seawat model showed that nearly 80 of the total abstracted volume since the start of operations is made up by freshwater that would have otherwise discharged into the ocean the remainder was removed from storage within the freshwater lens which consequently decreased in volume post et al 2018 found that the storage volume decrease is almost linearly dependent on the total volume abstracted and showed no signs of abatement after 27 years the salinity of the abstracted water on bonriki island has become much more responsive to droughts as the transition zone has migrated upward and moved closer to the screens of most of the wells than in the past these negative developments call for a reassessment of the management of the bonriki water reserve the current water demand appears to exceed the capacity of the freshwater lens according to post et al s 2018 results but a reduction in abstraction is not considered a feasible option for the short term as there are no alternative water sources on the island to meet the possible water deficit jolliffe 2017 therefore a strategy is needed to minimise freshwater lens vulnerability to salinization while maximising the provision of fresh groundwater to the island s populace this paper presents a methodology to explore groundwater reserve management strategies applied to bonriki island kiribati including several options such as redistribution of pumping and land use management to increase recharge this allowed the effectiveness of dynamic management of the lens based on drought indicators to be investigated the principles of dynamic management scenarios are predicated on adaptive management concepts e g williams 2011 specifically the approach to managing the bonriki lens adopted in this investigation is a form of trigger level management werner et al 2011 in that meteorological indicators and salinity levels are used to set the allowable abstraction volumes standard groundwater modelling codes are not well suited to test the effectiveness of such operational management processes because the rate of pumping over time is not known a priori to simulation and instead depends on the model outcomes that is to properly assess the anticipated mode of management feedback mechanisms are required whereby pumping is moderated by lens behaviour enabling dynamic simulation of pumping rates based on management rules is an extension to previous modelling investigations of coastal aquifers e g ghassemi et al 1999 werner and gallagher 2006 post et al 2018 the calibrated numerical model of the bonriki lens was implemented as a script based model using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 which enables the execution of a modflow based model in a python programming environment the objective of this article is to demonstrate the applicability of such models to design and evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic management procedures for fresh groundwater resources in particular where saltwater freshwater interactions are critical 2 study area the island of bonriki is part of the tarawa atoll in the republic of kiribati located near the equator in the western part of the pacific ocean fig 1 the surface elevation is between 2 and 4 m above mean sea level it is separated from the neighbouring buota island to the northeast by a tidal channel on the ocean side is a beach on a rock platform from which a reef flat extends into the ocean the island is located on the south eastern tip of the atoll s lagoon an aquaculture facility with approximately east west oriented saltwater ponds is located in the southern part of the island bonriki international airport is located centrally on the island and the fringes contain residential areas together with the smaller lens of the adjacent buota island bonriki island s freshwater lens constitutes tarawa s national water reserve due to limited water resources on the island land use is regulated however law enforcement is problematic extensive vegetation primarily coconut trees and pandanus jolliffe 2017 covers the lens area groundwater is abstracted by a system of infiltration galleries in the form of horizontal wells that are a few hundred metres in length just below the water table these wells feed water into a central vertical shaft from which the water is pumped after chlorination the water enters the reticulated water system through which the majority of water is provided to the high population density regions of south tarawa notwithstanding significant leakage problems with the reticulation network in 2014 groundwater was being abstracted at a rate of 1362 m3 day post et al 2018 the subsurface lithology is made up of holocene clastic sediments that cover the underlying pleistocene limestone the latter was subjected to weathering during ocean low stands of the earth s glaciations the erosive surface that forms the boundary between the holocene sediments and the underlying limestone is uneven and its depth varies by 3 to 6 m between drill holes the holocene material transitions from the lagoon to the ocean from i unconsolidated sand and gravel into ii poorly cemented hard coral fragments into iii consolidated coral deposits detailed descriptions of the geology of bonriki island are provided by falkland and woodroffe 2004 and jacobson and taylor 1981 tarawa s hot tropical climate is strongly influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso cycles and thus the southern oscillation index and tarawa s annual rainfall are strongly correlated white et al 2007 the period between may and november tends to be the driest while most rainfall occurs from december to april daily rainfall observations have been made on betio island see fig 1 for location since 1947 the average annual rainfall based on the measurements between january 1947 and december 2013 was 1998 mm daily rainfall has been recorded at bonriki airport since 2009 pan evaporation data collected on betio island between 1981 and 1991 yielded a mean pan evaporation rate of 6 15 mm d with a minimum of 5 5 mm d in july and a maximum of 6 9 mm d in september and october falkland 1992 increases in seawater temperatures due to future global warming are expected to lead to an increase in rainfall averages in the pacific predictions of future rainfall as well as drought frequency and duration are based on global atmospheric circulation models drought periods are strongly correlated with the inter annual la niña cycles and sea surface temperatures white 2010 while the representation of enso cycles in such models has improved different models still produce diverging projections of changes in frequency intensity and patterns of future el niño and la niña events bom and csiro 2011 for kiribati bom and csiro 2014 indicate with medium confidence that the annual as well as the seasonal mean rainfall will increase and that the incidence of droughts will decrease 3 methodology the modelling technique adopted in assessing the efficacy of management scenarios on the bonriki freshwater lens involved the development and application of a novel feedback mechanism whereby pumping was restricted according to aquifer conditions the rules for modifying pumping in simulations of future lens behavior are considered representative of the operational procedures that are expected to be adopted by water managers a suite of future scenarios was considered and the corresponding simulated management practices were evaluated in terms of their effectiveness based on the predicted salinities expressed as the water s electrical conductivity ec of the abstraction wells from these management rules were formulated that aim to minimise the long term effects of abstraction on the freshwater lens while optimising the access to fresh groundwater i e ec below 1 5 ms cm for the population of south tarawa this was achieved through the placement of constraints on the abstraction rates during droughts so that unacceptable negative impacts from prolonged periods of low recharge are minimised firstly a calibrated numerical model was developed for this purpose using the seawat code the calibration procedures and results are described in detail in bosserelle et al 2015 galvis rodriguez et al 2017 and post et al 2018 the design of management procedures took into consideration various aspects that determine the condition of the lens i e rainfall land use and abstraction regimes as will be detailed in the following subsections 3 1 rainfall the spatially distributed and transient recharge required for the numerical model was determined using the watbal code which has formed the basis for estimates of rainfall recharge to the bonriki lens in several previous modelling studies alam et al 2002 falkland and woodroffe 2004 post et al 2018 rainfall inputs to watbal were required for future scenarios which were developed for an evaluation period spanning the years 2015 2044 i e 30 years this was preceded by simulation of the conditions occurring during january 1997 december 2014 which encompassed the calibration period for the transient model and represents the historical period with the most intensive abstraction uncertainty in future predictions of changes in inter annual rainfall variability as mentioned above as well as the unknown response of evaporation to changes in climatic variables such as temperature form an obstacle in parametrising the recharge to the freshwater lens for predictive model scenarios white 2010 therefore instead of relying on uncertain projections the daily measured rainfall data from january 1986 to december 2014 were used as input for the recharge calculations for the period january 2016 to december 2044 the selected historical rainfall record includes 5 years of high rainfall 1990 1994 as well as a three year drought 1998 2000 which was the severest event since measurements started in 1947 this three year drought occurs during the years 2028 2030 in the rainfall time series adopted for scenario analyses actual measurements were used for the year 2015 the unmodified historical rainfall as a proxy for the future rainfall is referred to as rainfall scenario s1 additionally two scenarios were designed in which different drought characteristics were considered in rainfall scenario s2 a six year drought was implemented by replacing the daily data for the relatively wet year 2027 which maps onto 1997 in the historical record with the averages of the years 1995 1996 1998 1999 and 2000 by doing this the rainfall of 2025 2030 was lowered from 1213 mm y to 808 mm y on average in rainfall scenario s3 a repeated drought is considered by using the 1996 2014 rainfall observations for the period 2016 2034 and the 1996 2005 data for the years 2035 2044 which means that the 1998 2000 dry years are repeated twice in the future scenario i e during the years 2018 2020 and 2037 2039 the monthly rainfall values are displayed graphically in fig 2 3 2 land use the original calibrated model adopted five recharge zones and considered the period 1997 2014 in 2015 the vegetation was cleared in a significant part of the bonriki water reserve for the installation of solar panels the modified land use of this zone was included in the model during the years 2015 2044 fig 3 with the effect of vegetation clearing on recharge evaluated using watbal 3 3 abstraction three future abstraction regimes were considered referred to as q1 to q3 in the following in the first q1 it was assumed that the total abstraction rate becomes 1660 m3 d as of july 2014 which is the first month for which no actual measured abstraction rates were available at the time of this analysis the abstraction rate is kept steady and is distributed in relative proportions over the 21 operational galleries based on the original design yield of each of the pumping galleries alam et al 2002 falkland 2003 fig 3 this abstraction regime represents a no management approach to drought with abstraction for each pumping gallery at its original design rate the second regime that was considered q2 involved redistributing the abstraction rates between individual galleries based on a sensitivity ranking the ranking was determined by repeatedly running the model with rainfall scenario s1 and abstraction regime q1 but with abstraction at each gallery increased by 80 m3 day one gallery at a time the sensitivity was measured by the resulting increase of the salinity of the water at the trunk main which collects the water from all galleries the salinity increase was taken as the average ec value over the years 2029 2031 i e following the 2028 2030 drought by a lag time of 12 months to account for the delayed response of the abstraction water salinity to low recharge conditions the abstraction rates of the four most sensitive galleries i e 1 17 2 and 20 were scaled back by 45 45 22 5 and 22 5 m3 day respectively while the abstraction rates of the six least sensitive galleries i e 7 9 11 12 13 and 22 were each increased by 22 5 m3 day the total abstracted rate thus remained constant at 1660 m3 day the third abstraction regime q3 built upon q2 in that the redistributed pumping rates from q2 were used as the target or starting values in q3 the sensitivity analysis that was run prior to q2 see above was re run to recalculate the sensitivities with q2 pumping rates in place the results are provided in table 1 which lists the wells with the highest intermediate lowest sensitivities noting that these have changed compared to sensitivities used to determine the pumping redistribution in q2 see above relative to q2 an additional set of more sophisticated rules was adopted to minimise the impact of drought on the lens i e in the form of trigger level management a period during which r 12 25 is called a warning period under this regime the rules tested were formulated as follows 1 if r 12 25 and the ec at the trunk main exceeds 1 ms cm at any stage in a 3 month period the abstraction rates of galleries with ec 1 ms cm are reduced by a predetermined level at the end of that 3 month time step table 1 galleries with ec 2 5 ms cm are switched off the reduction becomes effective during the subsequent 3 month period 2 if r 12 25 and the ec at the trunk main exceeds 1 2 ms cm at any stage during a 3 month period the abstraction rates of galleries with ec 1 ms cm are subsequently reduced for three months as indicated in table 1 and galleries with ec 2 5 ms cm are switched off 3 while the conditions under 1 or 2 are in effect a gallery can only be restored to its full pumping capacity if the ec of the water it abstracts falls below 0 9 ms cm at the end of each 3 month period once these conditions are no longer in effect the relevant galleries are restored to their full capacity for abstraction regime q3 i e responsive abstraction the 30 year future simulation period was subdivided into 120 sequential model runs of 3 months duration the first 3 month period starting on 1 july 2014 used the calculated heads and concentrations of the calibrated model as starting conditions a central control program written in the python programming language runs the seawat model and reads in the concentrations at the end of each 3 month period using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 it implements the above management rules to decide for which galleries the abstraction rate will be reduced during the subsequent 3 month run the main program sequence is displayed graphically in fig 4 the heads and the concentrations at the end of a 3 month model run are used as initial conditions for the subsequent model run the program also calculates the freshwater lens volume v f and other water balance components at the end of each model run and the numbers for the entire 30 year period are recorded in spreadsheet files for post processing this on the fly processing of model outcomes requiring minimal extra computation time has the additional advantage that the size of the output files remains small as the results of 3 month simulations keep getting overwritten model simulations are denoted by a label that is composed of the rainfall scenario and abstraction regime for example model simulation s2q3 is for the responsive abstraction regime q3 applied to rainfall scenario s2 the third abstraction regime was not implemented for rainfall scenario s1 but otherwise all combinations of rainfall scenario and abstraction regime were considered resulting in eight simulations table 2 a no abstraction regime q0 was also run with each rainfall scenario bringing the total number of simulations to eleven 3 4 model output the effectiveness of management scenarios was evaluated from model outputs of 1 the freshwater lens volume v f 2 pumped water volumes q a and 3 the salinity of pumped groundwater modelled concentrations were used to determine v f which was calculated by summing saturated volumes in cells containing groundwater with ec 2 5 ms cm at the end of each stress period the effect of pumping on the size of the freshwater lens was assessed in terms of the difference between modelled freshwater volumes without abstraction v f na and with abstraction v f a as δv f v f na v f a the total abstracted volume of groundwater v abs tot was defined as 1 v abs tot 1 n q a i δ t i where q a i is the volumetric abstraction rate for month i m3 d and δti is the length of month i in days 28 δti 31 the total number of months since the start of pumping on 1 january 1987 was n 696 the model results were compared to r 12 see fig 2 which is a drought index used in kiribati s water management and drought response plans e g white et al 2008 r 12 represents the rank of the 12 month rainfall total relative to other 12 month sums for the same month for the rainfall scenario being evaluated that is an r 12 value of 100 means that the current month and previous 11 months were wetter than any other 12 month period with the same start and end months 4 results 4 1 effect of rainfall scenarios fig 5 shows the development of the abstracted water ec at the trunk main for rainfall scenarios s1 s2 and s3 july 2014 to december 2044 and for the three abstraction scenarios q1 q2 and q3 the difference in the calculated ec between the rainfall scenarios demonstrates how sensitive the lens condition is to changes in recharge this is borne out especially by the difference between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 which are identical except for the year 2027 which was much dryer in scenario s2 than in scenario s1 the effect on the salinity of the abstracted groundwater is substantial while the ec only just exceeded the critical limit of 1 5 ms cm for two brief periods of a few months in simulation s1q1 the 1 5 ms cm limit was well exceeded for a period of about 3 years in simulation s2q1 even more remarkably the exceedance of the 1 5 ms cm ec limit in 2043 and 2044 in s2q1 but not in s1q1 is the result solely of the year 2027 being drier in rainfall scenario s2 than in s1 during and after the first 3 year drought 2018 2020 the trunk main ec in simulation s3q1 reaches levels of over 2 ms cm for several consecutive months bearing in mind that the 2035 2044 sequence is the same as the 2006 2015 in scenario s3 it is interesting to note that the same 3 year drought now spanning the years 2037 2039 provokes a much stronger salinity response fig 5c ec values reach over 4 ms cm and the 1 5 ms cm threshold is exceeded for a continuous period of about 4 years and even persists during the first months of the following above average rainfall period this behaviour can be better understood by observing the temporal variability of v f which is shown in fig 6 the main difference between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 is that in scenario s1 the persistent decrease in v f during the years 2025 2031 of scenario s2 is interrupted by a circa one year period of recovery in 2027 this means that in simulation s1q1 v f only drops below a value of 4 106 m3 during the years 2030 and 2031 which is when the salinities are at their highest in simulation s2q1 on the other hand v f falls to values of just over 2 106 m3 during those same years which indicates that the lens is in a poorer condition overall and explains why the salinities rise much higher and for a much longer period of time the same reasoning applies to explain the difference in the response to the 3 year droughts in rainfall scenario s3 while the lens is in a relatively poor state during the 2018 2020 drought its condition is worse during the drought of 2037 2039 this is reflected in simulation s3q1 by much higher salinities of the abstracted water during the latter compared to the former fig 5c post et al 2018 noted that the historical pumping regime of the bonriki lens caused δv f i e the lens storage deficit to increase virtually unabated as a function of v tot indicating that the stressed system had not yet reached a new dynamic steady state the assumed future rainfall scenarios in the current study allow for an extended period of analysis of ec and v tot trends relative to that of post et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 the lens storage deficit appears to level off in all rainfall scenarios at least temporarily in 2015 soon after the 1948 june 2014 period considered by post et al 2018 in rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 there is even a reversal of the trend which indicates a phase of lens recovery that persists with a brief interruption during the years 2018 2021 until the 2025 drought sets in the wetter year of 2027 in rainfall scenario s1 leads to a brief pause of the increase δv f while δv f continues to increase unabated at a rate of approximately 0 3 106 m3 yr in scenario s2 in rainfall scenario s3 there are no prolonged periods of high enough rainfall for the lens to recover except for the periods 2023 2028 and 2043 2044 when a slight decrease of δv f can be observed for simulations s3q1 and s3q2 fig 7 the total recharge over the simulation period is larger in rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 than in scenario s3 by 8 76 106 m3 and 5 67 106 m3 respectively and as a result v f is lower on average in scenario s3 than in the other two rainfall scenarios fig 6 moreover the variability of δv f is smaller in rainfall scenario s3 than in s1 or s2 fig 7 by the end of the simulation period december 2044 the lens is in a better state in terms of v f for simulation s3q1 v f 4 59 106 m3 than for s1q1 v f 3 94 106 m3 or s2q1 v f 3 67 106 m3 the simulated ec values of simulation s3q1 are also favourable compared to those from s1q1 and s2q1 during the last two high rainfall years of the simulation even though ec values reached the highest levels of all simulations in s3q1 during the 2037 2039 drought 4 2 effect of abstraction regimes a positive effect on the salinities is achieved by the redistribution of the abstraction abstraction regime q2 between the individual galleries in all three rainfall scenarios fig 5 however contrary to the reasoning applied above to explain the differences in the ec response to droughts the lower ec values of the abstracted water at the trunk main is accompanied by a lower v f for abstraction regime q2 compared to q1 fig 6 these results show that the same total abstraction rate distributed differently across the island s wells can modify the groundwater flow regime so that the lens shrinks in size but at the same time the water supply system becomes more resilient to droughts in terms of the abstraction water salinity in other words lower salinity groundwater can be pumped from a smaller lens with alternative pumping strategies abstraction regime q3 responsive management has a positive effect on the ec of the salinity of the distributed water albeit at the expense of reduced water availability for the residents of south tarawa for simulation s2q3 the ec remains markedly lower than in simulations s2q1 or s2q2 during the 2025 2030 drought although there is still an exceedance of the 1 5 ms cm threshold from january 2029 to december 2030 with the defined management rules the model reduces abstraction between january 2029 and april 2032 the maximum decrease of the total abstraction rate is 877 m3 day i e 53 of 1660 m3 day during the period july to december 2030 it can also be seen from fig 5b that there are four one to three month intervals between 2038 and 2044 when abstraction is not at its full capacity which is because the salinity of individual galleries is above the ec threshold in the latter two of these four cases this occurred outside a warning period for simulation s3q3 the management rules result in prolonged reduction of abstraction during the years 2019 to 2021 by up to 680 m3 day and 2037 to 2040 by up to 802 m3 day see fig 5c these significant reductions are effective in keeping the ec below 1 5 ms cm during the first drought but fail to accomplish this target during the second drought there are six periods of reduced abstraction ranging in length from 3 to 6 months during the years 2029 to 2036 which do not all coincide with r 12 warning periods as expected the reduction of the freshwater volume during a drought is not as severe when abstraction is reduced simulations s2q3 and s3q3 compared to the scenario in which the galleries are redistributed simulations s2q2 and s3q2 since the duration of the reduced abstraction periods is short though the magnitude of the difference is small relative to the total reduction of v f brought about by pumping fig 6 in simulation s3q3 contrary to s3q1 or s3q2 there is a prolonged decrease of δv f during the last 8 years of the simulation period which already sets in during the 2037 2039 drought it thus seems that a reduction of the abstraction rates during droughts is effective in preventing further harm to or even restoring the health of the lens 5 discussion the investigation of coastal groundwater management including the dynamic pumping response methodology applied in this study is an improvement on previous island modelling investigations in which the pumping rates of management scenarios are pre set e g alam et al 2002 management scenarios are tested that follow the recommendation of werner et al 2011 to combine elements in flux based i e rainfall or recharge based and trigger level i e head and or salinities management specifically a rainfall based index r 12 and salinity thresholds were used as indicators for hydrological drought and freshwater lens stress respectively in abstraction regime q3 these were used in combination to initiate management responses in the form of reduced abstraction the current study adds to werner et al s 2011 evaluation of coastal groundwater management by adopting a more sophisticated modelling platform rather than the simple quasi steady state sharp interface evaluation of their case study furthermore we report on a novel approach to redistributing the pumping rates to coastal aquifers using sensitivity analysis of the pumped water salinity versus pumping rate changes comparisons between the responsive pumping regime q3 redistribution regime q2 and original design yield regime q1 reveal important insights regarding management of the bonriki lens as discussed below the results of the current research has already been taken into account by the government of kiribati who have updated their operational rules in their drought response policies aimed at maximising the availability of water without causing detrimental salinization of the freshwater lens during periods of reduced recharge the script based numerical model developed for responsive pumping scenarios requires the modeller to specify only the pre defined rules for the management scenario and all the pre and post processing of model files is fully automated this enables rapid evaluation of different management responses or variations of a response and avoids the need for tedious preparation of input and analysis of output files in the context of williams 2011 definition of adaptive management this is effectively a single cycle in what would otherwise be under an adaptive management philosophy itself a repeated cycle of re setting the management rules themselves for example the use of r 12 to designate drought periods could be adapted or the salinity thresholds for management actions might be redesigned after a period of testing of the management rules these types of scenarios are plausible adaptations to the current approach albeit stakeholder consultation would be integral to management protocol redesign and the outcomes of consultation processes are practically impossible to predict and thereby challenging to implement into responsive groundwater modelling scenarios post et al 2018 concluded that lens shrinkage is likely to continue to occur under the pumping rates of recent years the modelling results support that finding by revealing that for all three rainfall scenarios and for the three abstraction regimes it holds that while wet phases bring some relief the overall decadal trend of δv f is to increase i e lens shrinkage caused by abstraction is set to progress with time this means that the freshwater buffer zone below the abstraction galleries is expected to continue to thin increasing the sensitivity of the abstracted water salinity to droughts there are notable differences between the abstraction regimes i e original redistributed and responsive in terms of the absolute value of δv f but the rising trend is obtained in all three regimes the difference in the simulated abstraction water salinities between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 for abstraction regime q1 testify to the long lasting consequences of a single year with lower recharge the lower recharge in 2027 in scenario s2 compared to s1 leads to higher modelled ec values 15 years later the brief recovery of the lens as indicated by the increase of v f in scenario s1 in 2027 fig 6a provides just enough buffer to maintain abstraction water salinities below the threshold during the years that follow on the other hand the continual depletion of the lens in scenario s2 during the years 2025 2031 v f in fig 6b destroys the lens buffer capacity which can only be restored when abstraction is severely reduced or during periods of extraordinarily high recharge the latter effect is exemplified by the strong recovery of ec values and v f from their extreme values in simulation s3q1 during the period from 2040 when above average r 12 values are sustained for multiple years in a row hence whilst r 12 is a predictor of short term on the order of one year salinity trends monitoring of the trends of v f and δv f based on model simulations that assimilate the latest observed rainfall and salinity data may support management in that it can provide an indicator of the long term on the order of a decade future salinity trends under a constant abstraction regime the differences between abstraction regimes q1 and q2 indicate that if higher salinities are accepted from the abstracted water the lens volume is likely to be higher because in effect some proportion of the water supplied through the trunk main is in fact brackish or seawater conversely the fresher the trunk main water the larger the relative draw of the lens storage notwithstanding the impact on discharge to the sea of alternative pumping regimes this suggests that pumping lower quality water leaves a greater provision for future extraction through larger lens storage thus island lens management could consider providing the highest tolerable salinity of groundwater rather than the freshest water possible identification of highest tolerable salinity of groundwater would need to be agreed through community and stakeholder consultation to ensure that the salinity of supplied water is acceptable for its intended purpose and considering other social economic health and environmental factors the objective of seeking to pump the highest tolerable salinity groundwater presents as a paradoxical management ideology relative to traditional approaches of seeking to extract the lowest salinity groundwater further exploration is warranted to examine the practicalities and true benefits of this management philosophy declines in freshwater storage under dynamic conditions are rarely analysed in atoll environments and other freshwater lens settings with often steady state conditions constant recharge or constant pumping assessed our modelling results reinforce the importance of using transient recharge for freshwater lens analysis griggs and peterson 1993 ghassemi et al 1999 because the bonriki lens condition appears to be highly dynamic and only by capturing the transient behaviour of v f can lens recovery during high rainfall periods and its decline under drought be properly interpreted this is critical for the assessment of responsive management groundwater abstraction systems in atoll environments are typically developed as pump and forget management strategies these approaches focus on maintaining abstraction at a constant rate over time to maintain water supply but tend to overlook the capacity of water managers to modify their operation of the system in response to its condition dynamics e g sinclair et al 2014 the long term implications of this approach is that frequently the freshwater quality decreases limiting the use of groundwater to washing bathing or toilet flushing applications and alternate and often less reliable water sources such as household rainwater harvesting are needed to meet potable water needs in this study we advocate for and test an active management regime that embraces the dynamic nature of the groundwater system different levels of salinity and the corresponding available volumes of water that a community may be prepared to accept under different climate and water security situations can be evaluated with a particular focus on the conditions experienced under drought conditions communities and groundwater custodians may be willing to accept higher salinity levels during drought periods in order to maintain a particular level of supply the current methodology allows for assessment of these sorts of trade offs including under various plausible future climate regimes the conditions that signify a return to pre drought salinity conditions following higher rainfall rates that allow for recovery of the lens can also be tested these will be significant additional factors for groundwater stakeholders and are also plausibly assessable using the current methodology the social and economic costs of maintaining an acceptable salinity or freshness of the supplied water compared with the costs of providing an alternate water source e g desalination are an important consideration the reduction of abstraction during droughts to safeguard acceptable salinity levels creates a mismatch in the supply and demand of freshwater because demand is highest and other sources of freshwater i e from rainwater tanks are lowest during drought periods in these cases the community may be willing to accept higher levels of salinity in the reticulated water for a period rather than incur the cost of desalinated water to meet the freshwater demand in addition to the supply management that we have assessed demand management can assist in abating the degradation of fresh groundwater resources during periods of lower recharge for example pre drought periods declared based on r 12 e g 25 r 12 40 can be used to alert the community and bring water restrictions into effect additionally access to potable water could be limited to strategically located and controlled standpipes this regulated access approach would not only lower demand by requiring householders to retrieve low salinity potable water from discrete locations but would also reduce potential losses from leaking household distribution systems and encourage the use of water supply from domestic wells for non potable needs such as washing and toilet flushing various other forms of demand management are possible and are essential elements in determining development and management strategies for the groundwater system this study did not consider the option of abstraction reduction during periods of ample rainfall it is conceivable though that a significant part of the demand can then be met by rainwater harvesting allowing temporary relief of the pressure on the lens reducing the abstraction when recharge is high might be an effective way to promote the recovery of the freshwater volume i e a reduction of δv f as a larger fraction of the recharge remains available to add to the storage without numbers on the rainwater storage capacity this option could not be considered in our numerical simulations yet this might constitute another form of dynamic abstraction management aimed at preserving as much of the freshwater volume as possible 6 conclusions this study provides a rare example of physically based density dependent simulation to examine possible future behaviour of an atoll island lens bonriki island kiribati subjected to high levels of abstraction in addition to traditional fixed pumping scenarios this study investigated the applicability of responsive management whereby pumping was adjusted according to aquifer conditions which were assessed from system variables that are historically monitored on bonriki island the salinity of the abstracted water was found to depend strongly on the assumed temporal distribution of groundwater recharge with relatively small differences between rainfall scenarios yielding large differences in salinity it was found that antecedent differences in recharge as far back as 15 years can lead to important differences in salinity of the pumped water during a drought because projected future rainfall and especially its temporal distribution is inherently uncertain this high sensitivity of the model outcomes forms a severe impediment to assessing the future development of the water resource and the sustainability of abstraction regimes therefore rather than forecasting future water availability using a deterministic approach modelling efforts are best aimed at developing management responses to events that are likely to occur under future conditions this has important ramifications for the interpretation of sustainable yield of freshwater lenses and water supply systems more generally the traditional construct of sustainable yield refers to the maximum amount of water that can be taken from the system without causing adverse effects which in the context of island water supply translates to an abstraction rate that is invariably related to the amount of rainfall recharge we propose a more dynamic interpretation in which the abstraction amount is time variant and depends on drought conditions and the maximum salinity a community is willing to accept perhaps a temporary degradation of the resource can be accepted in order to meet the water needs during a drought as long as the recovery during the subsequent wet phases is sufficient to ensure the long term sustainability of the water supply assessing the lens ability to supply water under likely scenarios of reduced rainfall conditions allows estimating the required capacity and costs of alternative water supply options which can be presented to the community to support the decision making process the proposed responsive management and the indicators used here can strengthen tarawa s adaptive water management process and should be evaluated and potentially modified after a period of testing this facilitates the development of optimal solutions that ensure the sustainability of the lens and that provide maximum benefit to stakeholders and the community the departure from a sustainable yield concept that is static i e fixed pumping rates in lieu of one that is more dynamic based on rainfall history and salinity thresholds entails both opportunities and risks future research could be aimed at mapping these not just for atoll islands but for water supply systems under pressure more generally the methodology to evaluate various responsive management simulations adds to the existing suite of groundwater modelling tools by exploiting the flexibility of script based numerical modelling by breaking up the simulation into a series of short duration intervals 120 intervals of 3 months duration in our case the model output after one interval can be used to decide how the model input variables must be changed for the next interval while we used the python based flopy library bakker et al 2016 in this study any programming language could be used for this purpose also the approach is easily transferrable to other applications such as the simulation of artificial storage and recovery schemes

6684,challenges in balancing freshwater demands and the long term availability of freshwater from small island aquifers warrants responsive management whereby groundwater conditions guide decisions about pumping rates to avoid well salinization we evaluate responsive freshwater lens management for the first time through transient three dimensional dispersive modelling of bonriki island kiribati both responsive and fixed management scenarios are explored including a novel pumping redistribution strategy modelling results reveal that responsive management offers superior lens protection particularly during droughts pumping redistribution produced lower salinities but greater lens depletion all scenarios indicate that the bonriki lens will continue to decline consistent with previous shorter timeframe projections lower lens storage losses are attainable by abstracting groundwater at the maximum acceptable salinity contrary to traditional strategies of seeking the lowest available salinities the methodology developed in this research provides a blueprint for investigating responsive monitor and react management scenarios which we advocate as best practice for balancing freshwater demands with long term lens security keywords atoll island saltwater intrusion wellfield operation sustainable yield drought 1 introduction fresh groundwater in islands is stored in lenses that float above underlying saltwater and are held in delicate balance by buoyancy forces freshwater seawater mixing and aquifer inflows and outflows on small islands freshwater lenses and rainfall are the two main sources of water for human consumption white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 the main threats to freshwater lenses are pollution by anthropogenic contaminants and salinization by seawater safeguarding the available freshwater resources calls for water management strategies that are tailored towards the unique physiographic conditions encountered on islands the abstraction of fresh groundwater from islands results in thinning of the lens widening of the transition zone between the fresh groundwater and seawater and in many cases up coning e g werner et al 2017 due to the increasing demand for water mainly driven by population growth the withdrawal of groundwater has increased in many islands e g ibrahim et al 2002 and future changes in rainfall patterns are expected to affect freshwater availability alsumaiei and bailey 2018 without sufficient knowledge of the groundwater system and recharge rates there is a serious risk of over exploitation much effort has therefore been devoted to determining the sustainable yield of freshwater lenses broadly defined as the rate at which groundwater can be extracted without adverse effects the sustainable yield is often expressed as a percentage of the recharge for example ranging between 25 50 for atoll islands hunt and peterson 1980 white and falkland 2010 numerical groundwater models play a key role in water management decision making and have been applied to a number of islands see werner et al 2017 for a recent overview of atoll island examples they provide a versatile tool for the comprehensive assessment of factors that may impact the sustainable yield of island aquifers such as transient recharge and pumping variability and solute mixing processes the latter is particularly important given the greater thickness of the transition zone relative to that of the freshwater lens in many cases e g buddemeier and oberdorfer 2004 therefore numerical models that simulate dispersive mixing may be the only appropriate tool to assess abstraction effects in the context of the island s sustainable yield their application for sustainable yield estimation is limited though to islands where sufficient hydrogeological data are available several studies have adopted numerical models to design groundwater supply systems for atoll islands griggs and peterson 1993 modelled the freshwater lens of the laura area on the majuro atoll marshall islands they varied design criteria such as abstraction rate number of wells and well depth it was concluded that the sustainable yield of horizontal galleries was roughly double that of individual pumping centres i e drilled vertical wells they also noted the absence of steady state conditions due to the high temporal variability of recharge rates and contended that a higher sustainable yield would be calculated when monthly recharge rates were modelled instead of yearly averages as the latter underestimated actual recharge ghassemi et al 1999 found that using monthly recharge rates instead of quarterly averages led to improvement in their model s ability to simulate observed groundwater salinities they concluded that it is vital to consider the transience of the system at an appropriate temporal resolution during calibration post et al 2018 investigated the long term effects of abstraction from the freshwater lens of bonriki island tarawa atoll kiribati groundwater is withdrawn using a network of infiltration galleries which has been in operation since 1987 growing water demand and upward revisions of the sustainable yield estimates have led to the abstraction of ever greater amounts of groundwater water balance calculations by post et al 2018 based on a calibrated seawat model showed that nearly 80 of the total abstracted volume since the start of operations is made up by freshwater that would have otherwise discharged into the ocean the remainder was removed from storage within the freshwater lens which consequently decreased in volume post et al 2018 found that the storage volume decrease is almost linearly dependent on the total volume abstracted and showed no signs of abatement after 27 years the salinity of the abstracted water on bonriki island has become much more responsive to droughts as the transition zone has migrated upward and moved closer to the screens of most of the wells than in the past these negative developments call for a reassessment of the management of the bonriki water reserve the current water demand appears to exceed the capacity of the freshwater lens according to post et al s 2018 results but a reduction in abstraction is not considered a feasible option for the short term as there are no alternative water sources on the island to meet the possible water deficit jolliffe 2017 therefore a strategy is needed to minimise freshwater lens vulnerability to salinization while maximising the provision of fresh groundwater to the island s populace this paper presents a methodology to explore groundwater reserve management strategies applied to bonriki island kiribati including several options such as redistribution of pumping and land use management to increase recharge this allowed the effectiveness of dynamic management of the lens based on drought indicators to be investigated the principles of dynamic management scenarios are predicated on adaptive management concepts e g williams 2011 specifically the approach to managing the bonriki lens adopted in this investigation is a form of trigger level management werner et al 2011 in that meteorological indicators and salinity levels are used to set the allowable abstraction volumes standard groundwater modelling codes are not well suited to test the effectiveness of such operational management processes because the rate of pumping over time is not known a priori to simulation and instead depends on the model outcomes that is to properly assess the anticipated mode of management feedback mechanisms are required whereby pumping is moderated by lens behaviour enabling dynamic simulation of pumping rates based on management rules is an extension to previous modelling investigations of coastal aquifers e g ghassemi et al 1999 werner and gallagher 2006 post et al 2018 the calibrated numerical model of the bonriki lens was implemented as a script based model using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 which enables the execution of a modflow based model in a python programming environment the objective of this article is to demonstrate the applicability of such models to design and evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic management procedures for fresh groundwater resources in particular where saltwater freshwater interactions are critical 2 study area the island of bonriki is part of the tarawa atoll in the republic of kiribati located near the equator in the western part of the pacific ocean fig 1 the surface elevation is between 2 and 4 m above mean sea level it is separated from the neighbouring buota island to the northeast by a tidal channel on the ocean side is a beach on a rock platform from which a reef flat extends into the ocean the island is located on the south eastern tip of the atoll s lagoon an aquaculture facility with approximately east west oriented saltwater ponds is located in the southern part of the island bonriki international airport is located centrally on the island and the fringes contain residential areas together with the smaller lens of the adjacent buota island bonriki island s freshwater lens constitutes tarawa s national water reserve due to limited water resources on the island land use is regulated however law enforcement is problematic extensive vegetation primarily coconut trees and pandanus jolliffe 2017 covers the lens area groundwater is abstracted by a system of infiltration galleries in the form of horizontal wells that are a few hundred metres in length just below the water table these wells feed water into a central vertical shaft from which the water is pumped after chlorination the water enters the reticulated water system through which the majority of water is provided to the high population density regions of south tarawa notwithstanding significant leakage problems with the reticulation network in 2014 groundwater was being abstracted at a rate of 1362 m3 day post et al 2018 the subsurface lithology is made up of holocene clastic sediments that cover the underlying pleistocene limestone the latter was subjected to weathering during ocean low stands of the earth s glaciations the erosive surface that forms the boundary between the holocene sediments and the underlying limestone is uneven and its depth varies by 3 to 6 m between drill holes the holocene material transitions from the lagoon to the ocean from i unconsolidated sand and gravel into ii poorly cemented hard coral fragments into iii consolidated coral deposits detailed descriptions of the geology of bonriki island are provided by falkland and woodroffe 2004 and jacobson and taylor 1981 tarawa s hot tropical climate is strongly influenced by el niño southern oscillation enso cycles and thus the southern oscillation index and tarawa s annual rainfall are strongly correlated white et al 2007 the period between may and november tends to be the driest while most rainfall occurs from december to april daily rainfall observations have been made on betio island see fig 1 for location since 1947 the average annual rainfall based on the measurements between january 1947 and december 2013 was 1998 mm daily rainfall has been recorded at bonriki airport since 2009 pan evaporation data collected on betio island between 1981 and 1991 yielded a mean pan evaporation rate of 6 15 mm d with a minimum of 5 5 mm d in july and a maximum of 6 9 mm d in september and october falkland 1992 increases in seawater temperatures due to future global warming are expected to lead to an increase in rainfall averages in the pacific predictions of future rainfall as well as drought frequency and duration are based on global atmospheric circulation models drought periods are strongly correlated with the inter annual la niña cycles and sea surface temperatures white 2010 while the representation of enso cycles in such models has improved different models still produce diverging projections of changes in frequency intensity and patterns of future el niño and la niña events bom and csiro 2011 for kiribati bom and csiro 2014 indicate with medium confidence that the annual as well as the seasonal mean rainfall will increase and that the incidence of droughts will decrease 3 methodology the modelling technique adopted in assessing the efficacy of management scenarios on the bonriki freshwater lens involved the development and application of a novel feedback mechanism whereby pumping was restricted according to aquifer conditions the rules for modifying pumping in simulations of future lens behavior are considered representative of the operational procedures that are expected to be adopted by water managers a suite of future scenarios was considered and the corresponding simulated management practices were evaluated in terms of their effectiveness based on the predicted salinities expressed as the water s electrical conductivity ec of the abstraction wells from these management rules were formulated that aim to minimise the long term effects of abstraction on the freshwater lens while optimising the access to fresh groundwater i e ec below 1 5 ms cm for the population of south tarawa this was achieved through the placement of constraints on the abstraction rates during droughts so that unacceptable negative impacts from prolonged periods of low recharge are minimised firstly a calibrated numerical model was developed for this purpose using the seawat code the calibration procedures and results are described in detail in bosserelle et al 2015 galvis rodriguez et al 2017 and post et al 2018 the design of management procedures took into consideration various aspects that determine the condition of the lens i e rainfall land use and abstraction regimes as will be detailed in the following subsections 3 1 rainfall the spatially distributed and transient recharge required for the numerical model was determined using the watbal code which has formed the basis for estimates of rainfall recharge to the bonriki lens in several previous modelling studies alam et al 2002 falkland and woodroffe 2004 post et al 2018 rainfall inputs to watbal were required for future scenarios which were developed for an evaluation period spanning the years 2015 2044 i e 30 years this was preceded by simulation of the conditions occurring during january 1997 december 2014 which encompassed the calibration period for the transient model and represents the historical period with the most intensive abstraction uncertainty in future predictions of changes in inter annual rainfall variability as mentioned above as well as the unknown response of evaporation to changes in climatic variables such as temperature form an obstacle in parametrising the recharge to the freshwater lens for predictive model scenarios white 2010 therefore instead of relying on uncertain projections the daily measured rainfall data from january 1986 to december 2014 were used as input for the recharge calculations for the period january 2016 to december 2044 the selected historical rainfall record includes 5 years of high rainfall 1990 1994 as well as a three year drought 1998 2000 which was the severest event since measurements started in 1947 this three year drought occurs during the years 2028 2030 in the rainfall time series adopted for scenario analyses actual measurements were used for the year 2015 the unmodified historical rainfall as a proxy for the future rainfall is referred to as rainfall scenario s1 additionally two scenarios were designed in which different drought characteristics were considered in rainfall scenario s2 a six year drought was implemented by replacing the daily data for the relatively wet year 2027 which maps onto 1997 in the historical record with the averages of the years 1995 1996 1998 1999 and 2000 by doing this the rainfall of 2025 2030 was lowered from 1213 mm y to 808 mm y on average in rainfall scenario s3 a repeated drought is considered by using the 1996 2014 rainfall observations for the period 2016 2034 and the 1996 2005 data for the years 2035 2044 which means that the 1998 2000 dry years are repeated twice in the future scenario i e during the years 2018 2020 and 2037 2039 the monthly rainfall values are displayed graphically in fig 2 3 2 land use the original calibrated model adopted five recharge zones and considered the period 1997 2014 in 2015 the vegetation was cleared in a significant part of the bonriki water reserve for the installation of solar panels the modified land use of this zone was included in the model during the years 2015 2044 fig 3 with the effect of vegetation clearing on recharge evaluated using watbal 3 3 abstraction three future abstraction regimes were considered referred to as q1 to q3 in the following in the first q1 it was assumed that the total abstraction rate becomes 1660 m3 d as of july 2014 which is the first month for which no actual measured abstraction rates were available at the time of this analysis the abstraction rate is kept steady and is distributed in relative proportions over the 21 operational galleries based on the original design yield of each of the pumping galleries alam et al 2002 falkland 2003 fig 3 this abstraction regime represents a no management approach to drought with abstraction for each pumping gallery at its original design rate the second regime that was considered q2 involved redistributing the abstraction rates between individual galleries based on a sensitivity ranking the ranking was determined by repeatedly running the model with rainfall scenario s1 and abstraction regime q1 but with abstraction at each gallery increased by 80 m3 day one gallery at a time the sensitivity was measured by the resulting increase of the salinity of the water at the trunk main which collects the water from all galleries the salinity increase was taken as the average ec value over the years 2029 2031 i e following the 2028 2030 drought by a lag time of 12 months to account for the delayed response of the abstraction water salinity to low recharge conditions the abstraction rates of the four most sensitive galleries i e 1 17 2 and 20 were scaled back by 45 45 22 5 and 22 5 m3 day respectively while the abstraction rates of the six least sensitive galleries i e 7 9 11 12 13 and 22 were each increased by 22 5 m3 day the total abstracted rate thus remained constant at 1660 m3 day the third abstraction regime q3 built upon q2 in that the redistributed pumping rates from q2 were used as the target or starting values in q3 the sensitivity analysis that was run prior to q2 see above was re run to recalculate the sensitivities with q2 pumping rates in place the results are provided in table 1 which lists the wells with the highest intermediate lowest sensitivities noting that these have changed compared to sensitivities used to determine the pumping redistribution in q2 see above relative to q2 an additional set of more sophisticated rules was adopted to minimise the impact of drought on the lens i e in the form of trigger level management a period during which r 12 25 is called a warning period under this regime the rules tested were formulated as follows 1 if r 12 25 and the ec at the trunk main exceeds 1 ms cm at any stage in a 3 month period the abstraction rates of galleries with ec 1 ms cm are reduced by a predetermined level at the end of that 3 month time step table 1 galleries with ec 2 5 ms cm are switched off the reduction becomes effective during the subsequent 3 month period 2 if r 12 25 and the ec at the trunk main exceeds 1 2 ms cm at any stage during a 3 month period the abstraction rates of galleries with ec 1 ms cm are subsequently reduced for three months as indicated in table 1 and galleries with ec 2 5 ms cm are switched off 3 while the conditions under 1 or 2 are in effect a gallery can only be restored to its full pumping capacity if the ec of the water it abstracts falls below 0 9 ms cm at the end of each 3 month period once these conditions are no longer in effect the relevant galleries are restored to their full capacity for abstraction regime q3 i e responsive abstraction the 30 year future simulation period was subdivided into 120 sequential model runs of 3 months duration the first 3 month period starting on 1 july 2014 used the calculated heads and concentrations of the calibrated model as starting conditions a central control program written in the python programming language runs the seawat model and reads in the concentrations at the end of each 3 month period using the flopy library bakker et al 2016 it implements the above management rules to decide for which galleries the abstraction rate will be reduced during the subsequent 3 month run the main program sequence is displayed graphically in fig 4 the heads and the concentrations at the end of a 3 month model run are used as initial conditions for the subsequent model run the program also calculates the freshwater lens volume v f and other water balance components at the end of each model run and the numbers for the entire 30 year period are recorded in spreadsheet files for post processing this on the fly processing of model outcomes requiring minimal extra computation time has the additional advantage that the size of the output files remains small as the results of 3 month simulations keep getting overwritten model simulations are denoted by a label that is composed of the rainfall scenario and abstraction regime for example model simulation s2q3 is for the responsive abstraction regime q3 applied to rainfall scenario s2 the third abstraction regime was not implemented for rainfall scenario s1 but otherwise all combinations of rainfall scenario and abstraction regime were considered resulting in eight simulations table 2 a no abstraction regime q0 was also run with each rainfall scenario bringing the total number of simulations to eleven 3 4 model output the effectiveness of management scenarios was evaluated from model outputs of 1 the freshwater lens volume v f 2 pumped water volumes q a and 3 the salinity of pumped groundwater modelled concentrations were used to determine v f which was calculated by summing saturated volumes in cells containing groundwater with ec 2 5 ms cm at the end of each stress period the effect of pumping on the size of the freshwater lens was assessed in terms of the difference between modelled freshwater volumes without abstraction v f na and with abstraction v f a as δv f v f na v f a the total abstracted volume of groundwater v abs tot was defined as 1 v abs tot 1 n q a i δ t i where q a i is the volumetric abstraction rate for month i m3 d and δti is the length of month i in days 28 δti 31 the total number of months since the start of pumping on 1 january 1987 was n 696 the model results were compared to r 12 see fig 2 which is a drought index used in kiribati s water management and drought response plans e g white et al 2008 r 12 represents the rank of the 12 month rainfall total relative to other 12 month sums for the same month for the rainfall scenario being evaluated that is an r 12 value of 100 means that the current month and previous 11 months were wetter than any other 12 month period with the same start and end months 4 results 4 1 effect of rainfall scenarios fig 5 shows the development of the abstracted water ec at the trunk main for rainfall scenarios s1 s2 and s3 july 2014 to december 2044 and for the three abstraction scenarios q1 q2 and q3 the difference in the calculated ec between the rainfall scenarios demonstrates how sensitive the lens condition is to changes in recharge this is borne out especially by the difference between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 which are identical except for the year 2027 which was much dryer in scenario s2 than in scenario s1 the effect on the salinity of the abstracted groundwater is substantial while the ec only just exceeded the critical limit of 1 5 ms cm for two brief periods of a few months in simulation s1q1 the 1 5 ms cm limit was well exceeded for a period of about 3 years in simulation s2q1 even more remarkably the exceedance of the 1 5 ms cm ec limit in 2043 and 2044 in s2q1 but not in s1q1 is the result solely of the year 2027 being drier in rainfall scenario s2 than in s1 during and after the first 3 year drought 2018 2020 the trunk main ec in simulation s3q1 reaches levels of over 2 ms cm for several consecutive months bearing in mind that the 2035 2044 sequence is the same as the 2006 2015 in scenario s3 it is interesting to note that the same 3 year drought now spanning the years 2037 2039 provokes a much stronger salinity response fig 5c ec values reach over 4 ms cm and the 1 5 ms cm threshold is exceeded for a continuous period of about 4 years and even persists during the first months of the following above average rainfall period this behaviour can be better understood by observing the temporal variability of v f which is shown in fig 6 the main difference between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 is that in scenario s1 the persistent decrease in v f during the years 2025 2031 of scenario s2 is interrupted by a circa one year period of recovery in 2027 this means that in simulation s1q1 v f only drops below a value of 4 106 m3 during the years 2030 and 2031 which is when the salinities are at their highest in simulation s2q1 on the other hand v f falls to values of just over 2 106 m3 during those same years which indicates that the lens is in a poorer condition overall and explains why the salinities rise much higher and for a much longer period of time the same reasoning applies to explain the difference in the response to the 3 year droughts in rainfall scenario s3 while the lens is in a relatively poor state during the 2018 2020 drought its condition is worse during the drought of 2037 2039 this is reflected in simulation s3q1 by much higher salinities of the abstracted water during the latter compared to the former fig 5c post et al 2018 noted that the historical pumping regime of the bonriki lens caused δv f i e the lens storage deficit to increase virtually unabated as a function of v tot indicating that the stressed system had not yet reached a new dynamic steady state the assumed future rainfall scenarios in the current study allow for an extended period of analysis of ec and v tot trends relative to that of post et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 the lens storage deficit appears to level off in all rainfall scenarios at least temporarily in 2015 soon after the 1948 june 2014 period considered by post et al 2018 in rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 there is even a reversal of the trend which indicates a phase of lens recovery that persists with a brief interruption during the years 2018 2021 until the 2025 drought sets in the wetter year of 2027 in rainfall scenario s1 leads to a brief pause of the increase δv f while δv f continues to increase unabated at a rate of approximately 0 3 106 m3 yr in scenario s2 in rainfall scenario s3 there are no prolonged periods of high enough rainfall for the lens to recover except for the periods 2023 2028 and 2043 2044 when a slight decrease of δv f can be observed for simulations s3q1 and s3q2 fig 7 the total recharge over the simulation period is larger in rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 than in scenario s3 by 8 76 106 m3 and 5 67 106 m3 respectively and as a result v f is lower on average in scenario s3 than in the other two rainfall scenarios fig 6 moreover the variability of δv f is smaller in rainfall scenario s3 than in s1 or s2 fig 7 by the end of the simulation period december 2044 the lens is in a better state in terms of v f for simulation s3q1 v f 4 59 106 m3 than for s1q1 v f 3 94 106 m3 or s2q1 v f 3 67 106 m3 the simulated ec values of simulation s3q1 are also favourable compared to those from s1q1 and s2q1 during the last two high rainfall years of the simulation even though ec values reached the highest levels of all simulations in s3q1 during the 2037 2039 drought 4 2 effect of abstraction regimes a positive effect on the salinities is achieved by the redistribution of the abstraction abstraction regime q2 between the individual galleries in all three rainfall scenarios fig 5 however contrary to the reasoning applied above to explain the differences in the ec response to droughts the lower ec values of the abstracted water at the trunk main is accompanied by a lower v f for abstraction regime q2 compared to q1 fig 6 these results show that the same total abstraction rate distributed differently across the island s wells can modify the groundwater flow regime so that the lens shrinks in size but at the same time the water supply system becomes more resilient to droughts in terms of the abstraction water salinity in other words lower salinity groundwater can be pumped from a smaller lens with alternative pumping strategies abstraction regime q3 responsive management has a positive effect on the ec of the salinity of the distributed water albeit at the expense of reduced water availability for the residents of south tarawa for simulation s2q3 the ec remains markedly lower than in simulations s2q1 or s2q2 during the 2025 2030 drought although there is still an exceedance of the 1 5 ms cm threshold from january 2029 to december 2030 with the defined management rules the model reduces abstraction between january 2029 and april 2032 the maximum decrease of the total abstraction rate is 877 m3 day i e 53 of 1660 m3 day during the period july to december 2030 it can also be seen from fig 5b that there are four one to three month intervals between 2038 and 2044 when abstraction is not at its full capacity which is because the salinity of individual galleries is above the ec threshold in the latter two of these four cases this occurred outside a warning period for simulation s3q3 the management rules result in prolonged reduction of abstraction during the years 2019 to 2021 by up to 680 m3 day and 2037 to 2040 by up to 802 m3 day see fig 5c these significant reductions are effective in keeping the ec below 1 5 ms cm during the first drought but fail to accomplish this target during the second drought there are six periods of reduced abstraction ranging in length from 3 to 6 months during the years 2029 to 2036 which do not all coincide with r 12 warning periods as expected the reduction of the freshwater volume during a drought is not as severe when abstraction is reduced simulations s2q3 and s3q3 compared to the scenario in which the galleries are redistributed simulations s2q2 and s3q2 since the duration of the reduced abstraction periods is short though the magnitude of the difference is small relative to the total reduction of v f brought about by pumping fig 6 in simulation s3q3 contrary to s3q1 or s3q2 there is a prolonged decrease of δv f during the last 8 years of the simulation period which already sets in during the 2037 2039 drought it thus seems that a reduction of the abstraction rates during droughts is effective in preventing further harm to or even restoring the health of the lens 5 discussion the investigation of coastal groundwater management including the dynamic pumping response methodology applied in this study is an improvement on previous island modelling investigations in which the pumping rates of management scenarios are pre set e g alam et al 2002 management scenarios are tested that follow the recommendation of werner et al 2011 to combine elements in flux based i e rainfall or recharge based and trigger level i e head and or salinities management specifically a rainfall based index r 12 and salinity thresholds were used as indicators for hydrological drought and freshwater lens stress respectively in abstraction regime q3 these were used in combination to initiate management responses in the form of reduced abstraction the current study adds to werner et al s 2011 evaluation of coastal groundwater management by adopting a more sophisticated modelling platform rather than the simple quasi steady state sharp interface evaluation of their case study furthermore we report on a novel approach to redistributing the pumping rates to coastal aquifers using sensitivity analysis of the pumped water salinity versus pumping rate changes comparisons between the responsive pumping regime q3 redistribution regime q2 and original design yield regime q1 reveal important insights regarding management of the bonriki lens as discussed below the results of the current research has already been taken into account by the government of kiribati who have updated their operational rules in their drought response policies aimed at maximising the availability of water without causing detrimental salinization of the freshwater lens during periods of reduced recharge the script based numerical model developed for responsive pumping scenarios requires the modeller to specify only the pre defined rules for the management scenario and all the pre and post processing of model files is fully automated this enables rapid evaluation of different management responses or variations of a response and avoids the need for tedious preparation of input and analysis of output files in the context of williams 2011 definition of adaptive management this is effectively a single cycle in what would otherwise be under an adaptive management philosophy itself a repeated cycle of re setting the management rules themselves for example the use of r 12 to designate drought periods could be adapted or the salinity thresholds for management actions might be redesigned after a period of testing of the management rules these types of scenarios are plausible adaptations to the current approach albeit stakeholder consultation would be integral to management protocol redesign and the outcomes of consultation processes are practically impossible to predict and thereby challenging to implement into responsive groundwater modelling scenarios post et al 2018 concluded that lens shrinkage is likely to continue to occur under the pumping rates of recent years the modelling results support that finding by revealing that for all three rainfall scenarios and for the three abstraction regimes it holds that while wet phases bring some relief the overall decadal trend of δv f is to increase i e lens shrinkage caused by abstraction is set to progress with time this means that the freshwater buffer zone below the abstraction galleries is expected to continue to thin increasing the sensitivity of the abstracted water salinity to droughts there are notable differences between the abstraction regimes i e original redistributed and responsive in terms of the absolute value of δv f but the rising trend is obtained in all three regimes the difference in the simulated abstraction water salinities between rainfall scenarios s1 and s2 for abstraction regime q1 testify to the long lasting consequences of a single year with lower recharge the lower recharge in 2027 in scenario s2 compared to s1 leads to higher modelled ec values 15 years later the brief recovery of the lens as indicated by the increase of v f in scenario s1 in 2027 fig 6a provides just enough buffer to maintain abstraction water salinities below the threshold during the years that follow on the other hand the continual depletion of the lens in scenario s2 during the years 2025 2031 v f in fig 6b destroys the lens buffer capacity which can only be restored when abstraction is severely reduced or during periods of extraordinarily high recharge the latter effect is exemplified by the strong recovery of ec values and v f from their extreme values in simulation s3q1 during the period from 2040 when above average r 12 values are sustained for multiple years in a row hence whilst r 12 is a predictor of short term on the order of one year salinity trends monitoring of the trends of v f and δv f based on model simulations that assimilate the latest observed rainfall and salinity data may support management in that it can provide an indicator of the long term on the order of a decade future salinity trends under a constant abstraction regime the differences between abstraction regimes q1 and q2 indicate that if higher salinities are accepted from the abstracted water the lens volume is likely to be higher because in effect some proportion of the water supplied through the trunk main is in fact brackish or seawater conversely the fresher the trunk main water the larger the relative draw of the lens storage notwithstanding the impact on discharge to the sea of alternative pumping regimes this suggests that pumping lower quality water leaves a greater provision for future extraction through larger lens storage thus island lens management could consider providing the highest tolerable salinity of groundwater rather than the freshest water possible identification of highest tolerable salinity of groundwater would need to be agreed through community and stakeholder consultation to ensure that the salinity of supplied water is acceptable for its intended purpose and considering other social economic health and environmental factors the objective of seeking to pump the highest tolerable salinity groundwater presents as a paradoxical management ideology relative to traditional approaches of seeking to extract the lowest salinity groundwater further exploration is warranted to examine the practicalities and true benefits of this management philosophy declines in freshwater storage under dynamic conditions are rarely analysed in atoll environments and other freshwater lens settings with often steady state conditions constant recharge or constant pumping assessed our modelling results reinforce the importance of using transient recharge for freshwater lens analysis griggs and peterson 1993 ghassemi et al 1999 because the bonriki lens condition appears to be highly dynamic and only by capturing the transient behaviour of v f can lens recovery during high rainfall periods and its decline under drought be properly interpreted this is critical for the assessment of responsive management groundwater abstraction systems in atoll environments are typically developed as pump and forget management strategies these approaches focus on maintaining abstraction at a constant rate over time to maintain water supply but tend to overlook the capacity of water managers to modify their operation of the system in response to its condition dynamics e g sinclair et al 2014 the long term implications of this approach is that frequently the freshwater quality decreases limiting the use of groundwater to washing bathing or toilet flushing applications and alternate and often less reliable water sources such as household rainwater harvesting are needed to meet potable water needs in this study we advocate for and test an active management regime that embraces the dynamic nature of the groundwater system different levels of salinity and the corresponding available volumes of water that a community may be prepared to accept under different climate and water security situations can be evaluated with a particular focus on the conditions experienced under drought conditions communities and groundwater custodians may be willing to accept higher salinity levels during drought periods in order to maintain a particular level of supply the current methodology allows for assessment of these sorts of trade offs including under various plausible future climate regimes the conditions that signify a return to pre drought salinity conditions following higher rainfall rates that allow for recovery of the lens can also be tested these will be significant additional factors for groundwater stakeholders and are also plausibly assessable using the current methodology the social and economic costs of maintaining an acceptable salinity or freshness of the supplied water compared with the costs of providing an alternate water source e g desalination are an important consideration the reduction of abstraction during droughts to safeguard acceptable salinity levels creates a mismatch in the supply and demand of freshwater because demand is highest and other sources of freshwater i e from rainwater tanks are lowest during drought periods in these cases the community may be willing to accept higher levels of salinity in the reticulated water for a period rather than incur the cost of desalinated water to meet the freshwater demand in addition to the supply management that we have assessed demand management can assist in abating the degradation of fresh groundwater resources during periods of lower recharge for example pre drought periods declared based on r 12 e g 25 r 12 40 can be used to alert the community and bring water restrictions into effect additionally access to potable water could be limited to strategically located and controlled standpipes this regulated access approach would not only lower demand by requiring householders to retrieve low salinity potable water from discrete locations but would also reduce potential losses from leaking household distribution systems and encourage the use of water supply from domestic wells for non potable needs such as washing and toilet flushing various other forms of demand management are possible and are essential elements in determining development and management strategies for the groundwater system this study did not consider the option of abstraction reduction during periods of ample rainfall it is conceivable though that a significant part of the demand can then be met by rainwater harvesting allowing temporary relief of the pressure on the lens reducing the abstraction when recharge is high might be an effective way to promote the recovery of the freshwater volume i e a reduction of δv f as a larger fraction of the recharge remains available to add to the storage without numbers on the rainwater storage capacity this option could not be considered in our numerical simulations yet this might constitute another form of dynamic abstraction management aimed at preserving as much of the freshwater volume as possible 6 conclusions this study provides a rare example of physically based density dependent simulation to examine possible future behaviour of an atoll island lens bonriki island kiribati subjected to high levels of abstraction in addition to traditional fixed pumping scenarios this study investigated the applicability of responsive management whereby pumping was adjusted according to aquifer conditions which were assessed from system variables that are historically monitored on bonriki island the salinity of the abstracted water was found to depend strongly on the assumed temporal distribution of groundwater recharge with relatively small differences between rainfall scenarios yielding large differences in salinity it was found that antecedent differences in recharge as far back as 15 years can lead to important differences in salinity of the pumped water during a drought because projected future rainfall and especially its temporal distribution is inherently uncertain this high sensitivity of the model outcomes forms a severe impediment to assessing the future development of the water resource and the sustainability of abstraction regimes therefore rather than forecasting future water availability using a deterministic approach modelling efforts are best aimed at developing management responses to events that are likely to occur under future conditions this has important ramifications for the interpretation of sustainable yield of freshwater lenses and water supply systems more generally the traditional construct of sustainable yield refers to the maximum amount of water that can be taken from the system without causing adverse effects which in the context of island water supply translates to an abstraction rate that is invariably related to the amount of rainfall recharge we propose a more dynamic interpretation in which the abstraction amount is time variant and depends on drought conditions and the maximum salinity a community is willing to accept perhaps a temporary degradation of the resource can be accepted in order to meet the water needs during a drought as long as the recovery during the subsequent wet phases is sufficient to ensure the long term sustainability of the water supply assessing the lens ability to supply water under likely scenarios of reduced rainfall conditions allows estimating the required capacity and costs of alternative water supply options which can be presented to the community to support the decision making process the proposed responsive management and the indicators used here can strengthen tarawa s adaptive water management process and should be evaluated and potentially modified after a period of testing this facilitates the development of optimal solutions that ensure the sustainability of the lens and that provide maximum benefit to stakeholders and the community the departure from a sustainable yield concept that is static i e fixed pumping rates in lieu of one that is more dynamic based on rainfall history and salinity thresholds entails both opportunities and risks future research could be aimed at mapping these not just for atoll islands but for water supply systems under pressure more generally the methodology to evaluate various responsive management simulations adds to the existing suite of groundwater modelling tools by exploiting the flexibility of script based numerical modelling by breaking up the simulation into a series of short duration intervals 120 intervals of 3 months duration in our case the model output after one interval can be used to decide how the model input variables must be changed for the next interval while we used the python based flopy library bakker et al 2016 in this study any programming language could be used for this purpose also the approach is easily transferrable to other applications such as the simulation of artificial storage and recovery schemes
