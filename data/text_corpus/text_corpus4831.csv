24155,epidemiological mathematical models are powerful tools for estimating the course of a pandemic and exploring different scenarios through pandemic intervention policies pips these models are commonly developed to provide decision support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner done properly these models are able to provide a safe quick and cheap solution for this challenge there are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control however in order to become applicative tools for decision making the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges efficiently define the model develop it as computer software and fit it into historical data performed efficiently one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and pips in this paper we present a critical review of models that extend the susceptible infected recovered sir model and explore the efficiency of these models their software characteristics and model performance on real world data we further provide a guide for epidemiological mathematical model development and implementation exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options lastly we outline the current trends limitations and opportunities in this field in particular we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread especially in the context of airborne diseases moreover we show that agent based simulations are preferable over partial ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size keywords agent based simulation extended sir model biomathematical modeling pandemics dynamics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction historical records show that pandemics caused significant mortality economical crises and political shifts for centuries conti 2020 in the twenty first century alone many emerging and reemerging infectious diseases threaten the human race brodeur et al 2020 globalization processes combined with social economic processes such as urbanization in the developing world which is bringing more people into denser neighborhoods have facilitated pandemic spread keeping it near constant in the near future although the advances in clinical and engineering preventing methods wu et al 2017 lederberg 1988 these diseases are often disseminated at unprecedented speed a few recent examples of such outbreaks are the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 the h1n1 influenza pandemic of 2009 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov in saudi arabia in 2012 the ebola virus in the west african region in 2014 and the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 also known as the covid 19 pandemic that caused eight million recorded death worldwide in just two years wiratsudakul et al 2018 eurosurveillance editorial team 2020 mackey and liang 2012 dea groot et al 2013 while there are many types of pandemics such as sexually transmitted diseases genuis et al 2004 quinn 1996 socially influenced behavior djillali et al 2021a b and airborne diseases domingo et al 2020 ferguson et al 2006 the group of airborne pandemics caused the most concern due to their high infection rate and unrestricted target population fernandez montero et al 2020 the airborne pandemic groups include multiple pathogens such as influenza lassa virus covid 19 nipah virus and others in addition pandemic intervention policies pips for airborne pandemics are relatively more harmful to the economy and psychological state of the population in comparison to the other types of pandemic araz et al 2012 kabir et al 2020 meltzer et al 1999 taylor et al 2008 perrin et al 2009 as such policymakers are required to be ready for outbreak events to react to them properly to serve this purpose policymakers have relied on real time and historical data gathered on a variety of epidemiological healthcare and social processes liu et al 2018 ritterman et al 2009 barclay 2008 descriptive summaries of raw data alone do not reveal the complex dynamics underlying pandemics to fill this gap epidemiological mathematical models are exploited to predict monitor and evaluate the pandemic course and the influence of pips to alter it adiga et al 2020 modeling pandemic spread and control is an interdisciplinary task obligating to comprehend not only the mathematical frameworks but also biological clinical social economic and other knowledge that influence or influenced the pandemic and pips rock et al 2014 these epidemiological mathematical models can be divided into two main groups statistical models and mechanistic models models that belong to the first group use a data driven approach without any assumptions on the dynamics while the latter group of models is based on theoretical principles that aim to explain the dynamics of the pandemic statistical models commonly use statistical and machine learning ml methods to forecast a wide range of outcomes many models that belong to this group have been developed using a wide range of methods such as auto regressive time series methods bayesian optimization techniques and recently even deep learning models desai et al 2019 ivorra et al 2020 long and ehrenfeld 2020 salgotra et al 2020 agarwal and jhajharia 2021 on the other hand mechanistic models such as the sir model uses a set of rules or processes between individuals in a population tuite et al 2020 miller 2017a berge et al 2017 miller 2017b hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with data driven ml approaches are also starting to become popular usually showing superior performance in comparison to the previous models funk et al 2018 shariful et al 2021 shen et al 2020a lazebnik and blumrosen 2022 the most popular epidemiological mathematical modeling approach is the susceptible infected recovered sir model al raeei 2020 fernández villaverde and jones 2020 ellison 2020 proposed by kermack and mckendrick 1927 the sir model assumes that the population is divided into susceptible infected and recovered individuals such that each infected individual infected on average β susceptible individuals and that infected individuals recover and become recovered at a rate γ however the sir model by itself is usually too simplistic to capture real world pandemic spread cooper et al 2020 atkeson 2020 moein et al 2021 as a result multiple extensions of the sir model have been developed to improve the sir based models expressiveness prediction accuracy and robustness rahimi et al 2021 indeed an increasing number of sir model based works are published over the last two decades on a yearly basis as shown in fig 1 one can notice a peak in 2020 which can be associated with the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic worldwide eurosurveillance editorial team 2020 these models would be kept in theory without computer software that allows both professional and non professional users to query the models on a broad spectrum of realistic scenarios wang et al 2020 jiomekong and camara 2020 maryam et al 2020 however the implementation of such models as computer simulations is not trivial since it requires the researchers to overcome several technical and computational challenges to obtain a useful tool for policymakers chumachenko et al 2018 priest et al 2021 carley et al 2006 for example fitting the model on historical data the present work aims to provide an overview of extended sir based mathematical models particularly those developed for airborne pandemics with a special focus on their implementation as computer software in addition following the presented approaches we provide a manual for new epidemiological modelers on how to develop and implement their models this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the common temporal and spatial extensions of the sir model including biological clinical economic and sociological in particular the influence of such decisions on numerical calculation or simulation implementation is discussed next section 3 review the two main approach to the extended sir based model s implementation from the point of view of a computational design and provide examples of how to fit them into historical data afterward section 4 outlines a manual for epidemiological mathematical modelers on how to develop and implement their model in section 5 we discuss the research trends current models limitations and opportunities finally section 6 concludes the work and proposes possible future work a schematic view of this structure is presented in fig 2 2 extended sir models the sir model can be extended by introducing more temporal processes that maintain the well mixture assumption of the sir model or spatial extensions that violate this assumption in the spatial extensions there are two main groups norm based and graph based spatial extensions the norm based spatial extensions assume a continuous spatial domain that obeys known physical rules up to some level while the graph based spatial extensions assume discrete and usually abstract spatial domains which also ignore physical rules in particular one can divide the graph based spatial extensions into infection graphs where individuals are the nodes of the graphs and location graphs where nodes describe locations in which the individuals are located and can move between them the temporal extensions can be roughly divided into four main groups biological clinical social and economic the biological extensions are focused on the biological processes of the pathogen such as mutation and interaction with the host s immune system the clinical extensions are focused on the clinical processes that occur due to the pathogen such as different infection severity and clinical treatment efficiency the sociological extensions are focused on the influence of information spread and decision making of individuals in the population due to the pandemic such as willingness to obey pips the economic extensions are focused on the influence of the pandemic on the workforce and its production on the population behavior during the pandemic such as introducing constraints on pips that aim to control the pandemic spread such that the economy will not crash a schematic view of possible extensions to the sir model is shown in fig 3 2 1 temporal extensions the temporal extensions are defined by the introduction or modification of existing processes in the sir model in which the well mixture assumption is not affected namely the population has more complex dynamics which are usually reflected in more epidemiological states in this section we explore four common extension strategies divided into biological clinical economic and sociological nonetheless this division is artificial since most of the time dynamics that are rooted in one category for instance economic influences or cause changes in the processes of another category like sociological 2 1 1 biological the biological extensions are associated with the dynamics related to the pathogen and its interaction with the host s immune system nisar et al 2021 proposed a fractional order sird model where d is the death state that individuals can reach after being infected i the authors study the analytical results of the basic reproduction number using the next generation matrix diekmann et al 2010 as well as its stability furthermore the authors fitted their model to data from who who 2022 about the covid 19 pandemic in china focusing on the beginning of the pandemic and on the city of wuhan the authors used an adams bashforth method wang 2013 of fractional order to find the numerical solution for the proposed model piccirillo 2021 used an seir model where e is the exposed state in which individuals are already infected by the pathogen but not infectious yet technically an infection period is added to the sir model such that infected individuals first become exposed and only after some time transformed into the infected i state the author also introduces an abstract preventive measure on the infection spread in the form of a control parameter to the infection rate usually marked by β the authors used a numerical ordinary differential equations odes solver to evaluate several scenarios of the preventive measures applied by the government validation of the model on historical data is not provided in recent years the study of multi strain pandemics is gathering popularity this popularity can be associated with the ever improved ability to analyze and distinguish pathogen strains in a timely manner for instance minayev and ferguson 2008 investigate the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for multiple pathogens the authors proposed a set of deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi strain pathogens which provide increased biological realism but assumed clinical epidemiological dynamics that hold only for a set of pathogens with cross immunity of fewer than 0 4 minayev and ferguson 2008 while of interest it means only a very limited portion of the theoretical multi strain pandemics can be analyzed using these models another example is the stochastic sirs model proposed by gordo et al 2009 which takes into consideration two strains and divides the population into sub groups according to their clinical properties the authors validated their model on the influenza pandemic in the state of new york usa between 1993 and 2006 showing promising results in a similar manner khyar and allali 2020 proposed an seir model for the covid 19 pandemic with two strains while proposing an extension to the model for multi strain dynamics as well in their model an individual can be infected only once and develop immunity to all strains khyar and allali 2020 lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2022 relaxed this assumption allowing an individual to be infected and recovered with each one of the strains while taking into consideration the order of infection which is shown to better represent actual biological dynamics cox and brokstad 2020 winer et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2020 yaqinuddin 2020 2 1 2 clinical the clinical extensions are usually associated with either introduction of new epidemiological states that are related to the original infection i state in the sir model or the division of the population into sub groups typically referred to as metapopulations in addition from the pip point of view clinical extensions are referred to the ability of the healthcare system as well as clinical facilities such as hospitals to help severely infected individuals to recover chen 2020 proposed a sir model with two levels of infection severity symptomatic and asymptomatic for the case of covid 19 the author also differs in the transmission path between the two cases in which susceptible individuals become asymptomatic infected immediately while symptomatic infected individuals first go through the exposed stage in addition each infection severity is assumed to have a unique infection and recovery rates the author also suggested a stochastic version of the proposed model by introducing a random noise to each parameter value over time a comparison between the two versions of the model has been investigated by solving the model using a numerical ode solver has been conducted but no validation of the model s performance on historical data or fitting on this data has been provided kozyreff 2021 used a sir model with hospitalized patient dynamics which is assumed to be proportional to the number of infected individuals with some delay and exponential decay in the meantime of hospitalization stay one can note that the hospitalized population does not influence the remaining epidemiological states which are expected to accurately describe the hospitalization dynamics indeed the author addressed this issue explaining that the present paper is to invoke the simplest possible model in order to exploit simple explicit formulas kozyreff 2021 they fitted their proposed model on the covid 19 pandemic for five states belgium france italy switzerland and new york city us focusing on the first three months of the pandemic in each state in practice the author used the mathematica version 8 0 1 1 https www wolfram com mathematica with the findfit and nonlinearmodelfit functions that utilize the least mean square regression method bjorck 1996 it is worth noting that while the author provided a figure to visualize the fitting results no empirical analysis has been provided which limits the ability to evaluate the model s expressiveness rost and wu 2008 studied an seir epidemic model with varying infectivity by considering the infection age of infected individuals this assumption leads to a system of differential equations with distributed infinite delay extension of this work has been proposed by bajiya et al 2021 which introduced an abstract heterogeneous population dynamics by dividing into multiple sub groups of the population and assuming known infection interactions between any two sub groups in particular bajiya et al 2021 provided a close form for the global stability of disease free equilibrium as well as endemic equilibrium the authors also empirically studied these analytical outcomes using a numerical ode solver unsurprisingly obtaining the analytically predicted results the division into age groups was also studied by bunimovich mendrazitsky and stone 2005 for polio and lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2021 for covid 19 in particular lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2021 fitted a two age group sir model on the covid 19 data for israel using a least mean square error with grid search liu et al 2006 on the parameters process showing better prediction results compared to one age group sir model for the middle of the pandemic in general and one implementing a pip that unbalances influence different age groups in the population such as the closure of schools ram and schaposnik 2021 used a stochastic multi age group sir model such that the probability of two individuals from two age groups meeting is an input to the model the authors also introduced the social distance pip such that as more people obey social distance the probability two individuals interact is reduced in a logarithmic manner the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in washington state usa by minimizing the prediction of the mean absolute error over time by the model and the three epidemiological parameters hospitalization rate icu rate among hospitalizations and mortality rate taken from ferguson et al 2020 the authors also used the pandemic state as the initial condition and the population s age distribution from the us government s public datasets ram and schaposnik 2021 lazebnik and blumrosen 2022 used a multi strain extended sirs model with nine states susceptible infected severely infected short recovered long recovered reinfected severely reinfected and deceased the authors assumed that the pandemic is associated with a pathogen with two or more strains such that there is some level of similarity between the strains as such the authors integrated knowledge from microbiology about the pharmacokinetics dynamics that occur as the host s immune system fights the pathogen namely the authors assumed that after recovering from the infection state an individual has a large number of antibodies that keep the individual immune from reinfection nevertheless the amount of antibodies is reduced over time until their amount is too small to make the individual immune from reinfection while the number of long term immune cells i e t cells and b cells are generated by the individual s body as such reinfection is possible but has a different infection and recovery rate due to the long term immune cells moreover due to the similarity between the strains antibodies as well as long term immune cells have a proportional effect on the other strains corresponding to the similarity between them the authors implemented their model using the agent based simulation approach raberto et al 2001 they implemented the proposed model for the covid 19 pandemic in the case of israel the fitting function that has been used is a variation on the mean square error such that the total prediction of all strains in each epidemiological state is compared to the historical records over time due to the lack of diversion to strains in the publicly available historical data the fitting procedure is adapted from lazebnik et al 2021b the data is divided into fitting and validation cohorts such that the fitting cohort is the first 18 months of the data and the validation cohort is the additional two months in order to evaluate the model s performance three epidemiological parameters the mean reproduction number mortality rate and severe cases hospitalization rate are computed for both the fitting and validation cohorts 2 1 3 economic the economic extensions are associated with the workforce and how they influence the infection dynamics moreover the economic dynamics commonly introduce constraints for the execution of pips implementation to make sure the damage to the economy is limited a similar approach is the introduction of a multi objective pip implementation such that the pandemic spread is minimized as well as the economic damage that usually occurs with some level of trade off between them alvarez et al 2020 used a sir model with the lockdown dynamics implemented as the number of individuals in lockdown multiplied by the lockdown effectiveness are deduced from the infection rate β in the susceptible and infection equations moreover unorthodoxly the authors assumed the death state is not part of the epidemiological state but rather the population size is reduced over time proportionally to the number of infected individuals not only that this proportion is not constant as commonly found in sird models but a function of the number of infected e g i t itself on top of that the authors introduce an economic model in which 1 the lockdown population size is limited in order to make sure some sectors would not shut down 2 individuals who are infected but not in lockdown can still produce as much as those susceptible or recovered not in lockdown and 3 lockdown individuals do not produce the authors also assumed that individuals are homogeneous in the manner that they produce at the same rate based on this model the authors aimed to find the optimal number of lockdown individuals such that the population production is maximized while the pandemic spread is minimized farboodi et al 2021 used a sird model with an economic model in their economic models the authors have taken into consideration social activity such that individuals get utility from a level of social activity in addition an individual is aware of being recovered from the disease but cannot differ from susceptible and infected states using the proposed model the authors study several types of equilibria including the laissez faire knight 1967 and social optimum scenarios krueger et al 2020 extended the model proposed by eichenbaum et al 2020 by combining the sird model and allowing individuals in the population to decide at each point in time the amount of their consumption of goods the individuals have a budget that is based on their salary from being employed nonetheless the availability of employment is dependent on the epidemiological state of the population and in turn influences the transmission rate the authors aim to capture the interplay between infection dynamics and the demand side or the supply side however the authors were not able to analyze both of them simultaneously which is further highlighting the importance of sectoral heterogeneity shami and lazebnik 2022 considered a multi strain pandemic with a seihrd h hospitalized model with a mutation mechanism driven by simple modeling of a random mutation process occurring during infection of individuals in the population the authors included a non linear economic model that takes into consideration the direct cost of the pandemic in the form of hospitalization costs as well as costs associated with dead individuals and the cost to manage a pandemic in the form of testing for the emergence of new strains throughout the mutation process they trained a reinforcement learning agent to manage the intervention policy over time showing its effectiveness on real world data 2 1 4 sociological the sociological extensions are associated with the natural processes that happen in the population regardless of the pandemic as well as changes in the population s behavior as a result of the execution of pips adamu et al 2019 proposed a sir model where the susceptible s is growing at a constant rate b due to the birth of new individuals to the population and all the epidemiological states losing individuals in a constant rate c due to natural death i e unrelated to the pandemic over time the authors show that the values of b and c strongly change the long term projection of the pandemic furthermore the authors investigated the influence of these parameters on the stability of the asymptotic state showing a phase transition where c b c b and c b as such one can conclude that taking into consideration the natural growth in the population and death unrelated to the pandemic has an influence on the long term dynamics of relatively large population size as such for a short term simulation e g hours days and even weeks one can avoid these processes to obtain a simpler model without a significant loss of accuracy shanta and buswas 2020 also included birth and natural death rates and added a media awareness component to study the impact of media awareness programs that are covered by media during the disease period formally the authors introduced to the sir model two new states media awareness and isolation which operates as the pip following the media awareness such that the media awareness grows proportionally to the number of infected individuals while decaying over time and the number of isolated individuals grows proportionally to the media awareness and the susceptible individuals while decaying over time as well the authors fitted the model on the covid 19 pandemic using reported data from yang and wang 2020 rong et al 2020 while the media awareness parameters values are assumed the authors solved their model using the ode45 numerical ode solver available in matlab 2 2 https www mathworks com products matlab html li et al 2020 used an extended seir model that integrates the mask wearing pip to study the covid 19 pandemic spread the model takes into consideration asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals the public awareness of mask usage as a function of the pandemic spread mask generation by the market and several levels of mask quality based on commercial or homemade production specifically the authors highlighted that the percentage of people wearing a mask during a pandemic depends on several factors such that culture and social awareness of a pandemic which integrated into the model as the proportion of mask wearing individuals from the population proportional to the change in the number of infected individuals 2 2 spatial extensions the spatial extensions are defined by the introduction of dynamics that override the well mixture assumption 3 3 the well mixture assumption assumes that for each point in time t the probability two random individuals in the population would interact is uniformly distributed of the sir model by making the probability that an individual would interact with other individuals non uniform in this section we explore two common extension strategies graph based and norm based spatial extensions however some models integrate the spatial dynamics into the temporal one by introducing a new epidemiological state as well as modifying the model s parameters to be based on spatial data for instance berke et al 2022 presented an seir model that integrates mobile data obtained from the mobile phone location service to approximate the movement of the population the model has been implemented for the covid 19 pandemic in andorra with comprehensive datasets that include telecoms data covering 100 of mobile subscribers in the country and a serology testing program that more than 90 of the population participants the authors assume three versions of the model where the infection rate over time β t is either constant i e regular seir model exponential to the average number of trips or exponential to the number of trips with the entrance of additional individuals from outside the country in addition the authors assumed that only a portion of the recovered individuals is reported with some fixed delay and reflected in the historical records the authors used a daily number of infected individuals over five months such that the first half was used for training and the remaining half was used for validation of the model the model s parameters were obtained by minimizing the negative log likelihood using the l bfgs b method byrd et al 1995 for the validation phase they used the median absolute percentage error mape over cumulative estimates as proposed by friedman et al 2021 unsurprisingly the authors reported the version of the model that integrates mobility outperforms on average the one that does not on the validation data 2 2 1 graph based infection networks a stochastic sir model with a spatial graph based component is constructed as follows each individual in the population is a node in the graph that is associated with one of the three epidemiological states and connected to some other nodes if a susceptible node is connected to an infected node it has a non negative probability to become infected after some time each node infected node becomes a recovered node almost all infection network epidemiological models start with these settings masuda and holme 2017 however after this agreed common ground models start to differ from one another by the graph constriction methods as well as the epidemiological logic ellison 2020 provided an extended review of infection networks based on the sir model e g without other temporal extensions the author started with the homogeneous sir model showing that a fully connected infection graph that is also static in time i e the edges of the graph do not change over time obtains similar behavior to the classical sir model afterward heterogeneous sir models with uniform matching and homophily are investigated showing significantly different results where the latter is better suited for realistic social networks mcauley and leskovec 2012 the authors highlighted that this approach is somewhat problematic for applicative usage due to the complexity of fitting the model for realistic pandemics and since this representation is relatively sensitive to the topology of the graph which may cause an overestimation of the difficulty of controlling an epidemic as well as the damage incurred in reaching herd immunity for even minor fitting error holme 2021 studied the implementation of the agent based infection graph representation the author started with the same common settings see section 2 2 1 and proposed an algorithm for the construction of infection network models in order to balance realism and computational efficiency first all nodes in the graph are initialized as susceptible second the algorithm runs through the contacts in increasing order of time and if there is a contact between a susceptible and infectious node then infect the susceptible node i e transform to the infected epidemiological state with a pre defined probability in such a case sample a personal recovery duration from an exponential distribution and transform the node into the recovered epidemiological state when needed finally the simulation is terminated when there are no infectious nodes furthermore the authors also suggest a better performing simulation approach based on the event driven algorithm proposed by kiss et al 2017 they show that on realistic networks the improved algorithm outperforms the naive approach both via complexity analysis and empirical experiments in particular their experiments show that for low infection rate 0 1 and short recovery duration 10 time steps the event driven algorithm is at least ten times faster location networks bognanni et al 2020 developed a model of the joint determination of epidemiological and economic variables in epidemic settings they called econ sir the authors used an agent based representation of the sir model in which agents are able to make economic decisions based on the state of the economy these decisions influence the economy which has a feedback loop with the pandemic spread rate of interest the authors proposed an enriched version of the model to tackle the unique characteristics of the covid 19 pandemic including other extensions and a spatial component they assume the initial version occurs on a single node of a graph and allow individuals to move between nodes location freely given information about the infection risk in each node the agents perceived infection risk can be different from the true value based on inaccurate information they obtain the implementation and fitting of the spatial component of the extended version of the model are based on a panel of daily county level observations that included infection cases death cases point of interest visits and hours worked the authors used the log likelihood minimization criteria for the model s parameters on the node level while minimizing the cumulative error of the entire graph over time measured on four signals obtained from the model s prediction goel and sharma 2020 proposed a location graph based sir model in which each node of the graph is a location where a subset of the population is located in their proposed model each susceptible individual can be infected by infected individuals located in the same node local infection or by infected individuals visiting its node from neighbor nodes global infection the authors introduced social connectivity indicating the average number of individuals that move between nodes and therefore cause global infection the authors tried to fit the proposed model to the covid 19 pandemic in estonia but obtained poor results since the model is too simplistic nevertheless one can notice the solid mathematical ground for spatial pips evaluation like social distance reduced social connectivity and even community based lockdowns 2 2 2 norm based viguerie et al 2021 developed a partial differential equation pde representation of the seird model in which the spatial component is defined on a continuous two dimensional domain the model also takes into consideration the natural birth and death rates division of the infection and recovery rates for both asymptomatic and symptomatic unconformably the authors do not divide the infection i into two states and diffusion parameters respectively corresponding to the different population groups moreover a portion of the exposed individuals does not develop symptoms and transform directly into the recovered epidemiological state the spatial movement over a large population is described by an inhomogeneous random walk which in the limit tends to a second order differential operator viguerie et al 2021 salsa 2009 the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in lombardy italy focusing on the first half year of the pandemic they used a finite element spatial discretization benaroya and rehak 1988 and the backward euler method biswas et al 2013 for time integration and solve each time step fully implicitly with a picard iteration for stability huang et al 1996 the resulting linear systems are solved by the gmres algorithm using a jacobi preconditioner chen and shen 2006 milner and zhao 2008 proposed a sir model with a one dimensional finite and continuous spatial domain obtaining a pde representation in their model susceptible individuals move away from the previous location of the infection and all individuals move away from overcrowded regions following diffusion dynamics the authors numerically solve the model for different diffusion coefficients resulting in either hyperbolic or parabolic second order pde using the runge kutta discontinuous galerkin method rkdg method cockburn and shu 2001 for the temporal component and the finite element method benaroya and rehak 1988 for the spatial component using this numerical calculation approach the authors show that the mse and mae errors reduced linearly to the number of partitions for both the one dimensional and two dimensional cases paeng and lee 2017 proposed a sir model where individuals are assumed to move stochastically within a small fixed radius rather than a random walk the authors proposed continuous and discrete sir models that show spatial distributions which differ by the radius value they show that the propagation speed and size of an epidemic depend on the population density and the infectious radius 3 model implementation once the mathematical model is designed researchers are faced with the challenge of implementing it like computer software one is able to divide the process of implementing a mathematical model into three main tasks a simulation approach fitting procedure on historical data and extraction of high level epidemiological properties in the following section a review of how several researchers overcome these challenges with their strength and limitations are provided 3 1 simulation approach there are two main simulation approaches ode based numerical calculation and agent based simulation the first is using numerical algorithms to approximate the analytical solution of ode and pde based representation of the sir model the latter approach takes advantage of the unique representation of the sir model which represents the number of individuals in each epidemiological state over time and simulated the interactions between the individuals in the population to match the global sir dynamics it is worth stating that even for the classical sir model without any extensions the predictions of the numerical calculation and agent based simulation are highly differing connell et al 2009a b this phenomenon occurs with other complex social systems simulations as well macal 2010 one can argue the methods are complementary to one another since the advantages of one method are usually the limitation of the other the numerical computations simulation approach is usually used either with a norm based spatial component or no spatial component at all infection graphs by definition do not characterize by odes location based graphs result in the multiplication of the extended sir equations for each one of the nodes and dynamic construction of additional equations to capture the movement between nodes which results in an extremely large number of odes that make the approximation error grow over time and the overall computation unstable in particular for realistic location graph based sir models modern numerical ode solvers are not able to compute the results in a feasible time and therefore impractical however for the cases in which numerical computation is fitting it has two advantages first the computation time is independent of the population size o 1 for a population of size n which allows computing the dynamics of a large population such as one found in the scope of cities or countries second the implementation is relatively simple and there are multiple open source ode solvers available andersson et al 2015 stadter et al 2021 pastawa et al 2020 to name a few ketcheson et al developed a package for the design of numerical ode solvers in matlab if one wishes to introduce modifications to existing ode solvers given the need ketcheson et al 2020a this is in addition to a large number of built in matlab ode and pde solving methods rackauckas 2018 python is gathering popularity in the last two decades and ode solver packages become increasingly available for it as well ketcheson et al 2020b dahlgren 2018 another package named dynamicalsystems jl is designed on the julia programming language which is considered a novel and promising programming language for efficient numerical computation and relatively easy to use bezanson et al 2017 datseris 2018 on the other hand agent based simulation extends the numerical computation method for all temporal and spatial extensions discussed in section 2 in practice the agent based simulation approach allows describing local interactions between agents in three ways in order to obtain global behavior spontaneous interactions interactions between individuals and interactions of an individual and the environment the first group includes interactions that usually depend on time for example the transformation from the infection epidemiological state to the recovery after γ time steps the interactions between individuals are often the most intuitive ones and include interactions between two or more individuals that change the state of at least one of them for instance an infected individual infects a susceptible individual after physical contact lastly interactions between individuals and the environment can influence the decisions and the state of the agents throughout the underacted change of state for a global or local element an example can be a central economy that defines constraints for policymakers in applying pips that can influence the pandemic spread this economy at each point in time is defined by the overall interactions with the individuals with it and each following step in time influences the conditions that might define their next state two of the main advantages of agent based simulations are the easy implementation of heterogeneous behavior and the introduction of the decision making process these two additions allow the simulation of complex dynamics that better capture the real dynamics that happen in nature on the flip side agent based simulations are computationally expensive in comparison with the numerical computation approach first the naive and the most broad used implementation of the agent based simulation is asymptotically linear to the size of the population moreover heterogeneity in the population makes the simulation stochastic as such in order to obtain statistically significant results one is ordinarily required to run the simulation multiple times besides the introduction of the decision making process generates a set of new difficulties in the simulation such that is the decision making is optimal based on what data an agent makes a decision and what is the decision making model to name a few these questions are not in the scope of this review but one should take them into consideration when using this approach a comparison between the two approaches divided into the eight discussed properties is provided in table 1 3 2 fitting historical data the implementation of the fitting procedure can take multiple shapes and sizes mainly influenced by the simulation approach one chooses nonetheless these procedures have several properties in common they all used the model historical data of some dynamics that can be computed using the model and an optimization search algorithm that can change a set of parameters in the model to make it more similar to the historical data indeed roberty and de araujo 2021 used a sir model with data about the evolution of the covid 19 pandemic compiled by the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering the authors used an ode based numerical calculation to solve the model the authors used the newton raphson optimization algorithm lindstrom and bates 1988 on the mean absolute error mae between the historical number of recovered individuals and the one predicted by the model over time this approach is feasible as the authors take advantage of the fact that it is relatively easy to get an analytical description of the number of recovered individuals over time r t from the classical sir model in addition the authors used ridge regression repeating the same method but also normalizing the mae value using a moving average of 14 days hoerl and kennard 1970 the author provided their software as open access written in python version 3 7 roberty and de araujo 2021 the proposed approach and the corresponding software provide a simple but effective fitting procedure for the ode based simulation approach that said the method the authors proposed will be extremely hard to utilize for an even slightly more complex model where the identification and extraction of a single parameter s formula for the optimization process is not feasible ambrosio and aziz alaoui 2020 used a sir model with covid 19 data for the month of march 2020 in new york ny and new jersey nj states the authors used the data reported in the news 4 4 https www nytimes com article coronavirus county data us html action click module spotlight pgtype homepage and assumed the number of individuals in ny is n 19453556 based on the available data from 2019 reported by the usa census bureau 5 5 https www census gov the authors taking into consideration the historical recorded number are probably underestimating the actual number of infected individuals due to unreported infection cases by normalizing the recorded number to be just 10 from the real historical number based on infected to tested positive rate in the same time frame and location the authors used a trial and error approach allowing for each parameter to obtain different values over time while trying to minimize the model s total infected individuals over the period compared to the same recorded value moreover the authors proposed a spatial temporal extension of the sir model taking a two node graph based spatial model for ny and nj and the transformation rate of individuals between these two cities the fitting method remains the same for the extended version of the model as the spatial dynamics are formally represented as additional three equations to the ode based representation of the sir model lazebnik et al 2021b used a spatio temporal two age group sird model such that adults are divided into working and non working groups and a three node line graph as the spatial component the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in israel in order to fit the model on historical data the authors first approximated the initial conditions of their model based on the best available data at the time of the initial condition of the model the israeli central bureau of statistics 2020a b 2017 who 2022 afterward the authors defined a mean square error loss function based on the three infection and dead states of the model compared to historical data using this loss function the authors used the gradient descent haskell 1944 algorithm by computing the symmetric difference quotient numerical derivative mercer 2014 for each one of the model s parameters to get the numerical gradient for the point in the parameter space this process was repeated until the gradient s norm was smaller than a pre defined threshold this process was repeated multiple times 1000 such that the initial condition was taken at random using the monte carlo method liu et al 2000 and the parameter s values that minimize the loss function 4 develop your model this section provides a high level guide for new and experienced modelers that are interested in developing their own epidemiological mathematical model that extends the sir model and implements it as computer software since there is a wide diversity of modeling options and even more implementation methods and practices in this section we would use the object oriented programming oop approach with the popular python programming language srinath 2017 in addition we would assume one is interested in empirical results rather than analytical ones and as such focus on the accuracy of the model rather than simplicity for analytical analysis hence we first outline how one would pick the right extensions for the sir model model scope state of the pandemic and available data afterward we discuss several important software implementation details 4 1 construct your extended sir model the construction of one s extended sir model should start with getting familiar with the biological clinical economic and sociological settings as well as the pandemic state and duration of interest consider you are given the task to model the spread of influenza in your local school building in the course of several weeks just before winter begins and the number of influenza patients starts to increase furthermore you are requested to evaluate the effectiveness of asking only staff to wear masks during their entire stay in the school the attentive reader would immediately notice that the mini pandemic is not yet arrived so the state of the pandemic is just the beginning and the duration of interest is several weeks more importantly we are interested in only a small size population i e the students and staff visiting the school following this example it is immediately noticeable that taking into consideration the natural birth and death in the population is redundant since in the course of a few weeks these values would be so small that their influence on the pandemic spread would be insignificant a borderline but still intuitive decision would be to add the exposed and death states a quick review of the literature iuliano et al 2018 would reveal that the exposed phase in which individuals are already infected but not yet infectious is common in influenza while the mortality rate in the last several decades is extremely low thus including the exposed e epidemiological state would be appropriate while adding the death state d is less important moreover as the dynamics occur in a single building one can and should introduce a spatial component to the model here the availability of the data plays a role if no spatial data is available one would have to use the well mixture assumption nevertheless as more data is available more complex spatial models become available imagine a list of historical interactions available between any two individuals in the population using this data one can extract the probability of each pair wise interaction in the population thus an infection graph can be a decent spatial model on the other hand it would be hard to impossible to obtain such data as an alternative visiting the school and marking the rooms and the average location of the population over time is more realistic lazebnik and alexi 2022 given this data one can use a location graph for the spatial component on top of that one can take another step further during the school visit and capture a 3d scan of the building which would allow a highly detailed norm based spatial model dai and zhao 2020 kwon et al 2020 peng and jimenez 2021 shen et al 2020b now focusing on the pip part of the assignment one can conclude that a division of the population into two sub populations stuff and not stuff i e students is required so the model would be able to differ between the two groups in the pip settings at this point the modeler would probably ask itself if further division can be beneficial one option is a division by age group another option could be a division by sex another check in the clinical literature would reveal that such differences are existing for both different sex and age nonetheless these are relatively small as such the modeler can decide if to take them into consideration or not based on the initial condition an extreme but easy to analyze case would be a 95 female and 5 male school in which using the knowledge e g parameter values of female centric clinical dynamics would be more appropriate than the average in the population or even male centric one assuming such data is available in the same manner we can evaluate the advantage of including the other extensions reviewed in section 2 to the effectiveness and relevance of the model these extensions are summarized in table 2 with the most generic feasibility criteria and implementation class for an agent based simulation approaches further discussed in section 4 2 this is not a full list of possible extensions for the sir model but of the most popular ones in addition modelers are encouraged to develop new extensions for their unique cases providing more processes to known dynamics for example biological or integrating new disciplines for instance psychology concluding the provided example when one aims to develop an extended sir model a review of the aspects that influence the pandemic spread as well as the task scope are the keys to properly choosing the relevant extensions of the sir model of note some would try to take the largest and most sophisticated model in order to take as many processes into consideration thinking it would work well for the private case of interest while this thinking process is true in theory it is inferior to the proposed approach as such large models usually require much more data for proper configuration more computation power and are less stable compared to a dedicated model vytla et al 2021 4 2 software implementation details once the model is well defined we assume a modeler wants to implement it as computer software as mentioned in section 2 2 there are two main approaches for implementing extended sir based models numerical calculation of ode or pde based models or agent based simulations the implementation of numerical ode solvers is hard and out of the scope of this review we swiftly state that such solvers are required to comply with multiple objectives such as small errors fast computation time and robustness as a result it is considered to be a hard task to properly develop a new solver with superior properties hence the modeler who is interested in epidemiological mathematical models rather than numerical computation should probably use one of the many available solvers for a recent review please see byakatonda 2020 on the other hand the implementation of agent based simulation is more straightforward when one is breaking the simulation into the three types of interactions an individual in the population might have spontaneous individual individual and individual environment interactions in practice it is convenient to represent an agent we would use agent and individual in this section interchangeably as a timed finite state machine with or without the ability to make decisions that change its other agents or the environment s state this logic can define multiple types of agents each one belonging to a different sub population and as such single agents and multiple inherent agent classes can be useful moreover as often querying subsets of the population or even the entire population is needed in such models a population class provides a good solution to this need in addition one can use a spatial class that describes the spatial component of the model this approach is useful for the location graph based and norm based types of the spatial component while the infection graph model is better to be developed as a property of the agent and population classes since spatial implementation can highly differ especially for the norm based spatial approach it is recommended that all the logic of the spatial component would be wrapped with this single class in particular how it influences the population s state and vice versa this way one can experiment with different spatial components with minimal change to the software structure a similar logic can be applied to the pandemic class which holds the logic of the used extended sir model and the pip class which contains the logic of the pips configuration and usage these four components are the building blocks of the simulator and as such can be used by utilized by a simulator class this class is responsible for the simulation including computing and recording the change in both the population s and environment s states over simulation steps an instance of this class can be generated by three main processes first a manual configuration a random configuration with some requirements for example used in sensitivity analysis and a result of fitting on historical data all three approaches can be methods of a simulatorgenerator class finally as the modeler and other users would like to study and analyze multiple configurations of the simulator an interface class we named analyzer can be used to externalize a list of possible simulation configurations generated by the simulatorgenerator class after one or more simulations are computed the analyzer can take advantage of a ploter class and a report class to return a report with the asked data with the relevant figures and schemes in particular the report class can be inherent to produce a wide spectrum of report types each one associated with one or more analysis types of the simulation a unified modeling language uml graph of the proposed structure with complimented technical details is provided in fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 research trends as models size is enlarging to take into consideration a growing number of processes aiming to more accurately capture pandemic spread dynamics it is becoming harder up to infeasible to obtain theoretical results for example it is impossible to obtain a radical based formula for the basic reproduction number r 0 for a multi strain sir based model with more than two strains lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2022 using the well established next generation matrix method diekmann et al 2010 thus a larger number of analysis methods move from analyzing odes and dynamic system approaches into stochastic processes and functional analysis lazebnik et al 2021a cortés et al 2020 hamra et al 2013 these methods have shown promising results in different dynamic systems such as astronomy biology economics etc sharma 2017 nix and vose 1992 bojanic 2021 privault 2018 shaikhet 1996 therefore it is not a surprise that these methods gaining popularity in the epidemiological context when the models become too complex to model and analyzed using their classical ode representation in addition as single type pips are repeatably shown to be too simplistic and obtain sub optimal results for multi objective settings models that allow to combine or even generate pips on the fly becoming more popular these models provide a more reach configuration space that policymakers can explore and as such can be considered a more useful and reliable tool indeed multiple epidemiological simulators allow the combination of several pips while also allowing some space to explore several different extensions of the sir model lorch et al 2020 bhatele et al 2017 cota and ferreira 2017 5 2 limitations the current models are facing a catch 22 situation on the one hand simple models are of interest as these are more explainable and require less data thus it makes them more appealing for policymakers to use selbst and barocas 2018 bertossi and geerts 2020 deeks 2019 on the other hand these models are usually poorly performed for even a slightly different usage from the original one the researchers aimed to address similar issues with the models performance are taking place for long periods of time a similar but opposite situation occurs for complex models that show better prediction accuracy on a larger set of configurations these models are usually not interoperable and require a lot and reach data that is commonly unavailable or too noisy to serve as legitimate training fitting data as such the usefulness of these models is often limited by the amount and diversity of the available data furthermore sir based and other epidemiological models experiencing hardships in predicting the course of the pandemic across locations and time frames since the dynamics they aim to capture are consistently changing due to active intervention of policymakers a social and economic adaption of the population and stochastic changes in the pathogen s behavior a similar issue is commonly addressed in the ml based model and called concept drift gama et al 2014 karnick et al 2008 aztiria et al 2012 hoens et al 2012 lazebnik et al 2022 however currently the concept drift challenge is remaining mainly unaddressed for ml based models and the situation is even worse for the case of sir based models xu and wilson 2021 lima et al 2022 unfortunately there is no clear direction to tackle this challenge and further investigation is required leaving an open and promising door for future research to accomplish from the proposed review a more technically fundamental issue in the way authors showcase their work is revealed most of the extended sir based papers show the performance of their models on historical data claiming to fit it on the historical data and even fewer show a validation using this data in either case it seems that a significant number of papers do not outline in detail the fitting and validation procedure as well as the data used for these two processes this phenomenon makes it practically impossible to reproduce the proclaimed results and more importantly compare new models with these models or even build upon them 5 3 opportunities since current epidemiological mathematical models are focused on a narrow field of interest to capture the unique properties and complex dynamics of each case individually a multi scale ensemble model that takes into consideration the interactions between these models can capture more accurately the global course of the pandemic while keeping the local smaller dynamics accurate infeasible computation resources for example one can combine a norm based spatial model in the scale of a single room lazebnik and alexi 2023 peng et al 2020 to a location graph based spatial model for an airborne pandemic spread in a building lazebnik and alexi 2022 this way one can exploit the high accuracy of a norm based model without the need to simulate a large size spatial location since the latter is abstracted by the graph based model another promising line of work is the usage of ml and agent based simulations together to simulate an extremely heterogeneous population this approach can be used to integrate a personalized decision making model for each agent in the population allowing it to make a unique set of actions based on feedback from the environment jang et al 2018 wang and usher 2005 jalalimanesh et al 2017 alexi et al 2023 these actions would alter the course of the pandemic and allow a more realistic representation of reality in particular one can investigate the influence of the online information consumed by individuals in the population over time from multiple sources television social media ads etc on their willingness to obey pips and therefore on the course of the pandemic 6 conclusion the paper discusses a few important epidemiological mathematical extended sir models focusing on airborne pandemics these models have been used by policymakers and public health officials in the recent covid 19 and other pandemics to assess the evolution of the pandemic design and analyze pips and study various what if scenarios we show how those modelers face the challenges related to properly developing these models and converting them into applicative software tools one conclusion that can be drawn from this review is that modelers need to be more transparent in the description of their models by clearly stating the implementation details of their model the fitting procedure and the data used in addition a more detailed sensitivity and stability quantification of the proposed models is advised allowing us to draw the limitation of usage for each model a future review can therefore focus on the current state of the art sensitivity and stability analysis methods with how to successfully implement them in a new model from a more applicative point of view mathematicians and engineers are advised to collaborate with social and natural science researchers aiming to reveal new promising extensions to the sir model hopefully making it even more accurate and expressive funding this research did not receive any specific grant

24155,epidemiological mathematical models are powerful tools for estimating the course of a pandemic and exploring different scenarios through pandemic intervention policies pips these models are commonly developed to provide decision support tools for policymakers who are forced to make difficult decisions in a timely manner done properly these models are able to provide a safe quick and cheap solution for this challenge there are numerous types of mathematical models for epidemiological disease spread and control however in order to become applicative tools for decision making the modelers of these models are required to overcome three computational challenges efficiently define the model develop it as computer software and fit it into historical data performed efficiently one can use the obtained tool to explore possible scenarios and pips in this paper we present a critical review of models that extend the susceptible infected recovered sir model and explore the efficiency of these models their software characteristics and model performance on real world data we further provide a guide for epidemiological mathematical model development and implementation exploring several modeling approaches and their respective implementation options lastly we outline the current trends limitations and opportunities in this field in particular we find that the spatial properties of a model play a critical role in its accuracy and ability to explain historical pandemic spread especially in the context of airborne diseases moreover we show that agent based simulations are preferable over partial ordinary differential solvers when considering a highly realistic pandemic model or focusing on a relatively small population size keywords agent based simulation extended sir model biomathematical modeling pandemics dynamics data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction historical records show that pandemics caused significant mortality economical crises and political shifts for centuries conti 2020 in the twenty first century alone many emerging and reemerging infectious diseases threaten the human race brodeur et al 2020 globalization processes combined with social economic processes such as urbanization in the developing world which is bringing more people into denser neighborhoods have facilitated pandemic spread keeping it near constant in the near future although the advances in clinical and engineering preventing methods wu et al 2017 lederberg 1988 these diseases are often disseminated at unprecedented speed a few recent examples of such outbreaks are the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars in 2003 the h1n1 influenza pandemic of 2009 the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov in saudi arabia in 2012 the ebola virus in the west african region in 2014 and the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 also known as the covid 19 pandemic that caused eight million recorded death worldwide in just two years wiratsudakul et al 2018 eurosurveillance editorial team 2020 mackey and liang 2012 dea groot et al 2013 while there are many types of pandemics such as sexually transmitted diseases genuis et al 2004 quinn 1996 socially influenced behavior djillali et al 2021a b and airborne diseases domingo et al 2020 ferguson et al 2006 the group of airborne pandemics caused the most concern due to their high infection rate and unrestricted target population fernandez montero et al 2020 the airborne pandemic groups include multiple pathogens such as influenza lassa virus covid 19 nipah virus and others in addition pandemic intervention policies pips for airborne pandemics are relatively more harmful to the economy and psychological state of the population in comparison to the other types of pandemic araz et al 2012 kabir et al 2020 meltzer et al 1999 taylor et al 2008 perrin et al 2009 as such policymakers are required to be ready for outbreak events to react to them properly to serve this purpose policymakers have relied on real time and historical data gathered on a variety of epidemiological healthcare and social processes liu et al 2018 ritterman et al 2009 barclay 2008 descriptive summaries of raw data alone do not reveal the complex dynamics underlying pandemics to fill this gap epidemiological mathematical models are exploited to predict monitor and evaluate the pandemic course and the influence of pips to alter it adiga et al 2020 modeling pandemic spread and control is an interdisciplinary task obligating to comprehend not only the mathematical frameworks but also biological clinical social economic and other knowledge that influence or influenced the pandemic and pips rock et al 2014 these epidemiological mathematical models can be divided into two main groups statistical models and mechanistic models models that belong to the first group use a data driven approach without any assumptions on the dynamics while the latter group of models is based on theoretical principles that aim to explain the dynamics of the pandemic statistical models commonly use statistical and machine learning ml methods to forecast a wide range of outcomes many models that belong to this group have been developed using a wide range of methods such as auto regressive time series methods bayesian optimization techniques and recently even deep learning models desai et al 2019 ivorra et al 2020 long and ehrenfeld 2020 salgotra et al 2020 agarwal and jhajharia 2021 on the other hand mechanistic models such as the sir model uses a set of rules or processes between individuals in a population tuite et al 2020 miller 2017a berge et al 2017 miller 2017b hybrid models that combine mechanistic models with data driven ml approaches are also starting to become popular usually showing superior performance in comparison to the previous models funk et al 2018 shariful et al 2021 shen et al 2020a lazebnik and blumrosen 2022 the most popular epidemiological mathematical modeling approach is the susceptible infected recovered sir model al raeei 2020 fernández villaverde and jones 2020 ellison 2020 proposed by kermack and mckendrick 1927 the sir model assumes that the population is divided into susceptible infected and recovered individuals such that each infected individual infected on average β susceptible individuals and that infected individuals recover and become recovered at a rate γ however the sir model by itself is usually too simplistic to capture real world pandemic spread cooper et al 2020 atkeson 2020 moein et al 2021 as a result multiple extensions of the sir model have been developed to improve the sir based models expressiveness prediction accuracy and robustness rahimi et al 2021 indeed an increasing number of sir model based works are published over the last two decades on a yearly basis as shown in fig 1 one can notice a peak in 2020 which can be associated with the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic worldwide eurosurveillance editorial team 2020 these models would be kept in theory without computer software that allows both professional and non professional users to query the models on a broad spectrum of realistic scenarios wang et al 2020 jiomekong and camara 2020 maryam et al 2020 however the implementation of such models as computer simulations is not trivial since it requires the researchers to overcome several technical and computational challenges to obtain a useful tool for policymakers chumachenko et al 2018 priest et al 2021 carley et al 2006 for example fitting the model on historical data the present work aims to provide an overview of extended sir based mathematical models particularly those developed for airborne pandemics with a special focus on their implementation as computer software in addition following the presented approaches we provide a manual for new epidemiological modelers on how to develop and implement their models this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides an overview of the common temporal and spatial extensions of the sir model including biological clinical economic and sociological in particular the influence of such decisions on numerical calculation or simulation implementation is discussed next section 3 review the two main approach to the extended sir based model s implementation from the point of view of a computational design and provide examples of how to fit them into historical data afterward section 4 outlines a manual for epidemiological mathematical modelers on how to develop and implement their model in section 5 we discuss the research trends current models limitations and opportunities finally section 6 concludes the work and proposes possible future work a schematic view of this structure is presented in fig 2 2 extended sir models the sir model can be extended by introducing more temporal processes that maintain the well mixture assumption of the sir model or spatial extensions that violate this assumption in the spatial extensions there are two main groups norm based and graph based spatial extensions the norm based spatial extensions assume a continuous spatial domain that obeys known physical rules up to some level while the graph based spatial extensions assume discrete and usually abstract spatial domains which also ignore physical rules in particular one can divide the graph based spatial extensions into infection graphs where individuals are the nodes of the graphs and location graphs where nodes describe locations in which the individuals are located and can move between them the temporal extensions can be roughly divided into four main groups biological clinical social and economic the biological extensions are focused on the biological processes of the pathogen such as mutation and interaction with the host s immune system the clinical extensions are focused on the clinical processes that occur due to the pathogen such as different infection severity and clinical treatment efficiency the sociological extensions are focused on the influence of information spread and decision making of individuals in the population due to the pandemic such as willingness to obey pips the economic extensions are focused on the influence of the pandemic on the workforce and its production on the population behavior during the pandemic such as introducing constraints on pips that aim to control the pandemic spread such that the economy will not crash a schematic view of possible extensions to the sir model is shown in fig 3 2 1 temporal extensions the temporal extensions are defined by the introduction or modification of existing processes in the sir model in which the well mixture assumption is not affected namely the population has more complex dynamics which are usually reflected in more epidemiological states in this section we explore four common extension strategies divided into biological clinical economic and sociological nonetheless this division is artificial since most of the time dynamics that are rooted in one category for instance economic influences or cause changes in the processes of another category like sociological 2 1 1 biological the biological extensions are associated with the dynamics related to the pathogen and its interaction with the host s immune system nisar et al 2021 proposed a fractional order sird model where d is the death state that individuals can reach after being infected i the authors study the analytical results of the basic reproduction number using the next generation matrix diekmann et al 2010 as well as its stability furthermore the authors fitted their model to data from who who 2022 about the covid 19 pandemic in china focusing on the beginning of the pandemic and on the city of wuhan the authors used an adams bashforth method wang 2013 of fractional order to find the numerical solution for the proposed model piccirillo 2021 used an seir model where e is the exposed state in which individuals are already infected by the pathogen but not infectious yet technically an infection period is added to the sir model such that infected individuals first become exposed and only after some time transformed into the infected i state the author also introduces an abstract preventive measure on the infection spread in the form of a control parameter to the infection rate usually marked by β the authors used a numerical ordinary differential equations odes solver to evaluate several scenarios of the preventive measures applied by the government validation of the model on historical data is not provided in recent years the study of multi strain pandemics is gathering popularity this popularity can be associated with the ever improved ability to analyze and distinguish pathogen strains in a timely manner for instance minayev and ferguson 2008 investigate the interaction between epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics for multiple pathogens the authors proposed a set of deterministic models of the transmission dynamics of multi strain pathogens which provide increased biological realism but assumed clinical epidemiological dynamics that hold only for a set of pathogens with cross immunity of fewer than 0 4 minayev and ferguson 2008 while of interest it means only a very limited portion of the theoretical multi strain pandemics can be analyzed using these models another example is the stochastic sirs model proposed by gordo et al 2009 which takes into consideration two strains and divides the population into sub groups according to their clinical properties the authors validated their model on the influenza pandemic in the state of new york usa between 1993 and 2006 showing promising results in a similar manner khyar and allali 2020 proposed an seir model for the covid 19 pandemic with two strains while proposing an extension to the model for multi strain dynamics as well in their model an individual can be infected only once and develop immunity to all strains khyar and allali 2020 lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2022 relaxed this assumption allowing an individual to be infected and recovered with each one of the strains while taking into consideration the order of infection which is shown to better represent actual biological dynamics cox and brokstad 2020 winer et al 2011 mukherjee et al 2020 yaqinuddin 2020 2 1 2 clinical the clinical extensions are usually associated with either introduction of new epidemiological states that are related to the original infection i state in the sir model or the division of the population into sub groups typically referred to as metapopulations in addition from the pip point of view clinical extensions are referred to the ability of the healthcare system as well as clinical facilities such as hospitals to help severely infected individuals to recover chen 2020 proposed a sir model with two levels of infection severity symptomatic and asymptomatic for the case of covid 19 the author also differs in the transmission path between the two cases in which susceptible individuals become asymptomatic infected immediately while symptomatic infected individuals first go through the exposed stage in addition each infection severity is assumed to have a unique infection and recovery rates the author also suggested a stochastic version of the proposed model by introducing a random noise to each parameter value over time a comparison between the two versions of the model has been investigated by solving the model using a numerical ode solver has been conducted but no validation of the model s performance on historical data or fitting on this data has been provided kozyreff 2021 used a sir model with hospitalized patient dynamics which is assumed to be proportional to the number of infected individuals with some delay and exponential decay in the meantime of hospitalization stay one can note that the hospitalized population does not influence the remaining epidemiological states which are expected to accurately describe the hospitalization dynamics indeed the author addressed this issue explaining that the present paper is to invoke the simplest possible model in order to exploit simple explicit formulas kozyreff 2021 they fitted their proposed model on the covid 19 pandemic for five states belgium france italy switzerland and new york city us focusing on the first three months of the pandemic in each state in practice the author used the mathematica version 8 0 1 1 https www wolfram com mathematica with the findfit and nonlinearmodelfit functions that utilize the least mean square regression method bjorck 1996 it is worth noting that while the author provided a figure to visualize the fitting results no empirical analysis has been provided which limits the ability to evaluate the model s expressiveness rost and wu 2008 studied an seir epidemic model with varying infectivity by considering the infection age of infected individuals this assumption leads to a system of differential equations with distributed infinite delay extension of this work has been proposed by bajiya et al 2021 which introduced an abstract heterogeneous population dynamics by dividing into multiple sub groups of the population and assuming known infection interactions between any two sub groups in particular bajiya et al 2021 provided a close form for the global stability of disease free equilibrium as well as endemic equilibrium the authors also empirically studied these analytical outcomes using a numerical ode solver unsurprisingly obtaining the analytically predicted results the division into age groups was also studied by bunimovich mendrazitsky and stone 2005 for polio and lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2021 for covid 19 in particular lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2021 fitted a two age group sir model on the covid 19 data for israel using a least mean square error with grid search liu et al 2006 on the parameters process showing better prediction results compared to one age group sir model for the middle of the pandemic in general and one implementing a pip that unbalances influence different age groups in the population such as the closure of schools ram and schaposnik 2021 used a stochastic multi age group sir model such that the probability of two individuals from two age groups meeting is an input to the model the authors also introduced the social distance pip such that as more people obey social distance the probability two individuals interact is reduced in a logarithmic manner the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in washington state usa by minimizing the prediction of the mean absolute error over time by the model and the three epidemiological parameters hospitalization rate icu rate among hospitalizations and mortality rate taken from ferguson et al 2020 the authors also used the pandemic state as the initial condition and the population s age distribution from the us government s public datasets ram and schaposnik 2021 lazebnik and blumrosen 2022 used a multi strain extended sirs model with nine states susceptible infected severely infected short recovered long recovered reinfected severely reinfected and deceased the authors assumed that the pandemic is associated with a pathogen with two or more strains such that there is some level of similarity between the strains as such the authors integrated knowledge from microbiology about the pharmacokinetics dynamics that occur as the host s immune system fights the pathogen namely the authors assumed that after recovering from the infection state an individual has a large number of antibodies that keep the individual immune from reinfection nevertheless the amount of antibodies is reduced over time until their amount is too small to make the individual immune from reinfection while the number of long term immune cells i e t cells and b cells are generated by the individual s body as such reinfection is possible but has a different infection and recovery rate due to the long term immune cells moreover due to the similarity between the strains antibodies as well as long term immune cells have a proportional effect on the other strains corresponding to the similarity between them the authors implemented their model using the agent based simulation approach raberto et al 2001 they implemented the proposed model for the covid 19 pandemic in the case of israel the fitting function that has been used is a variation on the mean square error such that the total prediction of all strains in each epidemiological state is compared to the historical records over time due to the lack of diversion to strains in the publicly available historical data the fitting procedure is adapted from lazebnik et al 2021b the data is divided into fitting and validation cohorts such that the fitting cohort is the first 18 months of the data and the validation cohort is the additional two months in order to evaluate the model s performance three epidemiological parameters the mean reproduction number mortality rate and severe cases hospitalization rate are computed for both the fitting and validation cohorts 2 1 3 economic the economic extensions are associated with the workforce and how they influence the infection dynamics moreover the economic dynamics commonly introduce constraints for the execution of pips implementation to make sure the damage to the economy is limited a similar approach is the introduction of a multi objective pip implementation such that the pandemic spread is minimized as well as the economic damage that usually occurs with some level of trade off between them alvarez et al 2020 used a sir model with the lockdown dynamics implemented as the number of individuals in lockdown multiplied by the lockdown effectiveness are deduced from the infection rate β in the susceptible and infection equations moreover unorthodoxly the authors assumed the death state is not part of the epidemiological state but rather the population size is reduced over time proportionally to the number of infected individuals not only that this proportion is not constant as commonly found in sird models but a function of the number of infected e g i t itself on top of that the authors introduce an economic model in which 1 the lockdown population size is limited in order to make sure some sectors would not shut down 2 individuals who are infected but not in lockdown can still produce as much as those susceptible or recovered not in lockdown and 3 lockdown individuals do not produce the authors also assumed that individuals are homogeneous in the manner that they produce at the same rate based on this model the authors aimed to find the optimal number of lockdown individuals such that the population production is maximized while the pandemic spread is minimized farboodi et al 2021 used a sird model with an economic model in their economic models the authors have taken into consideration social activity such that individuals get utility from a level of social activity in addition an individual is aware of being recovered from the disease but cannot differ from susceptible and infected states using the proposed model the authors study several types of equilibria including the laissez faire knight 1967 and social optimum scenarios krueger et al 2020 extended the model proposed by eichenbaum et al 2020 by combining the sird model and allowing individuals in the population to decide at each point in time the amount of their consumption of goods the individuals have a budget that is based on their salary from being employed nonetheless the availability of employment is dependent on the epidemiological state of the population and in turn influences the transmission rate the authors aim to capture the interplay between infection dynamics and the demand side or the supply side however the authors were not able to analyze both of them simultaneously which is further highlighting the importance of sectoral heterogeneity shami and lazebnik 2022 considered a multi strain pandemic with a seihrd h hospitalized model with a mutation mechanism driven by simple modeling of a random mutation process occurring during infection of individuals in the population the authors included a non linear economic model that takes into consideration the direct cost of the pandemic in the form of hospitalization costs as well as costs associated with dead individuals and the cost to manage a pandemic in the form of testing for the emergence of new strains throughout the mutation process they trained a reinforcement learning agent to manage the intervention policy over time showing its effectiveness on real world data 2 1 4 sociological the sociological extensions are associated with the natural processes that happen in the population regardless of the pandemic as well as changes in the population s behavior as a result of the execution of pips adamu et al 2019 proposed a sir model where the susceptible s is growing at a constant rate b due to the birth of new individuals to the population and all the epidemiological states losing individuals in a constant rate c due to natural death i e unrelated to the pandemic over time the authors show that the values of b and c strongly change the long term projection of the pandemic furthermore the authors investigated the influence of these parameters on the stability of the asymptotic state showing a phase transition where c b c b and c b as such one can conclude that taking into consideration the natural growth in the population and death unrelated to the pandemic has an influence on the long term dynamics of relatively large population size as such for a short term simulation e g hours days and even weeks one can avoid these processes to obtain a simpler model without a significant loss of accuracy shanta and buswas 2020 also included birth and natural death rates and added a media awareness component to study the impact of media awareness programs that are covered by media during the disease period formally the authors introduced to the sir model two new states media awareness and isolation which operates as the pip following the media awareness such that the media awareness grows proportionally to the number of infected individuals while decaying over time and the number of isolated individuals grows proportionally to the media awareness and the susceptible individuals while decaying over time as well the authors fitted the model on the covid 19 pandemic using reported data from yang and wang 2020 rong et al 2020 while the media awareness parameters values are assumed the authors solved their model using the ode45 numerical ode solver available in matlab 2 2 https www mathworks com products matlab html li et al 2020 used an extended seir model that integrates the mask wearing pip to study the covid 19 pandemic spread the model takes into consideration asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals the public awareness of mask usage as a function of the pandemic spread mask generation by the market and several levels of mask quality based on commercial or homemade production specifically the authors highlighted that the percentage of people wearing a mask during a pandemic depends on several factors such that culture and social awareness of a pandemic which integrated into the model as the proportion of mask wearing individuals from the population proportional to the change in the number of infected individuals 2 2 spatial extensions the spatial extensions are defined by the introduction of dynamics that override the well mixture assumption 3 3 the well mixture assumption assumes that for each point in time t the probability two random individuals in the population would interact is uniformly distributed of the sir model by making the probability that an individual would interact with other individuals non uniform in this section we explore two common extension strategies graph based and norm based spatial extensions however some models integrate the spatial dynamics into the temporal one by introducing a new epidemiological state as well as modifying the model s parameters to be based on spatial data for instance berke et al 2022 presented an seir model that integrates mobile data obtained from the mobile phone location service to approximate the movement of the population the model has been implemented for the covid 19 pandemic in andorra with comprehensive datasets that include telecoms data covering 100 of mobile subscribers in the country and a serology testing program that more than 90 of the population participants the authors assume three versions of the model where the infection rate over time β t is either constant i e regular seir model exponential to the average number of trips or exponential to the number of trips with the entrance of additional individuals from outside the country in addition the authors assumed that only a portion of the recovered individuals is reported with some fixed delay and reflected in the historical records the authors used a daily number of infected individuals over five months such that the first half was used for training and the remaining half was used for validation of the model the model s parameters were obtained by minimizing the negative log likelihood using the l bfgs b method byrd et al 1995 for the validation phase they used the median absolute percentage error mape over cumulative estimates as proposed by friedman et al 2021 unsurprisingly the authors reported the version of the model that integrates mobility outperforms on average the one that does not on the validation data 2 2 1 graph based infection networks a stochastic sir model with a spatial graph based component is constructed as follows each individual in the population is a node in the graph that is associated with one of the three epidemiological states and connected to some other nodes if a susceptible node is connected to an infected node it has a non negative probability to become infected after some time each node infected node becomes a recovered node almost all infection network epidemiological models start with these settings masuda and holme 2017 however after this agreed common ground models start to differ from one another by the graph constriction methods as well as the epidemiological logic ellison 2020 provided an extended review of infection networks based on the sir model e g without other temporal extensions the author started with the homogeneous sir model showing that a fully connected infection graph that is also static in time i e the edges of the graph do not change over time obtains similar behavior to the classical sir model afterward heterogeneous sir models with uniform matching and homophily are investigated showing significantly different results where the latter is better suited for realistic social networks mcauley and leskovec 2012 the authors highlighted that this approach is somewhat problematic for applicative usage due to the complexity of fitting the model for realistic pandemics and since this representation is relatively sensitive to the topology of the graph which may cause an overestimation of the difficulty of controlling an epidemic as well as the damage incurred in reaching herd immunity for even minor fitting error holme 2021 studied the implementation of the agent based infection graph representation the author started with the same common settings see section 2 2 1 and proposed an algorithm for the construction of infection network models in order to balance realism and computational efficiency first all nodes in the graph are initialized as susceptible second the algorithm runs through the contacts in increasing order of time and if there is a contact between a susceptible and infectious node then infect the susceptible node i e transform to the infected epidemiological state with a pre defined probability in such a case sample a personal recovery duration from an exponential distribution and transform the node into the recovered epidemiological state when needed finally the simulation is terminated when there are no infectious nodes furthermore the authors also suggest a better performing simulation approach based on the event driven algorithm proposed by kiss et al 2017 they show that on realistic networks the improved algorithm outperforms the naive approach both via complexity analysis and empirical experiments in particular their experiments show that for low infection rate 0 1 and short recovery duration 10 time steps the event driven algorithm is at least ten times faster location networks bognanni et al 2020 developed a model of the joint determination of epidemiological and economic variables in epidemic settings they called econ sir the authors used an agent based representation of the sir model in which agents are able to make economic decisions based on the state of the economy these decisions influence the economy which has a feedback loop with the pandemic spread rate of interest the authors proposed an enriched version of the model to tackle the unique characteristics of the covid 19 pandemic including other extensions and a spatial component they assume the initial version occurs on a single node of a graph and allow individuals to move between nodes location freely given information about the infection risk in each node the agents perceived infection risk can be different from the true value based on inaccurate information they obtain the implementation and fitting of the spatial component of the extended version of the model are based on a panel of daily county level observations that included infection cases death cases point of interest visits and hours worked the authors used the log likelihood minimization criteria for the model s parameters on the node level while minimizing the cumulative error of the entire graph over time measured on four signals obtained from the model s prediction goel and sharma 2020 proposed a location graph based sir model in which each node of the graph is a location where a subset of the population is located in their proposed model each susceptible individual can be infected by infected individuals located in the same node local infection or by infected individuals visiting its node from neighbor nodes global infection the authors introduced social connectivity indicating the average number of individuals that move between nodes and therefore cause global infection the authors tried to fit the proposed model to the covid 19 pandemic in estonia but obtained poor results since the model is too simplistic nevertheless one can notice the solid mathematical ground for spatial pips evaluation like social distance reduced social connectivity and even community based lockdowns 2 2 2 norm based viguerie et al 2021 developed a partial differential equation pde representation of the seird model in which the spatial component is defined on a continuous two dimensional domain the model also takes into consideration the natural birth and death rates division of the infection and recovery rates for both asymptomatic and symptomatic unconformably the authors do not divide the infection i into two states and diffusion parameters respectively corresponding to the different population groups moreover a portion of the exposed individuals does not develop symptoms and transform directly into the recovered epidemiological state the spatial movement over a large population is described by an inhomogeneous random walk which in the limit tends to a second order differential operator viguerie et al 2021 salsa 2009 the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in lombardy italy focusing on the first half year of the pandemic they used a finite element spatial discretization benaroya and rehak 1988 and the backward euler method biswas et al 2013 for time integration and solve each time step fully implicitly with a picard iteration for stability huang et al 1996 the resulting linear systems are solved by the gmres algorithm using a jacobi preconditioner chen and shen 2006 milner and zhao 2008 proposed a sir model with a one dimensional finite and continuous spatial domain obtaining a pde representation in their model susceptible individuals move away from the previous location of the infection and all individuals move away from overcrowded regions following diffusion dynamics the authors numerically solve the model for different diffusion coefficients resulting in either hyperbolic or parabolic second order pde using the runge kutta discontinuous galerkin method rkdg method cockburn and shu 2001 for the temporal component and the finite element method benaroya and rehak 1988 for the spatial component using this numerical calculation approach the authors show that the mse and mae errors reduced linearly to the number of partitions for both the one dimensional and two dimensional cases paeng and lee 2017 proposed a sir model where individuals are assumed to move stochastically within a small fixed radius rather than a random walk the authors proposed continuous and discrete sir models that show spatial distributions which differ by the radius value they show that the propagation speed and size of an epidemic depend on the population density and the infectious radius 3 model implementation once the mathematical model is designed researchers are faced with the challenge of implementing it like computer software one is able to divide the process of implementing a mathematical model into three main tasks a simulation approach fitting procedure on historical data and extraction of high level epidemiological properties in the following section a review of how several researchers overcome these challenges with their strength and limitations are provided 3 1 simulation approach there are two main simulation approaches ode based numerical calculation and agent based simulation the first is using numerical algorithms to approximate the analytical solution of ode and pde based representation of the sir model the latter approach takes advantage of the unique representation of the sir model which represents the number of individuals in each epidemiological state over time and simulated the interactions between the individuals in the population to match the global sir dynamics it is worth stating that even for the classical sir model without any extensions the predictions of the numerical calculation and agent based simulation are highly differing connell et al 2009a b this phenomenon occurs with other complex social systems simulations as well macal 2010 one can argue the methods are complementary to one another since the advantages of one method are usually the limitation of the other the numerical computations simulation approach is usually used either with a norm based spatial component or no spatial component at all infection graphs by definition do not characterize by odes location based graphs result in the multiplication of the extended sir equations for each one of the nodes and dynamic construction of additional equations to capture the movement between nodes which results in an extremely large number of odes that make the approximation error grow over time and the overall computation unstable in particular for realistic location graph based sir models modern numerical ode solvers are not able to compute the results in a feasible time and therefore impractical however for the cases in which numerical computation is fitting it has two advantages first the computation time is independent of the population size o 1 for a population of size n which allows computing the dynamics of a large population such as one found in the scope of cities or countries second the implementation is relatively simple and there are multiple open source ode solvers available andersson et al 2015 stadter et al 2021 pastawa et al 2020 to name a few ketcheson et al developed a package for the design of numerical ode solvers in matlab if one wishes to introduce modifications to existing ode solvers given the need ketcheson et al 2020a this is in addition to a large number of built in matlab ode and pde solving methods rackauckas 2018 python is gathering popularity in the last two decades and ode solver packages become increasingly available for it as well ketcheson et al 2020b dahlgren 2018 another package named dynamicalsystems jl is designed on the julia programming language which is considered a novel and promising programming language for efficient numerical computation and relatively easy to use bezanson et al 2017 datseris 2018 on the other hand agent based simulation extends the numerical computation method for all temporal and spatial extensions discussed in section 2 in practice the agent based simulation approach allows describing local interactions between agents in three ways in order to obtain global behavior spontaneous interactions interactions between individuals and interactions of an individual and the environment the first group includes interactions that usually depend on time for example the transformation from the infection epidemiological state to the recovery after γ time steps the interactions between individuals are often the most intuitive ones and include interactions between two or more individuals that change the state of at least one of them for instance an infected individual infects a susceptible individual after physical contact lastly interactions between individuals and the environment can influence the decisions and the state of the agents throughout the underacted change of state for a global or local element an example can be a central economy that defines constraints for policymakers in applying pips that can influence the pandemic spread this economy at each point in time is defined by the overall interactions with the individuals with it and each following step in time influences the conditions that might define their next state two of the main advantages of agent based simulations are the easy implementation of heterogeneous behavior and the introduction of the decision making process these two additions allow the simulation of complex dynamics that better capture the real dynamics that happen in nature on the flip side agent based simulations are computationally expensive in comparison with the numerical computation approach first the naive and the most broad used implementation of the agent based simulation is asymptotically linear to the size of the population moreover heterogeneity in the population makes the simulation stochastic as such in order to obtain statistically significant results one is ordinarily required to run the simulation multiple times besides the introduction of the decision making process generates a set of new difficulties in the simulation such that is the decision making is optimal based on what data an agent makes a decision and what is the decision making model to name a few these questions are not in the scope of this review but one should take them into consideration when using this approach a comparison between the two approaches divided into the eight discussed properties is provided in table 1 3 2 fitting historical data the implementation of the fitting procedure can take multiple shapes and sizes mainly influenced by the simulation approach one chooses nonetheless these procedures have several properties in common they all used the model historical data of some dynamics that can be computed using the model and an optimization search algorithm that can change a set of parameters in the model to make it more similar to the historical data indeed roberty and de araujo 2021 used a sir model with data about the evolution of the covid 19 pandemic compiled by the johns hopkins university center for systems science and engineering the authors used an ode based numerical calculation to solve the model the authors used the newton raphson optimization algorithm lindstrom and bates 1988 on the mean absolute error mae between the historical number of recovered individuals and the one predicted by the model over time this approach is feasible as the authors take advantage of the fact that it is relatively easy to get an analytical description of the number of recovered individuals over time r t from the classical sir model in addition the authors used ridge regression repeating the same method but also normalizing the mae value using a moving average of 14 days hoerl and kennard 1970 the author provided their software as open access written in python version 3 7 roberty and de araujo 2021 the proposed approach and the corresponding software provide a simple but effective fitting procedure for the ode based simulation approach that said the method the authors proposed will be extremely hard to utilize for an even slightly more complex model where the identification and extraction of a single parameter s formula for the optimization process is not feasible ambrosio and aziz alaoui 2020 used a sir model with covid 19 data for the month of march 2020 in new york ny and new jersey nj states the authors used the data reported in the news 4 4 https www nytimes com article coronavirus county data us html action click module spotlight pgtype homepage and assumed the number of individuals in ny is n 19453556 based on the available data from 2019 reported by the usa census bureau 5 5 https www census gov the authors taking into consideration the historical recorded number are probably underestimating the actual number of infected individuals due to unreported infection cases by normalizing the recorded number to be just 10 from the real historical number based on infected to tested positive rate in the same time frame and location the authors used a trial and error approach allowing for each parameter to obtain different values over time while trying to minimize the model s total infected individuals over the period compared to the same recorded value moreover the authors proposed a spatial temporal extension of the sir model taking a two node graph based spatial model for ny and nj and the transformation rate of individuals between these two cities the fitting method remains the same for the extended version of the model as the spatial dynamics are formally represented as additional three equations to the ode based representation of the sir model lazebnik et al 2021b used a spatio temporal two age group sird model such that adults are divided into working and non working groups and a three node line graph as the spatial component the authors implemented their model for the covid 19 pandemic in israel in order to fit the model on historical data the authors first approximated the initial conditions of their model based on the best available data at the time of the initial condition of the model the israeli central bureau of statistics 2020a b 2017 who 2022 afterward the authors defined a mean square error loss function based on the three infection and dead states of the model compared to historical data using this loss function the authors used the gradient descent haskell 1944 algorithm by computing the symmetric difference quotient numerical derivative mercer 2014 for each one of the model s parameters to get the numerical gradient for the point in the parameter space this process was repeated until the gradient s norm was smaller than a pre defined threshold this process was repeated multiple times 1000 such that the initial condition was taken at random using the monte carlo method liu et al 2000 and the parameter s values that minimize the loss function 4 develop your model this section provides a high level guide for new and experienced modelers that are interested in developing their own epidemiological mathematical model that extends the sir model and implements it as computer software since there is a wide diversity of modeling options and even more implementation methods and practices in this section we would use the object oriented programming oop approach with the popular python programming language srinath 2017 in addition we would assume one is interested in empirical results rather than analytical ones and as such focus on the accuracy of the model rather than simplicity for analytical analysis hence we first outline how one would pick the right extensions for the sir model model scope state of the pandemic and available data afterward we discuss several important software implementation details 4 1 construct your extended sir model the construction of one s extended sir model should start with getting familiar with the biological clinical economic and sociological settings as well as the pandemic state and duration of interest consider you are given the task to model the spread of influenza in your local school building in the course of several weeks just before winter begins and the number of influenza patients starts to increase furthermore you are requested to evaluate the effectiveness of asking only staff to wear masks during their entire stay in the school the attentive reader would immediately notice that the mini pandemic is not yet arrived so the state of the pandemic is just the beginning and the duration of interest is several weeks more importantly we are interested in only a small size population i e the students and staff visiting the school following this example it is immediately noticeable that taking into consideration the natural birth and death in the population is redundant since in the course of a few weeks these values would be so small that their influence on the pandemic spread would be insignificant a borderline but still intuitive decision would be to add the exposed and death states a quick review of the literature iuliano et al 2018 would reveal that the exposed phase in which individuals are already infected but not yet infectious is common in influenza while the mortality rate in the last several decades is extremely low thus including the exposed e epidemiological state would be appropriate while adding the death state d is less important moreover as the dynamics occur in a single building one can and should introduce a spatial component to the model here the availability of the data plays a role if no spatial data is available one would have to use the well mixture assumption nevertheless as more data is available more complex spatial models become available imagine a list of historical interactions available between any two individuals in the population using this data one can extract the probability of each pair wise interaction in the population thus an infection graph can be a decent spatial model on the other hand it would be hard to impossible to obtain such data as an alternative visiting the school and marking the rooms and the average location of the population over time is more realistic lazebnik and alexi 2022 given this data one can use a location graph for the spatial component on top of that one can take another step further during the school visit and capture a 3d scan of the building which would allow a highly detailed norm based spatial model dai and zhao 2020 kwon et al 2020 peng and jimenez 2021 shen et al 2020b now focusing on the pip part of the assignment one can conclude that a division of the population into two sub populations stuff and not stuff i e students is required so the model would be able to differ between the two groups in the pip settings at this point the modeler would probably ask itself if further division can be beneficial one option is a division by age group another option could be a division by sex another check in the clinical literature would reveal that such differences are existing for both different sex and age nonetheless these are relatively small as such the modeler can decide if to take them into consideration or not based on the initial condition an extreme but easy to analyze case would be a 95 female and 5 male school in which using the knowledge e g parameter values of female centric clinical dynamics would be more appropriate than the average in the population or even male centric one assuming such data is available in the same manner we can evaluate the advantage of including the other extensions reviewed in section 2 to the effectiveness and relevance of the model these extensions are summarized in table 2 with the most generic feasibility criteria and implementation class for an agent based simulation approaches further discussed in section 4 2 this is not a full list of possible extensions for the sir model but of the most popular ones in addition modelers are encouraged to develop new extensions for their unique cases providing more processes to known dynamics for example biological or integrating new disciplines for instance psychology concluding the provided example when one aims to develop an extended sir model a review of the aspects that influence the pandemic spread as well as the task scope are the keys to properly choosing the relevant extensions of the sir model of note some would try to take the largest and most sophisticated model in order to take as many processes into consideration thinking it would work well for the private case of interest while this thinking process is true in theory it is inferior to the proposed approach as such large models usually require much more data for proper configuration more computation power and are less stable compared to a dedicated model vytla et al 2021 4 2 software implementation details once the model is well defined we assume a modeler wants to implement it as computer software as mentioned in section 2 2 there are two main approaches for implementing extended sir based models numerical calculation of ode or pde based models or agent based simulations the implementation of numerical ode solvers is hard and out of the scope of this review we swiftly state that such solvers are required to comply with multiple objectives such as small errors fast computation time and robustness as a result it is considered to be a hard task to properly develop a new solver with superior properties hence the modeler who is interested in epidemiological mathematical models rather than numerical computation should probably use one of the many available solvers for a recent review please see byakatonda 2020 on the other hand the implementation of agent based simulation is more straightforward when one is breaking the simulation into the three types of interactions an individual in the population might have spontaneous individual individual and individual environment interactions in practice it is convenient to represent an agent we would use agent and individual in this section interchangeably as a timed finite state machine with or without the ability to make decisions that change its other agents or the environment s state this logic can define multiple types of agents each one belonging to a different sub population and as such single agents and multiple inherent agent classes can be useful moreover as often querying subsets of the population or even the entire population is needed in such models a population class provides a good solution to this need in addition one can use a spatial class that describes the spatial component of the model this approach is useful for the location graph based and norm based types of the spatial component while the infection graph model is better to be developed as a property of the agent and population classes since spatial implementation can highly differ especially for the norm based spatial approach it is recommended that all the logic of the spatial component would be wrapped with this single class in particular how it influences the population s state and vice versa this way one can experiment with different spatial components with minimal change to the software structure a similar logic can be applied to the pandemic class which holds the logic of the used extended sir model and the pip class which contains the logic of the pips configuration and usage these four components are the building blocks of the simulator and as such can be used by utilized by a simulator class this class is responsible for the simulation including computing and recording the change in both the population s and environment s states over simulation steps an instance of this class can be generated by three main processes first a manual configuration a random configuration with some requirements for example used in sensitivity analysis and a result of fitting on historical data all three approaches can be methods of a simulatorgenerator class finally as the modeler and other users would like to study and analyze multiple configurations of the simulator an interface class we named analyzer can be used to externalize a list of possible simulation configurations generated by the simulatorgenerator class after one or more simulations are computed the analyzer can take advantage of a ploter class and a report class to return a report with the asked data with the relevant figures and schemes in particular the report class can be inherent to produce a wide spectrum of report types each one associated with one or more analysis types of the simulation a unified modeling language uml graph of the proposed structure with complimented technical details is provided in fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 research trends as models size is enlarging to take into consideration a growing number of processes aiming to more accurately capture pandemic spread dynamics it is becoming harder up to infeasible to obtain theoretical results for example it is impossible to obtain a radical based formula for the basic reproduction number r 0 for a multi strain sir based model with more than two strains lazebnik and bunimovich mendrazitsky 2022 using the well established next generation matrix method diekmann et al 2010 thus a larger number of analysis methods move from analyzing odes and dynamic system approaches into stochastic processes and functional analysis lazebnik et al 2021a cortés et al 2020 hamra et al 2013 these methods have shown promising results in different dynamic systems such as astronomy biology economics etc sharma 2017 nix and vose 1992 bojanic 2021 privault 2018 shaikhet 1996 therefore it is not a surprise that these methods gaining popularity in the epidemiological context when the models become too complex to model and analyzed using their classical ode representation in addition as single type pips are repeatably shown to be too simplistic and obtain sub optimal results for multi objective settings models that allow to combine or even generate pips on the fly becoming more popular these models provide a more reach configuration space that policymakers can explore and as such can be considered a more useful and reliable tool indeed multiple epidemiological simulators allow the combination of several pips while also allowing some space to explore several different extensions of the sir model lorch et al 2020 bhatele et al 2017 cota and ferreira 2017 5 2 limitations the current models are facing a catch 22 situation on the one hand simple models are of interest as these are more explainable and require less data thus it makes them more appealing for policymakers to use selbst and barocas 2018 bertossi and geerts 2020 deeks 2019 on the other hand these models are usually poorly performed for even a slightly different usage from the original one the researchers aimed to address similar issues with the models performance are taking place for long periods of time a similar but opposite situation occurs for complex models that show better prediction accuracy on a larger set of configurations these models are usually not interoperable and require a lot and reach data that is commonly unavailable or too noisy to serve as legitimate training fitting data as such the usefulness of these models is often limited by the amount and diversity of the available data furthermore sir based and other epidemiological models experiencing hardships in predicting the course of the pandemic across locations and time frames since the dynamics they aim to capture are consistently changing due to active intervention of policymakers a social and economic adaption of the population and stochastic changes in the pathogen s behavior a similar issue is commonly addressed in the ml based model and called concept drift gama et al 2014 karnick et al 2008 aztiria et al 2012 hoens et al 2012 lazebnik et al 2022 however currently the concept drift challenge is remaining mainly unaddressed for ml based models and the situation is even worse for the case of sir based models xu and wilson 2021 lima et al 2022 unfortunately there is no clear direction to tackle this challenge and further investigation is required leaving an open and promising door for future research to accomplish from the proposed review a more technically fundamental issue in the way authors showcase their work is revealed most of the extended sir based papers show the performance of their models on historical data claiming to fit it on the historical data and even fewer show a validation using this data in either case it seems that a significant number of papers do not outline in detail the fitting and validation procedure as well as the data used for these two processes this phenomenon makes it practically impossible to reproduce the proclaimed results and more importantly compare new models with these models or even build upon them 5 3 opportunities since current epidemiological mathematical models are focused on a narrow field of interest to capture the unique properties and complex dynamics of each case individually a multi scale ensemble model that takes into consideration the interactions between these models can capture more accurately the global course of the pandemic while keeping the local smaller dynamics accurate infeasible computation resources for example one can combine a norm based spatial model in the scale of a single room lazebnik and alexi 2023 peng et al 2020 to a location graph based spatial model for an airborne pandemic spread in a building lazebnik and alexi 2022 this way one can exploit the high accuracy of a norm based model without the need to simulate a large size spatial location since the latter is abstracted by the graph based model another promising line of work is the usage of ml and agent based simulations together to simulate an extremely heterogeneous population this approach can be used to integrate a personalized decision making model for each agent in the population allowing it to make a unique set of actions based on feedback from the environment jang et al 2018 wang and usher 2005 jalalimanesh et al 2017 alexi et al 2023 these actions would alter the course of the pandemic and allow a more realistic representation of reality in particular one can investigate the influence of the online information consumed by individuals in the population over time from multiple sources television social media ads etc on their willingness to obey pips and therefore on the course of the pandemic 6 conclusion the paper discusses a few important epidemiological mathematical extended sir models focusing on airborne pandemics these models have been used by policymakers and public health officials in the recent covid 19 and other pandemics to assess the evolution of the pandemic design and analyze pips and study various what if scenarios we show how those modelers face the challenges related to properly developing these models and converting them into applicative software tools one conclusion that can be drawn from this review is that modelers need to be more transparent in the description of their models by clearly stating the implementation details of their model the fitting procedure and the data used in addition a more detailed sensitivity and stability quantification of the proposed models is advised allowing us to draw the limitation of usage for each model a future review can therefore focus on the current state of the art sensitivity and stability analysis methods with how to successfully implement them in a new model from a more applicative point of view mathematicians and engineers are advised to collaborate with social and natural science researchers aiming to reveal new promising extensions to the sir model hopefully making it even more accurate and expressive funding this research did not receive any specific grant

provides the urban green infrastructure ugi is capable of capturing and adsorbing pollutants through removal mechanisms as envisaged in the national plan for recovery and resilience pnrr italy has planned on investing about eur 300 million of the next generation eu funds in urban reforestation programs that will target italian metropolitan cities mcs successful implementation of such interventions is underpinned by a thorough knowledge of the presence and distribution of existing vegetation and its capacity to deliver ess in the present study we selected three italian coastal mcs along a latitudinal gradient namely genoa bari and reggio calabria and assessed the regulating es of pm10 removal by urban and peri urban forests in both biophysical and monetary terms in 2019 the total pm10 removal in the mcs of genoa bari and reggio calabria amounted to 5 331 363 and 4 248 mg respectively for a corresponding monetary value of eur 536 39 and 435 million our analyses were conducted on a seasonal basis and further aimed at investigating the role of functional diversity in es provision according to our findings in all mcs the highest annual average pm10 removal efficiencies were exhibited by the evergreen broadleaves deciduous broadleaves also displayed high efficiency values despite being characterized by a marked seasonality caused by leaf abscission conifers proved less efficient although our findings may indicate a good response to a condition of multi stress maintaining a functionally mixed species composition in the ugis is desirable for guaranteeing the continuous provision of ess throughout the year in conclusion our results provide useful insights to support the sustainable planning and management of ugis as envisaged by the united

in europe eea 2020 pm which is a heterogeneous mix of solid and liquid suspended particles of variable dimension and chemical composition is regarded as a major concern who 2021a gbd 2016 risk factor collaborators 2017 indeed many epidemiological studies have consistently reported adverse effects on the human health ranging from cardiovascular and respiratory disease to carcinogenesis caused by both short term rohr and wyzga 2012 and long term exposure li et al 2003 atkinson et al 2014 wyzga and rohr 2015 the severity of these effects as well as their transport processes in the air is largely determined by the particles aerodynamic properties who 2021b which have a strong dependence on size according to their aerodynamic diameter particles can be classified as coarse 2 5 10 µm fine 0 1 2 5 µm or ultra fine 0 1 µm reflecting their progressively greater capacity to penetrate the respiratory system and be harmful to the human health ultra fine and fine particles are together referred to as pm2 5 which is the pm size fraction encompassing the greatest number of particles however assessment of pm10 comprising all ultra fine fine and coarse particles with a diameter 10 µm is crucial because it further accounts for the major proportion of particle mass kelly and fussell 2012 and allows to cover the whole spectrum of the adverse effects posed to the human health although estimates for pm10 were not explicitly featured in their 2022 air quality report according to the eea in 2020 the death burden caused by pm2 5 in the 27 countries part of the european union eu totals an estimated 238 000 premature deaths eea 2022 providing a clear indication for pm10 additionally pm has the potential to damage anthropic materials and manufactures and act as a climate altering factor due to the scattering and adsorption of incoming solar radiation with both a warming and a cooling effect al thani et al 2018 pm pollution has a strong urban connotation mainly due to the higher density of human activities and the diversity of emission sources including traffic industry domestic fuel burning shipping etc karagulian et al 2015 with approximately 75 of the european population being urban united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 despite the declining trend in pm ambient concentrations over the last 15 years population exposure in europe is still high according to the world health organization who air quality guidelines who 2021b in 2019 respectively 81 and 97 of eu 27 urban citizens were exposed to pm10 and pm2 5 concentrations above safety standards eea 2021a the onset and progression of the sars cov 2 pandemic have sparked renewed interest among the scientific community and policymakers in finding solutions for the mitigation of air pollution in urban areas schröter et al 2022 ideally measures aimed at effectively improving air quality should target emission sources directly lafortezza et al 2018 however this is not simple to attain in practice because of the difficulty in capping human activities and of the transboundary and heterogeneous nature of pm which can originate from distant emission sources that cannot be controlled brunekreef et al 2021 in the present european landscape the capacity of natural and semi natural ecosystems to provide a variety of benefits for the human population is referred to as ecosystem services ess costanza et al 1997 daily 1997 wallace 2007 ipbes 2019 it includes the ability of urban and peri urban forests to mitigate air pollution and its negative impacts

removal via estimates of deposition mechanisms nowak et al 2006 2014 barò et al 2014 fusaro et al 2017 sebastiani et al 2021 furthermore cities are particularly vulnerable areas kabisch et al 2016 where environmental challenges are permeated by critical socioeconomic aspects newman 2006 to meet these challenges using vegetation to improve air quality has been proposed as a suitable nature based

was allocated to the urban and extra urban forestry plan which envisages the reforestation of italian mcs with the planting of 6 6 million trees by 2024 decreto del ministro della transizione ecologica 2021 this is an important occasion for italian institutions and local administrations to rethink urban design and improve urban health with projects addressing multiple challenges and focusing on urban regeneration mite 2021 to properly advise the sustainable management and efficient planning of ugis and foster economic investment in the eyes of the stakeholders more evidence quantifying the value that urban and peri urban forests hold in terms of es provision is needed blasi et al 2017 maes et al 2020 given the above premises we selected three italian coastal mcs located along a latitudinal gradient namely genoa ge bari ba and reggio calabria rc these cities have been shaped by the interplay of different geomorphological settings climates and backgrounds of socioeconomic development and anthropic pressure which resulted in diverse landscapes and urban rural configurations we acquired and processed remotely sensed data integrated into gis environment using a modeling approach the main objective of the present study was the biophysical and monetary assessment of the es of pm10 removal by urban and peri urban forests in these three mcs more specifically we aimed to i map the presence and distribution of three functional groups fgs of vegetation through a classification of remotely sensed data ii characterize and map pm10 removal on a seasonal basis iii define the role of functional diversity in es provision by describing pm10 removal for the three fgs iv evaluate the monetary benefits granted by the provision of es given that ess potential is closely linked to both functional and structural aspects of the vegetation we expect to observe an effect of the specific lulc mosaic on es provision that is different in each mc and which varies with the degree of anthropic pressure climatic factors further contribute to determine the specific conditions of stress felt by local vegetation as well as its stress responses such that pm10 removal efficiencies are expected to highlight a better performance in those fgs that are functionally adapted to stress variables particularly water and heat 1 2 relevance toward the achievement of the global sustainable development goals cities are a primary focus of the united nations un 2030 agenda for sustainable development with over half of the world population living in urban areas and projections pointing to 6 5 billion people by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 it is clear that cities will increasingly represent a strategic stage for the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 the sustainable transformation of cities and communities as envisaged in goal 11 necessarily requires coordinated and transversal actions that embrace all three dimensions of sustainability environmental economic and social purvis et al 2019 and this is indeed reflected in the broad scope of its related targets target 11 6 explicitly frames the improvement of air quality as essential for the reduction of the environmental impact of cities and the annual mean levels of pm2 5 and pm10 were chosen as one of the two indicators to be used to assess progress towards this target because it provides quantitative and spatialized information regarding the actual impact of ugis on concentration levels modeling pm10 removal in large metropolitan areas is therefore crucial to evaluate strategical actions to satisfy the specific requirements the most relevant aspect in the case of pm is linked to the detrimental impacts on human health with target 9 of goal 3 good health and well being being set to reduce the mortality rate attributed to ambient air pollution among others the use of ugi to reduce pm concentration levels will directly contribute to addressing this goal although the findings emerging from the present work do not directly quantify other measures of es provision the multi functionality and system based approach of ugis hawken et al 2021 which provide a wide variety of benefits capable of supporting the health and well being of urban citizens in many ways clearly mirrors to transversality of the sdg framework specifically we think our results can contribute to evaluating the achievement of goal 13 and 15 respectively climate action and life on land

classification of sentinel 2 imagery sensed in the summer of 2019 using a maximum likelihood algorithm the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi samples 13 spectral bands with different spatial resolution four bands at 10 m six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m three bands belong to the so called red edge a spectral region in the near infrared where changes in reflectance are conducive to the study of vegetation we used the sentinel 2 level 2a product which is derived from the level 1c product and directly provides bottom of atmosphere boa corrected reflectance images esa 2015 satellite images were processed using the open source sentinel application platform snap for the exploitation of earth observation data to train a maximum likelihood algorithm an adequate number of regions of interest roi was first collected using available lulc base maps as a reference a total of six lulc classes were identified artificial surfaces cultivated and uncultivated land which includes pastures bare areas or other areas with sparse vegetation water bodies and three fgs of vegetation that is evergreen broadleaves deciduous broadleaves and conifers manes et al 2012 notably the class of artificial surfaces was obtained from a soil consumption classification produced for the year 2019 by the italian institute for environmental protection and research ispra which mapped impervious surfaces for the whole national territory with a spatial resolution of 10 m by integrating photointerpretation of sentinel 2 imagery and ground validation this soil consumption layer provides a reliable spatial description of local urbanization processes and of their effects on the extent and degree of fragmentation of natural ecosystems amato et al 2017 the classification was then evaluated by calculating the overall accuracy which proved in all cases to be over 70 2 3 average seasonal leaf area index leaf area index lai is a dimensionless vegetation index defined as the one sided green leaf area or total needle surface area in the case of conifers per unit ground surface area it is descriptive of the structure phenology and functional quality of the forest canopy bréda 2008 lai data for the year 2019 were obtained from the copernicus global land service cgls lai product which is freely available on the cgls website the cgls lai product is derived from daily proba v s1 top of the atmosphere toa reflectance data and made available for download as a 10 days temporal composite with a spatial resolution of 300 m for our purposes we averaged lai data on a seasonal basis using the gis software grass gis for each mc for the deciduous broadleaves lai values were computed following their period of vegetative growth winter average lai was therefore arbitrarily considered equal to 0 and autumn values averaged up to the 24th of october after which we assumed the onset of abscission marando et al 2016 2 4 average seasonal pm10 concentrations pm10 concentration data were obtained in the context of the bigdata in environmental and occupational epidemiology beep project funded by the italian national institute for insurance against accidents at work inail which had the general objective of assessing the public health impacts of atmospheric pollution and air temperature on the population at the national scale in particular a five stage modeling strategy based on random forest methods was implemented to predict pm10 pm2 5 and pm10 2 5 daily concentrations at 1 km2 spatial resolution across italy for the years 2013 2015 the model calibrates ground level pm concentrations from routine monitoring networks using aerosol optical depth aod data meteorological parameters spatio temporal data e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a variety of spatial data e g geo climatic zones point emission sources and land cover data as main predictors in this study daily pm10 concentration data for the year 2015 were seasonally averaged and then extracted and utilized to derive four maps of average seasonal pm10 concentration for each mc each maintaining a spatial resolution of 1 km2 for more detailed information regarding the methodology and the model the reader may refer to stafoggia et al 2019 2 5 modeling pm10 deposition dry deposition of pm10 was estimated using the equation first proposed by nowak et al 1994 and then re applied in different studies manes et al 2016 the equation is reported below q f l t where q is the amount of pm10 kg ha adsorbed to the leaf cuticle f is the pollutant flux estimated as the product of the deposition velocity vd m s of pm10 and its concentration c µg m3 l is the lai t refers to the time interval s which for our purposes was set equal to the length of each season for the fg of deciduous broadleaves we assumed a period of vegetative growth of 218 days going from the beginning of spring to mid autumn vd is derived from a median value of 0 0064 m s which was estimated for an average lai of 6 and thus obtained by adjusting to the actual lai value escobedo and novak 2009 the model integrated with land cover data obtained through the classification was implemented at pixel level in grass gis separate runs were launched for each fg in each season and mc four maps of average seasonal removal efficiency kg ha of pm10 were obtained for each of the three mcs by summing removal efficiencies over the total extent covered by each fg and using appropriate unit conversion factors seasonal and total pm10 removal mg could be estimated 2 6 monetary evaluation monetary evaluation of es provision by each fg was conducted on a seasonal basis using the externality value of pm10 fusaro et al 2017 externalities can be defined as the hidden socioeconomic public health and environmental costs that are not otherwise recognized by the market the externality value of pm10 was estimated based on the value of a life year voly and it s equal to 107 384 mg of pollutant for italy eea 2021b voly is an estimate of damage costs based upon the reduction of life expectancy the latter being measured in potential years of life lost yoll therefore our evaluation covers the avoided estimated costs attributable to pm10 removal by the vegetation 3 results 3 1 land use and land cover classification fig 2 a c shows the lulc maps for the three mcs table 2a 2b 2c summarizes the results of both the absolute km2 and relative extent of each lulc class in ge fig 2a the landscape is dominated by vegetation 62 which spans the whole territory of the mc and contrarily to what can be observed in the two other mcs infiltrates the bulk of the urban fabric located within the municipality borders in ba fig 2b cultivated and uncultivated land largely outweighs the other classes 83 vegetation cover is very limited 7 taken together the three fgs account for a smaller surface than that occupied by the class of artificial surfaces almost 10 in rc fig 2c cultivated and uncultivated land again emerges as the most extensive class 67 although the natural vegetation concentrated along the final portion of the apennine range is extensive 27 the artificial surfaces are limited less than 6 in all three mcs the deciduous broadleaves emerge as the most abundant fg ranging from 75 to 89 of total green cover in ba and rc the conifers are the second most abundant fg 14

winter 2 73 kg ha in total the vegetation in rc removed 4248 00 mg of pm10 table 5b 3 5 monetary evaluation of the regulating ecosystem service of pm10 removal total estimated monetary values of pm10 removal by season and by fg in the three mcs are reported in table 6a 6b 6c monetary estimation is strictly dependent on the biophysical evaluation given by total removals for the year 2019 the total monetary value for the es of pm10 removal amounted to eur 574 64 million in ge eur 39 00 million in ba and lastly eur 456 17 million in rc 4 discussion average seasonal removal efficiency which is strictly linked to the estimated lai manes et al 2016 follows two distinct temporal patterns in ge and rc it peaks in the summer and reaches a minimum in winter however in ba all three fgs exhibit the highest and lowest values in the spring and autumn respectively such a finding is explained by the local climate conditions winter is traditionally the wet season and water availability in the spring is good while temperatures progressively become milder overall improving the abiotic conditions for the natural vegetation and possibly anticipating the onset of the period of vegetative growth additionally the region of apulia where ba is located is frequently and hardly hit by drought with some areas even considered to be at risk of desertification ladisa et al 2010 precipitation in late spring and summer is scarce a condition which is exacerbated by the increasing temperatures polemio and casarano 2004 and by the water demand posed by intensive agricultural activities and other forms of anthropic pressure that show a marked seasonality such as tourism marini et al 2019 the very limited water availability puts the natural vegetation under water stress affecting its morpho structural characteristics and in turn the detected lai overall resulting in rather low values of summer pm10 removal efficiency minimum autumn removal efficiencies may then be explained by a combination of factors including phenology and the limiting climate conditions e g prolonged dry spells extending past the summer indeed some authors who analyzed precipitation deficits in apulia over time have reported a considerable contribution by the autumn months to the overall observed negative precipitation trend polimenio and casarano 2004 when comparing pm10 removal efficiencies between mcs it is noteworthy that all fgs exhibit their best performances in rc which may be indicative of healthier natural vegetation in terms of both structure e g horizontal and vertical geometric complexity and functionality e g productivity nutrient cycling etc bréda 2008 this in turn could be facilitated by more favorable biotic abiotic environmental conditions or lack of excessive disturbances enforced by pollution and urbanization dynamics and landscape fragmentation similar considerations may be put forward to explain why the fgs in ba all exhibit the worst observed performances apart from summer multi stress the natural vegetation in ba has been heavily fragmented by the synergistic action of centuries of traditional agricultural practices salimonti et al 2013 and local modern urban development patterns curtis 2013 such factors may contribute to diminishing the estimated removal efficiency by affecting the lai by comparison in ge and rc the seasonal peak average removal efficiencies are over three times as high as the peak values observed in ba natural areas in these two mcs and in ge particularly are indeed much more extensive and unfragmented evergreen broadleaves are the overall best performing fg as they display the highest annual average removal efficiencies in all three mcs 16 74 11 80 and 4 43 kg ha and in rc ge and ba respectively with particular reference to ge and ba this result is due to the maintenance of high seasonal efficiency values throughout the year especially during the autumn in ge and ba deciduous broadleaves display the highest seasonal average removal efficiencies among the three fgs respectively 32 89 and 8 98 kg ha however leaf abscission causes a drastic decrease in autumn average removal efficiency which eventually becomes null in the winter when canopy cover is completely lost conifers proved considerably less effective at removing pm10 compared to the other two fgs with values that are generally lower and less consistent throughout the year this finding is in disagreement with previous studies that have found the morpho functional and anatomical traits of conifers e g waxes trichomes high stomatal densities etc to be particularly well suited for pm10 deposition beckett et al 2000 chen et al 2017 jin et al 2021 however when comparing their performance with those of the other two fgs in ge and rc on one hand and in ba on the other we found that conifers in ba are subject to a much lower relative decrease in average removal efficiency than either the evergreen or the deciduous broadleaves our findings may thus be indicative of a good response by needle leaved species to the combination of heat and water stress and anthropic pressure affecting ba which may be relevant for reforestation guidelines in vulnerable mediterranean urban areas according to our results to guarantee an effective es provision with continuity throughout the year maintaining the functional diversity in species composition of urban green spaces and peri urban forests is crucial manes et al 2014 functional diversity also ensures multifunctionality which translates into the concurrent provision of multiple ess by vegetation including temperature regulation carbon storage runoff retention and recreation lausi et al 2022 sebastiani and fares 2023 we argue that policymakers and stakeholders involved in new urban and peri urban forestation strategies should bare this in mind for their upcoming work annual monetary benefits generated by the regulating es of pm10 removal in 2019 vary substantially among the three mcs with a difference of one order of magnitude between the estimates obtained for ge and rc on one hand and ba on the other as hinted above such a discrepancy reflects the sheer difference in overall green cover extent exhibited by the mcs from the total annual es monetary value and total surface area of each mc we derived annual monetary value per spatial unit amounting to approximately 313 000 km2 142 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 and for ge rc and ba respectively the difference in the values obtained is striking and describes well the diversity in terms of both the condition and the extent of natural capital in the three mcs this is a useful indicator to guide ugi planning efforts and evaluate them against policy objectives or scenario analysis it is estimated that in ba almost 100 000 ha 26 are devolved to the production of olives istat 2022b a similar figure emerges from the assessment of the corine land cover class olive groves code 223 olive trees olea europea are an evergreen broadleaved species with a slow vegetative growth that however excluding a short period of vegetative rest during the coldest months is continuous year round although beyond the scope of the present study given the large number of olive trees in ba their potential to contribute to air filtration may not be negligible biophysical and monetary quantification of pm10 removal by olive groves should therefore be accounted for to give a more accurate account of es provision in a territory where the agricultural landscape is so dominant and where reforestation projects should focus on re establishing or improving landscape connectivity between natural areas by making use of ugi elements that are transversal to different lulc classes 5 limitations of the study the present study is subject to some general limitations that should be addressed the first is concerned with the use of a deposition velocity vd value that is scaled according to lai values this is indeed a strong assumption as it is known that vd is influenced by several variables ranging from air temperature and humidity to wind speed and species specific traits e g leaf morphology hirabayashi et al 2011 however since ad hoc studies are needed to properly estimate dry deposition velocities of pm10 on different types of vegetation such approximation has been widely accepted in previous research conducted at similar scales sebastiani et al 2021 secondly as previously observed by manes et al 2016 it is known that the model strongly relies on lai such that the spatiotemporal patterns in pm10 removal efficiency are closely influenced by these data the monetary evaluation is based on the voly externality value calculated for italy nonetheless computing the voly is complex and previous european studies have produced estimates which vary considerably hein et al 2016 besides that one should also keep in mind that ugi provides multiple ess carbon storage climate regulation recreation that should be also accounted for in order to provide a comprehensive monetary evaluation szkop et al 2020 6 conclusion in this study we have investigated the potential of the ugis of ge ba and rc three italian coastal mcs along a latitudinal gradient to contribute to the improvement of air quality through pm10 removal we briefly summarize the main findings as follows i mirroring lai spatial and temporal patterns pm10 removal efficiency was greatest in the summer in ge and rc and in the spring in ba total removal reflected total green cover extent and was thus greatest in ge 5351 24 mg followed closely by rc 4248 00 mg and considerably lower in ba 363 18 mg ii evergreen broadleaves displayed the best removal performances exhibiting both the highest annual average removal efficiencies in the three mcs 11 80 4 43 and 16 74 kg ha in ge ba and rc respectively and the highest seasonal average efficiency 36 49 kg ha in the summer in rc deciduous broadleaves also exhibited high removal efficiency values although leaf abscission in the autumn and winter hinders continuous es provision throughout the year conifers proved generally less effective than the other two fgs though results in ba indicate they may show a good response to the combination of extreme climate conditions and anthropic pressure in accordance with site specific characteristics and natural vegetation potential of target areas maintaining a functionally mixed species composition in the ugis is desirable for guaranteeing the continuous provision of es iii the monetary benefits deriving from es provision estimated through evaluation of the externality costs of pm10 pollution amounted to eur 574 64 million eur 39 00 million and eur 456 17 million for ge ba and rc respectively in conclusion the use of biophysical and monetary estimates of pm10 removal in three italian coastal mcs can support local administrations with the preparation of urban and peri urban reforestation plans at the local and regional scale with the general objective of maximizing the provision of multiple es mapping of pm10 removal may further support the evaluation of the existence of trade offs and synergies between es or identify areas with a potential mismatch between es supply and demand overall contributing to a more efficient and sustainable planning of the ugis and in turn to evaluate

planned on investing about eur 300 million of the next generation eu funds in urban reforestation programs that will target italian metropolitan cities mcs successful implementation of such interventions is underpinned by a thorough knowledge of the presence and distribution of existing vegetation and its capacity to deliver ess in the present study we selected three italian coastal mcs along a latitudinal gradient namely genoa bari and reggio calabria and assessed the regulating es of pm10 removal by urban and peri urban forests in both biophysical and monetary terms in 2019 the total pm10 removal in the mcs of genoa bari and reggio calabria amounted to 5 331 363 and 4 248 mg respectively for a corresponding monetary value of eur 536 39 and 435 million our analyses were conducted on a seasonal basis and further aimed at investigating the role of functional diversity in es provision according to our findings in all mcs the highest annual average pm10 removal efficiencies were exhibited by the evergreen broadleaves deciduous broadleaves also displayed high efficiency values despite being characterized by a marked seasonality caused by leaf abscission conifers proved less efficient although our findings may indicate a good response to a condition of multi stress maintaining a functionally mixed species composition in the ugis is desirable for

data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 scientific background as reported by the european environment agency eea air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk factor in europe eea 2020 pm which is a heterogeneous mix of solid and liquid suspended particles of variable dimension and chemical composition is regarded as a major concern who 2021a gbd 2016 risk factor collaborators 2017 indeed many epidemiological studies have consistently reported adverse effects on the human health ranging from cardiovascular and respiratory disease to carcinogenesis caused by both short term rohr and wyzga 2012 and long term exposure li et al 2003 atkinson et al 2014 wyzga and rohr 2015 the severity of these effects as well as their transport processes in the air is largely determined by the particles aerodynamic properties who 2021b which have a strong dependence on size according to their aerodynamic diameter particles can be classified as coarse 2 5 10 µm fine 0 1 2 5 µm or ultra fine 0 1 µm reflecting their progressively greater capacity to penetrate the respiratory system and be harmful to the human health ultra fine and fine particles are together referred to as pm2 5 which is the pm size fraction encompassing the greatest number of particles however assessment of pm10 comprising all ultra fine fine and coarse particles with a diameter 10 µm is crucial because it further accounts for the major proportion of particle mass kelly and fussell 2012 and allows to cover the whole spectrum of the adverse effects posed to the human health although estimates for pm10 were not explicitly featured in their 2022 air quality report according to the eea in 2020 the death burden caused by pm2 5 in the 27 countries part of the european union eu totals an estimated 238 000 premature deaths eea 2022 providing a clear indication for pm10 additionally pm has the potential to damage anthropic materials and manufactures and act as a climate altering factor due to the scattering and adsorption of incoming solar radiation with both a warming and a cooling effect al thani et al 2018 pm pollution has a strong urban connotation mainly due to the higher density of human activities and the diversity of emission sources including traffic industry domestic fuel burning shipping etc karagulian et al 2015 with approximately 75 of the european population being urban united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 despite the declining trend in pm ambient concentrations over the last 15 years population exposure in europe is still high according to the world health organization who air quality guidelines who 2021b in 2019 respectively 81 and 97 of eu 27 urban citizens were exposed to pm10 and pm2 5 concentrations above safety standards eea 2021a the onset and progression of the sars cov 2 pandemic have sparked renewed interest among the scientific community and policymakers in finding solutions for the mitigation of air pollution in urban areas schröter et al 2022 ideally measures aimed at effectively improving air quality should target emission sources directly lafortezza et al 2018 however this is not simple to attain in practice because of the difficulty in capping human activities and of the transboundary and heterogeneous nature of pm which can originate from distant emission sources that cannot be controlled brunekreef et al 2021 in the present european landscape the capacity of natural and semi natural ecosystems to provide a variety of benefits for the human population is referred to as ecosystem services ess costanza et al 1997 daily 1997 wallace 2007 ipbes 2019 it includes the ability of urban and peri urban forests to mitigate air pollution and its negative impacts

removal via estimates of deposition mechanisms nowak et al 2006 2014 barò et al 2014 fusaro et al 2017 sebastiani et al 2021 furthermore cities are particularly vulnerable areas kabisch et al 2016 where environmental challenges are permeated by critical socioeconomic aspects newman 2006 to meet these challenges using vegetation to improve air quality has been proposed as a suitable nature based

was allocated to the urban and extra urban forestry plan which envisages the reforestation of italian mcs with the planting of 6 6 million trees by 2024 decreto del ministro della transizione ecologica 2021 this is an important occasion for italian institutions and local administrations to rethink urban design and improve urban health with projects addressing multiple challenges and focusing on urban regeneration mite 2021 to properly advise the sustainable management and efficient planning of ugis and foster economic investment in the eyes of the stakeholders more evidence quantifying the value that urban and peri urban forests hold in terms of es provision is needed blasi et al 2017 maes et al 2020 given the above premises we selected three italian coastal mcs located along a latitudinal gradient namely genoa ge bari ba and reggio calabria rc these cities have been shaped by the interplay of different geomorphological settings climates and backgrounds of socioeconomic development and anthropic pressure which resulted in diverse landscapes and urban rural configurations we acquired and processed remotely sensed data integrated into gis environment using a modeling approach the main objective of the present study was the biophysical and monetary assessment of the es of pm10 removal by urban and peri urban forests in these three mcs more specifically we aimed to i map the presence and distribution of three functional groups fgs of vegetation through a classification of remotely sensed data ii characterize and map pm10 removal on a seasonal basis iii define the role of functional diversity in es provision by describing pm10 removal for the three fgs iv evaluate the monetary benefits granted by the provision of es given that ess potential is closely linked to both functional and structural aspects of the vegetation we expect to observe an effect of the specific lulc mosaic on es provision that is different in each mc and which varies with the degree of anthropic pressure climatic factors further contribute to determine the specific conditions of stress felt by local vegetation as well as its stress responses such that pm10 removal efficiencies are expected to highlight a better performance in those fgs that are functionally adapted to stress variables particularly water and heat 1 2 relevance toward the achievement of the global sustainable development goals cities are a primary focus of the united nations un 2030 agenda for sustainable development with over half of the world population living in urban areas and projections pointing to 6 5 billion people by 2050 united nations department of economic and social affairs population division 2019 it is clear that cities will increasingly represent a strategic stage for the achievement of the sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 the sustainable transformation of cities and communities as envisaged in goal 11 necessarily requires coordinated and transversal actions that embrace all three dimensions of sustainability environmental economic and social purvis et al 2019 and this is indeed reflected in the broad scope of its related targets target 11 6 explicitly frames the improvement of air quality as essential for the reduction of the environmental impact of cities and the annual mean levels of pm2 5 and pm10 were chosen as one of the two indicators to be used to assess progress towards this target because it provides quantitative and spatialized information regarding the actual impact of ugis on concentration levels modeling pm10 removal in large metropolitan areas is therefore crucial to evaluate strategical actions to satisfy the specific requirements the most relevant aspect in the case of pm is linked to the detrimental impacts on human health with target 9 of goal 3 good health and well being being set to reduce the mortality rate attributed to ambient air pollution among others the use of ugi to reduce pm concentration levels will directly contribute to addressing this goal although the findings emerging from the present work do not directly quantify other measures of es provision the multi functionality and system based approach of ugis hawken et al 2021 which provide a wide variety of benefits capable of supporting the health and well being of urban citizens in many ways clearly mirrors to transversality of the sdg framework specifically we think our results can contribute to evaluating the achievement of goal 13 and 15 respectively climate action and life on land frantzeskaki et al 2019 de la sota et al 2019 kowarik et al 2020 2 methods pm10 removal was estimated using a spatially explicit modeling approach that integrates multiple freely available remotely

calabria introduced by national law in 2014 legge 7 aprile 2014 n 56 mcs are relatively recent administrative entities constituted by a set of municipalities reporting to a capital municipality that controls and coordinates the local governance because of its geographic conformation and the specific history of human settlement and socioeconomic development urbanization in italy has occurred predominantly in coastal areas munafò 2021 indeed ten out of the fourteen mcs are located in the coastal belt they host approximately 14 5 million people almost 24 of the total national population while occupying only 10 of national land istat 2022a reflecting the country s geologic climatic orographic and socioeconomic diversity each mc represents a unique example of urbanization with different degrees of anthropic pressure urbanization processes are responsible for the transition from natural to artificial cover also referred to as soil consumption amato et al 2017 that captures

classification of sentinel 2 imagery sensed in the summer of 2019 using a maximum likelihood algorithm the sentinel 2 multispectral instrument msi samples 13 spectral bands with different spatial resolution four bands at 10 m six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m three bands belong to the so called red edge a spectral region in the near infrared where changes in reflectance are conducive to the study of vegetation we used the sentinel 2 level 2a product which is derived from the level 1c product and directly provides bottom of atmosphere boa corrected reflectance images esa 2015 satellite images were processed using the open source sentinel application platform snap for the exploitation of earth observation data to train a maximum likelihood algorithm an adequate number of regions of interest roi was first collected using available lulc base maps as a reference a total of six lulc classes were identified artificial surfaces cultivated and uncultivated land which includes pastures bare areas or other areas with sparse vegetation water bodies and three fgs of vegetation that is evergreen broadleaves deciduous broadleaves and conifers manes et al 2012 notably the class of artificial surfaces was obtained from a soil consumption classification produced for the year 2019 by the italian institute for environmental protection and research ispra which mapped impervious surfaces for the whole national territory with a spatial resolution of 10 m by integrating photointerpretation of sentinel 2 imagery and ground validation this soil consumption layer provides a reliable spatial description of local urbanization processes and of their effects on the extent and degree of fragmentation of natural ecosystems amato et al 2017 the classification was then evaluated by calculating the overall accuracy which proved in all cases to be over 70 2 3 average seasonal leaf area index leaf area index lai is a dimensionless vegetation index defined as the one sided green leaf area or total needle surface area in the case of conifers per unit ground surface area it is descriptive of the structure phenology and functional quality of the forest canopy bréda 2008 lai data for the year 2019 were obtained from the copernicus global land service cgls lai product which is freely available on the cgls website the cgls lai product is derived from daily proba v s1 top of the atmosphere toa reflectance data and made available for download as a 10 days temporal composite with a spatial resolution of 300 m for our purposes we averaged lai data on a seasonal basis using the gis software grass gis for each mc for the deciduous broadleaves lai values were computed following their period of vegetative growth winter average lai was therefore arbitrarily considered equal to 0 and autumn values averaged up to the 24th of october after which we assumed the onset of abscission marando et al 2016 2 4 average seasonal pm10 concentrations pm10 concentration data were obtained in the context of the bigdata in environmental and occupational epidemiology beep project funded by the italian national institute for insurance against accidents at work inail which had the general objective of assessing the public health impacts of atmospheric pollution and air temperature on the population at the national scale in particular a five stage modeling strategy based on random forest methods was implemented to predict pm10 pm2 5 and pm10 2 5 daily concentrations at 1 km2 spatial resolution across italy for the years 2013 2015 the model calibrates ground level pm concentrations from routine monitoring networks using aerosol optical depth aod data meteorological parameters spatio temporal data e g normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and a variety of spatial data e g geo climatic zones point emission sources and land cover data as main predictors in this study daily pm10 concentration data for the year 2015 were seasonally averaged and then extracted and utilized to derive four maps of average seasonal pm10 concentration for each mc each maintaining a spatial resolution of 1 km2 for more detailed information regarding the methodology and the model the reader may refer to stafoggia et al 2019 2 5 modeling pm10 deposition dry deposition of pm10 was estimated using the equation first proposed by nowak et al 1994 and then re applied in different studies manes et al 2016 the equation is reported below q f l t where q is the amount of pm10 kg ha adsorbed to the leaf cuticle f is the pollutant flux estimated as the product of the deposition velocity vd m s of pm10 and its concentration c µg m3 l is the lai t refers to the time interval s which for our purposes was set equal to the length of each season for the fg of deciduous broadleaves we assumed a period of vegetative growth of 218 days going from the beginning of spring to mid autumn vd is derived from a median value of 0 0064 m s which was estimated for an average lai of 6 and thus obtained by adjusting to the actual lai value escobedo and novak 2009 the model integrated with land cover data obtained through the classification was implemented at pixel level in grass gis separate runs were launched for each fg in each season and mc four maps of average seasonal removal efficiency kg ha of pm10 were obtained for each of the three mcs by summing removal efficiencies over the total extent covered by each fg and using appropriate unit conversion factors seasonal and total pm10 removal mg could be estimated 2 6 monetary evaluation monetary evaluation of es provision by each fg was conducted on a seasonal basis using the externality value of pm10 fusaro et al 2017 externalities can be defined as the hidden socioeconomic public health and environmental costs that are not otherwise recognized by the market the externality value of pm10 was estimated based on the value of a life year voly and it s equal to 107 384 mg of pollutant for italy eea 2021b voly is an estimate of damage costs based upon the reduction of life expectancy the latter being measured in potential years of life lost yoll therefore our evaluation covers the avoided estimated costs attributable to pm10 removal by the vegetation 3 results 3 1 land use and land cover classification fig 2 a c shows the lulc maps for the three mcs table 2a 2b 2c

respectively are the fg and period displaying highest removal efficiencies 16 74 and 30 82 kg ha table 5a average removal efficiency by fg and season is lowest in conifers 10 81 kg ha and for the winter 2 73 kg ha in total the vegetation in rc removed 4248 00 mg of pm10 table 5b 3 5 monetary evaluation of the regulating ecosystem service of pm10 removal total estimated monetary values of pm10 removal by season and by fg in the three mcs are reported in table 6a 6b 6c monetary estimation is strictly dependent on the biophysical evaluation given by total removals for the year 2019 the total monetary value for the es of pm10 removal amounted to eur 574 64 million in ge eur 39 00 million in ba and lastly eur 456 17 million in rc 4 discussion average seasonal removal efficiency which is strictly linked to the estimated lai manes et al 2016 follows two distinct temporal patterns in ge and rc it peaks in the summer and reaches a minimum in winter however in ba all three fgs exhibit the highest and lowest values in the spring and autumn respectively such a finding is explained by the local climate conditions winter is traditionally the wet season and water availability in the spring is good while temperatures progressively become milder overall improving the abiotic conditions for the natural vegetation and possibly anticipating the onset of the period of vegetative growth additionally the region of apulia where ba is located is frequently and hardly hit by drought with some areas even considered to be at risk of desertification ladisa et al 2010 precipitation in late spring and summer is scarce a condition which is exacerbated by the increasing temperatures polemio and casarano 2004 and by the water demand posed by intensive agricultural activities and other forms of anthropic pressure that show a marked seasonality such as tourism marini et al 2019 the very limited water availability puts the natural vegetation under water stress affecting its morpho structural characteristics and in turn the detected lai overall resulting in rather low values of summer pm10 removal efficiency minimum autumn removal efficiencies may then be explained by a combination of factors including phenology and the limiting climate conditions e g prolonged dry spells extending past the summer indeed some authors who analyzed precipitation deficits in apulia over time have reported a considerable contribution by the autumn months to the overall observed negative precipitation trend polimenio and casarano 2004 when comparing pm10 removal efficiencies between mcs it is noteworthy that all fgs exhibit their best performances in rc which may be indicative of healthier natural vegetation in terms of both structure e g horizontal and vertical geometric complexity and functionality e g productivity nutrient cycling etc bréda 2008 this in turn could be facilitated by more favorable biotic abiotic environmental conditions or lack of excessive disturbances enforced by pollution and urbanization dynamics and landscape fragmentation similar considerations may be put forward to explain why the fgs in ba all exhibit the worst observed performances apart from summer multi stress the natural vegetation in ba has been heavily fragmented by the synergistic action of centuries of traditional agricultural practices salimonti et al 2013 and local modern urban development patterns curtis 2013 such factors may contribute to diminishing the estimated removal efficiency by affecting the lai by comparison in ge and rc the seasonal peak average removal efficiencies are over three times as high as the peak values observed in ba natural areas in these two mcs and in ge particularly are indeed much more extensive and unfragmented evergreen broadleaves are the overall best performing fg as they display the highest annual average removal efficiencies in all three mcs 16 74 11 80 and 4 43 kg ha and in rc ge and ba respectively with particular reference to ge and ba this result is due to the maintenance of high seasonal efficiency values throughout the year especially during the autumn in ge and ba deciduous broadleaves display the highest seasonal average removal efficiencies among the three fgs respectively 32 89 and 8 98 kg ha however leaf abscission causes a drastic decrease in autumn average removal efficiency which eventually becomes null in the winter when canopy cover is completely lost conifers proved considerably less effective at removing pm10 compared to the other two fgs with values that are generally lower and less consistent throughout the year this finding is in disagreement with previous studies that have found the morpho functional and anatomical traits of conifers e g waxes trichomes high stomatal densities etc to be particularly well suited for pm10 deposition beckett et al 2000 chen et al 2017 jin et al 2021 however when comparing their performance with those of the other two fgs in ge and rc on one hand and in ba on the other we found that conifers in ba are subject to a much lower relative decrease in average removal efficiency than either the evergreen or the deciduous broadleaves our findings may thus be indicative of a good response by needle leaved species to the combination of heat and water stress and anthropic pressure affecting ba which may be relevant for reforestation guidelines in vulnerable mediterranean urban areas according to our results to guarantee an effective es provision with continuity throughout the year maintaining the functional diversity in species composition of urban green spaces and peri urban forests is crucial manes et al 2014 functional diversity also ensures multifunctionality which translates into the concurrent provision of multiple ess by vegetation including temperature regulation carbon storage runoff retention and recreation lausi et al 2022 sebastiani and fares 2023 we argue that policymakers and stakeholders involved in new urban and peri urban forestation strategies should bare this in mind for their upcoming work annual monetary benefits generated by the regulating es of pm10 removal in 2019 vary substantially among the three mcs with a difference of one order of magnitude between the estimates obtained for ge and rc on one hand and ba on the other as hinted above such a discrepancy reflects the sheer difference in overall green cover extent exhibited by the mcs from the total annual es monetary value and total surface area of each mc we derived annual monetary value per spatial unit amounting to approximately 313 000 km2 142 000 km2 and 10 000 km2 and for ge rc and ba respectively the difference in the values obtained is striking and describes well the diversity in terms of both the condition and the extent of natural capital in the three mcs this is a useful indicator to guide ugi planning efforts and evaluate them against policy objectives or scenario analysis it is estimated that in ba almost 100 000 ha 26 are devolved to the production of olives istat 2022b a similar figure emerges from the assessment of the corine land cover class olive groves code 223 olive trees olea europea are an evergreen broadleaved species with a slow vegetative growth that however excluding a short period of vegetative rest during the coldest months is continuous year round although beyond the scope of the present study given the large number of olive trees in ba their potential to contribute to air filtration may not be negligible biophysical and monetary quantification of pm10 removal by olive groves should therefore be accounted for to give a more accurate account of es provision in a territory where the agricultural landscape is so dominant and where reforestation projects should focus on re establishing or improving landscape connectivity between natural areas by making use of ugi elements that are transversal to different lulc classes 5 limitations of the study the present study is subject to some general limitations that should be addressed the first is concerned with the use of a deposition velocity vd value that is scaled according to lai values this is indeed a strong assumption as it is known that vd is influenced by several variables ranging from air temperature and humidity to wind speed and species specific traits e g leaf morphology hirabayashi et al 2011 however since ad hoc studies are needed to properly estimate dry deposition velocities of pm10 on different types of vegetation such approximation has been widely accepted in previous research conducted at similar scales sebastiani et al 2021 secondly as previously observed by manes et al 2016 it is known that the model strongly relies on lai such that the spatiotemporal patterns in pm10 removal efficiency are closely influenced by these data the monetary evaluation is based on the voly externality value calculated for italy nonetheless computing the voly is complex and previous european studies have produced estimates which vary considerably hein et al 2016 besides that one should also keep in mind that ugi provides multiple ess carbon storage climate regulation recreation that should be also accounted for in order to provide a comprehensive monetary evaluation szkop et al 2020 6 conclusion in this study we have investigated the potential of the ugis of ge ba and rc three italian coastal mcs along a latitudinal gradient to contribute to the improvement of air quality through pm10 removal we briefly summarize the main findings as follows i mirroring lai spatial and temporal patterns pm10 removal efficiency was greatest in the summer in ge and rc and in the spring in ba total removal reflected total green cover extent and was thus greatest in ge 5351 24 mg followed closely by rc 4248 00 mg and considerably lower in ba 363 18 mg ii evergreen broadleaves displayed the best removal performances exhibiting both the highest annual average removal efficiencies in the three mcs 11 80 4 43 and 16 74 kg ha in ge ba and rc respectively and the highest seasonal average efficiency 36 49 kg ha in the summer in rc deciduous broadleaves also exhibited high removal efficiency values although leaf abscission in the autumn and winter hinders continuous es provision throughout the year conifers proved generally less effective than the other two fgs though results in ba indicate they may show a good response to the combination of extreme climate conditions and anthropic pressure in accordance with site specific characteristics and natural vegetation potential of target areas maintaining a functionally mixed species composition in the ugis is desirable for guaranteeing the continuous provision of es iii the monetary benefits deriving from es provision estimated through evaluation of the externality costs of pm10 pollution amounted to eur 574 64 million eur 39 00 million and eur 456 17 million for ge ba and rc respectively in conclusion the use of biophysical and monetary estimates of pm10 removal in three italian coastal mcs can support local administrations with the preparation of urban and peri urban reforestation plans at the local and regional scale with the general objective of maximizing the provision of multiple es mapping of pm10 removal may further support the evaluation of the existence of trade offs and synergies between es or identify areas with a potential mismatch between es supply and demand overall contributing to a more efficient and sustainable planning of the ugis and in turn to evaluate

24157,land use change affected by rapid urbanization economic development and political influences as a crucial factor to ecosystem services ess irrational land use is likely to bring about loss of some ecosystem services ess in the meanwhile the trade offs occur among the ess are also changing this research aims to coordinate the relationship of ess for land use planning under different scenarios in tumen river region the essay has been organized in the following way initially we analyzed the impact on 6 ess in the context of the local land use change furthermore we explored their trade offs among the ess and seek to provide theoretical support to planning and management in the tumen river region here we used data from 1996 to 2006 and 2006 2016 to examine how the ecosystem services are affected by trade offs in three different scenarios baseline development bd fast development fd and harmonious development hd by using casa and usle models additionally with the help of integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model we assessed 6 ecosystem services not only including meat production mp net primary production npp habitat quality hq but crop production cp soil conservation sc water retention wr as well during 1996 2016 firstly we demonstrated the numerous trade offs and or synergistic interactions between ess then we assessed these ess at the regional scale based on the 3 scenarios finally we explored the optimal scenario results show that 1 it was significant that the dramatic land use change in the study area from 1996 to 2016 especially in cultivated land and forested land 2 the total esv in the study area initially decreased and then increased and showed a gradual improvement trend during 1996 2016 3 multiple ess in addition to 2 ess containing habitat quality hq and soil conservation sc there are also water retention wr and net primary productivity npp during 1996 2016 showed positive correlations however crop and meat production vs soil retention was not significantly correlated in the study period 4 among all scenario simulations ess showed the most improvement in the hd scenario and following closely behind are the bd scenario and the fd scenario the bd scenario had fewer trade offs compared with against 2016 and the hd and fd scenarios had more 5 relative to the catchment area the hd scenario is the optimal situation our findings will provide some references for the construction of land use management and ecological civilization in cross border area keywords ecosystem services ess trade offs land use scenarios the tumen river cross border area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction it is well known that humans directly or indirectly acquire lots of ecosystem services ess from ecosystems such as crop production cp water yield wy and also carbon storage cs the goods that is essential to maintain global life support systems or promote human welfare costanza et al 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 however along with the decline in ecosystem services comes a decline in biodiversity there is no doubt that the study of past ess will facilitate the research of ess under different scenarios in the present and future times millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 human health and survival are gravely threatened by the decline in ess millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 to some extent human actions also influence the processes and composition of the ess burkhard et al 2012 with the acceleration of the urbanization it appears that people have a greater demand than ever for food wood electricity shelter and other commodities and services which have caused an unreasonable land use spatial pattern foley et al 2005 the acute land use change has been a principal element reducing ess gradually as we all know regulating provisioning habitat and cultural services are the 4 types of ecosystem services teeb foundations 2010 there are plenty of es methods to distinguish quantify map or model the supplies and even streams of multiple ess as well as the synergies and trade offs exist between them as a result of different choices karimi et al 2021 the natural ecosystem s most immediate reaction to human activity is a change in land usage in other words change in ess is an obvious and instant sign of land use change it is easy to find that there are more and more scientists and decision makers thrown themselves into examining the connection between change in land use and ess which has received much more attention shi et al 2021 nowadays with the progress of the technology and the gradual increase of people s needs the relationship between ecosystem services become more complex and constantly changing than before in other words it can be understood as a trade off occurring in the middle of multiple ess sun and li 2017 there is a situation that when a decline in one es is accompanied by an increase in another es called trades off it is probably contributed to the interactions between ecosystem services or indirectly to multiple ecosystem services responding simultaneously to the same driver of change as an illustration a rise in crop production and consequent increase in nutrient runoff could cause a drop in water quality bennett et al 2009 providing scientific and professional information related to ecosystem modification for decision makers is the millennium ecosystem assessment ma s primary goal with the gradual deterioration of the global warming the related problem that it caused has received the attention of the majority of experts and scholars including methods to assess the state of related ecosystem services along with how stakeholders are affected by trade offs in benefit distribution cross the space of spatial and temporal scales s r carpenter et al 2009 hein et al 2006 j p rodriguez et al 2006 de groot et al 2010 tallis et al 2008 ring et al 2010 silvestri and kershaw 2010 when we refer to ecosystem services it is natural to associate it with the relationship between land use nevertheless lucc will deeply change the earth landscape and directly have an influence on ecosystem services it is no longer just a study issue of geography but has gradually become a study hotspot for all majors such as ecology environmental sciences and the related disciplines smith and orr 2012 mansue et al 2016 in generally speaking lots of study concerning the trade offs between ess and human welfare has been done recently for example feng et al suggested a novel analysis framework to couple the trade offs of ess and supply demand dynamics by referring previous studies feng et al 2021 wu et al used multi source data and integrated explicit assessment methodologies to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics and trade off changes in eight ess in loess plateau from 2000 to 2015 fan et al 2022 pan et al conducted a comprehensive review article about the trade offs and synergies of forest ecosystem services by referring 216 articles quan et al 2022 the research is helpful to make the decision makers have a deeper and better understanding and awareness on the balance of economic benefits and ecosystem services also it is the same for the well being of the people howe et al 2014 li et al 2016 many studies turn out that the overuse of the land by human beings will bring about serious environmental problems xu et al 2016 it is a fact that reforestation is a wise decision which can not only increase the greening rate but also improve people s living quality however it brings carbon sequestration and soil conservation inevitably more surface runoff is being lost dymond et al 2012 the above mentioned studies had some limitations on the one hand it is easy to find that today s research mostly focused on present ess trade offs it is inevitable to ignore the future ess evaluation based on multiple land use scenarios on the other hand due to esv is spatially heterogeneous previous case studies and conclusions cannot be easily extended to the cross border areas therefore it is an essential step to reevaluate the interaction among ess in coordinating the issue of rapid urbanization and ecological construction andrade et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 the ma which was completed in 2001 and is based on 2 factors containing land use change and the assessment of ess it has gradually increased public awareness of the significance of the trade off between management and ecosystem services mace 2013 maes et al 2011 in general spatial mapping scenario simulation and statistical analysis are some of the research methods nowadays scenario analysis has become one of the main methods in the study of trade offs and synergies for future ess deng et al 2016 different land use scenarios can be come up with in order to investigate how ess change under various scenarios and how this change will affect them plenty of suggestions and policies can be put forward to different land use planning scenarios li and wang 2018 harmáˇcková and vaˇckáˇr 2015 for instance zhao et al took dongting lake basin as study area they simulated 2 ess of grain production and water purification by setting various scenarios in 2035 and also figured out the effects of land use policies on ess and their trade offs yanni et al 2023 however the quantification and trade offs analysis of ess is a key issue in the comprehensive evaluation of ess and land use management wang et al 2017 quantification estimations show that the ecosystem services vary in accordance with changes in land use robinson et al 2013 nowadays a great number of research on evaluating ess have conducted by the scholars through remote sensing and gis technology including integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest adrienne et al 2014 it is an integrated assessment model and widely used to quantify ess in many regions in iran some scholars evaluated the habitat quality in mangrove forest where is along iran s southern shores between 2010 and 2021 based on the invest model fatemeh et al 2023 benra et al regard southern chile as study area this team evaluate the water yield in 1998 2007 and 2013 based on data of 224 catchments by using the model benra et al 2021 besides artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries villa et al 2014 and saores as tools are usually combined with the modeling and prediction of ess hu et al 2015 however there are still some limitations in these studies firstly it is indisputable that we have received the kinds of ess from the ecosystem but it is gradually developed into a consensus that the interaction between ess has become a sufficient difficulty in the aspect of ecosystem management methods cai et al 2016 van jaarsveld et al 2005 secondly the majority of earlier studies tended to concentrate on both the past and current ess there is not too much research on the future scenario therefore it is easy to find a gap between ecosystem services and land use scenarios lauf et al 2014 fu et al 2015 eventually there are still some shortcomings in present lulc simulation scenario research t l sohl and claggett 2013 for example it is hard for the patch evolution of natural land use to find the fundamental and potential factors of land use changes meentemeyer et al 2013 yang et al 2020 to solve this problem a series of models came out which are created by the experts and scholars among them the plus model which is commonly used for simulation of patch level land use it is one of the more representative and the most non linear relationships hidden behind lulc were simulated by it besides it also makes the impacts of lulc on potential ess in a more accurate representation of under different future policy scenarios liang et al 2021 based on this it is necessary to simulate the potential for future lulc development accurately which is not only favorable for the subsequent ess to quantify and evaluate but also helpful to achieve the ideal development scenarios by analyzing the trade offs and synergistic effects of ess fang et al 2020 k wu et al 2013 synergies and trade offs are typically discussed with reference to relationships between ess yang et al 2018 by making use of grid based correlation analysis and spatial superposition sun et al analyzed spatial heterogeneity of multiple ess interactions and trades offs in the guanzhong and hanzhong basins sun and liu 2020 gao et al quantitatively simulate 3 kinds of ess including soil conservation water yield and carbon sequestration in beijing during 2015 2018 besides 5 major watersheds of beijing were not only regarded as the research object for quantitative analysis but compared local ess interactions with one another in terms of spatial trade offs and synergies gao and zuo 2021 demestihas et al examined the cascade linking agricultural practices with ecosystem functions and services to evaluate the correlation patterns among five ecosystem services in apple orchards demestihas et al 2019 by using two means of esci and estd jie et al compared the changes tradeoffs and synergies of es based on various land use schemes j gong et al 2019 xun et al took pearl river delta region prd as the study subject and presented ugb flus model which could be integrated with the establishment of urban growth boundaries between 2020 and 2050 liang et al 2018 wu et al proposed a multi criteria approach for better understanding the relationship between synergies and trade offs of ess and tested it in hong kong macao greater bay area linlin et al 2022 huang et al took tibet autonomous region as the study area they quantified 6 ess during 1995 2015 and used the pearson correlation coefficient to examine the links between paired ess also this team used k means cluster analysis to identify the tos bundles and analyzed the factors which are leading to changes in social ecology jiuming et al 2023 huang et al quantified 6 ess in wujiang basin and analyzed the trade offs synergies among them moreover they also investigated the underlying driving factors among esbs fengxian et al 2023 as economy rapidly develops land use activities continually intensify which seriously affect the supply of ess bryan et al 2018 and this is evidenced by impacts on provisioning priess et al 2007 regulating yang et al 2016 and cultural services sun and li 2017 changes in land use can also lead to different trade offs between ess some research also demonstrates that while increased land use intensity can improve food production which also increased soil erosion although extensive forestation improves habitat quality increases carbon stocks and promotes soil conservation it can also result in loss of surface runoff qiao et al 2019 research that is considered the analysis of es trade offs and synergistic into land use change is beneficial to provide the theoretical advice related to ecosystem management decisions in this research tumen river region is used as the study area with the continuous acceleration of the china s urbanization the implementation of the one belt and one road initiative have created some unprecedented opportunities but also brought many challenges to the border areas especially to the research area the tumen river region is not merely a relatively complete core area of ecological security in the northeast border but a national ecological and environmental safety reserve as well however due to the construction of modern cities there are many unresolved environmental issues in the region such as excessive deforestation and the decrease in ess caused by the transfer of forestland and grassland to cropland the habitat quality in the tumen river region the central hub of one belt and one road initiative is linked to the integrated benefits and ecological security of the region and its neighbors in summary the study aims to investigate the changes in 6 ess in the research area based on various land use scenarios we hope to solve the tumen river region s ecosystem issues by studying ess based on different land use scenarios hence this study accomplishes the following 1 considering the actual situation of tumen river region we proposed a scientific framework concerning es evaluation 2 by setting up various scenarios the evolution of 6 ess were quantified in the study area 3 assessed and analyzed the trade offs and synergies between multiple es indicators interacting with each other 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tumen river is strategically located at the juncture of three countries china north korea and russia see fig 1 the middle and upper reaches of the tumen river approximately 490 km in length flow through china and north korea acting as a natural divider for these two countries while the lower reaches approximately 15 km divide north korea and russia before emptying into a delta in the east sea in addition to providing a boundary between the three countries many of the early rice cultivating settlements were located near the tumen river and its tributaries many of the smaller rural villages located on the tumen river would be either destroyed by planned construction activities or impacted in other ways because of new growth and development the river passes through several cities in china including longjing tumen and hunchun much of the area is mountainous with the remainder concentrated in coastal plains and river valleys agriculture is concentrated in the river valleys in addition to producing sur pluses in grain corn rice soybeans etc northeast china also generates surpluses in fruit and vegetables there are also abundant forest plant and animal resources as well as other natural resources in the region there is also an interesting social geography in the region the korean autonomous prefecture known as yanbian is situated on the southern corner of jilin province in 1995 the tumen river regional initiative was started by the united nations development programme the government of northeast asia is committed to working in partnership with the multiple sectors such as businesses related to transportation energy tourism investment and the environment because of the fact that as the only korean autonomous region in china which was regarded as the gateway and channel for collaboration in the tumen river region by tumen river region cooperation program besides with the increasing international cooperation that makes it gradually become the region with the best connections between china and surrounding countries cotton 1996 the area of yanbian is approximately 433 000 km2 where the offshore frontier faces the east sea yanbian which is in china s eastern jilin province fig 1 also it situated on the border of russia and korea depends on its unique geographical advantages and the continuous expansion of export oriented economy is more conductive to the region yanbian is a significant center for land sea transportation between europe north america and asia as well as a significant national natural environment barrier area jin and yujin 2001 chen et al 2009 colin 2003 as a substantial part of national one belt and one road construction due to it there are so many ports in the region facing north korea and russia debin and yahua 2015 the area also as a significant habitat provides multiple ess to the most biologically diverse region in the northern hemisphere there are the greatest number of amur leopards and manchurian tigers which is living in siberian breeding and inhabiting in the northeast tiger leopard national park in china where also serves as their primary habitat and breeding area l feng et al 2017 however there are over 70 of the park is located in this place this requires the study area to focus on local economic development while also managing the relationship with ecological environment protection 2 2 data sources land use maps meteorological satellite soil and statistical datasets were used in this study table 1 as table 1 demonstrates the land use map is obtained from landsat tm oli images from july 1996 august 2006 and may 2016 which is interpreted using a combination of artificial visual parse and object oriented data multi period land use data are merged in accordance with china s current land use classification ministry of land and resources 2007 and the study area s actual conditions are reclassified into six types specifically construction cultivated forested and unused land grassland and water bodies final land use maps are validated by using data from google earth and field survey data and an overall accuracy score of 91 percent is recorded 2 3 quantifying ecosystem services this paper draws on mea classification systems and teeb economics of ecosystems and biodiversity guidelines we used mathematical statistical model and invest model to evaluate 6 ess the former evaluated cropland production cp and meat production mp and the latter is applied to map the habitat quality hq and water yield wy besides the other two ess of net primary productivity npp and soil conservation sc are respectively made by casa and usle models all these models estimate the ecosystem services by drawing on biophysical data land use maps and satellite images 2 3 1 meat production mp in this study we assessed meat production service by calculating meat production efficiency which is also called meat production per unit area and not only that we also need to divide the meat production of every city county by calculating the area it occupies to calculate the local meat production efficiency su et al 2012 the study area mainly produces pork mutton and beef which are used to calculate each county s meat productivity for the years 1996 2006 and 2016 2 3 2 crop production cp the crop yield of cultivated land areas is calculated according to the method of li et al 2014 which establishes that cultivated land produces four crops maize potatoes rice and wheat the equation for cp is 1 c s x y i 1 i p x y c i s here csxy represents the total cp of cell x y in land use type s tons pxy is the area of cell x y cis refers to the yield per unit area of crop i on land use type s t km2 2 3 3 net primary production npp npp is a typical indicator of regulating services that seek to achieve carbon balance and ecosystem sustainability piao et al 2009 this model can be applied to estimate vegetation npp to a high standard and can also be used for vegetation net productivity estimation we use this model to calculate npp values and apply the following formulas 2 npp t x apar t x ε t x 3 apar t x sol t x fpar t x 0 5 here apar t x represents that the whole effective photosynthetic radiation absorbed at position t and time x gcm 2mon 1 ɛ t x represents the light energy use

circumstances gc mj 1 and the value is 0 389 gc mj 1 2 3 4 soil conservation sc soil conservation sc is defined as real soil loss versus feasible soil loss wang et al 2017 q feng et al 2017 and it represents the soil that ecosystem has retained over the course of a year we assessed soil losses by means of the usle model which are usually caused by erosion rill splash and sheet using the universal soil loss equation usle we assess soil conservation volume qiao et al 2019 5 a c a p a r 6 a p r k l s 7 a r r k l s c p s here we used ac standing for total soil conservation t hm2 a and ap for the feasible soil erosion t hm2 a ar for the real soil erosion t hm2 a k for soil erosion factor and r indicates precipitation erosion factor slope length is denoted by l ps illustrates soil conservation measure factor s expresses slope c stands for vegetation cover factor 2 3 5 water retention wr the invest model s water yield module illustrates how changes in land use patterns will impact hydropower generation and annual surface water output according to the water balance principle the amount of water that runs off the scenery is called water yield which is equivalent to the difference between actual evapotranspiration and precipitation sharp et al 2018 for each pixel on the landscape t this model calculates the annual water yield y x as follows 8 y t 1 a e t t p t p t where aet t represents actual evapotranspiration yearly for pixel t also p t represents the annual rainfall for pixel t then for obtaining water retention we altered water yield with topographic index saturated water conductivity and velocity coefficient the relevant calculation method is as follows 9 w r m i n 1 249 v e l o c i t y m i n 1 0 9 t i 3 m i n 1 k s a t 300 y 10 t i l o g d r a i n a g

elements when we set scenarios for the research area s r carpenter et al 2009 conflicts will arise between man and nature as a result of factors like demographic growth urbanization farmland goods and even soil corrosion considering the above integrated factors we set up three alternative scenarios in order to figure out the changing trends and their association among the several ess table 2 there is a new approach has emerged that regional spatial functional zoning and governance have grown in importance as a means of coordinating the sustainable growth of the people economy and resources while maximizing the overall advantages have grown in importance as a means of coordinating the sustainable growth of the people economy and resources while maximizing the overall advantages reidsma et al 2010 tao and wang 2016 in this study future development plans are combined in accordance with land use change rules from 1996 to 2016 and are applied to simulate the regional land use change in various scenarios land use change is simulated by idrisi software under three different scenarios in the planning of the three scenarios parameters are set for influencing and restricting factors including economy nature reserve population precipitation road temperature and water bodies the weight value meanwhile is calculated through the analytical hierarchical process ahp this is done in order to obtain future land use maps under three different scenarios that we have already set up in accordance with the different influences of parameters in corresponding scenarios the three scenarios are named baseline development bd scenario fast development fd scenario and harmonious development hd scenario they are described in detail in tables 2 and 3 2 5 quantification of synergies and trade offs in this study in order to guarantee the precision of quantization results data are standardized to eliminate impacts arising from the inconsistency of es units the standardized es is calculated as 12 e s s t d e s o b s e s m i n e s m a x e s m i n here esstd represents standard deviation of es esobs represents an es observation value we denote the maximum and minimum values of

bradford and d amato 2012 and the rmsd method is improved lu et al 2014 rmsd is defined as 13 r m s d 1 n 1 i 1 n e s i e s 2 in this case esi represents the average value of ess es means the i range of ess desired value except that the method of rmsd is used to reveal the relevant variance between the mean esstd and one of the esstd it is often seen as a tool of observing the degree of deviation from the mean 3 results 3 1 land use changes between 1996 and 2016 cultivated land and forest land as the two largest types of land use in the study area which respectively account for 10 24 and 84 33 of the whole region land use area during the whole study period fig 2 and table 4 during this period water bodies and forest land declined the most whereas cultivated land and grassland had a maximum growth both water bodies and forest land decreased the most construction land is the fastest growing area increasing by 247 2 km2 over the past 20 years during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 construction land increased by 193 5 km2 and 53 7 km2 the area of cultivated land climbed up and then declined during this period but eventually increased by 369 4 km2 the grassland area also follows the same pattern increasing by 297 7 km2 forested land initially decreased and then increased and finally decreased by 797 2 km2 the area of the water body followed the same pattern and then decreased during 1996 2016 and during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 it decreased by 139 km2 and increased by 20 7 km2 respectively the area of unused land in 1996 2016 basically remained unchanged table 4 3 2 changes of ecosystem services between 1996 and 2016 3 2 1 meat production mp as shown in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 average meat production in 1996 2006 and 2016 were 12 25 t km2 22 1 t km2 and 13 7 t km2 respectively reaching the highest value in 2006 the same trend can be seen in the entire period longjing and yanji which are at the center of the study area are regions with high values with annual average values while antu and hunchun have lower average annual production per unit yanji and tumen have the largest increase in average annual meat production increasing by 0 84 t km2 and 0 36 t km2 separately the annual average means of longjing and wangqing meanwhile demonstrated a decreasing trend figs 3 and 4 3 2 2 crop production cp as shown in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 from 1996 to 2016 the average values of crop production fluctuated constantly in particular in 2006 the average values of crop production were respectively 163 78 t km2 217 54 t km2 and 283 56 t km2 in 1996 2006 and 2016 annual crop production tended to increase in this period and the highest value for each year was always observed in longjing city and values of 62 85 t km2 90 45 t km2 and 63 47 t km2 were respectively recorded in 1996 2006 and 2016 on the other hand antu county remains a low value area regardless of annual crop yields and changes the output value of crops in antu helong tumen and dunhua has been increasing continuously and the increase in values are 5 65 t km2 8 04 t km2 11 97 t km2 and 24 07 t km2 respectively in the time of 1996 to 2016 hunchun city showed an increasing trend increasing by 8 87 t km2 while longjing city showed a decreasing trend decreasing by 0 63 t km2 yanji and wangqing showed an initial decline and a subsequent upward trend with the final value added being 41 84 t km2 and 18 71 t km2 respectively the most significant increases were in yanji city and dunhua city and the least obvious in longjing city figs 3 and 4 3 2 3 net primary production npp this paper also investigated the variation in spatial distribution of npp values for 1996 2016 the total value of npp was 26 87 tgc in 1996 and the average value was 621 2 gc m2 the highest value of npp was forested land with an average of 655 59 gc m2 and then there are the grassland and cultivated land which respectively recorded averages of 435 gc m2 and 463 16 gc m2 in 2006 the npp was 589 14 gc m2 and the total was 25 5 tgc which accounted for 5 09 of the decrease however in 2016 npp reached 26 21 tgc an increase of 1 14 107 gc in total there was a tendency to decrease first and then increase in this period the south of the study area was where the npp widely spread we also found that the lowest npp value for water body while unused land and forested land were the main sources of npp during the period 1996 2006 the npp values of hunchun city and wangqing county where is in the northeast of the study area decreased the most while dunhua city where is in the northwest of the study area increased the most figs 3 and 4 3 2 4 soil conservation sc during the period from 1996 to 2016 the amount of sc was enhanced significantly overall total sc accounted for 85 6 106 t in 1996 with an average of 19 9 102 t km2 forested land demonstrated the highest level of sc averaging 21 84 102 t km2 and cultivated land and grassland were immediately following which respectively recorded averages of 7 06 102 t km2 and 16 07 102 t km2 in 2006 the sc in the study area was 19 3 102 t km2 and the total value was 83 106 t which was 3 05 lower than in 1996 however in 2016 the study area s sc was 20 48 102 t km2 which represented an overall total increase of 6 13 when compared against 2006 the greatest increase was forested land up to 82 5 106 t followed by grassland and cultivated land which were 10 88 105 t and 34 4 105 t respectively higher sc values were shown in cultivated land and forested land on the contrary lower sc values were shown in unused land and water bodies the sc of dunhua city in study area s northwest increased the most but the remaining cities demonstrated varying degrees of loss figs 3 and 4 3 2 5 water retention wr wr was mainly distributed in the study area s forested land average water retention in the study area was respectively 2 97 105 m3 km2 1996 2 43 105 m3 km2 2006 and 2 93 105 m3 km2 2016 this encompassed a respective overall total of 12 86 109 m3 1996 10 45 109 m3 2006 and 12 67 109 m3 2016 forest land accounted for the largest water retention recording 3 2 105 m3 km2 1996 2 7 105 m3 km2 2006 and 3 22 105 m3 km2 2016 construction land accounted for the lowest water retention recording 1 86 104 m3 km2 1996 1 79 104 m3 km2 2006 and 1 67 104 m3 km2 2016 we can draw a conclusion that the higher water retention values were recorded in the southwest of the whole area oppositely low value areas occurred in the northeastern and eastern part the most obvious changes were the increase appearing in the north of the area and the eastern and southern areas decline figs 3 and 4 3 2 6 habitat quality hq habitat quality evaluation conducted over a three year period in the study area shows that the minimum habitat quality index was 0 which is evident from the construction and the unused land and 1 was the largest index which primarily manifested in the water bodies and forested land apart from construction land and unused land the other indexes were mostly between 0 82 and 1 the average habitat quality index across the whole area was 0 9085 0 8971 and 0 8968 area during 1996 2016 the study s habitat demonstrated a gradual decline meanwhile these changes suggested little difference in habitat quality figs 3 and 4 3 3 trade offs between multiple ess 1996 2016 with the aid of correlation analysis tool the study assessed the relationships between the multiple ess j s wu et al 2013 it is obvious to find that there are some substantial positive connections p 0 01 between ess including net primary productivity npp soil conservation sc water retention wr and habitat quality hq during the three year study period crop vs net primary production and meat production vs habitat quality these ess have important p 0 01 trade off connections but crop and meat production vs soil retention is not significantly correlated in the study period fig 5 crop and meat production services have a strong positive association showing a synergistic interaction between the two from fig 5 the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 928 to 0 658 in the study period crop and meat production services habitat quality and net primary productivity services showed significant negative correlation in 1996 2016 although there was a trade off happening in the relationship between these services the degree of the correlation still increased but habitat quality services net primary productivity services and water retention remained a positive correlation throughout the study and the strength of this correlation decreased in 1996 2006 from 0 514 to 0 353 and increased from 0 353 to 0 627 in 2006 2016 when considered as a magnitude of the correlation coefficient net primary productivity services soil retention and soil retention water retention decreased in 1996 2006 3 4 trade offs in different scenarios there are some drawbacks to correlation analysis which could only represent the correlation direction between ess rather than expose the direction of change in the spatial heterogeneity of ess thus the study area s trade off and synergy of various scenarios were analyzed through the ecosystem service trade off percentage estp fig 6 as shown in fig 6 hd and bd scenarios perform better than the 2016 percentage but these two scenarios perform worse than the 2016 percentage in the area of crop production fd scenarios perform better than the 2016 percentage in crop and meat production but show a lower level of performance in other ess when all scenarios are taken into account the fd scenario increases the most in crop and meat production evidencing respective growth rates of 19 and 42 percent the hd scenario demonstrates the best improvement in net primary productivity 0 1 percent habitat quality 0 7 percent soil conservation 1 38 percent and water retention 3 09 percent a comparison of the bd scenarios against the 2016 percentage shows an increase in multiple ess values and a decrease in crop production and net primary productivity fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the bd and hd scenarios were higher than the 2016 percentage but the fd scenario was lower than the others in general ess showed the largest improvements in the hd scenario followed by the bd scenario the bd scenario had fewer trade offs compared with against 2016 and the hd and fd scenarios the latter in particular had more under the three different scenarios it can be seen that the hd scenario could generate the largest number of overall ess while it could generate the largest number of trade offs under the fd scenario 3 5 ess spatial distributions and trade off situations in different scenarios in this study the study area is divided into 66 catchment areas the average total ess values and the ecosystem service trade off percentage estp in 2016 are compared with the results of each catchment area in the three different scenarios and then four situations are distinguished 1 the value of total ess are less than the 2016 values and the estp is greater than the 2016 value 2 the estp and total es values are less than the 2016 value 3 the estp and total es values are greater than the 2016 value 4 the estp is less than the 2016 value and total es values are greater than the 2016 value in the above four cases the first is worst and the last is optimal fig 8 fig 8 shows that in the study area situation three dominates the whole catchment area it is easy to find that each situation occupies a different percentage under different cases for situation one the percentages are 23 4 percent 2016 22 2 percent bd 23 1 percent hd 20 7 percent fd for situation two 35 9 percent 2016 31 1 percent bd 30 2 percent hd 42 2 percent fd for situation three 23 1 percent 2016 23 3 percent bd 22 4 percent hd 23 3 percent fd for situation four 17 6 percent 2016 23 4 percent bd 24 3 percent hd 13 7 percent fd through spatial analysis it is possible to confirm that the results of the catchment area obtained through three different scenarios illustrate the relative consistency of the overall spatial structure and also highlight discrepancies between localities situation one dominates the distribution in the western and southern catchment areas situation two dominates distribution in the northwest catchment area situation three dominates distribution in the eastern and western catchment area situation four dominates distribution in the northeast and southwest catchment area when bd and hd scenarios are compared with 2016 it is found that the first two situations in hd and fd scenarios have increased and bd scenarios have decreased in addition to the fd scenario situation four had increased most significantly in other scenarios fig 9 fig 9 shows the catchment area s distribution of tradeoff and total es situations in both 2016 and the three scenarios navy colors represent optimal situations and light blue represents the worst situations compared with 2016 under the bd and hd scenarios the area of the best scenario increased to 23 4 percent and 24 3 percent respectively the latter being the largest compared with 2016 in the hd and bd scenarios the overall percentage of situations one and two decreased and the hd scenario 53 3 decreased by 6 in the fd scenario the study area overall es values decreased but the area of situation three increased in situations one and three the primarily representation was the high trade offs the area percentage of situation one decreased in all scenarios and the area percentage of situation three decreased in the hd scenario and increased in the bd and fd scenarios accordingly the hd scenario is well worth considering 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of land use change on ecosystem services land use change in the tumen river region was getting worse during the last 20 years because of the factors that population increase fast urbanization the real estate market and government planning policies as a crucial component to the ecosystem of the earth millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 land use change has a profound impact on ess supply and strength as well as their interdependent processes j gong et al 2019 on the one hand both of water bodies and forested land s area had the most severe reduction while on the other hand the amount of cultivated and construction land increased significantly the increasing area of man made land surface gave rise to a decline in quantity of forested land water bodies as well as cultivated land it directly had an unfavorable effect on the provision of various ess and even altered the interactions among them under 3 scenarios that we have been set in the past 20 years construction land is the fastest growing area increasing by 247 2 km2 during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 construction land increased by 193 5 km2 and 53 7 km2 respectively table 4 our research outcomes further confirmed the previous findings that have done by haas and ban 2014 and zhang et al 2017 4 2 trade off and overall es quantifications during recent decades the large number of research has emerged including quantitative assessments of ess and their relationship analysis the influence of land use on ecological system procedure are crucial millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 which ultimately decide the state of es provision fu and zhang 2014 it is gradually come to an agreement that one of the critical factors for ess changes is the land use change in many research thus it is feasible to improve management practices that is based on ecosystem and speed up decision processes to accomplish specific goals through establishing diverse land use scenarios it is not just focused on the accuracy of the outcome of a single prediction scenario analysis might provide more than one probable outcome which is on prospective modifications to create a framework for future development hence our study used plenty of data containing the temperature and precipitation and the relevant data from 1996 2006 and 2016 to quantify multiple es values and then utilize it in different scenarios with the aim of simulating future ecosystems an improved understanding of the magnitude of the trade off value is supportive to determine the optimal scenario which makes it possible to minimize the trade offs value and maximize the over return lu et al 2014 we provide scientific theoretical basis for the optimal land use plans by referring to four situations which extend from best to worst case scenarios bradford and d amato 2012 previous research concerning study area has mainly emphasize the exploration of multiple es values with a large scale background mao et al 2019 maintained that in 2000 2015 carbon storage in northeast china s ess decreased and crop production increased yin et al 2019 concluded that in the northeast forest belt of the national barrier zone soil conservation increased and npp declined between 2000 and 2015 a longer research time span enables us to become more familiar with changes in ess we find that the four ess increased or decreased by different degrees at different stages particularly the npp values of ess were reduced the increase and decrease of regional npp are consistent with the change of forest land area indicating that land use change has a significant influence on npp above conclusions are compliance with the findings of liu et al 2015 as a result of climate change especially for the effects of temperature and rainfall on evapotranspiration groundwater flow and runoff foley et al 2005 changes in sc initially reduced and then increased while remaining above the level recorded in 1996 although the continual downward trend of hq has slowed the biggest threat to the habitat quality index is still the dramatic expansion in the construction planning area mackintosh et al 2015 the clarification of trade offs and synergy between ess is beneficial to sustainable development of the regional ecosystem there is progressively research on the synergy infection of meat production and crop production in terms of service supply at the meantime the impact is also observed to show a downward trend during 1996 2016 over time there has been a trend of temporal and spatial inconsistency between the two supply services compared to somewhere else the west of the research region is suitable for cp to widely spread in addition the eastern part of the study area showed a comparatively higher mp production regulating services hq npp sc and wr mutually synergies with each other the relationship between soil conservation and npp in the northeast forest belt region was quantified by yin et al 2019 through relatively exact data resolution 250 m and concludes that there is a weak synergy between them at different spatial scales interactions between ess have significant scale effects j p rodriguez et al 2006 as well as it is easy to find the trade offs which usually exist between regulating and provisioning services chisholm 2010 there is a weak synergy between supply and water conservation because the water retention was consistently increasing also the supply services presented a kind of increasing trend with the growth of service supply synergy becomes increasingly smaller on the one hand the continuous expansion of cultivated land drives the growth of supply capacity while on the other hand which is advantageous to the trade off effect government decision making should pay more attention to this phenomenon 4 3 scenario analysis and policy proposal understanding land use change in multiple scenarios provides a scientific way for future land use optimization the use of idris software to predict future land use changes is one of the most reliable and effective methods t l sohl and claggett 2013 this study not only applies this method based on land use change from 1996 to 2016 but also uses natural climate and socioeconomic development impact factors to predict future land use and gives two examples natural climate temperature and precipitation and socioeconomic development population and gdp finally we calculate each scenario s provisioning services through the average value of cp and mp for six types of land use in 2016 regulating service values are quantified by using climate data and predicted land use change we observe that socioeconomic development and natural climate factors will affect ess value and might even have an influence on the future land use changes noting that this also applies to multiple scenarios we construct the baseline bd fast fd and harmonious hd development scenarios which involve grain for green cultivated land reclamation and ecological protection in the bd and hd scenarios both ecological protection and grain for green can promote the improvement of overall ess however there is no significant increase in the value of npp and a decrease is also apparent in the bd scenario the results demonstrate that in addition to the forested land cultivated land also has a certain effect on regulating services and can provide regulation of es such as npp although the hd scenario provides a maximized overall ess and relatively high trade offs however when compared to the bd scenario this kind of scenario makes the trade offs of es minimize at the catchment scale considering the land use allocation in the optimal scenario the catchment area scale appears to be more desirable than pixel water scale in the fd scenario cultivated land reclamation can greatly increase provisioning service values but reduces overall ess the spatial distribution of all es trade offs at the catchment scale promotes the sustainable development of local forestry and agriculture goldstein et al 2012 however this study has certain limitations and uncertainties first the model s limitations may affect es assessment for example precipitation has a significant effect on water retention future research should focus on the seasonal variations of precipitation uncertainties in scenario simulation and the city future development plan is not only projected by government policies but supposed to be combined with the degree of the local urbanization including science and technology the introduction of talent and other impact factors although our results have some limitations they still make some scientific contributions to the local economic development and environmental protection besides they also facilitate to the land use adjustment layout in the tumen river region second the solves model will also help to assess ecosystem cultural services in the study area third ipcc is otherwise known as international panel on climate change holds an opinion that future climate simulation data should be used to suit and predict later land use change to provide more precise land use data for the quantification of ess liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 finally the interrelationship between multiple ess can also be measured through other means which include comprehensive ecosystem services ces sun and li 2017 the ecosystem service trade offs degree index estd j gong et al 2019 and also contain the least square fitting of orthogonal polynomials li et al 2017 5 conclusions in a word for the purpose of exploring the role of land use change in ess our study has taken the tumen river region as the study region and set up 3 land use scenarios by using rusle casa and invest models according to the results obtained earlier we can draw a conclusion that between 1996 and 2016 from decreasing to increasing is the overall trend in the value of ess in the study area which made the es functions gradually improved simultaneously the increase of the cultivated land enhanced the trade off between ess and the weakening of synergies moreover the connection of trade off between habitat quality and supply services is especially remarkable from the perspective of our findings that land use change remains a condition that can t be ignored in es but the impact of natural climate factors cannot be underestimated scenario simulation is one of the most effective ways to study trade offs between ess based on 3 scenarios our study analyzes trade offs between multiple ess the overall value of ess reached the maximum in the hd scenario at the pixel range and the hd scenario is undoubtedly the most appropriate one that is adopted at the catchment area scale according to our study outcomes not only will the hd scenario contribute to the land use sustainability but to the promotion of ecological civilization construction which is the most suitable scenario for the tumen river cross border area author contribution all authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript informed consent statement not

24157,land use change affected by rapid urbanization economic development and political influences as a crucial factor to ecosystem services ess irrational land use is likely to bring about loss of some ecosystem services ess in the meanwhile the trade offs occur among the ess are also changing this research aims to coordinate the relationship of ess for land use planning under different scenarios in tumen river region the essay has been organized in the following way initially we analyzed the impact on 6 ess in the context of the local land use change furthermore we explored their trade offs among the ess and seek to provide theoretical support to planning and management in the tumen river region here we used data from 1996 to 2006 and 2006 2016 to examine how the ecosystem services are affected by trade offs in three different scenarios baseline development bd fast development fd and harmonious development hd by using casa and usle models additionally with the help of integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest model we assessed 6 ecosystem services not only including meat production mp net primary production npp habitat quality hq but crop production cp soil conservation sc water retention wr as well during 1996 2016 firstly we demonstrated the numerous trade offs and or synergistic interactions between ess then we assessed these ess at the regional scale based on the 3 scenarios finally we explored the optimal scenario results show that 1 it was significant that the dramatic land use change in the study area from 1996 to 2016 especially in cultivated land and forested land 2 the total esv in the study area initially decreased and then increased and showed a gradual improvement trend during 1996 2016 3 multiple ess in addition to 2 ess containing habitat quality hq and soil conservation sc there are also water retention wr and net primary productivity npp during 1996 2016 showed positive correlations however crop and meat production vs soil retention was not significantly correlated in the study period 4 among all scenario simulations ess showed the most improvement in the hd scenario and following closely behind are the bd scenario and the fd scenario the bd scenario had fewer trade offs compared with against 2016 and the hd and fd scenarios had more 5 relative to the catchment area the hd scenario is the optimal situation our findings will provide some references for the construction of land use management and ecological civilization in cross border area keywords ecosystem services ess trade offs land use scenarios the tumen river cross border area data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction it is well known that humans directly or indirectly acquire lots of ecosystem services ess from ecosystems such as crop production cp water yield wy and also carbon storage cs the goods that is essential to maintain global life support systems or promote human welfare costanza et al 1997 millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 however along with the decline in ecosystem services comes a decline in biodiversity there is no doubt that the study of past ess will facilitate the research of ess under different scenarios in the present and future times millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 human health and survival are gravely threatened by the decline in ess millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 to some extent human actions also influence the processes and composition of the ess burkhard et al 2012 with the acceleration of the urbanization it appears that people have a greater demand than ever for food wood electricity shelter and other commodities and services which have caused an unreasonable land use spatial pattern foley et al 2005 the acute land use change has been a principal element reducing ess gradually as we all know regulating provisioning habitat and cultural services are the 4 types of ecosystem services teeb foundations 2010 there are plenty of es methods to distinguish quantify map or model the supplies and even streams of multiple ess as well as the synergies and trade offs exist between them as a result of different choices karimi et al 2021 the natural ecosystem s most immediate reaction to human activity is a change in land usage in other words change in ess is an obvious and instant sign of land use change it is easy to find that there are more and more scientists and decision makers thrown themselves into examining the connection between change in land use and ess which has received much more attention shi et al 2021 nowadays with the progress of the technology and the gradual increase of people s needs the relationship between ecosystem services become more complex and constantly changing than before in other words it can be understood as a trade off occurring in the middle of multiple ess sun and li 2017 there is a situation that when a decline in one es is accompanied by an increase in another es called trades off it is probably contributed to the interactions between ecosystem services or indirectly to multiple ecosystem services responding simultaneously to the same driver of change as an illustration a rise in crop production and consequent increase in nutrient runoff could cause a drop in water quality bennett et al 2009 providing scientific and professional information related to ecosystem modification for decision makers is the millennium ecosystem assessment ma s primary goal with the gradual deterioration of the global warming the related problem that it caused has received the attention of the majority of experts and scholars including methods to assess the state of related ecosystem services along with how

tallis et al 2008 ring et al 2010 silvestri and kershaw 2010 when we refer to ecosystem services it is natural to associate it with the relationship between land use nevertheless lucc will deeply change the earth landscape and directly have an influence on ecosystem services it is no longer just a study issue of geography but has gradually become a study hotspot for all majors such as ecology environmental sciences and the related disciplines smith and orr 2012 mansue et al 2016 in generally speaking lots of study concerning the trade offs between ess and human welfare has been done recently for example feng et al suggested a novel analysis framework to couple the trade offs of ess and supply demand dynamics by referring previous studies feng et al 2021 wu et al used multi source data and integrated explicit assessment methodologies to investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics and trade off changes in eight ess in loess plateau from 2000 to 2015 fan et al 2022 pan et al conducted a comprehensive review article about the trade offs and synergies of forest ecosystem services by referring 216 articles quan et al 2022 the research is helpful to make the decision makers

studies turn out that the overuse of the land by human beings will bring about serious environmental problems xu et al 2016 it is a fact that reforestation is a wise decision which can not only increase the greening rate but also improve people s living quality however it brings carbon sequestration and soil conservation inevitably more surface runoff is being lost dymond et al 2012 the above mentioned studies had some limitations on the one hand it is easy to find that today s research mostly focused on present ess trade offs it is inevitable to ignore the future ess evaluation based on multiple land use scenarios on the other hand due to esv is spatially heterogeneous previous case studies and conclusions cannot be easily extended to the cross border areas therefore it is an essential step to reevaluate the interaction among ess in coordinating the issue of rapid urbanization and ecological construction andrade et al 2020 hu et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 the ma which was completed in 2001 and is based on 2 factors containing land use change and the assessment of ess it has gradually increased public awareness of the significance of the trade off between management and ecosystem services mace 2013 maes et al 2011 in general spatial mapping scenario simulation and statistical analysis are some of the research methods nowadays scenario analysis has become one of the main methods in the study of trade offs and synergies for future ess deng et al 2016 different land use scenarios can be come up with in order to investigate how ess change under various scenarios and how this change will affect them plenty of suggestions and policies can be put forward to different land use planning scenarios li and wang 2018 harmáˇcková and vaˇckáˇr 2015 for instance zhao et al took dongting lake basin as study area they simulated 2 ess of grain production and water purification by setting various scenarios in 2035 and also figured out the effects of land use policies on ess and their trade offs yanni et al 2023 however the quantification and trade offs analysis of ess is a key issue in the comprehensive evaluation of ess and land use management wang et al 2017 quantification estimations show that the ecosystem services vary in accordance with changes in land use robinson et al 2013 nowadays a great number of research on evaluating ess have conducted by the scholars through remote sensing and gis technology including integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs invest adrienne et al 2014 it is an integrated assessment model and widely used to quantify ess in many regions in iran some scholars evaluated the habitat quality in mangrove forest where is along iran s southern shores between 2010 and 2021 based on the invest model fatemeh et al 2023 benra et al regard southern chile as study area this team evaluate the water yield in 1998 2007 and 2013 based on data of 224 catchments by using the model benra et al 2021 besides artificial intelligence for ecosystem services aries villa et al 2014 and saores as tools are usually combined with the modeling and prediction of ess hu et al 2015 however there are still some limitations in these studies firstly it is indisputable that we have received the kinds of ess from the ecosystem but it is gradually developed into a consensus that the interaction between ess has become a sufficient difficulty in the aspect of ecosystem management methods cai et al 2016 van jaarsveld et al 2005 secondly the majority of earlier studies tended to concentrate on both the past and current ess there is not too much research on the future scenario therefore it is easy to find a gap between ecosystem services and land use scenarios lauf et al 2014 fu et al 2015 eventually there are still some shortcomings in present lulc simulation scenario research t l sohl and claggett 2013 for example it is hard for the patch evolution of natural land use to find the fundamental and potential factors of land use changes meentemeyer et al 2013 yang et al 2020 to solve this problem a series of models came out which are created by the experts and scholars among them the plus model which is commonly used for simulation of patch level land use it is one of the more representative and the most non linear relationships hidden behind lulc were simulated by it besides it also makes the impacts of lulc on potential ess in a more accurate representation of under different future policy scenarios liang et al 2021 based on this it is necessary to simulate the potential for future lulc development accurately which is not only favorable for the subsequent ess to quantify and evaluate but also helpful to achieve the ideal development scenarios by analyzing the trade offs and synergistic effects of ess fang et al 2020 k wu et al 2013 synergies and trade offs are typically discussed with reference to relationships between ess yang et al 2018 by making use of grid based correlation analysis and spatial superposition sun et al analyzed spatial heterogeneity of multiple ess interactions and trades offs in the guanzhong and hanzhong basins sun and liu 2020 gao et al quantitatively simulate 3 kinds of ess including soil conservation water yield and carbon sequestration in beijing during 2015 2018 besides 5 major watersheds of beijing were not only regarded as the research object for quantitative analysis but compared local ess interactions with one another in terms of spatial trade offs and synergies gao and zuo 2021 demestihas et al examined the cascade linking agricultural practices with ecosystem functions and services to evaluate the correlation patterns among five ecosystem services in apple orchards demestihas et al 2019 by using two means of esci and estd jie et al compared the changes tradeoffs and synergies of es based on various land use schemes j gong et al 2019 xun et al took pearl river delta region prd as the study subject and presented ugb flus model which could be integrated with the establishment of urban growth boundaries between 2020 and 2050 liang et al 2018 wu et al proposed a multi criteria approach for better understanding the relationship between synergies and trade offs of ess and tested it in hong kong macao greater bay area linlin et al 2022 huang et al took tibet autonomous region as the study area they quantified 6 ess during 1995 2015 and used the pearson correlation coefficient to examine the links between paired ess also this team used k means cluster analysis to identify the tos bundles and analyzed the factors which are leading to changes in social ecology jiuming et al 2023 huang et al quantified 6 ess in wujiang basin and analyzed the trade offs synergies among them moreover they also investigated the underlying driving factors among esbs fengxian et al 2023 as economy rapidly develops land use activities continually intensify which seriously affect the supply of ess bryan et al 2018 and this is evidenced by impacts on provisioning priess et al 2007 regulating yang et al 2016 and cultural services sun and li 2017 changes in land use can also lead to different trade offs between ess some research also demonstrates that while increased land use intensity can improve food production which also increased soil erosion although extensive forestation improves habitat quality increases carbon stocks and promotes soil conservation it can also result in loss of surface runoff qiao et al 2019 research that is considered the analysis of es trade offs and synergistic into land use change is beneficial to provide the theoretical advice related to ecosystem management decisions in this research tumen river region is used as the study area with the continuous acceleration of the china s urbanization the implementation of the one belt and one road initiative have created some unprecedented opportunities but also brought many challenges to the border areas especially to the research area the tumen river region is not merely a relatively complete core area of ecological security in the northeast border but a national ecological and environmental safety reserve as well however due to the construction of modern cities there are many unresolved environmental issues in the region such as excessive deforestation and the decrease in ess caused by the transfer of forestland and grassland to cropland the habitat quality in the tumen river region the central hub of one belt and one road initiative is linked to the integrated benefits and ecological security of the region and its neighbors in summary the study aims to investigate the changes in 6 ess in the research area based on various land use scenarios we hope to solve the tumen river region s ecosystem issues by studying ess based on different land use scenarios hence this study accomplishes the following 1 considering the actual situation of tumen river region we proposed a scientific framework concerning es evaluation 2 by setting up various scenarios the evolution of 6 ess were quantified in the study area 3 assessed and analyzed the trade offs and synergies between multiple es indicators interacting with each other 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the tumen river is strategically located at the juncture of three countries china north korea and russia see fig 1 the middle and upper reaches of the tumen river approximately 490 km in length flow through china and north korea acting as a natural divider for these two countries while the lower reaches approximately 15 km divide north korea and russia before emptying into a delta in the east sea in addition to providing a boundary between the three countries many of the early rice cultivating settlements were located near the tumen river and its tributaries many of the smaller rural villages located on the tumen river would be either destroyed by planned construction activities or impacted in other ways because of new growth and development the river passes through several cities in china including longjing tumen and hunchun much of the area is mountainous with the remainder concentrated in coastal plains and river valleys agriculture is concentrated in the river valleys in addition to producing sur pluses in grain corn rice soybeans etc northeast china also generates surpluses in fruit and vegetables there are also abundant forest plant and animal resources as well as other natural resources in the region there is also an interesting social geography in the region the korean autonomous prefecture known as yanbian is situated on the southern corner of jilin province in 1995 the tumen river regional initiative was started by the united nations development programme the government of northeast asia is committed to working in partnership with the multiple sectors such as businesses related to transportation energy tourism investment and the environment because of the fact that as the only korean autonomous region in china which was regarded as the gateway and channel for collaboration in the tumen river region by tumen river region cooperation program besides with the increasing international cooperation that makes it gradually become the region with the best connections between china and surrounding countries cotton 1996 the area of yanbian is approximately 433 000 km2 where the offshore frontier faces the east sea yanbian which is in china s eastern jilin province fig 1 also it situated on the border of russia and korea depends on its unique geographical advantages and the continuous expansion of export oriented economy is more conductive to the region yanbian is a significant center for land sea transportation between europe north america and asia as well as a significant national natural environment barrier area jin and yujin 2001 chen et al 2009 colin 2003 as a substantial part of national one belt and one road construction due to it there are so many ports in the region facing north korea and russia debin and yahua 2015 the area also as a significant habitat provides multiple ess to the most biologically diverse region in the northern hemisphere there are the greatest number of amur leopards and manchurian tigers which is living in siberian breeding and inhabiting in the northeast tiger leopard national park in china where also serves as their primary habitat and breeding area l feng et al 2017 however there are over 70 of the park is located in this place this requires the study area to focus on local economic development while also managing the relationship with ecological environment protection 2 2 data sources land use maps meteorological satellite soil and statistical datasets were used in this study table 1 as table 1 demonstrates the land use map is obtained from landsat tm oli images from july 1996 august 2006 and may 2016 which is interpreted using a combination of artificial visual parse and object oriented data multi period land use data are merged in accordance with china s current land use classification ministry of land and resources 2007 and the study area s actual conditions are reclassified into six types specifically construction cultivated forested and unused land grassland and water bodies final land use maps are validated by using data from google earth and field survey data and an overall accuracy score of 91 percent is recorded 2 3 quantifying ecosystem services this paper draws on mea classification systems and teeb economics of ecosystems and biodiversity guidelines we used mathematical statistical model and invest model to evaluate 6 ess the former evaluated cropland production cp and meat production mp and the latter is applied to map the habitat quality hq and water yield wy besides the other two ess of net primary productivity npp and soil conservation sc are respectively made by casa and usle models all these models estimate the ecosystem services by drawing on biophysical data land use maps and satellite images 2 3 1 meat production mp in this study we assessed meat production service by calculating meat production efficiency which is also called meat production per unit area and not only that we also need to divide the meat production of every city county by calculating the area it occupies to calculate the local meat production efficiency su et al 2012 the study area mainly produces pork mutton and beef which are used to calculate each county s meat productivity for the years 1996 2006 and 2016 2 3 2 crop production cp the crop yield of cultivated land areas is calculated according to the method of li et al 2014 which establishes that cultivated land produces four crops maize potatoes rice and wheat the equation for cp is 1 c s x y i 1 i p x y c i s here csxy represents the total cp of cell x y in land use type s tons pxy is the area of cell x y cis refers to the yield per unit area of crop i on land use type s t km2 2 3 3 net primary production npp npp is a typical indicator of regulating services that seek to achieve carbon balance and ecosystem sustainability piao et al 2009 this model can be applied to estimate vegetation npp to a high standard and can also be used for vegetation net productivity estimation we use this model to calculate npp values and apply the following formulas 2 npp t x apar t x ε t x 3 apar t x sol t x fpar t x 0 5 here apar t x represents that the whole effective photosynthetic radiation absorbed at position t and time x gcm 2mon 1 ɛ t x represents the light energy use efficiency of apar t x converted to organic dry matter gc mj 1 the solar thermal radiation at position t at time x mj m2 was presented by sol t x fpar t x is the proportion of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plants at cell t in month x the constant w t x denotes the water stress coefficient as well as the effective solar radiation and the total solar radiation is signified by the constant 0 5 we respectively used t ɛ2 t x and tɛ1 t x as the high and low temperature stress coefficients we also use to represent the maximum light use efficiency which is under the perfect circumstances gc mj 1 and the value is 0 389 gc mj 1 2 3 4 soil conservation sc soil conservation sc is defined as real soil loss versus feasible soil loss wang et al 2017 q feng et al 2017 and it represents the soil that ecosystem has retained over the course of a year we assessed soil losses by means of the usle model which are usually caused by erosion rill splash and sheet using the universal soil loss equation usle we assess soil conservation volume qiao et al 2019 5 a c a p a r 6 a p r k l s 7 a r r k l s c p s here we used ac standing for total soil conservation t hm2 a and ap for the feasible soil erosion t hm2 a ar for the real soil erosion t hm2 a k for soil erosion factor and r indicates precipitation erosion factor slope length is denoted by l ps illustrates soil conservation measure factor s expresses slope c stands for vegetation cover factor 2 3 5 water retention wr the invest model s water yield module illustrates how changes in land use patterns will impact hydropower generation and annual surface water output according to the water balance principle the amount of water that runs off the scenery is called water yield which is equivalent to the difference between actual evapotranspiration and precipitation sharp et al 2018 for each pixel on the landscape t this model calculates the annual water yield y x as follows 8 y t 1 a e t t p t p t where aet t represents actual evapotranspiration yearly for pixel t also p t represents the annual rainfall for pixel t then for obtaining water retention we altered water yield with topographic index saturated water conductivity and velocity coefficient the relevant calculation method is as follows 9 w r m i n 1 249 v e l o c i t y m i n 1 0 9 t i 3 m i n 1 k s a t 300 y 10 t i l o g d r a i n a g

represents water yield mm ti represents the terrain index watershed area indicates the quantity of grids in the river basin soil depth indicates the thickness of soil mm 2 3 6 habitat quality hq habitat quality hq is used to evaluate the value of es which is favorable for individual and population persistence to sustain themselves hall et al 1997 hq is measured by considering the relative suitability of each land use type corresponds to a different threat as well as the force of outer stress from threats ykap s hq is measured by invest model and the equation for hq score is 11 q x j h j 1 d x j z d x j z k z here we use qxj to represent the habitat quality of plot x for land use type j overall habitat quality score is depicted by hj t which is assigned to land use category j with values ranging from 0 to 1 z denotes a scaling factor set by default to 2 5 in the model dxj denotes the study area s overall threat level in grid cell x with land use or habitat type j the figure k is used to denote a half saturation and constant set to half the resolution size of the landscape grid 2 4 simulating land use change it will be essential to consider natural and social feature elements when we set scenarios for the research area s r carpenter et al 2009 conflicts will arise between man and nature as a result of factors like demographic growth urbanization farmland goods and even soil corrosion considering the above integrated factors we set up three alternative scenarios in order to figure out the changing trends and their association among the several ess table 2 there is a new approach has emerged that regional spatial functional zoning and governance have grown in importance as a means of coordinating the sustainable growth of the people economy and resources while maximizing the overall advantages have grown in importance as a means of coordinating the sustainable growth of the people economy and resources while maximizing the overall advantages reidsma et al 2010 tao and wang 2016 in this study future development plans are combined in accordance with land use change rules from 1996 to 2016 and are applied to simulate the regional land use change in various scenarios land use change is simulated by idrisi software under three different scenarios in the planning of the three scenarios parameters are set for influencing and restricting factors including economy nature reserve population precipitation road temperature and water bodies the weight value meanwhile is calculated through the analytical hierarchical process ahp this is done in order to obtain future land use maps under three different scenarios that we have already set up in accordance with the different influences of parameters in corresponding scenarios the three scenarios are named baseline development bd scenario fast development fd scenario and harmonious development hd scenario they are described in detail in tables 2 and 3 2 5 quantification of synergies and trade offs in this study in order to guarantee the precision of quantization results data are standardized to eliminate impacts arising from the inconsistency of es units the standardized es is calculated as 12 e s s t d e s o b s e s m i n e s m a x e s m i n here esstd represents standard deviation of es esobs represents an es observation value we denote the maximum and minimum values of the same services by using esmax and esmin respectively whose value of individual range from 0 to 1 the statistical parameter root mean square deviation rmsd is applied to calculate trade offs bradford and d amato 2012 and the rmsd method is improved lu et al 2014 rmsd is defined as 13 r m s d 1 n 1 i 1 n e s i e s 2 in this case esi represents the average value of ess es means the i range of ess desired value except that the method of rmsd is used to reveal the relevant variance between the mean esstd and one of the esstd it is often seen as a tool of observing the degree of deviation from the mean 3 results 3 1 land use changes between 1996 and 2016 cultivated land and forest land as the two largest types of land use in the study area which respectively account for 10 24 and 84 33 of the whole region land use area during the whole study period fig 2 and table 4 during this period water bodies and forest land declined the most whereas cultivated land and grassland had a maximum growth both water bodies and forest land decreased the most construction land is the fastest growing area increasing by 247 2 km2 over the past 20 years during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 construction land increased by 193 5 km2 and 53 7 km2 the area of cultivated land climbed up and then declined during this period but eventually increased by 369 4 km2 the grassland area also follows the same pattern increasing by 297 7 km2 forested land initially decreased and then increased and finally decreased by 797 2 km2 the area of the water body followed the same pattern and then decreased during 1996 2016 and during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 it decreased by 139 km2 and increased by 20 7 km2 respectively the area of unused land in 1996 2016 basically remained unchanged table 4 3 2 changes of ecosystem services between 1996 and 2016 3 2 1 meat production mp as shown in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 average meat production in 1996 2006 and 2016 were 12 25 t km2 22 1 t km2 and 13 7 t km2 respectively reaching the highest value in 2006 the same trend can be seen in the entire period longjing and yanji which are at the center of the study area are regions with high values with annual average values while antu and hunchun have lower average annual production per unit yanji and tumen have the largest increase in average annual meat production increasing by 0 84 t km2 and 0 36 t km2 separately the annual average means of longjing and wangqing meanwhile demonstrated a decreasing trend figs 3 and 4 3 2 2 crop production cp as shown in table 4 and figs 3 and 4 from 1996 to 2016 the average values of crop production fluctuated constantly in particular in 2006 the average values of crop production were respectively 163 78 t km2 217 54 t km2 and 283 56 t km2 in 1996 2006 and 2016 annual crop production tended to increase in this period and the highest value for each year was always observed in longjing city and values of 62 85 t km2 90 45 t km2 and 63 47 t km2 were respectively recorded in 1996 2006 and 2016 on the other hand antu county remains a low value area regardless of annual crop yields and changes the output value of crops in antu helong tumen and dunhua has been increasing continuously and the increase in values are 5 65 t km2 8 04 t km2 11 97 t km2 and 24 07 t km2 respectively in the time of 1996 to 2016 hunchun city showed an increasing trend increasing by 8 87 t km2 while longjing city showed a decreasing trend decreasing by 0 63 t km2 yanji and wangqing showed an initial decline and a subsequent upward trend with the final value added being 41 84 t km2 and 18 71 t km2 respectively the most significant increases were in yanji city and dunhua city and the least obvious in longjing city figs 3 and 4 3 2 3 net primary production npp this paper also investigated the variation in spatial distribution of npp values for 1996 2016 the total value of npp was 26 87 tgc in 1996 and the average value was 621 2 gc m2 the highest value of npp was forested land with an average of 655 59 gc m2 and then there are the grassland and cultivated land which respectively recorded averages of 435 gc m2 and 463 16 gc m2 in 2006 the npp was 589 14 gc m2 and the total was 25 5 tgc which accounted for 5 09 of the decrease however in 2016 npp reached 26 21 tgc an increase of 1 14 107 gc in total there was a tendency to decrease first and then increase in this period the south of the study area was where the npp widely spread we also found that the lowest npp value for water body while unused land and forested land were the main sources of npp during the period 1996 2006 the npp values of hunchun city and wangqing county where is in the northeast of the study area decreased the most while dunhua city where is in the northwest of the study area increased the most figs 3 and 4 3 2 4 soil conservation sc during the period from 1996 to 2016 the amount of sc was enhanced significantly overall total sc accounted for 85 6 106 t in 1996 with an average of 19 9 102 t km2 forested land demonstrated the highest level of sc averaging 21 84 102 t km2 and cultivated land and grassland were immediately following which respectively recorded averages of 7 06 102 t km2 and 16 07 102 t km2 in 2006 the sc in the study area was 19 3 102 t km2 and the total value was 83 106 t which was 3 05 lower than in 1996 however in 2016 the study area s sc was 20 48 102 t km2 which represented an overall total increase of 6 13 when compared against 2006 the greatest increase was forested land up to 82 5 106 t followed by grassland and cultivated land which were 10 88 105 t and 34 4 105 t respectively higher sc values were shown in cultivated land and forested land on the contrary lower sc values were shown in unused land and water bodies the sc of dunhua city in study area s northwest increased the most but the remaining cities demonstrated varying degrees of loss figs 3 and 4 3 2 5 water retention wr wr was mainly distributed in the study area s forested land average water retention in the study area was respectively 2 97 105 m3 km2 1996 2 43 105 m3 km2 2006 and 2 93 105 m3 km2 2016 this encompassed a respective overall total of 12 86 109 m3 1996 10 45 109 m3 2006 and 12 67 109 m3 2016 forest land accounted for the largest water retention recording 3 2 105 m3 km2 1996 2 7 105 m3 km2 2006 and 3 22 105 m3 km2 2016 construction land accounted for the lowest water retention recording 1 86 104 m3 km2 1996 1 79 104 m3 km2 2006 and 1 67 104 m3 km2 2016 we can draw a conclusion that the higher water retention values were recorded in the southwest of the whole area oppositely low value areas occurred in the northeastern and eastern part the most obvious changes were the increase appearing in the north of the area and the eastern and southern areas decline figs 3 and 4 3 2 6 habitat quality hq habitat quality evaluation conducted over a three year period in the study area shows that the minimum habitat quality index was 0 which is evident from the construction and the unused land and 1 was the largest index which primarily manifested in the water bodies and forested land apart from construction land and unused land the other indexes were mostly between 0 82 and 1 the average habitat quality index across the whole area was 0 9085 0 8971 and 0 8968 area during 1996 2016 the study s habitat demonstrated a gradual decline meanwhile these changes suggested little difference in habitat quality figs 3 and 4 3 3 trade offs between multiple ess 1996 2016 with the aid of correlation analysis tool the study assessed the relationships between the multiple ess j s wu et al 2013 it is obvious to find that there are some substantial positive connections p 0 01 between ess including net primary productivity npp soil conservation sc water retention wr and habitat quality hq during the three year study period crop vs net primary production and meat production vs habitat quality these ess have important p 0 01 trade off connections but crop and meat production vs soil retention is not significantly correlated in the study period fig 5 crop and meat production services have a strong positive association showing a synergistic interaction between the two from fig 5 the correlation coefficient decreased from 0 928 to 0 658 in the study period crop and meat production services habitat quality and net primary productivity services showed significant negative correlation in 1996 2016 although there was a trade off happening in the relationship between these services the degree of the correlation still increased but habitat quality services net primary productivity services and water retention remained a positive correlation throughout the study and the strength of this correlation decreased in 1996 2006 from 0 514 to 0 353 and increased from 0 353 to 0 627 in 2006 2016 when considered as a magnitude of the correlation coefficient net primary productivity services soil retention and soil retention water retention decreased in 1996 2006 3 4 trade offs in different scenarios there are some drawbacks to correlation analysis which could only represent the correlation direction between ess rather than expose the direction of change in the spatial heterogeneity of ess thus the study area s trade off and synergy of various scenarios were analyzed through the ecosystem service trade off percentage estp fig 6 as shown in fig 6 hd and bd scenarios perform better than the 2016 percentage but these two scenarios perform worse than the 2016 percentage in the area of crop production fd scenarios perform better than the 2016 percentage in crop and meat production but show a lower level of performance in other ess when all scenarios are taken into account the fd scenario increases the most in crop and meat production evidencing respective growth rates of 19 and 42 percent the hd scenario demonstrates the best improvement in net primary productivity 0 1 percent habitat quality 0 7 percent soil conservation 1 38 percent and water retention 3 09 percent a comparison of the bd scenarios against the 2016 percentage shows an increase in multiple ess values and a decrease in crop production and net primary productivity fig 7 as shown in fig 7 the bd and hd scenarios were higher than the 2016 percentage but the fd scenario was lower than the others in general ess showed the largest improvements in the hd scenario followed by the bd scenario the bd scenario had fewer trade offs compared with against 2016 and the hd and fd scenarios the latter in particular had more under the three different scenarios it can be seen that the hd scenario could generate the largest number of overall ess while it could generate the largest number of trade offs under the fd scenario 3 5 ess spatial distributions and trade off situations in different scenarios in this study the study area is divided into 66 catchment areas the average total ess values and the ecosystem service trade off percentage estp in 2016 are compared with the results of each catchment area in the three different scenarios and then four situations are distinguished 1 the value of total ess are less than the 2016 values and the estp is greater than the 2016 value 2 the estp and total es values are less than the 2016 value 3 the estp and total es values are greater than the 2016 value 4 the estp is less than the 2016 value and total es values are greater than the 2016 value in the above four cases the first is worst and the last is optimal fig 8 fig 8 shows that in the study area situation three dominates the whole catchment area it is easy to find that each situation occupies a different percentage under different cases for situation one the percentages are 23 4 percent 2016 22 2 percent bd 23 1 percent hd 20 7 percent fd for situation two 35 9 percent 2016 31 1 percent bd 30 2 percent hd 42 2 percent fd for situation three 23 1 percent 2016 23 3 percent bd 22 4 percent hd 23 3 percent fd for situation four 17 6 percent 2016 23 4 percent bd 24 3 percent hd 13 7 percent fd through spatial analysis it is possible to confirm that the results of the catchment area obtained through three different scenarios illustrate the relative consistency of the overall spatial structure and also highlight discrepancies between localities situation one dominates the distribution in the western and southern catchment areas situation two dominates distribution in the northwest catchment area situation three dominates distribution in the eastern and western catchment area situation four dominates distribution in the northeast and southwest catchment area when bd and hd scenarios are compared with 2016 it is found that the first two situations in hd and fd scenarios have increased and bd scenarios have decreased in addition to the fd scenario situation four had increased most significantly in other scenarios fig 9 fig 9 shows the catchment area s distribution of tradeoff and total es situations in both 2016 and the three scenarios navy colors represent optimal situations and light blue represents the worst situations compared with 2016 under the bd and hd scenarios the area of the best scenario increased to 23 4 percent and 24 3 percent respectively the latter being the largest compared with 2016 in the hd and bd scenarios the overall percentage of situations one and two decreased and the hd scenario 53 3 decreased by 6 in the fd scenario the study area overall es values decreased but the area of situation three increased in situations one and three the primarily representation was the high trade offs the area percentage of situation one decreased in all scenarios and the area percentage of situation three decreased in the hd scenario and increased in the bd and fd scenarios accordingly the hd scenario is well worth considering 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of land use change on ecosystem services land use change in the tumen river region was getting worse during the last 20 years because of the factors that population increase fast urbanization the real estate market and government planning policies as a crucial component to the ecosystem of the earth millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 land use change has a profound impact on ess supply and strength as well as their interdependent processes j gong et al 2019 on the one hand both of water bodies and forested land s area had the most severe reduction while on the other hand the amount of cultivated and construction land increased significantly the increasing area of man made land surface gave rise to a decline in quantity of forested land water bodies as well as cultivated land it directly had an unfavorable effect on the provision of various ess and even altered the interactions among them under 3 scenarios that we have been set in the past 20 years construction land is the fastest growing area increasing by 247 2 km2 during 1996 2006 and 2006 2016 construction land increased by 193 5 km2 and 53 7 km2 respectively table 4 our research outcomes further confirmed the previous findings that have done by haas and ban 2014 and zhang et al 2017 4 2 trade off and overall es quantifications during recent decades the large number of research has emerged including quantitative assessments of ess and their relationship analysis the influence of land use on ecological system procedure are crucial millennium ecosystem assessment mea 2005 which ultimately decide the state of es provision fu and zhang 2014 it is gradually come to an agreement that one of the critical factors for ess changes is the land use change in many research thus it is feasible to improve management practices that is based on ecosystem and speed up decision processes to accomplish specific goals through establishing diverse land use scenarios it is not just focused on the accuracy of the outcome of a single prediction scenario analysis might provide more than one probable outcome which is on prospective modifications to create a framework for future development hence our study used plenty of data containing the temperature and precipitation and the relevant data from 1996 2006 and 2016 to quantify multiple es values and then utilize it in different scenarios with the aim of simulating future ecosystems an improved understanding of the magnitude of the trade off value is supportive to determine the optimal scenario which makes it possible to minimize the trade offs value and maximize the over return lu et al 2014 we provide scientific theoretical basis for the optimal land use plans by referring to four situations which extend from best to worst case scenarios bradford and d amato 2012 previous research concerning study area has mainly emphasize the exploration of multiple es values with a large scale background mao et al 2019 maintained that in 2000 2015 carbon storage in northeast china s ess decreased and crop production increased yin et al 2019 concluded that in the northeast forest belt of the national barrier zone soil conservation increased and npp declined between 2000 and 2015 a longer research time span enables us to become more familiar with changes in ess we find that the four ess increased or decreased by different degrees at different stages particularly the npp values of ess were reduced the increase and decrease of regional npp are consistent with the change of forest land area indicating that land use change has a significant influence on npp above conclusions are compliance with the findings of liu et al 2015 as a result of climate change especially for the effects of temperature and rainfall on evapotranspiration groundwater flow and runoff foley et al 2005 changes in sc initially reduced and then increased while remaining above the level recorded in 1996 although the continual downward trend of hq has slowed the biggest threat to the habitat quality index is still the dramatic expansion in the construction planning area mackintosh et al 2015 the clarification of trade offs and synergy between ess is beneficial to sustainable development of the regional ecosystem there is progressively research on the synergy infection of meat production and crop production in terms of service supply at the meantime the impact is also observed to show a downward trend during 1996 2016 over time there has been a trend of temporal and spatial inconsistency between the two supply services compared to somewhere else the west of the research region is suitable for cp to widely spread in addition the eastern part of the study area showed a comparatively higher mp production regulating services hq npp sc and wr mutually synergies with each other the relationship between soil conservation and npp in the northeast forest belt region was quantified by yin et al 2019 through relatively exact data resolution 250 m and concludes that there is a weak synergy between them at different spatial scales interactions between ess have significant scale effects j p rodriguez et al 2006 as well as it is easy to find the trade offs which usually exist between regulating and provisioning services chisholm 2010 there is a weak synergy between supply and water conservation because the water retention was consistently increasing also the supply services presented a kind of increasing trend with the growth of service supply synergy becomes increasingly smaller on the one hand the continuous expansion of cultivated land drives the growth of supply capacity while on the other hand which is advantageous to the trade off effect government decision making should pay more attention to this phenomenon 4 3 scenario analysis and policy proposal understanding land use change in multiple scenarios provides a scientific way for future land use optimization the use of idris software to predict future land use changes is one of the most reliable and effective methods t l sohl and claggett 2013 this study not only applies this method based on land use change from 1996 to 2016 but also uses natural climate and socioeconomic development impact factors to predict future land use and gives two examples natural climate temperature and precipitation and socioeconomic development population and gdp finally we calculate each scenario s provisioning services through the average value of cp and mp for six types of land use in 2016 regulating service values are quantified by using climate data and predicted land use change we observe that socioeconomic development and natural climate factors will affect ess value and might even have an influence on the future land use changes noting that this also applies to multiple scenarios we construct the baseline bd fast fd and harmonious hd development scenarios which involve grain for green cultivated land reclamation and ecological protection in the bd and hd scenarios both ecological protection and grain for green can promote the improvement of overall ess however there is no significant increase in the value of npp and a decrease is also apparent in the bd scenario the results demonstrate that in addition to the forested land cultivated land also has a certain effect on regulating services and can provide regulation of es such as npp although the hd scenario provides a maximized overall ess and relatively high trade offs however when compared to the bd scenario this kind of scenario makes the trade offs of es minimize at the catchment scale considering the land use allocation in the optimal scenario the catchment area scale appears to be more desirable than pixel water scale in the fd scenario cultivated land reclamation can greatly increase provisioning service values but reduces overall ess the spatial distribution of all es trade offs at the catchment scale promotes the sustainable development of local forestry and agriculture goldstein et al 2012 however this study has certain limitations and uncertainties first the model s limitations may affect es assessment for example precipitation has a significant effect on water retention future research should focus on the seasonal variations of precipitation uncertainties in scenario simulation and the city future development plan is not only projected by government policies but supposed to be combined with the degree of the local urbanization including science and technology the introduction of talent and other impact factors although our results have some limitations they still make some scientific contributions to the local economic development and environmental protection besides they also facilitate to the land use adjustment layout in the tumen river region second the solves model will also help to assess ecosystem cultural services in the study area third ipcc is otherwise known as international panel on climate change holds an opinion that future climate simulation data should be used to suit and predict later land use change to provide more precise land use data for the quantification of ess liang et al 2018 liu et al 2017 finally the interrelationship between multiple ess can also be measured through other means which include comprehensive ecosystem services ces sun and li 2017 the ecosystem service trade offs degree index estd j gong et al 2019 and also contain the least square fitting of orthogonal polynomials li et al 2017 5 conclusions in a word for the purpose of exploring the role of land use change in ess our study has taken the tumen river region as the study region and set up 3 land use scenarios by using rusle casa and invest models according to the results obtained earlier we can draw a conclusion that between 1996 and 2016 from decreasing to increasing is the overall trend in the value of ess in the study area which made the es functions gradually improved simultaneously the increase of the cultivated land enhanced the trade off between ess and the weakening of synergies moreover the connection of trade off between habitat quality and supply services is especially remarkable from the perspective of our findings that land use change remains a condition that can t be ignored in es but the impact of natural climate factors cannot be underestimated scenario simulation is one of the most effective ways to study trade offs between ess based on 3 scenarios our study analyzes trade offs between multiple ess the overall value of ess reached the maximum in the hd scenario at the pixel range and the hd scenario is undoubtedly the most appropriate one that is adopted at the catchment area scale according to our study outcomes not only will the hd scenario contribute to the land use sustainability but to the promotion of ecological civilization construction which is the most suitable scenario for the tumen river cross border area author contribution all authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript informed consent statement not

24158,by building connectivity between ecological spaces the landscape ecology network len can effectively prevent further habitat fragmentation and loss in urbanizing areas the existing len construction method fails to consider the multiple optimization goals of improving network structural and functional connectivity this paper aimed to provide a novel method to improve connectivity for existing lens in urbanizing areas we took an urbanizing area in china as an example and extract existing len based on ecological priorities on this basis from the dimension of structural connectivity optimization we used the network link additional technique based on integral index of probable connection to identify 50 optimal locations of additional corridors that could significantly improve the network structural connectivity from the dimension of functional connectivity enhancement we applied the greedy algorithm based on hierarchical rules with different priorities to search for corridor paths with maximum ecological function and low ecological and construction resistance the optimized len contained 43 ecological sources and 74 ecological corridors the dual dimension method proposed in this paper can improve the functional and structural connectivity of existing len and greatly save the optimization time and efficiency of the network to provide targeted ecological space protection schemes for urbanizing areas keywords landscape ecological network optimization approach connectivity improvement structural and functional connectivity landscape graph theory greedy algorithm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global metropolitan areas are expanding nations 2015 however urban cluster development is aggravating ecological patch loss fragmentation and isolation damaging the structure and function of the ecological space system barbati et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 and affecting ecosystem services ess and human well being therefore conservation efforts are urgently required to halt large scale ecosystem degradation due to rapid urbanization and to withstand significant ecological risks in large scale human settlements hermoso et al 2020 many studies have identified important protected areas pas and their priorities as ecological sources and habitats for species providing ess kukkala et al 2016 strassburg et al 2020 yang et al 2020 shrestha et al 2021 thus providing reference information for pa protection and management however these studies only emphasize the capacity of pas or the ecological spaces with the potential to become pas in providing es failing to protect pas in an interconnected ecological network and preventing structural connectivity between important pas isolated management may undermine the effectiveness of conservation hermoso et al 2020 and make it easy to ignore the impact of ecosystem structure and connectivity on ecological processes and functions wang et al 2021a therefore strategically identifying and adding new areas to connect the existing pas is essential to enhance connectivity between regional ecological space systems commission 2013 and build a strong extensive and resilient large scale ecological network that continuously provides ess to cities unlike large scale planning efforts that focus on determining the conservation priority of individual pas many studies and practices have been devoted to constructing landscape ecological networks lens with high connectivity at urban and district scales kwon et al 2021 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 initially the design of conservation networks with connectivity relied on expert opinions to determine corridors between pas by assessing the structure and orientation of natural landscape features hofman et al 2018 however this approach has been criticized for being subjective and weakening the repeatability of landscape connectivity assessments sawyer et al 2011 currently landscape ecologists quantify and construct structural connectivity between ecological patches through various methods and models including the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model and least cost path lcp analysis kong et al 2010 keeley et al 2016 circuit theory peng et al 2018 jahanishakib et al 2021 and graph theory clauzel et al 2018 foltête 2019 corridor analysis based on the mcr model and circuit theory relies on the setting of resistance surfaces and only considers obstacles caused by built up environmental characteristics on biological migration and the impact of landscape heterogeneity on ecological process flow peng et al 2018 however this inherent paradigm and simplistic assumptions lack the flexibility to respond to different environments and animal movement characteristics greatly reducing the effectiveness and relevance of connectivity models to conservation theory and practice kumar et al 2022 furthermore the functional characteristic of an ecological corridor as the supporting space for transmitting and delivering ess is disregarded moreover the mcr model may generate structurally redundant corridors lu et al 2020 which require filtering and manual deletion increasing the difficulty of application in a larger space range graph theory provides a spatially conceptualized representation for lens xun et al 2017 in recent years graph theory has become more widely used in ecological network analysis providing emerging new and more precise indexes to describe the connectivity and resilience of len hashemi and darabi 2022 however it cannot provide a ground truthed design for large scale landscape connectivity based on specific land use and landscape components kilbane et al 2019 to comprehensively address significant ecological risks and human needs at regional and national scales creating lens is an important approach that couples landscape function structure and ecological processes vuilleumier and prélaz droux 2002 xu et al 2016 focuses on the connectivity of network function and structure the functional connectivity of len is manifested in the sustainability of natural resource supply and the high level of es maintenance as well as the consistency of habitats within the space and the minimization of external obstructions and disturbances chi et al 2019 the construction spaces within the rapidly urbanizing area are dense and the proportion of impervious surfaces in urban areas is increasing xu et al 2018 therefore planners should balance ecological benefits and cost effectiveness when constructing lens using limited farmland and ecological patches xu et al 2019b by prioritizing the best resources and paths to arrange ecological corridors to form a connected network the network s capacity to provide multiple ess is maximized while controlling network construction cost and resistance and the functional connectivity of the network is also enhanced the structural connectivity of len is manifested in the continuity of the ecological space itself that supports the spatial flow of ess and the way in which the connection between various spatial elements optimizes the network structure and efficiency gonzález 2023 however most of the existing methods only focus on building or enhancing the connectivity of len in one dimension and only emphasize and shape the functional or structural characteristics of the network at the same time multi objective planning methods that take network structural and functional connectivity as the basis for len construction and optimization rarely exist based on the above research gaps this paper aimed to develop a new methodological framework to enhance len connectivity in both structural and functional dimensions and took typical urbanizing area in china as an example to optimize its existing len the framework was characterized by optimizing len from two dimensions structure and function at present many graph based complex network evaluation indices have been developed to quantitatively evaluate the connectivity of lens borgatti and everett 2006 bodin and saura 2010 hashemi and darabi 2022 recent studies have shown that graph based approaches can assess the structural importance of individual network components by removing or adding them and ranking their impact on the connectivity of the entire ecological network foltête et al 2014 xun et al 2017 to determine the necessity of patches or corridors in the network based on this we first used the network link additional technique based on the integral index of probable connection to identify the best locations of the new corridors that can significantly improve the connectivity of the existing len structure and determine the network topology connection method for structural optimization for the traditional ecological corridor path analysis model that obtains the best path selection by comparing many cumulative calculation results the best corridor path identification is time consuming therefore an efficient corridor path identification algorithm is critical to the overall computational performance of the solution process the greedy algorithm iteratively achieves the overall optimal solution of the solved problem by making a series of local optimal choices simplifying the multi objective solution of the overall problem to a smaller sub problem reed et al 2013 xu et al 2019b reducing the overall solution s complexity and shortening the computation time stopka et al 2020 liu et al 2022 therefore we secondly used the greedy algorithm set under the hierarchical rules to search for the new corridor paths with the largest ecological function and low ecological and construction resistance transform the topological network into a geographic network and provide specific support spaces for biological flow material flow energy flow and es spatial flow to enhance the functional connectivity within the network this paper aimed to provide a reference for building large scale len and realizing the co optimization practice of functional connectivity and structural connectivity of the networks 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the su jia hu co urbanizing area was the study site which includes three cities suzhou jiaxing and huzhou distributed around the east bank of the taihu lake close to the metropolitan area of shanghai and located in the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration yrdua a region with most significant urbanization and ecosystem changes fig 1 the study area covered a total area of 18 221 km2 and had a resident population of 18 315 million by 2015 the urbanization rate in this area had reached 72 64 54 86 higher than that in the early days of china s reform and opening up lian et al 2018 from the perspective of location the su jia hu area plays the role of buffer and barrier between the taihu lake basin and the shanghai metropolitan area at the same time it is also an important connection area in the taihu lake basin that connects taihu lake huangpu river system qiantang river and other water systems so it has important regional strategic significance and ecological importance improving and optimizing the connectivity of len within the scope of this study will not only help to integrate the natural resources shared by the area connect the rich landscape elements and diverse ecosystems of the region but also promote the further integration of policies and management within the su jia hu area belonging to jiangsu and zhejiang provinces at the same time its value is also reflected in providing the core guarantee of ecological security for the adjacent shanghai metropolitan area and the yrdua 2 2 methodological framework the existing len in the study area was composed of ecological sources with strong ecological function and important river corridors but the existing networks extracted under ecological determinism often lack connectivity therefore this paper took the identified existing len as the optimization basis firstly optimized the structural connectivity of the network to strengthen the continuity between the components of the existing len secondly it strengthened the functional connectivity of the network to provide the least hindrance and interference supporting spaces for the delivery and transmission of es spatial flows in the network fig 2 we introduced the integral index of probable connection into the network link additional technique to evaluate the overall connectivity of the new network obtained by adding a new connection to the original network moreover by comparing the change rate of the probable connectivity brought by all new connections the new connection locations that play a key role in improving the overall structural connectivity of the network were identified to obtain the topological connection mode of the network with optimized structure from this dimension we provided new index and technique for the structural connectivity optimization of len and proposed suggestions and strategies for adding new corridors in key locations to optimize the network structure by setting hierarchical rules with different priorities we wrote and executed greedy algorithms to identify geographic paths that minimize resistance and interference to the transmission of es in ecological corridors at the new connection locations in the context of existing landscape elements and land uses to generate len with enhanced ecological functions from this dimension we provided algorithms and path searching technique under new rules for enhancing the functional connectivity of len and proposed suggestions and strategies for planning new ecological corridors at specific locations 2 3 data sources and processing 2 3 1 existing landscape ecological network identification the existing len in the su jia hu area is extracted from the results of the authors existing research on the study area shen et al 2021 which consists of ecological sources with strong ecological functions and existing important river corridors through the multiple ecosystem service capacity index mesc index coupling evaluation model the authors evaluated the comprehensive capacity of the existing ecological patches in the u jia hu area to provide five key ess biodiversity maintenance service flood regulation service microclimate regulating service water purification service and recreation and tourism service based on the evaluation results and through spatial cluster analysis the ecological spaces were divided into six priorities see the appendix a for the results of the existing ecological space priority classification in the study area subsequently ecological patches with high ecological priority first to third grade priority large patch size and complete morphology were extracted as important ecological sources consist of existing len for existing river corridors first we screened 37 rivers with higher stream orders of 1 3 grades from among the several existing rivers in the study area based on the classification from the regulations of the people s republic of china on the administration of river courses in 2017 second using the natural breakpoint method classification we extracted 22 rivers 31 1 km with the length of the top 2 3 portion of rivers finally we manually identified 13 rivers that play an important role in connectivity i e rivers connecting two or more ecological sources as ecological corridors in the existing len these river corridors and important ecological sources constituted the existing len in the study area 2 3 2 other data sources we used the following four data sets appendix b of 2015 to optimize the len in the study area 1 land use cover 2 digital elevation model 3 1 10 000 scale river map and 4 spatial distribution of terrestrial es value in china for data sources with an inconsistent resolution 1 km 1 km dot matrix data shp was formed using raster transition points of 1 km in arcgis we then used the trend surface method in the interpolation analysis tool of the spatial analyst module to interpolate points into a grid surface with a unified resolution of 30 m land use data were produced using classifications based on landsat remote sensing images downloaded from the website of usgs http glovis usgs gov based on china s land use status classification gb t 21 010 2017 su jia hu land use characteristics and remote sensing information the land use types in the study area were divided into cultivated land construction space and ecological space the land use accuracy of construction space was over 70 and that for other spaces was more than 80 ecological space was divided into forest grassland lake wetland unused land and river the first five types of ecological spaces exhibit patchy spatial characteristics whereas rivers exhibit linear spatial characteristics the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem service value in china an open source data set provided by the data center for resources and environment sciences chinese academy of sciences suggests that china s terrestrial ecosystems are divided into forest grassland water area wetland desert and cultivated land the first five ecosystems correspond to the five patchy ecological spaces in the study area based on the spatial distribution data of net primary productivity npp precipitation and soil conservation in china the value equivalent factor for each es was adjusted using the es value equivalent factor method xie et al 2015 and 11 es values were calculated based on the five key ess selected in this study we chose the es values of biodiversity hydrology regulation climate regulation environmental purification and landscape culture the selected spatial data were clipped according to the scope of the study area 2 4 dual dimensions for landscape ecological network connectivity improvement 2 4 1 structural connectivity optimization based on integral index of probable connection landscape graph is a model for representing the habitat and ecological flow characteristics and species movements at large spatial scales foltête et al 2014 using nodes and connections landscape graphs provide a spatially conceptualized representation xun et al 2017 which helps delineate patches and corridors that contribute most to the overall connectivity of large scale networks galpern et al 2011 sahraoui et al 2021 in this study we used landscape graph to construct the model for len structural connectivity optimization based on structural connectivity the measure of the overall structural network performance the steps for network structure optimization of the existing len fig 3 were as follows first based on graph theory the abstract topological network model of the existing len was constructed through nodes and links step 1 second a structural index was developed and the probable integral connectivity of different network connection modes was evaluated step 2 third the network link technique was used to add new links between nodes that were not connected step 3 and the change rate of the integral probable connectivity of network caused due to the additions was evaluated and ranked step 4 ultimately the additional links in top positions were recognized as important for the network structure confirming the optimal position for adding links between nodes to improve network connectivity and forming a new topological network model that maximizes the integral probable connectivity of the network there is no mature index to evaluate the contribution of individual links to the overall network connectivity we used the iipc of a network to evaluate the capacity of individual links as structural connectivity providers we described the probability of two randomly placed points in the landscape falling into ecological sources that were reachable to each other directly connected by a link without passing through other patches and considered the ease with which these two points move and diffuse between the two ecological sources represented by the topological distance moving along the link we used i i p c to indicate the new measurement of this index after the addition of corridor k as a new link in the existing network which was calculated as follows 1 i i p c i 1 n j 1 n e i e j p i j 1 1 d k a 2 where n is the number of identified ecological sources and the number of nodes in the topological network model e is the ecological importance weight of the ecological source expressed by its mesc index and p i j is the probability that any two ecological sources in the len can be directly connected by the corridor without going through other patches the p i j of ecological sources i and j that have corridors between them as a direct connection was set to 1 to simplify the calculation if there is no direct connection or i j then the p i j 0 d k is the topological length of the new ecological corridor k added as a link between the ecological source i and j a is the study area including all ecological and non ecological spaces we constructed the importance of topological structure index itsi to measure the change rate of iipc caused by each additional link the index described the extent to which corridor k the link in the network contributed to the connectivity between other network components depending on the topological location of corridor k high itsi indicated that adding corridor k to the topological network can greatly improve the connectivity between other network components low itsi indicated that the addition of corridor k did not play a large role in the connectivity of the network topology and can be considered a non essential topological link in the case of limited space and resources the itsi was calculated as follows 2 i t s i k i i p c i i p c i i p c 100 new links were built for each pair of nodes without existing connections using the networkx toolkit based on the python language and according to eqs 1 and 2 we wrote the code that calculates the iipc and itsi after each link addition we set an open source shared code base https github com pandasang1231 simple landscape analysis on the github website accessible to anyone for using this network structure optimization method the results of itsi were ranked and divided into five levels using the natural breakpoint method and the impact of the additional links on the integral probable connectivity of network was divided into five degrees extremely significant significant general insignificant and barely any impact we selected the additional links with extremely significant and significant impacts as the best places to improve the integral structural connectivity of the existing len 2 4 2 functional connectivity enhancement based on greedy selection under hierarchical rules in this study we used a greedy search algorithm starting from the grid where a certain ecological patch was located and gradually approaching another ecological patch as the ending point by continuously selecting the grid scheme as the best corridor path under the established rules until the destination grid was reached black 2005 according to the above theoretical basis the steps to identify the geographic paths of additional links in the len topological model with optimal structure in specific urban environments and ecological substrates are as follows fig 4 first the grid of 30 m 30 m was used as the basic unit of spatial analysis and the grid assignment surface of corridor path identification rules was constructed including mesc index assignment and ecr value assignment using the individual es value spatial data from the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem service value in china the capacity to provide multiple ess to cultivated lands that also serve as ecological substrates was evaluated using the mesc index coupling assessment model and the mesc index of each cultivated land patch was calculated the results of the mesc index evaluation of cultivated lands and ecological spaces were summarized and divided into five levels using the natural breakpoint method and the corresponding grids were assigned values of 1 5 grids belonging to construction space were assigned zero we referred to relevant literature yu et al 2017 fu et al 2020 kumar et al 2022 mu et al 2022 to collect common ecological resistance factors and based on the environmental characteristics of the study area and experts opinions the following ecological resistance factors that were important for the study area were screened including 1 land cover types subdivided into five categories forest grassland water bodies unused land and impervious surface because different land cover affects the exchange of matter and energy and the transmission of es flows between ecological patches 2 river network density because the study area was in the plain water network area and the rivers can provide many ess and improve local spatial connectivity 3 elevation and 4 slope as there were diverse topographies in the study area and elevation and slope can directly affect species migration vegetation distribution and es flow direction based on the evaluation of above multiple ecological resistance factors appendix c the ecr value of each grid was obtained divided into ten grades using the natural breakpoint method and the values 1 10 were assigned to corresponding grids ecr values were positively correlated with these ecological resistance factors second to consider the ecological benefits and cost effectiveness of len construction under multi objective conditions we adopted hierarchical rules for executing each greedy choice appendix d as follows 1 continue to execute the lower level rules only if the highest level rule has been carried out without an only result and 2 if the only result has been obtained after the highest level rule is carried out the execution of the underlying rules is no longer considered simplifying the calculation and saving analysis time while ensuring that the top level rule has been performed first this priority between different hierarchical rules can be expressed by priority factors p1 and p1 p1 1 dai et al 2008 for each step of greedy choice the p1 level rule is to select the only grid with the largest mesc index the p1 1 level rule is to select the only grid with the smallest ecr value the p1 2 level rule is to select the grid with the closest euclidean distance to the destination grid we used breadth first search bfs based on the above hierarchical rules to identify the optimal path between each node pair with topological connections see the open source shared code base for detailed codes https github com pandasang1231 simple landscape analysis mesc index and ecr assignment grids generated in arcgis were exported as tif files and used as input data for running the code to identify each grid coordinate and a continuous path was formed from the start to end points the path identification results were exported as a tif file we assigned unified values to grids on the same path and the values of n paths were assigned 1 n in sequence the grids not belonging to any paths were assigned zero the tif file was imported back into arcgis and the raster path was converted into lines using raster to polyline in data management tool urban ecological space planning green space system planning and ecological security pattern planning can reflect the demand of urban development for the spatial elements of len to a certain extent wei et al 2019 therefore at last by referring to the existing plans of suzhou jiaxing and huzhou the important ecological corridors in the planning were artificially supplemented to generate a complete spatial network structure 3 results 3 1 existing landscape ecological network composed of ecological sources and important river corridors we extracted 43 ecological patches from the first second and third grades ecological spaces as important ecological sources with a total area of 4271 3 km2 accounting for 62 4 of the total ecological patch area and 22 1 of the total area of the study area lakes and ponds were the main landscape type accounting for 60 of the total number of patches followed by forests 16 and wetlands 14 grasslands and unused lands in the study area were small in scale had low vegetation cover and their capacity to provide multi ess was poor therefore none of these ecological patch types was selected as an ecological source large ecological sources were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas in the middle and southwest of the study area the northeast was dominated by medium sized ecological patches the north and southeast were areas where the existing ecological source areas were relatively lacking and only a small number of riverfront wetlands attached to large rivers were identified as ecological sources the total length of 13 river corridors in the existing len was 874 km it included two first grade river sections the yangtze and qiantang rivers six second grade rivers and five third grade rivers flowing through the study area the river corridors in the existing len were mainly distributed in the southwest with a small number of corridors in the north and east of the study area due to the lack of ecological sources in the southeastern part of the study area few existing river corridors were identified to connect ecological sources the existing len fig 5 consisting of 43 ecological sources and 13 river corridors presented a general pattern wherein the network components were abundant in the central northeastern and southwestern regions and rare in the north and southeast the network was better connected in the southwest part because there were more existing river corridors while the eastern and northern parts had more ecological sources but a small number of corridors resulting in a lack of connectivity between them in addition the network components in the southeast were separated from the main network structure organized by the taihu lake in the center of the study area 3 2 structurally optimized landscape ecological network connection mode fig 6 a shows a topological model of the existing len consisting of 43 ecological sources as nodes and 13 existing river corridors as links four river corridors were segmented by the nodes hence the network topological model contained 25 existing links the index statistics of the existing len topological model are shown in appendix e we obtained 878 additional individual links and their corresponding network connection mode models the visualization of the itsi calculation results of the above additional links is presented in appendix f a total of 50 additional links i e 6 of all additional links had extremely significant and significant impacts appendix g and h and were recognized as the best places to improve the integral probable connectivity of network these links were added to the existing network topological model the topological model of the structurally optimized len is shown in fig 6 b the index statistics of the len topological model of structural optimization is presented in appendix i comparing appendix e and i the number of network connectivity components was significantly reduced and the network diameter and clustering coefficient were slightly reduced most new links were densely distributed in the northeast of the study area where ecological sources were high but connectivity was poor and a few were in the southwest of the study area where the current connectivity was better fig 6 b considering the ecological source with a high mesc index 3 9 number 10 as the center many new links were connected and several scattered small ecological sources such as the ecological sources numbered 9 11 21 23 and 24 were organized around it forming a sub network structure with good local connectivity in the northern part of the study area and connecting the multiple ecological sources in this area that originally lacked connections to the main network structure centered around number 14 the taihu lake similarly with the ecological sources numbered 31 12 and 13 as the center another local sub network structure was formed in the eastern part of the study area through new links and more scattered ecological sources were organized simultaneously through the three key links between ecological sources numbers 10 and 25 23 and 12 and 9 and 12 the two sub network structures of the east and the north were linked thus the sub network structures were also connected to each other and organically combined with the main network structure the new links greatly resolved the problem of having several ecological sources with poor connectivity in the eastern and northern parts of the study area however among the first 50 new links that significantly affected the integral probable connectivity of network none connected the separated sub network structures in the southeast part of the study area to the main network structure the itsi ranking of the first additional link that connected this sub network structure to the main network structure was 336 located between ecological sources numbers 41 and 14 3 3 functional enhanced landscape ecological corridor paths appendix j a shows the mesc index distribution for all spaces in the su jia hu area the spaces with high mesc indices 3 0 were concentrated in the ecological sources the areas with mesc indices of 2 0 to 3 0 existed in the wide cultivated lands in the southeast and west of the study area and in the ecological spaces such as rivers grasslands and wetlands the cultivated lands in the south north and east of the study area had low mesc indices ranging from 1 0 to 2 0 appendix j b shows the ecr value distribution for all spaces in the su jia hu area areas with high ecr values 7 10 were evenly and widely distributed in the northern and southeastern regions of the study area lacked ecological spaces and had dense rural settlements and urban areas on the north and south sides of the taihu lake areas with low ecr values 1 3 were concentrated on ecological sources the vast cultivated lands in the south southeast and northeast exhibited moderate levels of ecr values 4 6 pearson s correlation analysis indicated that the mesc indices and ecr values in all spaces in the study area had significant negative correlations at the 0 01 level p 0 052 fig 7 a shows the three different types of geographic paths for constructing ecological corridors at the optimal locations the total length of the 50 additional corridors was 608 36 km the longest and shortest corridors were 55 21 km and 2 03 km respectively according to the main spatial units on the corridor paths the additional corridors were divided into 1 13 cultivated land corridors whose paths traversed large cultivated land matrices they were mainly distributed in urban suburbs with small ecological space scales and scattered distribution in the north and east of the study area 2 30 ecological corridors that integrated scattered ecological units to form a stepping stone system such corridors connected many ecological spaces most of which were not ecological sources they were mainly distributed in the eastern and southwestern regions with dense ecological spaces 3 seven corridors in need of quality improvement they passed through the built up areas and were mainly distributed in the urban areas in the north and northeast of the study area where construction spaces were concentrated based on the existing plans we also identified 15 important ecological corridors appendix k three in suzhou four in huzhou and eight in jiaxing with the largest number of rivers and the densest distribution through manual addition and deletion of duplicate corridors 4 duplicate corridors in total at last 11 key planned corridors were added to the existing corridor system making a total of 74 corridors in the optimized len of the study area fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 multi objective optimization approach for len connectivity improvement this study optimized the connectivity of existing len using an integrated approach in a complex and extensive landscape filled with existing land use to achieve multi objective optimization of functional and structural dimensions increase connections between ecological sources and use functionally prioritized landscape elements and spatial units in existing environments to construct practical geographic connections based on the existing len the network link additional technique and iipc were integrated into the network structure optimization framework to identify links with a greater contribution to network structural connectivity improvement corridor path identification technology based on a greedy algorithm under hierarchical rules with different priorities indicated the suitability of specific landscape elements and spatial units for this addition thereby connecting them in series and transforming the abstract topological network model of structural optimization into a real geographical network composed of landscape elements the integration of these spatial planning tools enabled successful multi objective network optimization minimized potential conflicts in planning and enhanced the common interests of the network s functional and structural dimensions evaluating and identifying the capacity of ecological spaces to provide es and their priority settings have become the common goals of most studies hence we focused instead on identifying the optimal locations to improve network structural connectivity and searching for functional priority paths of corridors at the optimal locations we placed the improvement of structural connectivity ahead of the search for the corridors functional priority paths this approach is different from most existing methods for constructing and optimizing lens which first use connectivity construction models to generate corridors between patches and then use complex network evaluation indices or gravity models to identify the structural or functional importance of network components su et al 2019 dai et al 2021 kwon et al 2021 this generates corridors with structural redundancy which are eventually removed but require additional processing and analysis time in the previous step the complexity of the analysis and the reproducibility of the methods render len construction slow and cumbersome mu et al 2022 however the proposed method determined the network connection mode with the highest integral probable connectivity of the network using the topological network model fig 6 b simplifying the complexity of the multi scheme selection process for network structure optimization and then identified the specific ecological corridor geographical path fig 7 a for the nodes with topological links avoiding the generation and deletion of ecological corridors with structural redundancy this approach is feasible for conservation planners and can be applied to many conservation planning environments the optimized len fig 7 b based on this approach can better cope with climate and land use changes as well as risks and challenges posed by related anthropogenic activities to local ecosystems 4 2 optimization of len structure based on structural connectivity improvement a major advantage of landscape graphs over other connectivity modeling methods is that they can be easily applied to a wide spatial scale foltête et al 2014 experiments have shown that abstract landscape graphs can provide results similar to those of a single simulation minor and urban 2007 lookingbill et al 2010 confirming their ability to represent ecological processes therefore we used an abstract topological network model to simulate the various ways in which the network components are connected on a cross city scale the network structure optimization in the existing method is based on the complete len to assess the contribution of existing patches or corridors to the structure many studies have used network element removal techniques dilts et al 2016 mimet et al 2016 hofman et al 2018 or directly used complex network evaluation indices mu et al 2022 to evaluate the structural importance of individual components in the network however for cases where network connectivity needs to be improved due to the lack of patches or corridors the critical locations that need to be added to the links or nodes to improve the overall structural performance of the network cannot be identified using this method bodin and saura 2010 we used the network link additional technique with different additional link sequences based on iipc to determine the best places to add the links to significantly improve the integral probable connectivity of network between nodes that do not have a topological link apparently a fully connected network is likely to achieve optimal structural performance but building a real len in a rapidly urbanizing area is a complex and multi factor process mossman et al 2015 therefore factors such as improving network efficiency reducing structural redundancy and controlling construction costs need to be considered simultaneously thus we identified the key locations that are supported by graph theory as the best places to add network topological links to optimize and improve the overall connectivity of the network and the iipc change rates i e itsi values of these new links ranked in the top 6 of all the results after structural optimization the number of connectivity components of the network was significantly reduced indicating that the scattered substructures in the existing network were organized and the network s islanding phenomenon was improved forming an overall network with better connectivity in addition the network diameter and clustering coefficient were slightly reduced i e with the addition of links the distance between any two points connected in the network was reduced easing the movement of species and es flow between the two points this technique highlights the complementarity of the lowest cost and landscape graph approach hofman et al 2018 according to the i i p c eq 1 and itsi evaluation model eq 2 and the results the link that has extremely significant effect on improving the probable connectivity of network has the following conditions first the two ecological sources directly connected to it have relatively high ecological importance mesc index therefore building a connection between these two ecological sources is critical to supporting the spread of species between high quality habitats and forming strong and stable es flows second it tends to exist between two close ecological sources therefore more ecological patches are needed as intermediate stepping stones between distant ecological patches to ensure the migration of species from one end of the habitat to the other fleury and brown 1997 establishing a direct connection between the nearest ecological sources ensures a tightly connected structure between each adjacent ecological patch pair this explains the significant contribution of the links between nodes of numbers 9 and 10 12 and 27 and 30 and 31 to the probable connectivity of network and the unsuccessful connection of the sub network structures in the southeastern part of the study area to the main network structure this situation occurred mainly because the components in the southeastern part of the study area were far away from other network components additionally the mesc indices of these ecological sources were relatively low therefore the graph theory did not support the need to connect them to other network components to compensate for this in the final step we artificially added 11 important corridors mostly riverfront greenways and urban green corridors to the existing plans fig 7 b this effort fully considered the need for linear spaces connecting ecological patches in construction spaces compensated for the lack of network components in the southeast of the study area and successfully integrated the separated sub network structure to the main network structure 4 3 ecological function enhancement of len based on greedy selection under different priority rules in complex cities where land use already exists balancing the competing environmental and economic issues is required urgently xu and bai 2017 to effectively strengthen the es capacity of the len and ensure its implementation and construction feasibility gaining insight into its ecological and cost effectiveness in identifying and designing new corridor paths is important cross city scales require many decisions for ecological corridor path identification which is not conducive to system optimization therefore we used a greedy searching algorithm based on iterative to search proximity ecological corridor paths with maximized functions a greedy algorithm always makes the best choice for problem solving in the current view although the algorithm does not consider every greedy choice from the perspective of overall optimality for many problems with a wide range chen et al 2019 xu et al 2019a liu et al 2021 the greedy algorithm produces an overall optimal or approximate solution reed et al 2013 in this study the ecological corridor path searching process from the starting patch a to the destination patch b was decomposed into multiple sub processes starting from a 30 m 30 m grid to find the next adjacent grid and this was the optimal sub structure of the greedy algorithm for each sub structure through greedy selection the grid with the highest mesc was identified as a new starting point for the path and the operation was stopped after the grid with the destination patch was located by optimizing each sub structure mesc index of the selected grid being the largest the optimal solution to the overall problem cumulative mesc index of the path being the largest was finally obtained supporting es transmission and delivery and maintaining the continuity and functional connectivity of the stream during transmission according to pearson s correlation analysis the mesc indices and ecr values of all spaces in the study area showed a significant negative correlation i e the ecr values of spaces with high mesc indices tended to be lower this confirms the rationality of the hierarchical rules with different priorities that we set for the greedy selection when searching for the best corridor path the p1 level rule is preferentially executed mesc index is the largest and the p1 1 level rule does not need to be considered after the p1 level rule is executed the ecr value is the smallest because statistically the execution of the p1 level rule means that the p1 1 level rule has been simultaneously executed simplifying the calculation however when the p1 level rule fails to identify a unique grid p1 1 and p1 2 level rules need further consideration in multi objective planning based on landscape elements and ecological substrates along corridor paths we have provided planning and designing suggestions and measures for three additional corridor types for corridors based on high quality cultivated land we suggest building large avenues as air circulation channels and intercity shelterbelts for the nearby urban area new corridors connecting multiple existing ecological spaces integrate scattered ecological patches and are proposed to supplement and improve the stepping stone system on the corridor path so that species and es flows can spread directly between ecological patches in relative proximity for new corridors passing through construction spaces existing greenways or rivers in the city should be integrated as far as possible by controlling facilities land use development and anthropogenic activities along the river and appropriately increasing the number of green belts and the width of green belts on both sides of the river the mesc of existing river corridors can be improved and a more stable biological migration corridor and a connecting space for es transmission can be constructed if the existing river passes through the urban construction space consider constructing a riverside belt park or ecological wetland park 4 4 application prospect and limitations of the len optimization approach the multi objective approach for len optimization proposed in this paper has the following advantages first the structural optimization based on integral structural connectivity evaluation uses abstract topological network models to generate and compare multiple schemes of network connection modes reducing the complexity of analysis and increasing suitability for a wide range of spatial scales second functional enhancement of corridor paths is based on a greedy algorithm set under the hierarchical rules with different priorities reducing the complexity of path search while considering multiple objectives and saving planning time the above advantages in analysis method and processing time render this approach suitable for large scale len optimization focusing on co urbanized areas and applying this method to improve the connectivity of len the problems to be solved include the overall identification and extraction of len components the comprehensive construction of len structure and the overall improvement of len functions based on this method len helps to break the ecological restrictions brought by administrative divisions between cities in co urbanized areas shen et al 2023 and realize the co optimization of len connectivity from dual dimensions of structure and function especially as urban agglomerations gradually become a new form of human settlement in the process of urbanization integrating complete natural spatial units such as mountains water systems and habitats across urban administrative boundaries to construct lens is inevitable for coping with significant ecological risks and environmental problems at regional and national scales cai and yin 2011 compared with large scale ecological planning methods this research method focusing on the urban areas and co urbanized areas also reflects the following characteristics first the research scale is suitable the existing ecological patches and river corridors in rapidly urbanized areas can be better paid attention to and utilized and on this basis key locations to improve the connectivity of len structure can be identified in the limited urban space to realize the stock planning second it can adapt to local conditions according to the specific landscape environment and land use in the urban area the geographic path of ecological corridors with strong es transmission ability can be analyzed and identified which provides clear spatial guidance for the planning and construction of ecological corridors on urban scale although the multi objective approach presented in this paper has important contributions it still has limitations first the network link additional technique for network structure optimization considers the impact of adding an individual link to the network structure but does not consider the cumulative effect of several additional links on the network structural index causing underestimation of the contribution of some network to improving connectivity second new ecological corridors identified using this approach are raster paths with width 1 lacking true width and extent the implementation potential of such corridors depends on the verification of current land use protection status and development potential along the corridor path hofman et al 2018 therefore a ground based assessment of these factors in newly identified corridors is needed in further network construction efforts using such additional information different conservation and development scenarios can be drafted in addition in the process of evaluating the ecological resistance factors in the study area the factors considered in this study were limited which may have a certain impact on the search for ecological corridor paths when applying this method to other study areas more local factors can be added according to the characteristics of the study area such as road density and night light index in highly urbanized areas or nature reserves and habitats of focal species 5 conclusions we devised a multi objective approach to improve the functional and structural connectivity of an existing len and optimized the len in the su jia hu co urbanizing area providing reference information for the identification of potential ecological corridors as important connections this optimized len consists of 43 ecological sources 13 existing river corridors 50 additional potential ecological corridors and 11 important planned corridors we integrated the network link additional technique and network structural connectivity index to form an optimized framework for network structure by quantifying the iipc under many network connection modes and selecting the 50 links sorted in the top 6 according to the sequence of indices of different links the optimal topological locations for network structure optimization were determined considering mesc enhancement and ecr reduction as the hierarchical rules with different priorities we used a greedy algorithm to identify the geographical paths of the additional links to indicate suitable landscape elements and spatial units for additional corridor planning because of their strong ecological functions and small ecological resistance although this paper only demonstrated the network optimization results of one rapidly urbanizing area we believe that the approach proposed in this study has wide applicability overcomes the shortcomings of previous methods which failed to consider multiple optimization objectives of network structure and function and aims to improve the functional and structural connectivity of existing lens through targeted and integrated methods for addressing major ecological risks and challenges at large scales funding this work was supported by the key project of national natural science foundation of china

24158,by building connectivity between ecological spaces the landscape ecology network len can effectively prevent further habitat fragmentation and loss in urbanizing areas the existing len construction method fails to consider the multiple optimization goals of improving network structural and functional connectivity this paper aimed to provide a novel method to improve connectivity for existing lens in urbanizing areas we took an urbanizing area in china as an example and extract existing len based on ecological priorities on this basis from the dimension of structural connectivity optimization we used the network link additional technique based on integral index of probable connection to identify 50 optimal locations of additional corridors that could significantly improve the network structural connectivity from the dimension of functional connectivity enhancement we applied the greedy algorithm based on hierarchical rules with different priorities to search for corridor paths with maximum ecological function and low ecological and construction resistance the optimized len contained 43 ecological sources and 74 ecological corridors the dual dimension method proposed in this paper can improve the functional and structural connectivity of existing len and greatly save the optimization time and efficiency of the network to provide targeted ecological space protection schemes for urbanizing areas keywords landscape ecological network optimization approach connectivity improvement structural and functional connectivity landscape graph theory greedy algorithm data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction global metropolitan areas are expanding nations 2015 however urban cluster development is aggravating ecological patch loss fragmentation and isolation damaging the structure and function of the ecological space system barbati et al 2013 sinha et al 2017 and affecting ecosystem services ess and human well being therefore conservation efforts are urgently required to halt large scale ecosystem degradation due to rapid urbanization and to withstand significant ecological risks in large scale human settlements hermoso et al 2020 many studies have identified important protected areas pas and their priorities as ecological sources and habitats for species providing ess kukkala et al 2016 strassburg et al 2020 yang et al 2020 shrestha et al 2021 thus providing reference information for pa protection and management however these studies only emphasize the capacity of pas or the ecological spaces with the potential to become pas in providing es failing to protect pas in an interconnected ecological network and preventing structural connectivity between important pas isolated management may undermine the effectiveness of conservation hermoso et al 2020 and make it easy to ignore the impact of ecosystem structure and connectivity on ecological processes and functions wang et al 2021a therefore strategically identifying and adding new areas to connect the existing pas is essential to enhance connectivity between regional ecological space systems commission 2013 and build a strong extensive and resilient large scale ecological network that continuously provides ess to cities unlike large scale planning efforts that focus on determining the conservation priority of individual pas many studies and practices have been devoted to constructing landscape ecological networks lens with high connectivity at urban and district scales kwon et al 2021 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 2021 initially the design of conservation networks with connectivity relied on expert opinions to determine corridors between pas by assessing the structure and orientation of natural landscape features hofman et al 2018 however this approach has been criticized for being subjective and weakening the repeatability of landscape connectivity assessments sawyer et al 2011 currently landscape ecologists quantify and construct structural connectivity between ecological patches through various methods and models including the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model and least cost path lcp analysis kong et al 2010 keeley et al 2016 circuit theory peng et al 2018 jahanishakib et al 2021 and graph theory clauzel et al 2018 foltête 2019 corridor analysis based on the mcr model and circuit theory relies on the setting of resistance surfaces and only considers obstacles caused by built up environmental characteristics on biological migration and the impact of landscape heterogeneity on ecological process flow peng et al 2018 however this inherent paradigm and simplistic assumptions lack the flexibility to respond to different environments and animal movement characteristics greatly reducing the effectiveness and relevance of connectivity models to conservation theory and practice kumar et al 2022 furthermore the functional characteristic of an ecological corridor as the supporting space for transmitting and delivering ess is disregarded moreover the mcr model may generate structurally redundant corridors lu et al 2020 which require filtering and manual deletion increasing the difficulty of application in a larger space range graph theory provides a spatially conceptualized representation for lens xun et al 2017 in recent years graph theory has become more widely used in ecological network analysis providing emerging new and more precise indexes to describe the connectivity and resilience of len hashemi and darabi 2022 however it cannot provide a ground truthed design for large scale landscape connectivity based on specific land use and landscape components kilbane et al 2019 to comprehensively address significant ecological risks and human needs at regional and national scales creating lens is an important approach that couples landscape function structure and ecological processes vuilleumier and prélaz droux 2002 xu et al 2016 focuses on the connectivity of network function and structure the functional connectivity of len is manifested in the sustainability of natural resource supply and the high level of es maintenance as well as the consistency of habitats within the space and the minimization of external obstructions and disturbances chi et al 2019 the construction spaces within the rapidly urbanizing area are dense and the proportion of impervious surfaces in urban areas is increasing xu et al 2018 therefore planners should balance ecological benefits and cost effectiveness when constructing lens using limited farmland and ecological patches xu et al 2019b by prioritizing the best resources and paths to arrange ecological corridors to form a connected network the network s capacity to provide multiple ess is maximized while controlling network construction cost and resistance and the functional connectivity of the network is also enhanced the structural connectivity of len is manifested in the continuity of the ecological space itself that supports the spatial flow of ess and the way in which the connection between various spatial elements optimizes the network structure and efficiency gonzález 2023 however most of the existing methods only focus on building or enhancing the connectivity of len in one dimension and only emphasize and shape the functional or structural characteristics of the network at the same time multi objective planning methods that take network structural and functional connectivity as the basis for len construction and optimization rarely exist based on the above research gaps this paper aimed to develop a new methodological framework to enhance len connectivity in both structural and functional dimensions and took typical urbanizing area in china as an example to optimize its existing len the framework was characterized by optimizing len from two dimensions structure and function at present many graph based complex network evaluation indices have been developed to quantitatively evaluate the connectivity of lens borgatti and everett 2006 bodin and saura 2010 hashemi and darabi 2022 recent studies have shown that graph based approaches can assess the structural importance of individual network components by removing or adding them and ranking their impact on the connectivity of the entire ecological network foltête et al 2014 xun et al 2017 to determine the necessity of patches or corridors in the network based on this we first used the network link additional technique based on the integral index of probable connection to identify the best locations of the new corridors that can significantly improve the connectivity of the existing len structure and determine the network topology connection method for structural optimization for the traditional ecological corridor path analysis model that obtains the best path selection by comparing many cumulative calculation results the best corridor path identification is time consuming therefore an efficient corridor path identification algorithm is critical to the overall computational performance of the solution process the greedy algorithm iteratively achieves the overall optimal solution of the solved problem by making a series of local optimal choices simplifying the multi objective solution of the overall problem to a smaller sub problem reed et al 2013 xu et al 2019b reducing the overall solution s complexity and shortening the computation time stopka et al 2020 liu et al 2022 therefore we secondly used the greedy algorithm set under the hierarchical rules to search for the new corridor paths with the largest ecological function and low ecological and construction resistance transform the topological network into a geographic network and provide specific support spaces for biological flow material flow energy flow and es spatial flow to enhance the functional connectivity within the network this paper aimed to provide a reference for building large scale len and realizing the co optimization practice of functional connectivity and structural connectivity of the networks 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the su jia hu co urbanizing area was the study site which includes three cities suzhou jiaxing and huzhou distributed around the east bank of the taihu lake close to the metropolitan area of shanghai and located in the yangtze river delta urban agglomeration yrdua a region with most significant urbanization and ecosystem changes fig 1 the study area covered a total area of 18 221 km2 and had a resident population of 18 315 million by 2015 the urbanization rate in this area had reached 72 64 54 86 higher than that in the early days of china s reform and opening up lian et al 2018 from the perspective of location the su jia hu area plays the role of buffer and barrier between the taihu lake basin and the shanghai metropolitan area at the same time it is also an important connection area in the taihu lake basin that connects taihu lake huangpu river system qiantang river and other water systems so it has important regional strategic significance and ecological importance improving and optimizing the connectivity of len within the scope of this study will not only help to integrate the natural resources shared by the area connect the rich landscape elements and diverse ecosystems of the region but also promote the further integration of policies and management within the su jia hu area belonging to jiangsu and zhejiang provinces at the same time its value is also reflected in providing the core guarantee of ecological security for the adjacent shanghai metropolitan area and the yrdua 2 2 methodological framework the existing len in the study area was composed of ecological sources with strong ecological function and important river corridors but the existing networks extracted under ecological determinism often lack connectivity therefore this paper took the identified existing len as the optimization basis firstly optimized the structural connectivity of the network to strengthen the continuity between the components of the existing len secondly it strengthened the functional connectivity of the network to provide the least hindrance and interference supporting spaces for the delivery and transmission of es spatial flows in the network fig 2 we introduced the integral index of probable connection into the network link additional technique to evaluate the overall connectivity of the new network obtained by adding a new connection to the original network moreover by comparing the change rate of the probable connectivity brought by all new connections the new connection locations that play a key role in improving the overall structural connectivity of the network were identified to obtain the topological connection mode of the network with optimized structure from this dimension we provided new index and technique for the structural connectivity optimization of len and proposed suggestions and strategies for adding new corridors in key locations to optimize the network structure by setting hierarchical rules with different priorities we wrote and executed greedy algorithms to identify geographic paths that minimize resistance and interference to the transmission of es in ecological corridors at the new connection locations in the context of existing landscape elements and land uses to generate len with enhanced ecological functions from this dimension we provided algorithms and path searching technique under new rules for enhancing the functional connectivity of len and proposed suggestions and strategies for planning new ecological corridors at specific locations 2 3 data sources and processing 2 3 1 existing landscape ecological network identification the existing len in the su jia hu area is extracted from the results of the authors existing research on the study area shen et al 2021 which consists of ecological sources with strong ecological functions and existing important river corridors through the multiple ecosystem service capacity index mesc index coupling evaluation model the authors evaluated the comprehensive capacity of the existing ecological patches in the u jia hu area to provide five key ess biodiversity maintenance service flood regulation service microclimate regulating service water purification service and recreation and tourism service based on the evaluation results and through spatial cluster analysis the ecological spaces were divided into six priorities see the appendix a for the results of the existing ecological space priority classification in the study area subsequently ecological patches with high ecological priority first to third grade priority large patch size and complete morphology were extracted as important ecological sources consist of existing len for existing river corridors first we screened 37 rivers with higher stream orders of 1 3 grades from among the several existing rivers in the study area based on the classification from the regulations of the people s republic of china on the administration of river courses in 2017 second using the natural breakpoint method classification we extracted 22 rivers 31 1 km with the length of the top 2 3 portion of rivers finally we manually identified 13 rivers that play an important role in connectivity i e rivers connecting two or more ecological sources as ecological corridors in the existing len these river corridors and important ecological sources constituted the existing len in the study area 2 3 2 other data sources we used the following four data sets appendix b of 2015 to optimize the len in the study area 1 land use cover 2 digital elevation model 3 1 10 000 scale river map and 4 spatial distribution of terrestrial es value in china for data sources with an inconsistent resolution 1 km 1 km dot matrix data shp was formed using raster transition points of 1 km in arcgis we then used the trend surface method in the interpolation analysis tool of the spatial analyst module to interpolate points into a grid surface with a unified resolution of 30 m land use data were produced using classifications based on landsat remote sensing images downloaded from the website of usgs http glovis usgs gov based on china s land use status classification gb t 21 010 2017 su jia hu land use characteristics and remote sensing information the land use types in the study area were divided into cultivated land construction space and ecological space the land use accuracy of construction space was over 70 and that for other spaces was more than 80 ecological space was divided into forest grassland lake wetland unused land and river the first five types of ecological spaces exhibit patchy spatial characteristics whereas rivers exhibit linear spatial characteristics the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem service value in china an open source data set provided by the data center for resources and environment sciences chinese academy of sciences suggests that china s terrestrial ecosystems are divided into forest grassland water area wetland desert and cultivated land the first five ecosystems correspond to the five patchy ecological spaces in the study area based on the spatial distribution data of net primary productivity npp precipitation and soil conservation in china the value equivalent factor for each es was adjusted using the es value equivalent factor method xie et al 2015 and 11 es values were calculated based on the five key ess selected in this study we chose the es values of biodiversity hydrology regulation climate regulation environmental purification and landscape culture the selected spatial data were clipped according to the scope of the study area 2 4 dual dimensions for landscape ecological network connectivity improvement 2 4 1 structural connectivity optimization based on integral index of probable connection landscape graph is a model for representing the habitat and ecological flow characteristics and species movements at large spatial scales foltête et al 2014 using nodes and connections landscape graphs provide a spatially conceptualized representation xun et al 2017 which helps delineate patches and corridors that contribute most to the overall connectivity of large scale networks galpern et al 2011 sahraoui et al 2021 in this study we used landscape graph to construct the model for len structural connectivity optimization based on structural connectivity the measure of the overall structural network performance the steps for network structure optimization of the existing len fig 3 were as follows first based on graph theory the abstract topological network model of the existing len was constructed through nodes and links step 1 second a structural index was developed and the probable integral connectivity of different network connection modes was evaluated step 2 third the network link technique was used to add new links between nodes that were not connected step 3 and the change rate of the integral probable connectivity of network caused due to the additions was evaluated and ranked step 4 ultimately the additional links in top positions were recognized as important for the network structure confirming the optimal position for adding links between nodes to improve network connectivity and forming a new topological network model that maximizes the integral probable connectivity of the network there is no mature index to evaluate the contribution of individual links to the overall network connectivity we used the iipc of a network to evaluate the capacity of individual links as structural connectivity providers we described the probability of two randomly placed points in the landscape falling into ecological sources that were reachable to each other directly connected by a link without passing through other patches and considered the ease with which these two points move and diffuse between the two ecological sources represented by the topological distance moving along the link we used i i p c to indicate the new measurement of this index after the addition of corridor k as a new link in the existing network which was calculated as follows 1 i i p c i 1 n j 1 n e i e j p i j 1 1 d k a 2 where n is the number of identified ecological sources and the number of nodes in the topological network model e is the ecological importance weight of the ecological source expressed by its mesc index and p i j is the probability that any two ecological sources in the len can be directly connected by the corridor without going through other patches the p i j of ecological sources i and j that have corridors between them as a direct connection was set to 1 to simplify the calculation if there is no direct connection or i j then the p i j 0 d k is the topological length of the new ecological corridor k added as a link between the ecological source i and j a is the study area including all ecological and non ecological spaces we constructed the importance of topological structure index itsi to measure the change rate of iipc caused by each additional link the index described the extent to which corridor k the link in the network contributed to the connectivity between other network components depending on the topological location of corridor k high itsi indicated that adding corridor k to the topological network can greatly improve the connectivity between other network components low itsi indicated that the addition of corridor k did not play a large role in the connectivity of the network topology and can be considered a non essential topological link in the case of limited space and resources the itsi was calculated as follows 2 i t s i k i i p c i i p c i i p c 100 new links were built for each pair of nodes without existing connections using the networkx toolkit based on the python language and according to eqs 1 and 2 we wrote the code that calculates the iipc and itsi after each link addition we set an open source shared code base https github com pandasang1231 simple landscape analysis on the github website accessible to anyone for using this network structure optimization method the results of itsi were ranked and divided into five levels using the natural breakpoint method and the impact of the additional links on the integral probable connectivity of network was divided into five degrees extremely significant significant general insignificant and barely any impact we selected the additional links with extremely significant and significant impacts as the best places to improve the integral structural connectivity of the existing len 2 4 2 functional connectivity enhancement based on greedy selection under hierarchical rules in this study we used a greedy search algorithm starting from the grid where a certain ecological patch was located and gradually approaching another ecological patch as the ending point by continuously selecting the grid scheme as the best corridor path under the established rules until the destination grid was reached black 2005 according to the above theoretical basis the steps to identify the geographic paths of additional links in the len topological model with optimal structure in specific urban environments and ecological substrates are as follows fig 4 first the grid of 30 m 30 m was used as the basic unit of spatial analysis and the grid assignment surface of corridor path identification rules was constructed including mesc index assignment and ecr value assignment using the individual es value spatial data from the spatial distribution of terrestrial ecosystem service value in china the capacity to provide multiple ess to cultivated lands that also serve as ecological substrates was evaluated using the mesc index coupling assessment model and the mesc index of each cultivated land patch was calculated the results of the mesc index evaluation of cultivated lands and ecological spaces were summarized and divided into five levels using the natural breakpoint method and the corresponding grids were assigned values of 1 5 grids belonging to construction space were assigned zero we referred to relevant literature yu et al 2017 fu et al 2020 kumar et al 2022 mu et al 2022 to collect common ecological resistance factors and based on the environmental characteristics of the study area and experts opinions the following ecological resistance factors that were important for the study area were screened including 1 land cover types subdivided into five categories forest grassland water bodies unused land and impervious surface because different land cover affects the exchange of matter and energy and the transmission of es flows between ecological patches 2 river network density because the study area was in the plain water network area and the rivers can provide many ess and improve local spatial connectivity 3 elevation and 4 slope as there were diverse topographies in the study area and elevation and slope can directly affect species migration vegetation distribution and es flow direction based on the evaluation of above multiple ecological resistance factors appendix c the ecr value of each grid was obtained divided into ten grades using the natural breakpoint method and the values 1 10 were assigned to corresponding grids ecr values were positively correlated with these ecological resistance factors second to consider the ecological benefits and cost effectiveness of len construction under multi objective conditions we adopted hierarchical rules for executing each greedy choice appendix d as follows 1 continue to execute the lower level rules only if the highest level rule has been carried out without an only result and 2 if the only result has been obtained after the highest level rule is carried out the execution of the underlying rules is no longer considered simplifying the calculation and saving analysis time while ensuring that the top level rule has been performed first this priority between different hierarchical rules can be expressed by priority factors p1 and p1 p1 1 dai et al 2008 for each step of greedy choice the p1 level rule is to select the only grid with the largest mesc index the p1 1 level rule is to select the only grid with the smallest ecr value the p1 2 level rule is to select the grid with the closest euclidean distance to the destination grid we used breadth first search bfs based on the above hierarchical rules to identify the optimal path between each node pair with topological connections see the open source shared code base for detailed codes https github com pandasang1231 simple landscape analysis mesc index and ecr assignment grids generated in arcgis were exported as tif files and used as input data for running the code to identify each grid coordinate and a continuous path was formed from the start to end points the path identification results were exported as a tif file we assigned unified values to grids on the same path and the values of n paths were assigned 1 n in sequence the grids not belonging to any paths were assigned zero the tif file was imported back into arcgis and the raster path was converted into lines using raster to polyline in data management tool urban ecological space planning green space system planning and ecological security pattern planning can reflect the demand of urban development for the spatial elements of len to a certain extent wei et al 2019 therefore at last by referring to the existing plans of suzhou jiaxing and huzhou the important ecological corridors in the planning were artificially supplemented to generate a complete spatial network structure 3 results 3 1 existing landscape ecological network composed of ecological sources and important river corridors we extracted 43 ecological patches from the first second and third grades ecological spaces as important ecological sources with a total area of 4271 3 km2 accounting for 62 4 of the total ecological patch area and 22 1 of the total area of the study area lakes and ponds were the main landscape type accounting for 60 of the total number of patches followed by forests 16 and wetlands 14 grasslands and unused lands in the study area were small in scale had low vegetation cover and their capacity to provide multi ess was poor therefore none of these ecological patch types was selected as an ecological source large ecological sources were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas in the middle and southwest of the study area the northeast was dominated by medium sized ecological patches the north and southeast were areas where the existing ecological source areas were relatively lacking and only a small number of riverfront wetlands attached to large rivers were identified as ecological sources the total length of 13 river corridors in the existing len was 874 km it included two first grade river sections the yangtze and qiantang rivers six second grade rivers and five third grade rivers flowing through the study area the river corridors in the existing len were mainly distributed in the southwest with a small number of corridors in the north and east of the study area due to the lack of ecological sources in the southeastern part of the study area few existing river corridors were identified to connect ecological sources the existing len fig 5 consisting of 43 ecological sources and 13 river corridors presented a general pattern wherein the network components were abundant in the central northeastern and southwestern regions and rare in the north and southeast the network was better connected in the southwest part because there were more existing river corridors while the eastern and northern parts had more ecological sources but a small number of corridors resulting in a lack of connectivity between them in addition the network components in the southeast were separated from the main network structure organized by the taihu lake in the center of the study area 3 2 structurally optimized landscape ecological network connection mode fig 6 a shows a topological model of the existing len consisting of 43 ecological sources as nodes and 13 existing river corridors as links four river corridors were segmented by the nodes hence the network topological model contained 25 existing links the index statistics of the existing len topological model are shown in appendix e we obtained 878 additional individual links and their corresponding network connection mode models the visualization of the itsi calculation results of the above additional links is presented in appendix f a total of 50 additional links i e 6 of all additional links had extremely significant and significant impacts appendix g and h and were recognized as the best places to improve the integral probable connectivity of network these links were added to the existing network topological model the topological model of the structurally optimized len is shown in fig 6 b the index statistics of the len topological model of structural optimization is presented in appendix i comparing appendix e and i the number of network connectivity components was significantly reduced and the network diameter and clustering coefficient were slightly reduced most new links were densely distributed in the northeast of the study area where ecological sources were high but connectivity was poor and a few were in the southwest of the study area where the current connectivity was better fig 6 b considering the ecological source with a high mesc index 3 9 number 10 as the center many new links were connected and several scattered small ecological sources such as the ecological sources numbered 9 11 21 23 and 24 were organized around it forming a sub network structure with good local connectivity in the northern part of the study area and connecting the multiple ecological sources in this area that originally lacked connections to the main network structure centered around number 14 the taihu lake similarly with the ecological sources numbered 31 12 and 13 as the center another local sub network structure was formed in the eastern part of the study area through new links and more scattered ecological sources were organized simultaneously through the three key links between ecological sources numbers 10 and 25 23 and 12 and 9 and 12 the two sub network structures of the east and the north were linked thus the sub network structures were also connected to each other and organically combined with the main network structure the new links greatly resolved the problem of having several ecological sources with poor connectivity in the eastern and northern parts of the study area however among the first 50 new links that significantly affected the integral probable connectivity of network none connected the separated sub network structures in the southeast part of the study area to the main network structure the itsi ranking of the first additional link that connected this sub network structure to the main network structure was 336 located between ecological sources numbers 41 and 14 3 3 functional enhanced landscape ecological corridor paths appendix j a shows the mesc index distribution for all spaces in the su jia hu area the spaces with high mesc indices 3 0 were concentrated in the ecological sources the areas with mesc indices of 2 0 to 3 0 existed in the wide cultivated lands in the southeast and west of the study area and in the ecological spaces such as rivers grasslands and wetlands the cultivated lands in the south north and east of the study area had low mesc indices ranging from 1 0 to 2 0 appendix j b shows the ecr value distribution for all spaces in the su jia hu area areas with high ecr values 7 10 were evenly and widely distributed in the northern and southeastern regions of the study area lacked ecological spaces and had dense rural settlements and urban areas on the north and south sides of the taihu lake areas with low ecr values 1 3 were concentrated on ecological sources the vast cultivated lands in the south southeast and northeast exhibited moderate levels of ecr values 4 6 pearson s correlation analysis indicated that the mesc indices and ecr values in all spaces in the study area had significant negative correlations at the 0 01 level p 0 052 fig 7 a shows the three different types of geographic paths for constructing ecological corridors at the optimal locations the total length of the 50 additional corridors was 608 36 km the longest and shortest corridors were 55 21 km and 2 03 km respectively according to the main spatial units on the corridor paths the additional corridors were divided into 1 13 cultivated land corridors whose paths traversed large cultivated land matrices they were mainly distributed in urban suburbs with small ecological space scales and scattered distribution in the north and east of the study area 2 30 ecological corridors that integrated scattered ecological units to form a stepping stone system such corridors connected many ecological spaces most of which were not ecological sources they were mainly distributed in the eastern and southwestern regions with dense ecological spaces 3 seven corridors in need of quality improvement they passed through the built up areas and were mainly distributed in the urban areas in the north and northeast of the study area where construction spaces were concentrated based on the existing plans we also identified 15 important ecological corridors appendix k three in suzhou four in huzhou and eight in jiaxing with the largest number of rivers and the densest distribution through manual addition and deletion of duplicate corridors 4 duplicate corridors in total at last 11 key planned corridors were added to the existing corridor system making a total of 74 corridors in the optimized len of the study area fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 multi objective optimization approach for len connectivity improvement this study optimized the connectivity of existing len using an integrated approach in a complex and extensive landscape filled with existing land use to achieve multi objective optimization of functional and structural dimensions increase connections between ecological sources and use functionally prioritized landscape elements and spatial units in existing environments to construct practical geographic connections based on the existing len the network link additional technique and iipc were integrated into the network structure optimization framework to identify links with a greater contribution to network structural connectivity improvement corridor path identification technology based on a greedy algorithm under hierarchical rules with different priorities indicated the suitability of specific landscape elements and spatial units for this addition thereby connecting them in series and transforming the abstract topological network model of structural optimization into a real geographical network composed of landscape elements the integration of these spatial planning tools enabled successful multi objective network optimization minimized potential conflicts in planning and enhanced the common interests of the network s functional and structural dimensions evaluating and identifying the capacity of ecological spaces to provide es and their priority settings have become the common goals of most studies hence we focused instead on identifying the optimal locations to improve network structural connectivity and searching for functional priority paths of corridors at the optimal locations we placed the improvement of structural connectivity ahead of the search for the corridors functional priority paths this approach is different from most existing methods for constructing and optimizing lens which first use connectivity construction models to generate corridors between patches and then use complex network evaluation indices or gravity models to identify the structural or functional importance of network components su et al 2019 dai et al 2021 kwon et al 2021 this generates corridors with structural redundancy which are eventually removed but require additional processing and analysis time in the previous step the complexity of the analysis and the reproducibility of the methods render len construction slow and cumbersome mu et al 2022 however the proposed method determined the network connection mode with the highest integral probable connectivity of the network using the topological network model fig 6 b simplifying the complexity of the multi scheme selection process for network structure optimization and then identified the specific ecological corridor geographical path fig 7 a for the nodes with topological links avoiding the generation and deletion of ecological corridors with structural redundancy this approach is feasible for conservation planners and can be applied to many conservation planning environments the optimized len fig 7 b based on this approach can better cope with climate and land use changes as well as risks and challenges posed by related anthropogenic activities to local ecosystems 4 2 optimization of len structure based on structural connectivity improvement a major advantage of landscape graphs over other connectivity modeling methods is that they can be easily applied to a wide spatial scale foltête et al 2014 experiments have shown that abstract landscape graphs can provide results similar to those of a single simulation minor and urban 2007 lookingbill et al 2010 confirming their ability to represent ecological processes therefore we used an abstract topological network model to simulate the various ways in which the network components are connected on a cross city scale the network structure optimization in the existing method is based on the complete len to assess the contribution of existing patches or corridors to the structure many studies have used network element removal techniques dilts et al 2016 mimet et al 2016 hofman et al 2018 or directly used complex network evaluation indices mu et al 2022 to evaluate the structural importance of individual components in the network however for cases where network connectivity needs to be improved due to the lack of patches or corridors the critical locations that need to be added to the links or nodes to improve the overall structural performance of the network cannot be identified using this method bodin and saura 2010 we used the network link additional technique with different additional link sequences based on iipc to determine the best places to add the links to significantly improve the integral probable connectivity of network between nodes that do not have a topological link apparently a fully connected network is likely to achieve optimal structural performance but building a real len in a rapidly urbanizing area is a complex and multi factor process mossman et al 2015 therefore factors such as improving network efficiency reducing structural redundancy and controlling construction costs need to be considered simultaneously thus we identified the key locations that are supported by graph theory as the best places to add network topological links to optimize and improve the overall connectivity of the network and the iipc change rates i e itsi values of these new links ranked in the top 6 of all the results after structural optimization the number of connectivity components of the network was significantly reduced indicating that the scattered substructures in the existing network were organized and the network s islanding phenomenon was improved forming an overall network with better connectivity in addition the network diameter and clustering coefficient were slightly reduced i e with the addition of links the distance between any two points connected in the network was reduced easing the movement of species and es flow between the two points this technique highlights the complementarity of the lowest cost and landscape graph approach hofman et al 2018 according to the i i p c eq 1 and itsi evaluation model eq 2 and the results the link that has extremely significant effect on improving the probable connectivity of network has the following conditions first the two ecological sources directly connected to it have relatively high ecological importance mesc index therefore building a connection between these two ecological sources is critical to supporting the spread of species between high quality habitats and forming strong and stable es flows second it tends to exist between two close ecological sources therefore more ecological patches are needed as intermediate stepping stones between distant ecological patches to ensure the migration of species from one end of the habitat to the other fleury and brown 1997 establishing a direct connection between the nearest ecological sources ensures a tightly connected structure between each adjacent ecological patch pair this explains the significant contribution of the links between nodes of numbers 9 and 10 12 and 27 and 30 and 31 to the probable connectivity of network and the unsuccessful connection of the sub network structures in the southeastern part of the study area to the main network structure this situation occurred mainly because the components in the southeastern part of the study area were far away from other network components additionally the mesc indices of these ecological sources were relatively low therefore the graph theory did not support the need to connect them to other network components to compensate for this in the final step we artificially added 11 important corridors mostly riverfront greenways and urban green corridors to the existing plans fig 7 b this effort fully considered the need for linear spaces connecting ecological patches in construction spaces compensated for the lack of network components in the southeast of the study area and successfully integrated the separated sub network structure to the main network structure 4 3 ecological function enhancement of len based on greedy selection under different priority rules in complex cities where land use already exists balancing the competing environmental and economic issues is required urgently xu and bai 2017 to effectively strengthen the es capacity of the len and ensure its implementation and construction feasibility gaining insight into its ecological and cost effectiveness in identifying and designing new corridor paths is important cross city scales require many decisions for ecological corridor path identification which is not conducive to system optimization therefore we used a greedy searching algorithm based on iterative to search proximity ecological corridor paths with maximized functions a greedy algorithm always makes the best choice for problem solving in the current view although the algorithm does not consider every greedy choice from the perspective of overall optimality for many problems with a wide range chen et al 2019 xu et al 2019a liu et al 2021 the greedy algorithm produces an overall optimal or approximate solution reed et al 2013 in this study the ecological corridor path searching process from the starting patch a to the destination patch b was decomposed into multiple sub processes starting from a 30 m 30 m grid to find the next adjacent grid and this was the optimal sub structure of the greedy algorithm for each sub structure through greedy selection the grid with the highest mesc was identified as a new starting point for the path and the operation was stopped after the grid with the destination patch was located by optimizing each sub structure mesc index of the selected grid being the largest the optimal solution to the overall problem cumulative mesc index of the path being the largest was finally obtained supporting es transmission and delivery and maintaining the continuity and functional connectivity of the stream during transmission according to pearson s correlation analysis the mesc indices and ecr values of all spaces in the study area showed a significant negative correlation i e the ecr values of spaces with high mesc indices tended to be lower this confirms the rationality of the hierarchical rules with different priorities that we set for the greedy selection when searching for the best corridor path the p1 level rule is preferentially executed mesc index is the largest and the p1 1 level rule does not need to be considered after the p1 level rule is executed the ecr value is the smallest because statistically the execution of the p1 level rule means that the p1 1 level rule has been simultaneously executed simplifying the calculation however when the p1 level rule fails to identify a unique grid p1 1 and p1 2 level rules need further consideration in multi objective planning based on landscape elements and ecological substrates along corridor paths we have provided planning and designing suggestions and measures for three additional corridor types for corridors based on high quality cultivated land we suggest building large avenues as air circulation channels and intercity shelterbelts for the nearby urban area new corridors connecting multiple existing ecological spaces integrate scattered ecological patches and are proposed to supplement and improve the stepping stone system on the corridor path so that species and es flows can spread directly between ecological patches in relative proximity for new corridors passing through construction spaces existing greenways or rivers in the city should be integrated as far as possible by controlling facilities land use development and anthropogenic activities along the river and appropriately increasing the number of green belts and the width of green belts on both sides of the river the mesc of existing river corridors can be improved and a more stable biological migration corridor and a connecting space for es transmission can be constructed if the existing river passes through the urban construction space consider constructing a riverside belt park or ecological wetland park 4 4 application prospect and limitations of the len optimization approach the multi objective approach for len optimization proposed in this paper has the following advantages first the structural optimization based on integral structural connectivity evaluation uses abstract topological network models to generate and compare multiple schemes of network connection modes reducing the complexity of analysis and increasing suitability for a wide range of spatial scales second functional enhancement of corridor paths is based on a greedy algorithm set under the hierarchical rules with different priorities reducing the complexity of path search while considering multiple objectives and saving planning time the above advantages in analysis method and processing time render this approach suitable for large scale len optimization focusing on co urbanized areas and applying this method to improve the connectivity of len the problems to be solved include the overall identification and extraction of len components the comprehensive construction of len structure and the overall improvement of len functions based on this method len helps to break the ecological restrictions brought by administrative divisions between cities in co urbanized areas shen et al 2023 and realize the co optimization of len connectivity from dual dimensions of structure and function especially as urban agglomerations gradually become a new form of human settlement in the process of urbanization integrating complete natural spatial units such as mountains water systems and habitats across urban administrative boundaries to construct lens is inevitable for coping with significant ecological risks and environmental problems at regional and national scales cai and yin 2011 compared with large scale ecological planning methods this research method focusing on the urban areas and co urbanized areas also reflects the following characteristics first the research scale is suitable the existing ecological patches and river corridors in rapidly urbanized areas can be better paid attention to and utilized and on this basis key locations to improve the connectivity of len structure can be identified in the limited urban space to realize the stock planning second it can adapt to local conditions according to the specific landscape environment and land use in the urban area the geographic path of ecological corridors with strong es transmission ability can be analyzed and identified which provides clear spatial guidance for the planning and construction of ecological corridors on urban scale although the multi objective approach presented in this paper has important contributions it still has limitations first the network link additional technique for network structure optimization considers the impact of adding an individual link to the network structure but does not consider the cumulative effect of several additional links on the network structural index causing underestimation of the contribution of some network to improving connectivity second new ecological corridors identified using this approach are raster paths with width 1 lacking true width and extent the implementation potential of such corridors depends on the verification of current land use protection status and development potential along the corridor path hofman et al 2018 therefore a ground based assessment of these factors in newly identified corridors is needed in further network construction efforts using such additional information different conservation and development scenarios can be drafted in addition in the process of evaluating the ecological resistance factors in the study area the factors considered in this study were limited which may have a certain impact on the search for ecological corridor paths when applying this method to other study areas more local factors can be added according to the characteristics of the study area such as road density and night light index in highly urbanized areas or nature reserves and habitats of focal species 5 conclusions we devised a multi objective approach to improve the functional and structural connectivity of an existing len and optimized the len in the su jia hu co urbanizing area providing reference information for the identification of potential ecological corridors as important connections this optimized len consists of 43 ecological sources 13 existing river corridors 50 additional potential ecological corridors and 11 important planned corridors we integrated the network link additional technique and network structural connectivity index to form an optimized framework for network structure by quantifying the iipc under many network connection modes and selecting the 50 links sorted in the top 6 according to the sequence of indices of different links the optimal topological locations for network structure optimization were determined considering mesc enhancement and ecr reduction as the hierarchical rules with different priorities we used a greedy algorithm to identify the geographical paths of the additional links to indicate suitable landscape elements and spatial units for additional corridor planning because of their strong ecological functions and small ecological resistance although this paper only demonstrated the network optimization results of one rapidly urbanizing area we believe that the approach proposed in this study has wide applicability overcomes the shortcomings of previous methods which failed to consider multiple optimization objectives of network structure and function and aims to improve the functional and structural connectivity of existing lens through targeted and integrated methods for addressing major ecological risks and challenges at large scales funding this work was supported by the key project of national natural science foundation of china

maximum function note the premises to execute three priorities of greedy selection rules are as follows 1 the choice of greed direction for each time identify the orientation upper left lower left upper right lower right right left upper and lower side of the grid where ecological source b is located relative to each starting grid i as the direction of the path 2 the grid range of greedy selection for each time centering on each starting grid i a 3 3 moving window is used to cover its surrounding grids greedy selection under hierarchical multi objective rules is performed on non

24159,the deterioration of the environment has been aggravated by the rapid growth of cities and economies and inter regional political economic scientific and technological frictions caused by ecological problems are increasing to safeguard the ecological environment and design healthy urban development it is crucial to assess the structure and quality of ecological networks ens which serve as links between landscape structure and ecological processes this paper simulates land use in 2035 under three development scenarios for the yellow river basin yrb identifying ens and assessing the robustness of network connectivity for each scenario we found that in the ecological protection scenario es forest and water land expanded the most increasing by 4 16 and 6 98 respectively the es also produced the most ecological patches 53 and important ecological corridors 141 with the important corridors forming an east west spatial pattern in the baseline scenario bs important corridors formed a north south pattern and in the urban development scenario us the important corridors were characterised by small scale aggregation the initial connectivity robustness of ens was 0 5 0 46 and 0 45 in the es bs and us respectively whether using deliberate or random attack models the robustness of network connectivity was strongest in the es this study provides a theoretical reference for the future planning of eco friendly development and ecological security patterns in the yrb graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multi scenario simulation ecological networks connectivity robustness the yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a growing population and increasingly sophisticated science and technology have accelerated the dissonance between humanity and nature since the earth entered the anthropocene posing a serious threat to ecological security while also imposing stringent requirements on the achievement of high quality sustainable development cardinale et al 2012 lewis and maslin 2015 to further mitigate environmental challenges like the fragmentation of ecological landscapes and to promote the harmonious development of humans and nature identifying ecological networks ens a networked landscape consisting of ecological patches and ecological corridors and evaluating their quality has become part of the most effective planning method fortin et al 2021 taylor et al 2006 however the resistance of different ens to potential damage depends on the land use type and the specific environment upadhyay et al 2017 identifying ens and evaluating their connectivity robustness based on multiple land use scenarios is beneficial for the improvement of ecosystem structure enhancement of ecosystem services and promotion of human well being montis et al 2019 land is integral to human survival because it supports human activities to promote ecological restoration optimising the land use spatial pattern of a landscape is a vital issue of contemporary research gao and bryan 2017 research on the optimisation of land ecosystem functions has gradually intensified since this century began and many studies simulate the future quantities and spatial distribution patterns of land use by extrapolating from their current situation aburas et al 2019 land use prediction models may be divided into two groups based on their simulation principles one is an approach that anticipates the amounts and structure of land use through multi objective planning which is in principle top down however this method cannot further optimise the land s spatial patterns geneletti 2013 sadeghi et al 2009 the other method combines land demand predictions with the probability of total land suitability the models used in this approach mainly include those based on cellular automata models ca such as the markov model ghosh et al 2021 tajbakhsh et al 2020 the artificial neural network model azari et al 2016 the clue s model saha et al 2021 shrestha et al 2018 and the future land use simulation model flus lin et al 2022 the evaluation of a region s en quality is a prerequisite for decreasing landscape fragmentation enhancing the structural stability of ecosystems and optimising ecological patterns in the region liccari et al 2022 the research system based on the patch resistance surface corridor theory has gradually become the basic research paradigm for identifying ens and optimising ecological security patterns staccione et al 2022 in the early stages scholars used nature reserves and ecological red lines to qualitatively identify ecological patches and after introducing quantitative indicators like ecological sensitivity biodiversity and landscape connectivity ecological patch identification became more accurate nematollahi et al 2022 additionally morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa improved the scientificity of ecological patch selection by considering the connectivity of patch structure ostapowicz et al 2008 a comprehensive resistance surface map that considers the natural environment and anthropogenic characteristics has replaced the direct assignment of resistance values by experts dupras et al 2016 the minimum cumulative resistance model mcr pouzols and moilanen 2014 circuit theory dickson et al 2019 and gravity model wanghe et al 2020 are the key techniques for identifying ecological corridors network analysis windsor et al 2022 graph theory analysis jahanishakib et al 2021 and complex network analysis di mauro et al 2022 are methods for evaluating and optimising en structure among these methods connectivity robustness derived from complex network analysis is one of the key indicators for estimating the stability of networks and can characterise the ability of complex network systems to maintain their original connectivity phillips et al 2015 robustness is mostly used in neural networks traffic networks and engineering naze et al 2021 osman and ishak 2015 for network connectivity robustness analysis nodes and routes are abstracted into points and lines in accordance with the complex network theory s guiding concept while this study s approach to abstracting complex network systems has become increasingly popular the evaluation of connectivity robustness based on ens is not common simulating the connectivity robustness of ens under random attack and deliberate attack modes can allow a flexible response to the ecological risks brought by nature or humans and introducing robustness into en analysis makes the evaluation of network structure stability more comprehensive and realistic and provides theoretical support for ecological restoration in key areas the yellow river basin yrb has an important role in maintaining social stability and ecological security it is a crucial environmental security barrier an economic growth zone and a key location for poverty alleviation in china however due to restricted natural circumstances and weak development basis the yrb has increasingly fallen behind regions in the southeast coastal areas since china s reform and opening up singh et al 2021 wohlfart et al 2016 while breakthroughs have been made in the ecological construction and environmental management of the yrb in recent years feng and zhu 2022 omer et al 2020 due to its fragile ecological base the lack of water resources and soil erosion in the basin are still prominent conflicts albers et al 2021 jia et al 2022 in this context an assessment of the structure and quality of the yrb s ens will aid in improving the science behind the ecological protection strategy of one axis five zones and multiple points as well as promoting rational land use establishing efficient ecological management strategies and urban development plans and achieving ecological protection and high quality development in the yrb the rapid expansion of construction land in the yrb in the context of rapid urbanisation has led to fragmentation of the ecological landscape affecting the stability of the regional ecosystem as well as its biodiversity a practical issue that requires immediate resolution is how to guarantee the structural stability of ens in the context of this rapid land use development so that their ecological functions can be maintained this paper attempts to answer two scientific questions how will the ens of the yrb change under various scenarios of land use and how stable are the yrb s ens scenario simulation and en stability analysis are both important research methods in ecology and land use change scenarios are the spatial manifestation of regional socioeconomic development focusing on the core link between coupled ecological stability of land use is important for understanding the mechanism of ecological change and for quantitative assessment of en stability under land use change scenarios thus the main objectives of this paper were to 1 predict the future land use situation in the yrb under multiple development pattern scenarios using a land use simulation model 2 build ens by identifying ecological patches and ecological corridors under different scenarios and 3 evaluate the connectivity robustness of the ens under the multiple scenarios in the face of different attack patterns 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river is china s second longest river flowing from the northern foot of the bayankala mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau through qinghai gansu and another nine provinces before emptying into the bohai sea in dongying shandong geographically the yrb is bounded by the yinshan mountains in the north the qinling mountains in the south the kunlun mountains in the west and the bohai sea in the east it is at the intersection of three natural areas across the east and west of china the yrb serves as china s most significant ecological security barrier in addition to being one of the northern regions that promote eco friendly construction based on the definition of the administrative area of the yrb by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn and with reference to the study by zuo et al 2022 on the definition of the boundaries of the yrb the 65 prefecture level cities through which the main stem of the yellow river flows were used as the study area fig 1 these have a combined area of 1251 400 km2 roughly 13 of china s total area the study area will have 226 million people by 2020 making up 16 01 of china s total population 2 2 data source the raster data were acquired from the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc and the united states geological survey usgs and the vector data were acquired from the national catalogue service for geographic information ncsgi table 1 3 methods the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 2 which consists of three major steps multi scenario land use simulation see section 3 1 en identification see section 3 2 and network connectivity robustness evaluation see section 3 3 3 1 multi scenario simulation of land use the hpscil cug lab development team created the plus model in 2020 a raster data based land use simulation model that combines a new land expansion analysis strategy with a multi type random patch seed based ca model during the simulation the plus model can simulate the transformation of multiple types of arbitrary land use patches and output the influence weights of various land use drivers liang et al 2021 3 1 1 driving factors the chosen driving factors have a noticeable influence on the simulation of future land use types and selecting appropriate driving factors can improve the simulation s realism to some extent ten indicators slope slope direction precipitation temperature gdp population density distance to the railroad distance to the road distance to the river and distance to the settlement were selected as the simulation s driving factors 3 1 2 restricting factors the plus model can incorporate areas where development is restricted by policy planning or natural conditions such as open water nature reserves etc the data is a binary image containing either 0 or 1 in each pixel with 0 indicating non convertible and 1 indicating convertible combining the actual conditions of the yrb with the document outline of the plan for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin hereinafter referred to as the outline the ecological function areas belonging to nature reserves water areas and one belt five zones and multiple points in the outline s strategic layout of ecological protection are classified as restricted development areas i e limiting factors 3 1 3 forecasting multi scenario land use demand this study establishes three development scenarios based on relevant studies li et al 2018 song et al 2020 taking into consideration the yrb s current natural and social development along with the yrb s spatial planning and environment conservation policies 1 the baseline scenario bs uses the probability of land use shift in the historical period to predict the future land use 2 the ecological protection scenario es adds the constraint factors mentioned in the outline documents to the baseline scenario reducing the likelihood of transferring cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas to construction land by 20 and to unused land by 30 and increasing the likelihood of transferring unused land to cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas by 30 3 the urban development scenario us is based on the yrb s present economic development levels increases the likelihood of transferring cultivated land forest land grassland water areas and unused land to construction land by 20 and decreases the likelihood of transferring construction land to cultivated land forest land grassland water areas and unused land by 30 3 1 4 specific simulation steps 1 extracting historic land expansion data land use data for 1995 and 2015 were entered to obtain extended land use data for 1995 2015 2 analysing land expansion strategy the rfc random forest classification algorithm is used by the plus model to calculate the transformation likelihood for each land class the driving factors and land expansion data for the relevant period serve as the step s input data and the remaining parameters were set through a number of experiments using references from related literature gao et al 2022 3 simulating land use using a ca model based on a multi class stochastic patch seed land use data the development likelihood data for each land use type in the corresponding period and the restricting factors are the input data this step s simulation parameters include land use demand transfer matrix and domain weights the land use demand was calculated as described in section 3 1 3 the transfer matrix values include 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no transfer and 1 indicating conversion and this parameter is set with reference to the land transfer likelihood matrix the domain weights range from 0 to 1 the greater the value the greater the likelihood of a land type changing and the specific value is determined by eq 1 1 w i t a i t a min t a max t a min where wi is the domain weight of type i land tai is the expansion area of type i land tamin is the minimum expansion area of each land type and tamax is the maximum expansion area of each land type 3 1 5 accuracy validation to assess the consistency between simulated and actual land use data the plus model includes kappa and fom accuracy validation coefficients with a kappa 0 8 indicating good consistency and a fom index within 0 01 0 25 indicating plausible results pontius et al 2008 based on two time periods 2000 2010 and 2005 2015 this paper simulates the spatial pattern and quantity of land use in 2010 and 2015 fig 3 the simulation accuracy was verified using real land use data for 2010 and 2015 resulting in a kappa coefficient of 0 974 an overall accuracy of 97 6 and a fom value of 0 067 for the 2010 simulation and a kappa coefficient of 0 977 an overall accuracy of 97 8 and a fom value of 0 083 for 2015 3 2 en identification 3 2 1 ecological patches 1 morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa the mspa approach utilises mathematical morphological principles like erosion expansion open operation and closed operation to determine the spatial pattern of raster images vogt and riitters 2017 for this study two value raster data were generated using forestland grassland and water area as foreground data for the three development scenarios and seven landscape types were generated in multiple scenarios using guidos toolbox 3 0 analysis software core islet perforation edge loop bridge and branch the core consists of larger more complete habitat patches that are critical for maintaining ecosystem integrity using the minimum area threshold method the core patches were extracted as alternative selected ecological patches 1 minimum area threshold selection the number of ecological patches and their minimum area threshold have an inverse relationship that is the greater the threshold the fewer the patches the number of patches and the percentage of the ecological patch s area in the overall area of the region determine the ecological patch s minimum area threshold in this study 1 km2 5 km2 10 km2 and 25 km2 were used as the minimum area threshold units for the screening of the minimum area threshold method and 10 km2 was finally selected as the minimum area threshold unit considering the extensive area of the study region 1 landscape connectivity analysis landscape connectivity measures the continuity between a landscape s spatial structural units and can illustrate how easy or difficult it is for organisms to move between ecological patches in a specified landscape saura and torné 2009 the conefor2 6 landscape connectivity analysis software uses two equations in the landscape connectivity analysis 2 p c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p i j a l 2 3 d p c p c p c r e m o v e p c 100 where pc denotes the probability of connectivity n denotes the total number of patches ai and aj denote the respective areas of patches i and j pij denotes the maximum probability of diffusion between patch i and patch j and al denotes the area of the study area in eq 3 pcremove is the probability of connectivity of the remaining patches after removing a patch and dpc indicates the degree of importance of the patch 3 2 2 ecological resistance the key to accurately characterising ens is a reasonable method for estimating ecological resistance values which quantifies the varying degrees of resistance that organisms or populations face when passing through different landscapes dupras et al 2016 resistance indicators include land use dem slope ndvi distance from the river and distance from the railroad and the resistance value of each indicator is graded using the natural intermittent breakpoint method table 2 the analytical hierarchy process ahp is used to determine the weight of each indicator huang et al 2022b 3 2 3 ecological corridors the minimal cumulative resistance model mcr which determines the minimum cumulative resistance that species must conquer on the ecological resistance surface when travelling from a source to a destination is frequently used in landscape ecology research pouzols and moilanen 2014 the shortest cost path between two patches was calculated using arcgis s cost distance analysis tool and the potential ecological corridors of the yrb were acquired using eq 4 4 mcr f min j n i m d i j r i where mcr denotes the minimum cumulative resistance value for expanding from an ecological patch to a landscape node dij denotes the distance between ecological patch i to landscape j and ri denotes the size of the resistance that patch i is subjected to in the expansion process i e the cumulative resistance cost f denotes the positive correlation between minimum cumulative resistance and ecological or human processes the gravity model was applied to the field of transportation in its early days and was then extended to the field of landscape ecology to characterise the ecological gravitational force between different ecological patches the greater the value of the ecological gravitational force the less resistance to species flow between the two patches wanghe et al 2020 5 g i j n i n j d i j 2 1 p i ln s i 1 p j ln s j l i j l max 2 l max 2 ln s i ln s j l i j 2 p i p j where gij denotes the ecological gravitational force between patches i and j ni and nj are their respective weights dij represents the normalised value of potential corridor resistance between patches i and j pi and pj represent the respective ecological resistance values of patches i and j si and sj reflect the respective areas of patches i and j lij denotes the cumulative resistance of corridors between patches i and j and lmax denotes the maximum cumulative resistance value of all corridors 3 3 network connectivity robustness evaluation 3 3 1 integrated importance of nodes ecological patches and significant ecological corridors are abstracted into concrete points and edges in accordance with complex network theory using pajek network analysis software four measures degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality we are calculated for each node su et al 2019 using these values normalised for each node feature value and weighted by the entropy weight method the integrated importance of each node was calculated using the equation 6 q i α d c i β b c i γ c c i θ e c i where qi is the integrated importance of node i dci bci cci and eci denote the degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality of node i respectively and α β γ and θ represent the corresponding eigenvalue weights 3 3 2 connectivity robustness the network is said to have connectivity robustness under node damage if most of the remaining nodes remain connected after the removal of some nodes qiu et al 2022 the damage scenarios were separated into two categories random attacks and targeted attacks a random attack refers to the random deletion of network nodes whereas a targeted attack refers to the ordered elimination of network nodes based on their integrated importance the connectivity robustness of the network under the two scenarios was calculated using eq 7 7 r c c max n n where rc represents the network connectivity robustness cmax denotes the number of nodes in the network s maximum connectivity subgraph after deleting some nodes n represents the total number of network nodes and n represents the number of deleted nodes 4 results 4 1 multi scenario land use simulation fig 4 depicts the probability matrix of land transfer in the yrb from 1995 to 2015 the primary land changes include a 20 27 conversion to cultivated land from 1995 grassland 25 99 to forest land from grassland 12 12 to grassland from cultivated land 18 02 to water area from cultivated land 53 23 to construction land from cultivated land and 27 03 to unused land from grassland table 3 and fig 5 display the quantities and spatial distributions of land usage in the yrb under the multi scenario simulation under the es scenario the largest areas are cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas with forest land primarily distributed in the sanjiang source qilian mountains region in the southwest and the liupan mountains qinling mountains lvliang mountains region in the south central area and grassland primarily distributed in the yellow river source region in the west and inner mongolia region in the north construction land saw the biggest increase in the us scenario primarily along the yellow river itself and in eastern coastal urban areas unused land was lowest showing a decrease in the es scenario and was mainly distributed in the desert areas such as the muus desert near the yellow river s jiziwan which are located in the northern central area 4 2 en identification 4 2 1 identification of ecological patches fig 6 displays the spatial pattern of mspa patterns under the multi scenarios the three scenarios core areas are primarily located in the study area s southwest with the es scenario s core areas being the most complete the areas greater than 80 km2 are regarded as alternative selected ecological patches because as shown in fig 7 once the core s area approaches 80 km2 the decrease in the number of ecological patches and the drop in the ratio of total patch area to the region s overall area tend to level out after examining the landscape connectivity of the alternative selected ecological patches we discovered that regions with dpc values below 0 2 were smaller had poorer landscape connectivity were closer to cities and were more impacted by human activities as a result alternative ecological patches with dpc values greater than 0 2 were chosen as the final ecological patches under the bs es and us scenarios the number of ecological patches in the study area was 43 53 and 40 representing 22 26 24 03 and 21 53 of the land area respectively fig 8 under the us scenario the ecological patches were concentrated in the southwestern water conserving area mainly in the sanjiang source zoige maqu qilian mountains heihe river and liupan mountains qinling mountains regions and the northern desertification control area mainly in the yinshan mountains otindag daqing mountains and western ordos helan mountains regions in addition to those of the us scenario the ecological patches in the bs scenario included an additional concentration in the eastern ecological function region which includes the taihang mountains and the lvliang mountains regions in addition to those of the bs scenario the ecological patches in the es scenario included concentrations in the soil and water conservation areas in eastern gansu northern shaanxi and northwestern shanxi 4 2 2 construction of the integrated ecological resistance surface fig 9 shows the yrb s ecological resistance surface constructed with land use dem slope ndvi distance from the river and distance from the railroad as resistance factors the distribution of ecological resistance is spatially heterogeneous and the high value regions are primarily found in the northwest in regions with little vegetation including the badain jaran desert tengger desert and mu us desert low value resistance zones are dispersed in places with a lot of ecological patches in the southwest and areas with a lot of forest land and grassland in the south and central east 4 2 3 identification of ecological corridors for the bs es and us scenarios the mcr model identified 902 1364 and 779 potential ecological corridors while the gravity model identified 81 141 and 60 important ecological corridors with 13 312 25 611 and 6364 km of total length respectively fig 10 under the three scenarios the layout of potential corridors were generally dense in the west and south and sparse in the east and north the pattern of important corridors in the multi scenarios has a noticeable difference the important corridors in the es scenario are widely distributed and closely connected connecting the study area s western southern and eastern parts in turn forming an east west spatial distribution pattern the important corridors in the bs scenario are more evenly distributed forming a north south spatial distribution pattern the important corridors in the us scenario are distributed in small scale clusters mainly located in the upper and middle reaches of the main stem of the yellow river and the coastal areas of its tributaries 4 3 network connectivity robustness evaluation 4 3 1 integrated importance evaluation of nodes using cluster analysis the importance of nodes in the ens was classified as high medium or low with the number of high importance nodes in the bs es and us scenarios being 5 13 and 7 the number of medium importance nodes being 23 15 and 8 and the number of low importance nodes being 14 25 and 25 respectively fig 11 high importance nodes in the bs scenario were evenly distributed in the sanjiang source and fenwei plains regions in the es scenario they were concentrated in the fenwei plain qinling mountains and liupan mountains regions and in the us scenario they were primarily distributed in the ningxia plain and qilian mountains regions 4 3 2 connectivity robustness analysis fig 12 depicts the connectivity robustness of the ens in the yrb under multi scenario simulation when subjected to random and deliberate attacks under both attack scenarios as the fraction of attacked nodes increases the connectivity robustness declines in a fluctuating pattern indicating that the fraction of attacked nodes has a direct impact on robustness this result indicates that connectivity robustness may be employed to analyse the stability of the ens the initial network connectivity robustness varied among the scenarios with values of 0 46 0 58 and 0 45 in the bs es and us scenarios respectively showing that the network structure was most stable in the es scenario in the bs scenario the connectivity robustness decreased rapidly from 0 46 to 0 15 as the percentage of deliberately attacked nodes reached 15 while the connectivity robustness appears to be in emergence when the percentage of attacked nodes was between 15 and 70 in the random attack mode the connectivity robustness remained between 0 35 and 0 42 even when the percentage of attacked nodes reached 50 higher percentages of attacked nodes caused the ens to lose their basic connectivity function in the es scenario the connectivity robustness decreased to 0 30 when 20 of nodes were deliberately attacked and fluctuated between 0 20 and 0 45 as the percentage of attacked nodes rose from 20 to 80 the connectivity robustness tended to decrease only slightly when random attacks were performed on nodes with values ranging from 0 20 to 0 60 in the us scenario as the percentage of deliberately attacked nodes reached 10 connectivity robustness dropped quickly to 0 2 whereas emergence occurred in the range of 0 15 0 2 when the percentage of attacked nodes was 10 50 in the random attack mode the overall connectivity robustness fluctuated erratically between 0 25 and 0 45 5 discussion 5 1 optimisation of en patterns with multi method integration in this paper the complex network theory is integrated with the traditional scale pattern process research paradigm of physical geography to provide methodological support for the quantitative study of landscape en identification and optimisation in the yrb based on the current land use situation in the yrb this paper simulated future land use change and constructed ens in addition the future spatial planning factors of the study area were fully considered so that the simulation of future land use change was more in line with the planning and development orientation of the study area the connectivity robustness analysis results for the ens under the different scenarios not only provide data support for formulating targeted regional ecological conservation management strategies in the study area but also provide new ideas for effectively protecting regional biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem stability in any region in addition the construction of the ecological corridors and the quantification of the importance of ecological nodes provide a valuable reference for future ecological restoration work in the study area land use has a direct influence on ecological security patterns so identifying land use trends can help guide ecological security planning in terms of land use change over the yrb s historical period the cultivated land decreased the forest expanded and the construction land rose significantly this is strongly tied to the region s strategy of returning farmland to woods and grasslands and it is consistent with the rapid expansion of development in the yrb over the same era yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the water area has increased slightly indicating that river and lake conservation measures have played a role to some extent in gradually forming an ecological zone along the yellow river with the main stem along with other major rivers and lakes as the backbone effectively safeguarding the water area cao et al 2022 it should be noted that grassland is decreasing while unused land is expanding which is directly connected to the continuation of desertification in some grassland and desert environments in the research area feng and zhu 2022 this result shows that combating desertification is still an ecological issue that needs to be focused on and that water and sand conservation measures need to be implemented in the future this is in line with the development principles upheld in outline of the plan for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin issued by the state council of china unlike the ecological security pattern identified in the yrb in this study the ecological patches and ecological corridors identified by zhang et al 2022 were primarily located in the study area s southern and eastern regions the main reason for this disparity is that zhang et al 2022 used ecological quality indicators such as ecosystem service supply demand and sensitivity as overlays to identify ecological patches whereas this study used landscape pattern analysis to identify ecological patches for the construction of ens from the perspective of landscape spatial structure as a result under the three development scenarios in 2035 ecological patches and ecological corridors are primarily distributed in the study area s woodland rich western and southern regions as well as the grassland rich northern regions in contrast no relatively important ecological patches were identified in the east which may be due to the predicted rapid expansion of construction land in the eastern region by 2035 with rapid urbanization some ecological patches for example taishan in shandong province in the east were fragmented by construction land and failed to form complete and highly connected ecological patches in any scenario robustness analysis is an important method for exploring the extent of network damage de montis et al 2019 in this study we discovered that network connectivity robustness differed significantly under different land use development scenarios and that connectivity robustness was closely related to the specific attacked nodes regardless of whether the attack was random or deliberate therefore we believe that in future development and planning it is advisable to include connectivity robustness as a criterion to judge the priority of areas for development or protection additionally land use development can also be adjusted with reference to the number and location of protected or developed areas in the plan in order to maintain or improve network connectivity under multiple scenarios of development and promote sustainable regional development 5 2 policy implications during the construction of the ecological resistance surface it was discovered that some areas along the yellow river s middle and upper reaches such as the longzhong plateau and the western part of the loess plateau have higher ecological resistance values which makes them important components of the yellow river s ecological zone playing a supporting and regulating role for the basin s overall ecological security thus future development should strengthen the ecological conservation of the river valley regions along the yellow river s middle and upper reaches wohlfart et al 2016 a comparison of the ens for the three scenarios reveals that the es scenario predicted the best spatial pattern of ecological patches and structure of ecological corridors while also most strongly promoting material circulation and biological migration in the east and west of the research region when integrated with the distribution of node importance it is discovered that the ecological status of the southern region has a greater influence on the quality of the ens of the entire yrb under the es scenario so environmental management and protection of this area should be increased during upcoming development to promote the high quality sustainable development of the entire basin chen et al 2022 since it is well known that nodes with a high degree of integrated importance have crucial impacts on the integrity and stability of an entire region s ens there should be more emphasis placed on their protection in real ecological terms de montis et al 2016 the high and middle importance nodes in this study are mainly located in the three river source region in the southwest the qinling mountains in the south the qilian mountains in the west and the yinshan mountains in the north which are all important source areas in any development scenario therefore the ecological protection and restoration of these areas should be a key concern in the future development process furthermore the network connectivity robustness clearly decreased when more than 10 of the nodes were attacked under the bs scenario and the us scenario so the number of developable ecological patches should not exceed 10 of the total number of ecological patches under future conditions resembling either scenario and it is suggested that ecological industries be introduced for appropriate development in the es scenario connectivity robustness began to deteriorate rapidly when the fraction of attacked nodes approached 40 because this proportion is much greater in the es scenario than in the bs and us scenarios development measures that balance ecological construction and industrial progress such as the advancement of ecotourism areas and green parks should be implemented allowing natural areas to fully exercise their cultural service functions while simultaneously protecting the environment 5 3 limitations many factors influence realistic land use change and using only the land transfer probabilities derived from the historical period as the land conversion rule in the baseline scenario may have resulted in some prediction errors however in many cases a more comprehensive and integrated consideration of the land use conversion rule for multiple scenarios is lacking jin et al 2023 to better serve the optimisation of land spatial structure future research should combine the multi objective planning model mop based on statistical models and economic data to achieve the aim of maximum ecological or economic profits sadooghi et al 2022 this study employed mspa minimum area threshold and connectivity analysis to screen ecological patches which is more objective and scientific than the conventional method of using protected areas or forest parks directly as ecological patches however due to spatial resolution and scale effects using 1 km as the base data resolution will result in the identification of larger ecological patches rather than smaller or more dispersed ecological patches affecting the integrity of the entire en xie et al 2022 the ahp method is used to obtain resistance surfaces by the weighted superposition of multiple indicators when creating an ecological resistance surface this method replaces the conventional method based on land use types and lays the groundwork for accurate corridor identification it should nonetheless be noted that the ahp method determines the weights of each resistance factor using qualitative analysis which may be influenced by individual subjective will in this paper we tried to consider the realistic situation and refer to previous studies to determine the weights but a more scientific and reasonable weight determination method should be found in the future to construct a more realistic ecological resistance surface mu et al 2022 furthermore the mcr and gravity models only describe ecological corridors as undirected line segments whereas corridors are actually band like units with specific widths the optimal width of the corridor currently has no consistent standard and the width of the migration corridor varies depending on the species huang et al 2022 on the basis of a more in depth understanding of the biological circumstances and natural environment in the research region the impact of ecological corridor width on ens should be investigated in the future 6 conclusion the plus model landscape ecology theory and complex network theory were used in this study to assess the connectivity robustness of the ens in the yrb under three future 2035 scenarios the bs es and us the study s findings can help to identify the priority ecological protection or economic development areas in the yrb facilitating ecological conservation and high quality development these are the primary conclusions cultivated land and grassland decreased in both the bs and us scenarios while in the es scenario forest land and water increased the most out of all the scenarios and unused land decreased the most additionally construction land increased the most in the us scenario the es scenario predicted the greatest number and area of ecological patches which were mainly distributed in the study area s southwest sanjiang source zoige maqu region west qilian mountains heihe river region south liupan mountains qinling mountains region and north yinshan mountains region furthermore the distribution of important ecological corridors varied greatly between scenarios with important corridors connecting ecological patches forming an east west spatial pattern under the es scenario and a north south spatial pattern under the bs scenario whereas important corridors were distributed in small aggregations scattered in the south and north of the study area under the us scenario the es scenario produced more high importance nodes than the other two scenarios whereas the bs scenario produced a more uniform spatial distribution of high importance nodes the network connectivity robustness was stronger under the random attack mode than under the deliberate attack mode and the connectivity robustness of the three scenarios in the deliberate attack mode showed different degrees of decreasing trends among these the en connectivity robustness exhibited a better buffering function and stronger stability in the es scenario credit authorship

24159,the deterioration of the environment has been aggravated by the rapid growth of cities and economies and inter regional political economic scientific and technological frictions caused by ecological problems are increasing to safeguard the ecological environment and design healthy urban development it is crucial to assess the structure and quality of ecological networks ens which serve as links between landscape structure and ecological processes this paper simulates land use in 2035 under three development scenarios for the yellow river basin yrb identifying ens and assessing the robustness of network connectivity for each scenario we found that in the ecological protection scenario es forest and water land expanded the most increasing by 4 16 and 6 98 respectively the es also produced the most ecological patches 53 and important ecological corridors 141 with the important corridors forming an east west spatial pattern in the baseline scenario bs important corridors formed a north south pattern and in the urban development scenario us the important corridors were characterised by small scale aggregation the initial connectivity robustness of ens was 0 5 0 46 and 0 45 in the es bs and us respectively whether using deliberate or random attack models the robustness of network connectivity was strongest in the es this study provides a theoretical reference for the future planning of eco friendly development and ecological security patterns in the yrb graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords multi scenario simulation ecological networks connectivity robustness the yellow river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction a growing population and increasingly sophisticated science and technology have accelerated the dissonance between humanity and nature since the earth entered the anthropocene posing a serious threat to ecological security while also imposing stringent requirements on the achievement of high quality sustainable development cardinale et al 2012 lewis and maslin 2015 to further mitigate environmental challenges like the fragmentation of ecological landscapes and to promote the harmonious development of humans and nature identifying ecological networks ens a networked landscape consisting of ecological patches and ecological corridors and evaluating their quality has become part of the most effective planning method fortin et al 2021 taylor et al 2006 however the resistance of different ens to potential damage depends on the land use type and the specific environment upadhyay et al 2017 identifying ens and evaluating their connectivity robustness based on multiple land use scenarios is beneficial for the improvement of ecosystem structure enhancement of ecosystem services and promotion of human well being montis et al 2019 land is integral to human survival because it supports human activities to promote ecological restoration optimising the land use spatial pattern of a landscape is a vital issue of contemporary research gao and bryan 2017 research on the optimisation of land ecosystem functions has gradually intensified since this century began and many studies simulate the future quantities and spatial distribution patterns of land use by extrapolating from their current situation aburas et al 2019 land use prediction models may be divided into two groups based on their simulation principles one is an approach that anticipates the amounts and structure of land use through multi objective planning which is in principle top down however this method cannot further optimise the land s spatial patterns geneletti 2013 sadeghi et al 2009 the other method combines land demand predictions with the probability of total land suitability the models used in this approach mainly include those based on cellular automata models ca such as the markov model ghosh et al 2021 tajbakhsh et al 2020 the artificial neural network model azari et al 2016 the clue s model saha et al 2021 shrestha et al 2018 and the future land use simulation model flus lin et al 2022 the evaluation of a region s en quality is a prerequisite for decreasing landscape fragmentation enhancing the structural stability of ecosystems and optimising ecological patterns in the region liccari et al 2022 the research system based on the patch resistance surface corridor theory has gradually become the basic research paradigm for identifying ens and optimising ecological security patterns staccione et al 2022 in the early stages scholars used nature reserves and ecological red lines to qualitatively identify ecological patches and after introducing quantitative indicators like ecological sensitivity biodiversity and landscape connectivity ecological patch identification became more accurate nematollahi et al 2022 additionally morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa improved the scientificity of ecological patch selection by considering the connectivity of patch structure ostapowicz et al 2008 a comprehensive resistance surface map that considers the natural environment and anthropogenic characteristics has replaced the direct assignment of resistance values by experts dupras et al 2016 the minimum cumulative resistance model mcr pouzols and moilanen 2014 circuit theory dickson et al 2019 and gravity model wanghe et al 2020 are the key techniques for identifying ecological corridors network analysis windsor et al 2022 graph theory analysis jahanishakib et al 2021 and complex network analysis di mauro et al 2022 are methods for evaluating and optimising en structure among these methods connectivity robustness derived from complex network analysis is one of the key indicators for estimating the stability of networks and can characterise the ability of complex network systems to maintain their original connectivity phillips et al 2015 robustness is mostly used in neural networks traffic networks and engineering naze et al 2021 osman and ishak 2015 for network connectivity robustness analysis nodes and routes are abstracted into points and lines in accordance with the complex network theory s guiding concept while this study s approach to abstracting complex network systems has become increasingly popular the evaluation of connectivity robustness based on ens is not common simulating the connectivity robustness of ens under random attack and deliberate attack modes can allow a flexible response to the ecological risks brought by nature or humans and introducing robustness into en analysis makes the evaluation of network structure stability more comprehensive and realistic and provides theoretical support for ecological restoration in key areas the yellow river basin yrb has an important role in maintaining social stability and ecological security it is a crucial environmental security barrier an economic growth zone and a key location for poverty alleviation in china however due to restricted natural circumstances and weak development basis the yrb has increasingly fallen behind regions in the southeast coastal areas since china s reform and opening up singh et al 2021 wohlfart et al 2016 while breakthroughs have been made in the ecological construction and environmental management of the yrb in recent years feng and zhu 2022 omer et al 2020 due to its fragile ecological base the lack of water resources and soil erosion in the basin are still prominent conflicts albers et al 2021 jia et al 2022 in this context an assessment of the structure and quality of the yrb s ens will aid in improving the science behind the ecological protection strategy of one axis five zones and multiple points as well as promoting rational land use establishing efficient ecological management strategies and urban development plans and achieving ecological protection and high quality development in the yrb the rapid expansion of construction land in the yrb in the context of rapid urbanisation has led to fragmentation of the ecological landscape affecting the stability of the regional ecosystem as well as its biodiversity a practical issue that requires immediate resolution is how to guarantee the structural stability of ens in the context of this rapid land use development so that their ecological functions can be maintained this paper attempts to answer two scientific questions how will the ens of the yrb change under various scenarios of land use and how stable are the yrb s ens scenario simulation and en stability analysis are both important research methods in ecology and land use change scenarios are the spatial manifestation of regional socioeconomic development focusing on the core link between coupled ecological stability of land use is important for understanding the mechanism of ecological change and for quantitative assessment of en stability under land use change scenarios thus the main objectives of this paper were to 1 predict the future land use situation in the yrb under multiple development pattern scenarios using a land use simulation model 2 build ens by identifying ecological patches and ecological corridors under different scenarios and 3 evaluate the connectivity robustness of the ens under the multiple scenarios in the face of different attack patterns 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yellow river is china s second longest river flowing from the northern foot of the bayankala mountains in the qinghai tibet plateau through qinghai gansu and another nine provinces before emptying into the bohai sea in dongying shandong geographically the yrb is bounded by the yinshan mountains in the north the qinling mountains in the south the kunlun mountains in the west and the bohai sea in the east it is at the intersection of three natural areas across the east and west of china the yrb serves as china s most significant ecological security barrier in addition to being one of the northern regions that promote eco friendly construction based on the definition of the administrative area of the yrb by the yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources http www yrcc gov cn and with reference to the study by zuo et al 2022 on the definition of the boundaries of the yrb the 65 prefecture level cities through which the main stem of the yellow river flows were used as the study area fig 1 these have a combined area of 1251 400 km2 roughly 13 of china s total area the study area will have 226 million people by 2020 making up 16 01 of china s total population 2 2 data source the raster data were acquired from the resource and environment science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences resdc and the united states geological survey usgs and the vector data were acquired from the national catalogue service for geographic information ncsgi table 1 3 methods the flowchart of this study is shown in fig 2 which consists of three major steps multi scenario land use simulation see section 3 1 en identification see section 3 2 and network connectivity robustness evaluation see section 3 3 3 1 multi scenario simulation of land use the hpscil cug lab development team created the plus model in 2020 a raster data based land use simulation model that combines a new land expansion analysis strategy with a multi type random patch seed based ca model during the simulation the plus model can simulate the transformation of multiple types of arbitrary land use patches and output the influence weights of various land use drivers liang et al 2021 3 1 1 driving factors the chosen driving factors have a noticeable influence on the simulation of future land use types and selecting appropriate driving factors can improve the simulation s realism to some extent ten indicators slope slope direction precipitation temperature gdp population density distance to the railroad distance to the road distance to the river and distance to the settlement were selected as the simulation s driving factors 3 1 2 restricting factors the plus model can incorporate areas where development is restricted by policy planning or natural conditions such as open water nature reserves etc the data is a binary image containing either 0 or 1 in each pixel with 0 indicating non convertible and 1 indicating convertible combining the actual conditions of the yrb with the document outline of the plan for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin hereinafter referred to as the outline the ecological function areas belonging to nature reserves water areas and one belt five zones and multiple points in the outline s strategic layout of ecological protection are classified as restricted development areas i e limiting factors 3 1 3 forecasting multi scenario land use demand this study establishes three development scenarios based on relevant studies li et al 2018 song et al 2020 taking into consideration the yrb s current natural and social development along with the yrb s spatial planning and environment conservation policies 1 the baseline scenario bs uses the probability of land use shift in the historical period to predict the future land use 2 the ecological protection scenario es adds the constraint factors mentioned in the outline documents to the baseline scenario reducing the likelihood of transferring cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas to construction land by 20 and to unused land by 30 and increasing the likelihood of transferring unused land to cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas by 30 3 the urban development scenario us is based on the yrb s present economic development levels increases the likelihood of transferring cultivated land forest land grassland water areas and unused land to construction land by 20 and decreases the likelihood of transferring construction land to cultivated land forest land grassland water areas and unused land by 30 3 1 4 specific simulation steps 1 extracting historic land expansion data land use data for 1995 and 2015 were entered to obtain extended land use data for 1995 2015 2 analysing land expansion strategy the rfc random forest classification algorithm is used by the plus model to calculate the transformation likelihood for each land class the driving factors and land expansion data for the relevant period serve as the step s input data and the remaining parameters were set through a number of experiments using references from related literature gao et al 2022 3 simulating land use using a ca model based on a multi class stochastic patch seed land use data the development likelihood data for each land use type in the corresponding period and the restricting factors are the input data this step s simulation parameters include land use demand transfer matrix and domain weights the land use demand was calculated as described in section 3 1 3 the transfer matrix values include 0 and 1 with 0 indicating no transfer and 1 indicating conversion and this parameter is set with reference to the land transfer likelihood matrix the domain weights range from 0 to 1 the greater the value the greater the likelihood of a land type changing and the specific value is determined by eq 1 1 w i t a i t a min t a max t a min where wi is the domain weight of type i land tai is the expansion area of type i land tamin is the minimum expansion area of each land type and tamax is the maximum expansion area of each land type 3 1 5 accuracy validation to assess the consistency between simulated and actual land use data the plus model includes kappa and fom accuracy validation coefficients with a kappa 0 8 indicating good consistency and a fom index within 0 01 0 25 indicating plausible results pontius et al 2008 based on two time periods 2000 2010 and 2005 2015 this paper simulates the spatial pattern and quantity of land use in 2010 and 2015 fig 3 the simulation accuracy was verified using real land use data for 2010 and 2015 resulting in a kappa coefficient of 0 974 an overall accuracy of 97 6 and a fom value of 0 067 for the 2010 simulation and a kappa coefficient of 0 977 an overall accuracy of 97 8 and a fom value of 0 083 for 2015 3 2 en identification 3 2 1 ecological patches 1 morphological spatial pattern analysis mspa the mspa approach utilises mathematical morphological principles like erosion expansion open operation and closed operation to determine the spatial pattern of raster images vogt and riitters 2017 for this study two value raster data were generated using forestland grassland and water area as foreground data for the three development scenarios and seven landscape types were generated in multiple scenarios using guidos toolbox 3 0 analysis software core islet perforation edge loop bridge and branch the core consists of larger more complete habitat patches that are critical for maintaining ecosystem integrity using the minimum area threshold method the core patches were extracted as alternative selected ecological patches 1 minimum area threshold selection the number of ecological patches and their minimum area threshold have an inverse relationship that is the greater the threshold the fewer the patches the number of patches and the percentage of the ecological patch s area in the overall area of the region determine the ecological patch s minimum area threshold in this study 1 km2 5 km2 10 km2 and 25 km2 were used as the minimum area threshold units for the screening of the minimum area threshold method and 10 km2 was finally selected as the minimum area threshold unit considering the extensive area of the study region 1 landscape connectivity analysis landscape connectivity measures the continuity between a landscape s spatial structural units and can illustrate how easy or difficult it is for organisms to move between ecological patches in a specified landscape saura and torné 2009 the conefor2 6 landscape connectivity analysis software uses two equations in the landscape connectivity analysis 2 p c i 1 n j 1 n a i a j p i j a l 2 3 d p c p c p c r e m o v e p c 100 where pc denotes the probability of connectivity n denotes the total number of patches ai and aj denote the respective areas of patches i and j pij denotes the maximum probability of diffusion between patch i and patch j and al denotes the area of the study area in eq 3 pcremove is the probability of connectivity of the remaining patches after removing a patch and dpc indicates the degree of importance of the patch 3 2 2 ecological resistance the key to accurately characterising ens is a reasonable method for estimating ecological resistance values which quantifies the varying degrees of resistance that organisms or populations face when passing through different landscapes dupras et al 2016 resistance indicators include land use dem slope ndvi distance from the river and distance from the railroad and the resistance value of each indicator is graded using the natural intermittent breakpoint method table 2 the analytical hierarchy process ahp is used to determine the weight of each indicator huang et al 2022b 3 2 3 ecological corridors the minimal cumulative resistance model mcr which determines the minimum cumulative resistance that species must conquer on the ecological resistance surface when travelling from a source to a destination is frequently used in landscape ecology research pouzols and moilanen 2014 the shortest cost path between two patches was calculated using arcgis s cost distance analysis tool and the potential ecological corridors of the yrb were acquired using eq 4 4 mcr f min j n i m d i j r i where mcr denotes the minimum cumulative resistance value for expanding from an ecological patch to a landscape node dij denotes the distance between ecological patch i to landscape j and ri denotes the size of the resistance that patch i is subjected to in the expansion process i e the cumulative resistance cost f denotes the positive correlation between minimum cumulative resistance and ecological or human processes the gravity model was applied to the field of transportation in its early days and was then extended to the field of landscape ecology to characterise the ecological gravitational force between different ecological patches the greater the value of the ecological gravitational force the less resistance to species flow between the two patches wanghe et al 2020 5 g i j n i n j d i j 2 1 p i ln s i 1 p j ln s j l i j l max 2 l max 2 ln s i ln s j l i j 2 p i p j where gij denotes the ecological gravitational force between patches i and j ni and nj are their respective weights dij represents the normalised value of potential corridor resistance between patches i and j pi and pj represent the respective ecological resistance values of patches i and j si and sj reflect the respective areas of patches i and j lij denotes the cumulative resistance of corridors between patches i and j and lmax denotes the maximum cumulative resistance value of all corridors 3 3 network connectivity robustness evaluation 3 3 1 integrated importance of nodes ecological patches and significant ecological corridors are abstracted into concrete points and edges in accordance with complex network theory using pajek network analysis software four measures degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality we are calculated for each node su et al 2019 using these values normalised for each node feature value and weighted by the entropy weight method the integrated importance of each node was calculated using the equation 6 q i α d c i β b c i γ c c i θ e c i where qi is the integrated importance of node i dci bci cci and eci denote the degree betweenness closeness and eigenvector centrality of node i respectively and α β γ and θ represent the corresponding eigenvalue weights 3 3 2 connectivity robustness the network is said to have connectivity robustness under node damage if most of the remaining nodes remain connected after the removal of some nodes qiu et al 2022 the damage scenarios were separated into two categories random attacks and targeted attacks a random attack refers to the random deletion of network nodes whereas a targeted attack refers to the ordered elimination of network nodes based on their integrated importance the connectivity robustness of the network under the two scenarios was calculated using eq 7 7 r c c max n n where rc represents the network connectivity robustness cmax denotes the number of nodes in the network s maximum connectivity subgraph after deleting some nodes n represents the total number of network nodes and n represents the number of deleted nodes 4 results 4 1 multi scenario land use simulation fig 4 depicts the probability matrix of land transfer in the yrb from 1995 to 2015 the primary land changes include a 20 27 conversion to cultivated land from 1995 grassland 25 99 to forest land from grassland 12 12 to grassland from cultivated land 18 02 to water area from cultivated land 53 23 to construction land from cultivated land and 27 03 to unused land from grassland table 3 and fig 5 display the quantities and spatial distributions of land usage in the yrb under the multi scenario simulation under the es scenario the largest areas are cultivated land forest land grassland and water areas with forest land primarily distributed in the sanjiang source qilian mountains region in the southwest and the liupan mountains qinling mountains lvliang mountains region in the south central area and grassland primarily distributed in the yellow river source region in the west and inner mongolia region in the north construction land saw the biggest increase in the us scenario primarily along the yellow river itself and in eastern coastal urban areas unused land was lowest showing a decrease in the es scenario and was mainly distributed in the desert areas such as the muus desert near the yellow river s jiziwan which are located in the northern central area 4 2 en identification 4 2 1 identification of ecological patches fig 6 displays the spatial pattern of mspa patterns under the multi scenarios the three scenarios core areas are primarily located in the study area s southwest with the es scenario s core areas being the most complete the areas greater than 80 km2 are regarded as alternative selected ecological patches because as shown in fig 7 once the core s area approaches 80 km2 the decrease in the number of ecological patches and the drop in the ratio of total patch area to the region s overall area tend to level out after examining the landscape connectivity of the alternative selected ecological patches we discovered that regions with dpc values below 0 2 were smaller had poorer landscape connectivity were closer to cities and were more impacted by human activities as a result alternative ecological patches with dpc values greater than 0 2 were chosen as the final ecological patches under the bs es and us scenarios the number of ecological patches in the study area was 43 53 and 40 representing 22 26 24 03 and 21 53 of the land area respectively fig 8 under the us scenario the ecological patches were concentrated in the southwestern water conserving area mainly in the sanjiang source zoige maqu qilian mountains heihe river and liupan mountains qinling mountains regions and the northern desertification control area mainly in the yinshan mountains otindag daqing mountains and western ordos helan mountains regions in addition to those of the us scenario the ecological patches in the bs scenario included an additional concentration in the eastern ecological function region which includes the taihang mountains and the lvliang mountains regions in addition to those of the bs scenario the ecological patches in the es scenario included concentrations in the soil and water conservation areas in eastern gansu northern shaanxi and northwestern shanxi 4 2 2 construction of the integrated ecological resistance surface fig 9 shows the yrb s ecological resistance surface constructed with land use dem slope ndvi distance from the river and distance from the railroad as resistance factors the distribution of ecological resistance is spatially heterogeneous and the high value regions are primarily found in the northwest in regions with little vegetation including the badain jaran desert tengger desert and mu us desert low value resistance zones are dispersed in places with a lot of ecological patches in the southwest and areas with a lot of forest land and grassland in the south and central east 4 2 3 identification of ecological corridors for the bs es and us scenarios the mcr model identified 902 1364 and 779 potential ecological corridors while the gravity model identified 81 141 and 60 important ecological corridors with 13 312 25 611 and 6364 km of total length respectively fig 10 under the three scenarios the layout of potential corridors were generally dense in the west and south and sparse in the east and north the pattern of important corridors in the multi scenarios has a noticeable difference the important corridors in the es scenario are widely distributed and closely connected connecting the study area s western southern and eastern parts in turn forming an east west spatial distribution pattern the important corridors in the bs scenario are more evenly distributed forming a north south spatial distribution pattern the important corridors in the us scenario are distributed in small scale clusters mainly located in the upper and middle reaches of the main stem of the yellow river and the coastal areas of its tributaries 4 3 network connectivity robustness evaluation 4 3 1 integrated importance evaluation of nodes using cluster analysis the importance of nodes in the ens was classified as high medium or low with the number of high importance nodes in the bs es and us scenarios being 5 13 and 7 the number of medium importance nodes being 23 15 and 8 and the number of low importance nodes being 14 25 and 25 respectively fig 11 high importance nodes in the bs scenario were evenly distributed in the sanjiang source and fenwei plains regions in the es scenario they were concentrated in the fenwei plain qinling mountains and liupan mountains regions and in the us scenario they were primarily distributed in the ningxia plain and qilian mountains regions 4 3 2 connectivity robustness analysis fig 12 depicts the connectivity robustness of the ens in the yrb under multi scenario simulation when subjected to random and deliberate attacks under both attack scenarios as the fraction of attacked nodes increases the connectivity robustness declines in a fluctuating pattern indicating that the fraction of attacked nodes has a direct impact on robustness this result indicates that connectivity robustness may be employed to analyse the stability of the ens the initial network connectivity robustness varied among the scenarios with values of 0 46 0 58 and 0 45 in the bs es and us scenarios respectively showing that the network structure was most stable in the es scenario in the bs scenario the connectivity robustness decreased rapidly from 0 46 to 0 15 as the percentage of deliberately attacked nodes reached 15 while the connectivity robustness appears to be in emergence when the percentage of attacked nodes was between 15 and 70 in the random attack mode the connectivity robustness remained between 0 35 and 0 42 even when the percentage of attacked nodes reached 50 higher percentages of attacked nodes caused the ens to lose their basic connectivity function in the es scenario the connectivity robustness decreased to 0 30 when 20 of nodes were deliberately attacked and fluctuated between 0 20 and 0 45 as the percentage of attacked nodes rose from 20 to 80 the connectivity robustness tended to decrease only slightly when random attacks were performed on nodes with values ranging from 0 20 to 0 60 in the us scenario as the percentage of deliberately attacked nodes reached 10 connectivity robustness dropped quickly to 0 2 whereas emergence occurred in the range of 0 15 0 2 when the percentage of attacked nodes was 10 50 in the random attack mode the overall connectivity robustness fluctuated erratically between 0 25 and 0 45 5 discussion 5 1 optimisation of en patterns with multi method integration in this paper the complex network theory is integrated with the traditional scale pattern process research paradigm of physical geography to provide methodological support for the quantitative study of landscape en identification and optimisation in the yrb based on the current land use situation in the yrb this paper simulated future land use change and constructed ens in addition the future spatial planning factors of the study area were fully considered so that the simulation of future land use change was more in line with the planning and development orientation of the study area the connectivity robustness analysis results for the ens under the different scenarios not only provide data support for formulating targeted regional ecological conservation management strategies in the study area but also provide new ideas for effectively protecting regional biodiversity and maintaining ecosystem stability in any region in addition the construction of the ecological corridors and the quantification of the importance of ecological nodes provide a valuable reference for future ecological restoration work in the study area land use has a direct influence on ecological security patterns so identifying land use trends can help guide ecological security planning in terms of land use change over the yrb s historical period the cultivated land decreased the forest expanded and the construction land rose significantly this is strongly tied to the region s strategy of returning farmland to woods and grasslands and it is consistent with the rapid expansion of development in the yrb over the same era yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 furthermore the water area has increased slightly indicating that river and lake conservation measures have played a role to some extent in gradually forming an ecological zone along the yellow river with the main stem along with other major rivers and lakes as the backbone effectively safeguarding the water area cao et al 2022 it should be noted that grassland is decreasing while unused land is expanding which is directly connected to the continuation of desertification in some grassland and desert environments in the research area feng and zhu 2022 this result shows that combating desertification is still an ecological issue that needs to be focused on and that water and sand conservation measures need to be implemented in the future this is in line with the development principles upheld in outline of the plan for ecological protection and high quality development of the yellow river basin issued by the state council of china unlike the ecological security pattern identified in the yrb in this study the ecological patches and ecological corridors identified by zhang et al 2022 were primarily located in the study area s southern and eastern regions the main reason for this disparity is that zhang et al 2022 used ecological quality indicators such as ecosystem service supply demand and sensitivity as overlays to identify ecological patches whereas this study used landscape pattern analysis to identify ecological patches for the construction of ens from the perspective of landscape spatial structure as a result under the three development scenarios in 2035 ecological patches and ecological corridors are primarily distributed in the study area s woodland rich western and southern regions as well as the grassland rich northern regions in contrast no relatively important ecological patches were identified in the east which may be due to the predicted rapid expansion of construction land in the eastern region by 2035 with rapid urbanization some ecological patches for example taishan in shandong province in the east were fragmented by construction land and failed to form complete and highly connected ecological patches in any scenario robustness analysis is an important method for exploring the extent of network damage de montis et al 2019 in this study we discovered that network connectivity robustness differed significantly under different land use development scenarios and that connectivity robustness was closely related to the specific attacked nodes regardless of whether the attack was random or deliberate therefore we believe that in future development and planning it is advisable to include connectivity robustness as a criterion to judge the priority of areas for development or protection additionally land use development can also be adjusted with reference to the number and location of protected or developed areas in the plan in order to maintain or improve network connectivity under multiple scenarios of development and promote sustainable regional development 5 2 policy implications during the construction of the ecological resistance surface it was discovered that some areas along the yellow river s middle and upper reaches such as the longzhong plateau and the western part of the loess plateau have higher ecological resistance values which makes them important components of the yellow river s ecological zone playing a supporting and regulating role for the basin s overall ecological security thus future development should strengthen the ecological conservation of the river valley regions along the yellow river s middle and upper reaches wohlfart et al 2016 a comparison of the ens for the three scenarios reveals that the es scenario predicted the best spatial pattern of ecological patches and structure of ecological corridors while also most strongly promoting material circulation and biological migration in the east and west of the research region when integrated with the distribution of node importance it is discovered that the ecological status of the southern region has a greater influence on the quality of the ens of the entire yrb under the es scenario so environmental management and protection of this area should be increased during upcoming development to promote the high quality sustainable development of the entire basin chen et al 2022 since it is well known that nodes with a high degree of integrated importance have crucial impacts on the integrity and stability of an entire region s ens there should be more emphasis placed on their protection in real ecological terms de montis et al 2016 the high and middle importance nodes in this study are mainly located in the three river source region in the southwest the qinling mountains in the south the qilian mountains in the west and the yinshan mountains in the north which are all important source areas in any development scenario therefore the ecological protection and restoration of these areas should be a key concern in the future development process furthermore the network connectivity robustness clearly decreased when more than 10 of the nodes were attacked under the bs scenario and the us scenario so the number of developable ecological patches should not exceed 10 of the total number of ecological patches under future conditions resembling either scenario and it is suggested that ecological industries be introduced for appropriate development in the es scenario connectivity robustness began to deteriorate rapidly when the fraction of attacked nodes approached 40 because this proportion is much greater in the es scenario than in the bs and us scenarios development measures that balance ecological construction and industrial progress such as the advancement of ecotourism areas and green parks should be implemented allowing natural areas to fully exercise their cultural service functions while simultaneously protecting the environment 5 3 limitations many factors influence realistic land use change and using only the land transfer probabilities derived from the historical period as the land conversion rule in the baseline scenario may have resulted in some prediction errors however in many cases a more comprehensive and integrated consideration of the land use conversion rule for multiple scenarios is lacking jin et al 2023 to better serve the optimisation of land spatial structure future research should combine the multi objective planning model mop based on statistical models and economic data to achieve the aim of maximum ecological or economic profits sadooghi et al 2022 this study employed mspa minimum area threshold and connectivity analysis to screen ecological patches which is more objective and scientific than the conventional method of using protected areas or forest parks directly as ecological patches however due to spatial resolution and scale effects using 1 km as the base data resolution will result in the identification of larger ecological patches rather than smaller or more dispersed ecological patches affecting the integrity of the entire en xie et al 2022 the ahp method is used to obtain resistance surfaces by the weighted superposition of multiple indicators when creating an ecological resistance surface this method replaces the conventional method based on land use types and lays the groundwork for accurate corridor identification it should nonetheless be noted that the ahp method determines the weights of each resistance factor using qualitative analysis which may be influenced by individual subjective will in this paper we tried to consider the realistic situation and refer to previous studies to determine the weights but a more scientific and reasonable weight determination method should be found in the future to construct a more realistic ecological resistance surface mu et al 2022 furthermore the mcr and gravity models only describe ecological corridors as undirected line segments whereas corridors are actually band like units with specific widths the optimal width of the corridor currently has no consistent standard and the width of the migration corridor varies depending on the species huang et al 2022 on the basis of a more in depth understanding of the biological circumstances and natural environment in the research region the impact of ecological corridor width on ens should be investigated in the future 6 conclusion the plus model landscape ecology theory and complex network theory were used in this study to assess the connectivity robustness of the ens in the yrb under three future 2035 scenarios the bs es and us the study s findings can help to identify the priority ecological protection or economic development areas in the yrb facilitating ecological conservation and high quality development these are the primary conclusions cultivated land and grassland decreased in both the bs and us scenarios while in the es scenario forest land and water increased the most out of all the scenarios and unused land decreased the most additionally construction land increased the most in the us scenario the es scenario predicted the greatest number and area of ecological patches which were mainly distributed in the study area s southwest sanjiang source zoige maqu region west qilian mountains heihe river region south liupan mountains qinling mountains region and north yinshan mountains region furthermore the distribution of important ecological corridors varied greatly between scenarios with important corridors connecting ecological patches forming an east west spatial pattern under the es scenario and a north south spatial pattern under the bs scenario whereas important corridors were distributed in small aggregations scattered in the south and north of the study area under the us scenario the es scenario produced more high importance nodes than the other two scenarios whereas the bs scenario produced a more uniform spatial distribution of high importance nodes the network connectivity robustness was stronger under the random attack mode than under the deliberate attack mode and the connectivity robustness of the three scenarios in the deliberate attack mode showed different degrees of decreasing trends among these the en connectivity robustness exhibited a better buffering function and stronger stability in the es scenario credit authorship
