20170,a detailed experimental investigation on the mapping of the lsb formation over a turbine blade with different airfoils and their vibration effects were considered first in this study wind tunnel experiments were performed on fx 84 w 150 sd7062 clark y and wasp airfoils at re 3 5 104 re 7 104 and various angles of attack experimental arrangements consisted of detailed instantaneous and time dependent flow visualizations quasi wall shear stress measurements by means of a hot film sensor aerodynamic force measurements with an external force balance system it was observed that there was a strong correlation between voltage signals obtained from the hot film sensor and the smoke wire results fluctuation amplitude started to increase within the lsb especially at the aft portion due to the transition induced trapped roll up vortices then fluctuations peaked upstream of the reattachment point it was observed that the airfoil with different thickness and camber caused the lsb either short or long to form resulting in variation of aerodynamic forces with the time this could trigger the stochastic vibrations such as flap wise and edge wise vibrations at the blade causing the stochastic fatigue loads and limiting the lifespan of turbine blades graphical abstract image 1 keywords marine wind turbine blades boundary layer separation laminar separation bubble flow induced vibrations cyclic loads fatigue 1 introduction recently both developed and developing countries have been faced in conjunction with an issue named as energy demand that growing for energy demand is mainly because of air pollution fossil fuel reduction an increase in people s situational awareness etc thus all governments focus on their attention the renewable energy resources of these energy resources wind energy has great popularity due to its historical background but critical lack of information especially in terms of technical cases puts a barrier in some fields of wind energy applications even though it has a reputation it can be said that aerodynamically understanding of flow characteristics formed over blades which is the most important part of marine current offshore wind turbines might be between these technical cases for instance the influence of transition to turbulence and laminar separation bubble lsb on the performance of turbines is not fully understood which acquires more attention investigations in this field are in priority because these flow phenomena directly affect the aerodynamic performance of turbines and their structural design thus it is essential to accurately understand and solve the unsteady flow structures in the lsb in the past few decades numerical simulation and wide range experimental investigations have been performed by aerodynamic researchers for the detailed investigations of the lsb in conjunction with the results indicating that flow characteristics and progress of lsb have been primarily dependent on many factors such as the turbulence intensity wang et al 2014 herbst et al 2018 li and yang 2019 reynolds number koca et al 2018 genç et al 2012 angle of attack of blade elsakka et al 2019 karasu et al 2013 pressure distribution sayed et al 2012 aspect ratio genç et al 2018 alom and saha 2019 maeda et al 2017 and surface roughness genç et al 2019 correct estimation of formation of transition and lsb over airfoils has a critical role in aerodynamic design when the criteria mentioned above are taken into consideration because lsb is frequently formed at low reynolds number regimes rec 5 105 because of laminar flow separation with adverse pressure gradient apg followed by transition phenomenon in the separated shear layer and mean flow reattachment downstream unsteady flow structures inside lsb and instability due to the presence of transition have a notable impact on turbine blade performance resulting in increasing the drag coefficient nowadays the onset of transition and lsb formation can be found numerically baltazar et al 2020 mary and sagaut 2002 and experimentally wei et al 2015 previous experimental studies investigated the lsb by means of different techniques such as surface pressure measurement traub and cooper 2008 particle image velocimetry piv wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 infrared ir thermographic technique ricci and montelpare 2005 hot film gauges koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 gomes et al 2015 surface visualization açıkel and genç 2018 lsb on the flat plate was comprehensively investigated by a pioneering study conducted by gaster 1967 at a wide range reynolds number and pressure distribution his results showed that the length of lsb abruptly increased with exceeding certain critical values of the apg or reynolds number naming as the bubble bursting ol et al 2005 performed standard piv to assign the reynolds shear stress and the mean flow structures of lsb over the surface of sd7003 airfoil by means of three various flow facilities hain et al 2009 also performed a study to define the dominant frequencies of transition phenomena and the flapping of bubble formed over sd7003 at a reynolds number of 6 6 104 their results of time resolved particle image velocimetry tr piv indicated that kelvin helmholtz instabilities caused the amplification of vortices formed in the shear layer and these instabilities exhibited a weak coherence in the spanwise direction lengani et al 2014 conducted piv measurement to investigate the unsteady flow field developing along the flow separation region of lsb over a thick flat plate at re 7 105 and then they post processed their data via proper orthogonal decomposition pod their results pointed out that the shedding frequency was not formed because of the most energetic pod mode conversely these modes defined larger velocity fluctuations in the shear layer region upstream of lsb maximum displacement tahani et al 2017 investigated the effects of the geometrical parameters on the performance of turbine blades under the case of 1 and 8 turbulence intensities by using blade element momentum bem theory their results revealed that the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake increased when turbulence intensity increased result in causing of the wake recovery to be faster moreover the flow separation was postponed thanks to the optimized geometry a numerical study was performed to investigate the effect of five blade thickness to chord ratios t c 9 12 15 18 and 21 on dynamic stall for an h type darrieus wind rotor by jain and saha 2020 numerical results showed that the formation of dynamic stall vortex is preceded by lsb casing the swifter leading edge type stall in the case of thinner airfoils t c 9 12 lsb distributed over the suction surface of airfoil at case of t c 15 this caused the mixed type stall to occur for the case of thicker airfoils t c 18 21 the trailing edge type stall phenomenon formed over the surface of airfoil in addition to the studies mentioned above stall phenomenon progress of lsb on the turbine blades could also vary to stem from the reynolds number turbulence and tip speed ratio rezaeiha et al 2018 the coupling among fluid and structure and its influence such as flow induced vibration plays a crucial role in the aerodynamic performance of air vehicles so that lift enhancement generally depends upon the amplitude and frequency of flow induced vibrations furthermore considerable aerodynamic fatigue loads on turbine blades may stem from these vibrations resulting in an enormous effect on the out of plane damage equivalent bending moment liu et al 2017a performed computational fluid dynamics cfd method to understand the dynamic stall characteristics and influence of blade vibration of an airfoil under both transitional and pitching motions they concluded from their study that the transitional motion could cause the dynamic stall of the airfoil and the aerodynamic fatigue loads could emerge with the presence of blade vibration the effects of cyclic loads especially on the role of blade section of misalignment and rotor for horizontal axis wind turbines hawt were investigated by otero and ponta 2018 their results foresaw that the cyclic loads would be dominant factor in terms of future design of larger turbines additionally the shaft torque was less insensitive to cyclic load than wind turbine blades this experimental based investigation is intended to further study the formation and progress of the lsb by examining the physical mechanism at low reynolds number in our previous study koca et al 2018 the leading edge vortex formation due to the lsb and the trailing edge vortex formation was investigated both on the suction surface and at the wake region in detail but there were few lacks as follows i there was no time dependent results in terms of both forming of the lsb and leading edge vortex formation ii spectrogram graphs allowing the researchers to take detailed information of dominant time dependent spectral results were not presented about the novelty of the paper four different airfoils which were rarely being existed even unavailable such as fx 84 w 150 wasp airfoils in the literature were chosen to examine the formation and flow induced vibration effects of the time dependent formation of the lsb and transition phenomena according to the format of the real wind turbine blades the cyclic loads are the dominant factor in terms of the future design of larger turbines additionally the shaft torque was less insensitive to cyclic load than turbine blades thus this paper describes the unsteady characterization of the lsbs developing over different real wind turbine blade profiles in this respect the current data of this study will be a roadmap for aerodynamic and structural aeroelastic researches moreover the explaining of the dominant time dependent spectral results with spectrograms was also unavailable in the literature even though the shedding process was performed with fft fast fourier transform in a lot of past studies istvan et al 2018 hodson and howell 2000 dellacasagrande et al 2020 this will allow the researchers to see and understand unsteady flow characteristics from a different perspective the conclusion of this paper will ensure guidance for a study with regards to flow control as future works for this purpose different turbine airfoils were selected to examine the formation and flow induced vibration effects of lsb and transition phenomena over airfoils at low reynolds numbers and various angles of attack then their results compared with each other regarding the novelty of this study a detailed experimental investigation on the mapping of the lsb formation over a turbine blade and their vibration effects were considered first time dependent formation of the lsb phenomenon over the turbine airfoils and effects of them on flow induced vibration were presented using the spectrogram graphs the main structure of this research was shown as seen in fig 1 in section 1 a comprehensive literature search and their evaluation were performed in section 2 various airfoils selection and their manufacturing process as well as an explanation of the experimental apparatus were reported in section 3 detailed results and effects of the lsb and the transition phenomenon formed over surfaces of selected turbine airfoils were presented finally concluding remarks of this research were noticed in section 4 2 description of experimental layouts 2 1 wind tunnel a suction type low speed wind tunnel was utilized for experiments at erciyes university wind engineering and aerodynamic laboratory the tunnel has a square test section dimensions of 500 mm 500 mm covering in conjunction with a transparent plexiglass wall for observation of flow phenomena the tunnel can be run at a maximum speed of 40 m s turbulence intensity equals 0 3 genç et al 2012 while it is at a minimum speed of 3 m s turbulence intensity equals to 0 75 during experiments the pitot tube was utilized to measure velocity in the test chamber and it was constantly controlled by a manometer located outside the test chamber 2 2 samples of selected different airfoils fx 84 w 150 sd7062 clark y and wasp wing profiles which are among the low reynolds number airfoil family were chosen for experimental samples these profiles are the airfoils used in marine current offshore wind turbine blades and a cambered was preferred at the root section and a thin airfoil at the tip section fig 2 they are modeled via solidworks and then fabricated via a rapid prototyping technique namely 3d printer for having smother surface was obtained their surfaces were rubbed with sandpaper two plexiglass plates at each tip of the airfoil were utilized so that flow over the suction surfaces was protected from tip vortices although it was known that the tip vortex was dominant at the tip of the turbine blade because this study aimed to map the low reynolds number flow phenomenon over the blade the chord length of airfoils was 200 mm whereas the span was 300 mm the blockage ratio is defined as follows 1 b frontal area of the object cross section of the wind tunnel test section the blockage ratio of the selected airfoils was calculated at lowest and highest angle of attack in the wind tunnel as seen in table 1 the correction of blockage ratio did not affect the results negatively since the results could be negligible when the blockage ratio was less than 10 genç et al 2012 schreck et al 2007 chen and liou 2011 2 3 flow visualization method with smoke wire since aerodynamic force measurement results allow limited explanation regarding the flow phenomena such as the lsb or boundary layer flow separation over the surface of selected airfoils the flow was visualized using a smoke wire method the technical equipment includes a thin copper wire with a thickness of 0 3 mm a resistive heating device for heating the wire and burning the oil droplet oil halogens for seeing flow sheets and a digital camera for filming flows fig 3 demonstrated how the smoke wire technique was configured in the test chamber of the wind tunnel the thin copper wire was vertically positioned at 1 5c in front of the airfoil and z c 0 4 oil drops were manually dribbled over the wire it waited for a while because oil drops were homogeneously dispersed on the copper wire to burn the homogeneous oil and obtain smoke sheets resistive heating was conducted at the level of 3 ma smoke sheets were then illustrated via halogens tests were performed two times for a better quality image a compact camera in front of the test chamber was run to capture smoke sheets videos after the test captured smoke sheets were divided into 1000 frames in terms of post processing hereby time dependent smoke wire results were obtained for two reynolds numbers and different angles of attack 2 4 measurement of aerodynamic forces to find out aerodynamic forces of selected airfoils the force measurement experiment was fulfilled at re 3 5 104 velocity 4 m s re 7 104 velocity 8 m s and different angles of attacks the average chord length of real turbine blades starts from 5 cm and go up to 3 m depending on the power of the turbine reynolds number is around 2 5 104 at the cut in speed of 3 m s wind speed for a small scale wind turbine with a nominal power of 1 kw this reynolds number is approximately 1 2 105 at rated speed 12 m s therefore the studied wind speeds and reynolds numbers 4 m s and 8 m s re 3 5 104 and 7 104 are in the same range with the real turbines as depicted in fig 4 fd and fl were measured employing two strain gauges one of them was used for drag force and another for lift force before the test the calibration process was performed for experiment accuracy after the experiment fl and fd aerodynamic forces were post processed by converting the drag cd and the lift cl coefficients with the following equations 2 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 s 3 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 s 2 5 hot film sensor tests boundary layer growth flow separation and formation of lsb could be explored utilizing the hot film sensors but the calibration process of these gauges is sophisticated since heat transfer amount over the surface of the sensor might be altered due to the undesirable issues such as flow characteristics dust particles model material etc koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 therefore the calibration procedure in this study was not able to perform instead of calibrated values voltage variances were taken into consideration to observe the presence of transition and lsb as seen in fig 5 a hot film gauge glue on type with the code number of 55r47 was used over suction surfaces of selected airfoils between x c 0 1 and x c 0 8 the gauge s size was 8 0 mm 1 6 mm having rectangular shape whereas its sensor s size was 0 1 mm 0 9 mm a double sided tape that did not ruin the flow characteristics was utilized to mount the gauges over the suction surface to record the data along the chordwise of airfoils a multichannel constant temperature anemometer cta was used and all contacts between hot film sensors and cta were conducted with the bnc cables 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization results from the smoke wire experiment visualization results extracted from smoke wire experiment for re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 were shown at different airfoils in figs 6 9 respectively instead of the results carried out at the whole angle of attack the angles which had specific results such as moderate the pre stall the stall and the post stall conditions were pointed out for fx 84 w 150 airfoil which was thicker and more camber airfoil the flow separated from the suction surface around at x c 0 48 because of the apg and reattached to surface at x c 0 79 at re 3 5 104 and α 4 resulting in the formation of the short lsb at the pre stall case α 14 the bubble was changed its formation by turning into the long bubble with an increasing angle of attack moreover the vortex shedding induced by the lsb with anti clockwise motion was pronouncedly observed and then they interacted with the vortices having clockwise motion induced by trailing edge in the wake of the airfoil at the stall angle α 16 the long bubble did not cope with the pressure gradients and the bubble bursting occurred over the suction surface causing the sharp decrease at the aerodynamic performance of airfoil and the increasing of flow induced vibrations it will be pointed out at part of force measurement results in detail when the angle of attack increased the separation point moved to the leading edge as pointed out the study performed by winslow et al 2018 resulting in a fully separated flow because of stronger apg for re 7 104 the same flow trend occurred at whole angles of attack but the lsb at α 4 was smaller than the previous case because inertial force increased when reynolds number increased additionally boundary layer flow separation occurred nearly the leading edge of the airfoil for the stall and the post stall cases at re 3 5 104 whereas it formed at the middle part of the airfoil for the same cases indicating that increasing reynolds number started to overcome the negative effects of apg furthermore the relatively narrower wake formed for two reynolds number cases when the angle of attack was less than the pre stall condition meaning that less drag force was obtained açıkel and genç 2018 according to the result of sd7062 airfoil as seen in fig 7 the same flow phenomena trends occurred over the suction surface for instance the short lsb was observed at re 3 5 104 re 7 104 α 4 and its size was then changed when the angle of attack increased to α 14 in contrast to the flow trend observed over fx 84 w 150 leading edge separation formed for the stall and the post stall conditions resulting in a more broadened wake region and inherently having the presence of more drag force on the other hand the stall triad over suction surfaces of clark y and wasp airfoils emerged with the different angles of attack at re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively that is the pre stall the stall and the post stall cases for re 3 5 104 occurred at α 14 α 16 α 18 respectively whereas they were observed at α 16 α 18 α 20 when reynolds number increased to re 7 104 the observed effect was similar to that reported by karasu et al 2020 utilizing thinner and less camber airfoil caused less sharp pressure variation and weaker apg over the suction surface of the mentioned airfoils resulting in that the stall triad delayed according to the results of the smoke wire experiment fig 10 showed the positions of the laminar boundary layer separations and reattachment points over the selected airfoils as mentioned in the previous studies koca et al 2018 genç et al 2016 the region between the separation and the reattachment points corresponding to the position of the lsb moreover the region between the separation and the reattachment points were associated with the solid lines to create shaded area so that it was intended to show the domain of the lsb over solid surfaces for fx 84 w 150 airfoil the laminar flow separated at x c 0 48 and reattached x c 0 79 resulting in the formation of the lsb at the trailing edge of the airfoil at re 3 5 104 it was seen that it progressively moved towards the leading edge with changing of the angle of attack for α 14 at which boundary layer reattachment did not occur for re 7 104 at the same airfoil the lsb formed at trailing edge again but its size was smaller because of higher inertial forces the same motion trend was then exhibited when the angle of attack increased by moving to the leading edge for sd7062 airfoil the separation point occurred at x c 0 39 whilst reattachment was observed at x c 0 7 resulting in presence of the short bubble forming nearly at the trailing edge at re 3 5 104 moreover the lsb kept its effect until α 10 and the flow could not reattach to surface at α 12 and after at re 7 104 of sd7062 the lsb was firstly observed between x c 0 61 and x c 0 9 at α 0 for α 2 at which longer lsb formed over the suction surface it was speculated that apg opposed to laminar flow earlier because of unstable flow conditions after α 2 the extent of the lsb gradually decreased when the angle of attack raised for clark y as a thinner airfoil it was observed that the lsb formed at the points between x c 0 52 and x c 0 84 for re 3 5 104 similar to thicker airfoils the size of lsb decreased with the raising of the angle of attack and it kept its presence up to α 14 with the increasing reynolds number to re 7 104 inherently dominant inertial forces lsb size decreased especially at 0 α 6 and it moved towards the leading edge consisted of experiments over other airfoil performed in advance at low reynolds number koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 by comparison with clark y and wasp airfoils the lsb formed over wasp airfoil was smaller at re 3 5 104 and α 0 it was most probably that utilizing thinner and less camber of airfoil caused the apg to exhibit less dominant role on incoming flow ensuring the occurrence of laminar boundary layer separation towards the trailing edge similar trends observed with other airfoils increasing the angle of the attack caused the size of the lsb to diminish and its location moved to the leading edge as well briefly these graphs represented two distinctly flow phenomena on the selected airfoils as follows i lsb characteristics ii boundary layer separation without reattachment 3 2 map of the lsb over the turbine blade the general topology of the lsb was discussed in this part as seen in fig 11 before the voltage variance obtained from the results of the hot film sensor as mentioned before the laminar boundary layer is prone to separate as apg plays a dominant role and u y is equal to zero in the separation point before the complete transition phenomenon the separation can considerably spread to a larger distance for the outer region of the lsb the laminar boundary layer causes the entrainment to be low at the fore of the lsb and the entrainment rate gradually starts to increase due to the transition further downstream the transition completes and the flow reaches sufficient energized level to reattach the boundary layer higher entrainment rate and larger reynolds stress are observed due to the turbulent diffusion at the end of the forepart of the outer region for the inside region of the lsb the flow at the forepart extends a larger region and its motion is trapped slow moving therefore this region is named the dead flow region and this region causes the pressure distribution curves to be constant because of zero pressure gradients genç et al 2012 2019 further downstream it is observed that the weak recirculation at the aft of the lsb and this causes the abrupt decrease at the pressure distribution curves u y is less than zero in this region after this region the turbulent reattachment is observed due to the energized flow following these expressions the results of the voltage variance obtained from hot film sensors will be compared with the smoke wire experiment in the following part a comparison of voltage variance results and smoke wire experiment for fx 84 w 150 airfoil was shown at re 3 5 104 and α 4 in fig 12 the flow was laminar at x c 0 1 and x c 0 2 since the fluctuations in these two points were lower resulting in that velocity profile was higher than zero u d y 0 starting of increased fluctuation at x c 0 48 indicated that the apg started to affect to the laminar flow but the laminar flow was still dominant as seen the hot film results it was observed that fluctuations decreased pronouncedly showing that the region close to x c 0 5 was separation point u d y 0 the first appearance of fluctuations picks at x c 0 6 revealed that the transition onset was observed and the apg played a dominant role in the flow the region between x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 was in the dead air region causing the zero pressure distribution to form the inherently constant trend at the pressure distribution curve moreover the turbulent reattachment formed around x c 0 79 regarding the comparison results for sd7062 airfoil at re 3 5 104 α 8 it was given in fig 13 similar to fx 84 w 150 airfoil reynolds number was the same while the angle of attack was increased from 4 to 8 according to the smoke wire result the flow separated at x c 0 3 and the turbulent reattachment occurred nearly at x c 0 61 it was seen that the lsb extended larger area even though reynolds number was not changed this explanation was twofold i sd7062 airfoil was thinner than fx 84 w 150 and utilizing a thinner airfoil caused the apg to change enormously resulting in the appearance of larger lsb ii increasing the angle of attack supplied the lsb to move towards further upstream fig 14 illustrated the comparison results for clark y airfoil which was thinner than fx 84 w 150 and sd7062 airfoils at re 7 104 and α 12 in contrast to the first two airfoils both reynolds number and angle of attack were increased for this airfoil from the explanation of voltage variance results the flow was laminar at x c 0 1 the small undulation at x c 0 2 revealed that the flow separated at this point because of the increase of the effect of the apg specifically the primary growth of breakdown and disturbance caused the fluctuation at x c 0 3 to present the peak and plateau these most probably indicated that the onset of the transition occurred at this point the points of x c 0 2 and x c 0 3 corresponded with the fore portion of the lsb as seen smoke wire results for x c 0 4 at which larger fluctuations because of shear layer roll up vortices formed causing the weak circulation and the dominant apg at the aft of the lsb this led the velocity profile to be less than zero as physically explaining amplification of unstable breakdown and disturbances caused shear layer roll up vortices to be formed in the aft part of the lsb as indicated in fig 11 shear layer roll up vortices simplified the entrainment of higher momentum flow from the outer part towards the near wall region concluding the turbulent reattachment at x c 0 57 the lsb completed its formation by occurring the turbulent reattachment to the solid surface after a while the flow passed to a fully turbulent region for wasp airfoil its results of voltage variance and smoke wire experiments were compared with each other as seen in fig 15 unlike the first three cases a short lsb formed at the leading edge of the airfoil because of the higher angle of attack additionally especially at x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 the lsb induced vortex shedding played a dominant role fig 15b from the voltage variance results two dominant plateaus as shown in red circle formed at x c 0 5 whereas three dominant plateaus as shown in a blue circle were observed at x c 0 6 similar to experimental and numerical investigations reported by koca et al 2018 and ducoin et al 2016 respectively these plateaus indicated that the lsb induced vortex shedding caused the peak fluctuation to form especially and specifically at x c 0 6 three dominant plateaus formed at the voltage variance result but their amplitude clearly and gradually decreased this was due to that the lsb induced vortices moved to further downstream along the vortex trajectory the sizes of vortices at the fore of trajectory were smaller but their frequencies were higher then these smaller vortices were larger when they moved towards the aft part of the trajectory as seen in fig 15b energies of bigger vortices at the aft part of the trajectory were less than those formed at forepart this led to bigger vortices to have less frequency resulting in the appearance of gradually decreasing fluctuations furthermore the dense fluctuations at x c 0 7 and x c 0 8 illustrated that the turbulent reattachment and fully turbulent phenomena occurred over the suction surface 3 3 flow induced vibrations over the turbine blade time dependent aerodynamic forces and their mean values were tabulated as given in fig 16 at re 3 5 104 for fx 84 w 150 airfoil instantaneous smoke wire results were also added at the graph to be supported and visualized regarding flow phenomena as seen in the smoke wire results the instantaneous images showing the short bubble at α 4 and bubble burst at α 16 revealed that the boundary layer phenomenon the lsb characteristics changed as mentioned in fig 10 and it moved towards further upstream when fx 84 w 150 airfoil angle of attack increased between 4 and 6 the long bubble formed the short bubble was observed at α 6 α 10 and the trailing edge separation appeared at α 10 α 12 and when the angle of attack was increased to α 12 the bubble bursting occurred and fully separated flow was shown these flow events affected the aerodynamic force results and the linearity of the force curves changed at the high reynolds number aerodynamics the sensitivity to the angle of attack of the order of 2π presents and based on the sensitivity to the angle of attack of the order of 2π an airfoil has a linear curve of cl however at low reynolds numbers real lift coefficients are lower than the theoretical ones due to the viscous effects and the transition the lsb and bursting at low reynolds flows flow phenomena cause the aerodynamic performance to decrease with the angle of attack increasing the lsb expands which produces the stall early and abruptly after the bubble burst time dependent force measurement results ensured which flow induced vibrations over the suction surface for example the fluctuations of time dependent force measurements for all airfoils at re 3 5 104 and α 12 were given in fig 17 specifically the undulations indicated that the lsb characteristics over the airfoil surface caused the cl and the cd to have a wavy curve for fx 84 w 150 airfoil the fluctuation in the cd curve was higher because of the long bubble while the cl curve undulation was lower fig 18 which caused flow induced vibrations at the edge wise direction to form as the airfoil camber was thinner the bubble converted to the short bubble fig 18 and also the fluctuation characteristics changed finally for wasp thin airfoil whereas the cd curve fluctuation was lower the one in the cl curve was higher which indicated that the flow induced vibrations at the flap wise direction would be effective in fig 19 instantaneous voltage variations versus the time second obtained from the hot film measurements at the location of the middle of the lsb for all airfoils were showed and the jumps in the instantaneous hot film results for fx 84 w150 airfoil pointed out the bubble bursting after long bubble formation which caused periodically flow induced vibrations to occur moreover for wasp airfoil higher hot film voltage undulations due to the flow were observed in fig 20d like higher fluctuations obtained from the force results in fig 18d consequently it was concluded in this study that the short bubble caused the more flow induced vibrations than the long bubble to form because the vortex formation due to the short bubble carried out near the leading edge of the airfoil as seen in fig 16b and the vortices moved towards the trailing edge by hitting the airfoil surface causing of having more vibration the vortices due to the long bubble occurred near the trailing edge of airfoil and the amount of the stroke of the vortices decreased to airfoil surface this affected less in terms of the blade vibration regarding the obtaining of more detailed information about flow induced vibrations like performed in the study of ducoin et al 2012 the force signal fluctuations were post processed in conjunction with using of a spectrogram a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time allowing to researchers to analyze possible dominant characteristics spectrum of frequencies in this respect spectrogram graphs indicating the time dependent spectral analysis results were seen in fig 20 these graphs belonged to force measurement results of fx 84 w 150 airfoil at re 3 5 104 and different angles of attack the red colors at the graphs pointed out the dominant frequencies for α 4 distribution of the dominant frequencies was continuous during 10 s at 350 hz while it was locally seen especially at 30 hz 140 hz and 200 hz the local appearance of some dominant frequencies at the graph meant that the frequency distribution changed over time this variation also indicated both change of aerodynamic forces and flow induced vibrations over time in this study the effects of the lsb and vortex formation due to the bubbles were mentioned in the previous section these aerodynamic flow phenomena were clearly illustrated thanks to the spectrogram graphs over time furthermore the distribution of the dominant frequencies red colors weakened with the increasing of the angle of attack meaning that the dominant effects of the flow on the aerodynamic forces decreased the changes at the aerodynamic forces with time caused the formation of stochastic vibrations these stochastic vibrations turned into stochastic fatigue loads of blades and affected blade life as a result of the experimental analysis presented in this study separations occurred in the cambered profiles in the blade root region due to long bubble and bubble bursting these separations caused the changes in the drag force over time which caused edge wise vibrations over the airfoil as seen in fig 21 edge wise vibrations triggered the blade to be forced backwards moreover it was seen that the short bubble formed at the tip section of blade with thinner airfoils the oscillations in the lift forces stem from the presence of the short bubble resulting in flap wise vibrations and the blade was forced upwards fig 21 additionally it was observed that flow induced vibrations on the blade changed regionally as different airfoils were used in the turbine blade hereby the aerodynamic vibrations edge wise and flap wise could be formed these aerodynamic vibrations caused the cyclic loads they could play crucial and determinant role in terms of design of up scaled turbines in the future causing the border of lifespan because of fatigue loads of structural and mechanical components 4 conclusion the present study focused on flow phenomena such as boundary layer transition and separation progress and formation of the lsb and stochastic flow vibrations over marine current offshore wind turbine blade by employing experimental investigations at re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 flow phenomena were assessed utilizing the smoke wire experiment to visualize the flow phenomena quasi shear layer measurement in the boundary layer via hot film sensor and time dependent aerodynamic force measurement the main conclusions can be summarized as follows detailed smoke wire experiment results showed that the lsb moved upstream diminished in the length for whole selected airfoils when the angle of attack increased supporting the earlier results reported by lambert and yarusevych 2019 moreover it was observed that the pre stall the stall and the post stall angles of attack did not change for fx 84 w 150 and sd7062 airfoils which were thicker and more camber when reynolds number increased from 3 5 104 to 7 104 but an increase of 2 at the stall triad of thinner and fewer camber airfoils including clark y and wasp with increasing of reynolds number it was speculated that utilizing thinner and less camber airfoil caused the effect of apg to be less forming more stable lsb this more stable characterization inside of the bubble hindered to the bubble burst resulting in the stall delay additionally narrower wake regions at lower angles of the attack became larger when the angle of attack increased agreeing with the findings presented by liu et al 2017b this caused the drag forces to be higher and the cd curve to increase gradually an extensive comparison of quasi shear layer measurement via hot film sensors and smoke wire experiments were employed from this comparison it was concluded that the fluctuation of raw signal data obtained from the hot film sensor was less for whole selected airfoils when the flow was laminar especially at further upstream the fluctuations started to increase especially at the fore and aft portion of the lsb it was executed that the fluctuation amplitude became dominant especially at the aft portion of the lsb due to the trapped rolling up vortices akhlaghi et al 2020 thanks to these structures which originated from the amplification of unstable breakdown and disturbances due to the transition the entrainment of higher momentum flow from the outer part towards near wall region were facilitated resulting in turbulent reattachment apart from the first thicker and more camber airfoils vortex shedding characteristics were also revealed for wasp airfoil at re 7 104 and α 16 further upstream at which the short bubble formed and this caused vortex sheds to be emerged rolling along the vortex trajectory these results exhibited well coherence in conjunction with the smoke wire results it was noticed that the short lsb induced these structures notably caused the fluctuation curves to have a dominant peak and plateau especially at x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 specifically for x c 0 6 case gradually decreased trends of dominant plateaus at the hot film signals confirmed that the last vortex shedding was weaker than ensuing vortex shedding comparing force and smoke wire results it can be observed that mean and time dependent aerodynamic force coefficients results reflect remarkably well trends with the trends obtained from smoke wire results it was illustrated that the cl curve increased with the raising of the angle of attack at α 18 the mild stall occurred at the cl curve due to the appearance of the bubble bursting additionally the time dependent force measurement results confirmed the presence of the lsb over the airfoil surface it was speculated that trapped rolling up vortices at aft portion on the lsb affected the cl curve trend for fx 84 w150 airfoil the fluctuation in the cd curve was higher because of the long bubble while the cl curve undulation was lower which caused flow induced vibrations at the edge wise direction to form as the airfoil camber was thinner the bubble converted to the short bubble and the cl curve fluctuation was higher which indicated that the flow induced vibrations at the flap wise direction would be effective moreover the short bubble caused the more flow induced vibrations than the long bubble to form because the vortex formation due to the short bubble carried out near the leading edge of the airfoil and the vortices moved towards the trailing edge by hitting the airfoil surface causing of having more vibration arcondoulis et al 2009 the dominant frequency obtained from spectrogram graphs indicating the time dependent spectral analysis results revealed that aerodynamic forces and flow induced vibrations changed with the presence of the lsb in addition the distribution of dominant frequency declined when the angle of attack increased flow induced vibrations on the blade changed regionally as different airfoils were used in the turbine blade as a result of low reynolds number flow phenomena the aerodynamic vibrations edge wise and flap wise could occur these aerodynamic vibrations caused the cyclic loads they could play crucial and determinant role in terms of design of up scaled turbines in the future causing the border of lifespan because of fatigue loads of structural and mechanical components as a consequence this experimental study will be future work for the aerodynamic researchers who interested in aiming at modifying the lsb with the active or passive genç et al 2020a 2020b 2020b durhasan 2020 karasu 2020 özden et al 2020 control implementations and increasing the aerodynamic performance of lifting surfaces such as turbine blades thereby laminar boundary layer separation and the formation of the lsb as seen as the main impediment to wind airfoil performance will be diminished by utilizing control techniques credit authorship

20170,a detailed experimental investigation on the mapping of the lsb formation over a turbine blade with different airfoils and their vibration effects were considered first in this study wind tunnel experiments were performed on fx 84 w 150 sd7062 clark y and wasp airfoils at re 3 5 104 re 7 104 and various angles of attack experimental arrangements consisted of detailed instantaneous and time dependent flow visualizations quasi wall shear stress measurements by means of a hot film sensor aerodynamic force measurements with an external force balance system it was observed that there was a strong correlation between voltage signals obtained from the hot film sensor and the smoke wire results fluctuation amplitude started to increase within the lsb especially at the aft portion due to the transition induced trapped roll up vortices then fluctuations peaked upstream of the reattachment point it was observed that the airfoil with different thickness and camber caused the lsb either short or long to form resulting in variation of aerodynamic forces with the time this could trigger the stochastic vibrations such as flap wise and edge wise vibrations at the blade causing the stochastic fatigue loads and limiting the lifespan of turbine blades graphical abstract image 1 keywords marine wind turbine blades boundary layer separation laminar separation bubble flow induced vibrations cyclic loads fatigue 1 introduction recently both developed and developing countries have been faced in conjunction with an issue named as energy demand that growing for energy demand is mainly because of air pollution fossil fuel reduction an increase in people s situational awareness etc thus all governments focus on their attention the renewable energy resources of these energy resources wind energy has great popularity due to its historical background but critical lack of information especially in terms of technical cases puts a barrier in some fields of wind energy applications even though it has a reputation it can be said that aerodynamically understanding of flow characteristics formed over blades which is the most important part of marine current offshore wind turbines might be between these technical cases for instance the influence of transition to turbulence and laminar separation bubble lsb on the performance of turbines is not fully understood which acquires more attention investigations in this field are in priority because these flow phenomena directly affect the aerodynamic performance of turbines and their structural design thus it is essential to accurately understand and solve the unsteady flow structures in the lsb in the past few decades numerical simulation and wide range experimental investigations have been performed by aerodynamic researchers for the detailed investigations of the lsb in conjunction with the results indicating that flow characteristics and progress of lsb have been primarily dependent on many factors such as the turbulence intensity wang et al 2014 herbst et al 2018 li and yang 2019 reynolds number koca et al 2018 genç et al 2012 angle of attack of blade elsakka et al 2019 karasu et al 2013 pressure distribution sayed et al 2012 aspect ratio genç et al 2018 alom and saha 2019 maeda et al 2017 and surface roughness genç et al 2019 correct estimation of formation of transition and lsb over airfoils has a critical role in aerodynamic design when the criteria mentioned above are taken into consideration because lsb is frequently formed at low reynolds number regimes rec 5 105 because of laminar flow separation with adverse pressure gradient apg followed by transition phenomenon in the separated shear layer and mean flow reattachment downstream unsteady flow structures inside lsb and instability due to the presence of transition have a notable impact on turbine blade performance resulting in increasing the drag coefficient nowadays the onset of transition and lsb formation can be found numerically baltazar et al 2020 mary and sagaut 2002 and experimentally wei et al 2015 previous experimental studies investigated the lsb by means of different techniques such as surface pressure measurement traub and cooper 2008 particle image velocimetry piv wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 infrared ir thermographic technique ricci and montelpare 2005 hot film gauges koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 gomes et al 2015 surface visualization açıkel and genç 2018 lsb on the flat plate was comprehensively investigated by a pioneering study conducted by gaster 1967 at a wide range reynolds number and pressure distribution his results showed that the length of lsb abruptly increased with exceeding certain critical values of the apg or reynolds number naming as the bubble bursting ol et al 2005 performed standard piv to assign the reynolds shear stress and the mean flow structures of lsb over the surface of sd7003 airfoil by means of three various flow facilities hain et al 2009 also performed a study to define the dominant frequencies of transition phenomena and the flapping of bubble formed over sd7003 at a reynolds number of 6 6 104 their results of time resolved particle image velocimetry tr piv indicated that kelvin helmholtz instabilities caused the amplification of vortices formed in the shear layer and these instabilities exhibited a weak coherence in the spanwise direction lengani et al 2014 conducted piv measurement to investigate the unsteady flow field developing along the flow separation region of lsb over a thick flat plate at re 7 105 and then they post processed their data via proper orthogonal decomposition pod their results pointed out that the shedding frequency was not formed because of the most energetic pod mode conversely these modes defined larger velocity fluctuations in the shear layer region upstream of lsb maximum displacement tahani et al 2017 investigated the effects of the geometrical parameters on the performance of turbine blades under the case of 1 and 8 turbulence intensities by using blade element momentum bem theory their results revealed that the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake increased when turbulence intensity increased result in causing of the wake recovery to be faster moreover the flow separation was postponed thanks to the optimized geometry a numerical study was performed to investigate the effect of five blade thickness to chord ratios t c 9 12 15 18 and 21 on dynamic stall for an h type darrieus wind rotor by jain and saha 2020 numerical results showed that the formation of dynamic stall vortex is preceded by lsb casing the swifter leading edge type stall in the case of thinner airfoils t c 9 12 lsb distributed over the suction surface of airfoil at case of t c 15 this caused the mixed type stall to occur for the case of thicker airfoils t c 18 21 the trailing edge type stall phenomenon formed over the surface of airfoil in addition to the studies mentioned above stall phenomenon progress of lsb on the turbine blades could also vary to stem from the reynolds number turbulence and tip speed ratio rezaeiha et al 2018 the coupling among fluid and structure and its influence such as flow induced vibration plays a crucial role in the aerodynamic performance of air vehicles so that lift enhancement generally depends upon the amplitude and frequency of flow induced vibrations furthermore considerable aerodynamic fatigue loads on turbine blades may stem from these vibrations resulting in an enormous effect on the out of plane damage equivalent bending moment liu et al 2017a performed computational fluid dynamics cfd method to understand the dynamic stall characteristics and influence of blade vibration of an airfoil under both transitional and pitching motions they concluded from their study that the transitional motion could cause the dynamic stall of the airfoil and the aerodynamic fatigue loads could emerge with the presence of blade vibration the effects of cyclic loads especially on the role of blade section of misalignment and rotor for horizontal axis wind turbines hawt were investigated by otero and ponta 2018 their results foresaw that the cyclic loads would be dominant factor in terms of future design of larger turbines additionally the shaft torque was less insensitive to cyclic load than wind turbine blades this experimental based investigation is intended to further study the formation and progress of the lsb by examining the physical mechanism at low reynolds number in our previous study koca et al 2018 the leading edge vortex formation due to the lsb and the trailing edge vortex formation was investigated both on the suction surface and at the wake region in detail but there were few lacks as follows i there was no time dependent results in terms of both forming of the lsb and leading edge vortex formation ii spectrogram graphs allowing the researchers to take detailed information of dominant time dependent spectral results were not presented about the novelty of the paper four different airfoils which were rarely being existed even unavailable such as fx 84 w 150 wasp airfoils in the literature were chosen to examine the formation and flow induced vibration effects of the time dependent formation of the lsb and transition phenomena according to the format of the real wind turbine blades the cyclic loads are the dominant factor in terms of the future design of larger turbines additionally the shaft torque was less insensitive to cyclic load than turbine blades thus this paper describes the unsteady characterization of the lsbs developing over different real wind turbine blade profiles in this respect the current data of this study will be a roadmap for aerodynamic and structural aeroelastic researches moreover the explaining of the dominant time dependent spectral results with spectrograms was also unavailable in the literature even though the shedding process was performed with fft fast fourier transform in a lot of past studies istvan et al 2018 hodson and howell 2000 dellacasagrande et al 2020 this will allow the researchers to see and understand unsteady flow characteristics from a different perspective the conclusion of this paper will ensure guidance for a study with regards to flow control as future works for this purpose different turbine airfoils were selected to examine the formation and flow induced vibration effects of lsb and transition phenomena over airfoils at low reynolds numbers and various angles of attack then their results compared with each other regarding the novelty of this study a detailed experimental investigation on the mapping of the lsb formation over a turbine blade and their vibration effects were considered first time dependent formation of the lsb phenomenon over the turbine airfoils and effects of them on flow induced vibration were presented using the spectrogram graphs the main structure of this research was shown as seen in fig 1 in section 1 a comprehensive literature search and their evaluation were performed in section 2 various airfoils selection and their manufacturing process as well as an explanation of the experimental apparatus were reported in section 3 detailed results and effects of the lsb and the transition phenomenon formed over surfaces of selected turbine airfoils were presented finally concluding remarks of this research were noticed in section 4 2 description of experimental layouts 2 1 wind tunnel a suction type low speed wind tunnel was utilized for experiments at erciyes university wind engineering and aerodynamic laboratory the tunnel has a square test section dimensions of 500 mm 500 mm covering in conjunction with a transparent plexiglass wall for observation of flow phenomena the tunnel can be run at a maximum speed of 40 m s turbulence intensity equals 0 3 genç et al 2012 while it is at a minimum speed of 3 m s turbulence intensity equals to 0 75 during experiments the pitot tube was utilized to measure velocity in the test chamber and it was constantly controlled by a manometer located outside the test chamber 2 2 samples of selected different airfoils fx 84 w 150 sd7062 clark y and wasp wing profiles which are among the low reynolds number airfoil family were chosen for experimental samples these profiles are the airfoils used in marine current offshore wind turbine blades and a cambered was preferred at the root section and a thin airfoil at the tip section fig 2 they are modeled via solidworks and then fabricated via a rapid prototyping technique namely 3d printer for having smother surface was obtained their surfaces were rubbed with sandpaper two plexiglass plates at each tip of the airfoil were utilized so that flow over the suction surfaces was protected from tip vortices although it was known that the tip vortex was dominant at the tip of the turbine blade because this study aimed to map the low reynolds number flow phenomenon over the blade the chord length of airfoils was 200 mm whereas the span was 300 mm the blockage ratio is defined as follows 1 b frontal area of the object cross section of the wind tunnel test section the blockage ratio of the selected airfoils was calculated at lowest and highest angle of attack in the wind tunnel as seen in table 1 the correction of blockage ratio did not affect the results negatively since the results could be negligible when the blockage ratio was less than 10 genç et al 2012 schreck et al 2007 chen and liou 2011 2 3 flow visualization method with smoke wire since aerodynamic force measurement results allow limited explanation regarding the flow phenomena such as the lsb or boundary layer flow separation over the surface of selected airfoils the flow was visualized using a smoke wire method the technical equipment includes a thin copper wire with a thickness of 0 3 mm a resistive heating device for heating the wire and burning the oil droplet oil halogens for seeing flow sheets and a digital camera for filming flows fig 3 demonstrated how the smoke wire technique was configured in the test chamber of the wind tunnel the thin copper wire was vertically positioned at 1 5c in front of the airfoil and z c 0 4 oil drops were manually dribbled over the wire it waited for a while because oil drops were homogeneously dispersed on the copper wire to burn the homogeneous oil and obtain smoke sheets resistive heating was conducted at the level of 3 ma smoke sheets were then illustrated via halogens tests were performed two times for a better quality image a compact camera in front of the test chamber was run to capture smoke sheets videos after the test captured smoke sheets were divided into 1000 frames in terms of post processing hereby time dependent smoke wire results were obtained for two reynolds numbers and different angles of attack 2 4 measurement of aerodynamic forces to find out aerodynamic forces of selected airfoils the force measurement experiment was fulfilled at re 3 5 104 velocity 4 m s re 7 104 velocity 8 m s and different angles of attacks the average chord length of real turbine blades starts from 5 cm and go up to 3 m depending on the power of the turbine reynolds number is around 2 5 104 at the cut in speed of 3 m s wind speed for a small scale wind turbine with a nominal power of 1 kw this reynolds number is approximately 1 2 105 at rated speed 12 m s therefore the studied wind speeds and reynolds numbers 4 m s and 8 m s re 3 5 104 and 7 104 are in the same range with the real turbines as depicted in fig 4 fd and fl were measured employing two strain gauges one of them was used for drag force and another for lift force before the test the calibration process was performed for experiment accuracy after the experiment fl and fd aerodynamic forces were post processed by converting the drag cd and the lift cl coefficients with the following equations 2 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 s 3 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 s 2 5 hot film sensor tests boundary layer growth flow separation and formation of lsb could be explored utilizing the hot film sensors but the calibration process of these gauges is sophisticated since heat transfer amount over the surface of the sensor might be altered due to the undesirable issues such as flow characteristics dust particles model material etc koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 therefore the calibration procedure in this study was not able to perform instead of calibrated values voltage variances were taken into consideration to observe the presence of transition and lsb as seen in fig 5 a hot film gauge glue on type with the code number of 55r47 was used over suction surfaces of selected airfoils between x c 0 1 and x c 0 8 the gauge s size was 8 0 mm 1 6 mm having rectangular shape whereas its sensor s size was 0 1 mm 0 9 mm a double sided tape that did not ruin the flow characteristics was utilized to mount the gauges over the suction surface to record the data along the chordwise of airfoils a multichannel constant temperature anemometer cta was used and all contacts between hot film sensors and cta were conducted with the bnc cables 3 results and discussion 3 1 visualization results from the smoke wire experiment visualization results extracted from smoke wire experiment for re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 were shown at different airfoils in figs 6 9 respectively instead of the results carried out at the whole angle of attack the angles which had specific results such as moderate the pre stall the stall and the post stall conditions were pointed out for fx 84 w 150 airfoil which was thicker and more camber airfoil the flow separated from the suction surface around at x c 0 48 because of the apg and reattached to surface at x c 0 79 at re 3 5 104 and α 4 resulting in the formation of the short lsb at the pre stall case α 14 the bubble was changed its formation by turning into the long bubble with an increasing angle of attack moreover the vortex shedding induced by the lsb with anti clockwise motion was pronouncedly observed and then they interacted with the vortices having clockwise motion induced by trailing edge in the wake of the airfoil at the stall angle α 16 the long bubble did not cope with the pressure gradients and the bubble bursting occurred over the suction surface causing the sharp decrease at the aerodynamic performance of airfoil and the increasing of flow induced vibrations it will be pointed out at part of force measurement results in detail when the angle of attack increased the separation point moved to the leading edge as pointed out the study performed by winslow et al 2018 resulting in a fully separated flow because of stronger apg for re 7 104 the same flow trend occurred at whole angles of attack but the lsb at α 4 was smaller than the previous case because inertial force increased when reynolds number increased additionally boundary layer flow separation occurred nearly the leading edge of the airfoil for the stall and the post stall cases at re 3 5 104 whereas it formed at the middle part of the airfoil for the same cases indicating that increasing reynolds number started to overcome the negative effects of apg furthermore the relatively narrower wake formed for two reynolds number cases when the angle of attack was less than the pre stall condition meaning that less drag force was obtained açıkel and genç 2018 according to the result of sd7062 airfoil as seen in fig 7 the same flow phenomena trends occurred over the suction surface for instance the short lsb was observed at re 3 5 104 re 7 104 α 4 and its size was then changed when the angle of attack increased to α 14 in contrast to the flow trend observed over fx 84 w 150 leading edge separation formed for the stall and the post stall conditions resulting in a more broadened wake region and inherently having the presence of more drag force on the other hand the stall triad over suction surfaces of clark y and wasp airfoils emerged with the different angles of attack at re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 as illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively that is the pre stall the stall and the post stall cases for re 3 5 104 occurred at α 14 α 16 α 18 respectively whereas they were observed at α 16 α 18 α 20 when reynolds number increased to re 7 104 the observed effect was similar to that reported by karasu et al 2020 utilizing thinner and less camber airfoil caused less sharp pressure variation and weaker apg over the suction surface of the mentioned airfoils resulting in that the stall triad delayed according to the results of the smoke wire experiment fig 10 showed the positions of the laminar boundary layer separations and reattachment points over the selected airfoils as mentioned in the previous studies koca et al 2018 genç et al 2016 the region between the separation and the reattachment points corresponding to the position of the lsb moreover the region between the separation and the reattachment points were associated with the solid lines to create shaded area so that it was intended to show the domain of the lsb over solid surfaces for fx 84 w 150 airfoil the laminar flow separated at x c 0 48 and reattached x c 0 79 resulting in the formation of the lsb at the trailing edge of the airfoil at re 3 5 104 it was seen that it progressively moved towards the leading edge with changing of the angle of attack for α 14 at which boundary layer reattachment did not occur for re 7 104 at the same airfoil the lsb formed at trailing edge again but its size was smaller because of higher inertial forces the same motion trend was then exhibited when the angle of attack increased by moving to the leading edge for sd7062 airfoil the separation point occurred at x c 0 39 whilst reattachment was observed at x c 0 7 resulting in presence of the short bubble forming nearly at the trailing edge at re 3 5 104 moreover the lsb kept its effect until α 10 and the flow could not reattach to surface at α 12 and after at re 7 104 of sd7062 the lsb was firstly observed between x c 0 61 and x c 0 9 at α 0 for α 2 at which longer lsb formed over the suction surface it was speculated that apg opposed to laminar flow earlier because of unstable flow conditions after α 2 the extent of the lsb gradually decreased when the angle of attack raised for clark y as a thinner airfoil it was observed that the lsb formed at the points between x c 0 52 and x c 0 84 for re 3 5 104 similar to thicker airfoils the size of lsb decreased with the raising of the angle of attack and it kept its presence up to α 14 with the increasing reynolds number to re 7 104 inherently dominant inertial forces lsb size decreased especially at 0 α 6 and it moved towards the leading edge consisted of experiments over other airfoil performed in advance at low reynolds number koca et al 2018 genç et al 2019 by comparison with clark y and wasp airfoils the lsb formed over wasp airfoil was smaller at re 3 5 104 and α 0 it was most probably that utilizing thinner and less camber of airfoil caused the apg to exhibit less dominant role on incoming flow ensuring the occurrence of laminar boundary layer separation towards the trailing edge similar trends observed with other airfoils increasing the angle of the attack caused the size of the lsb to diminish and its location moved to the leading edge as well briefly these graphs represented two distinctly flow phenomena on the selected airfoils as follows i lsb characteristics ii boundary layer separation without reattachment 3 2 map of the lsb over the turbine blade the general topology of the lsb was discussed in this part as seen in fig 11 before the voltage variance obtained from the results of the hot film sensor as mentioned before the laminar boundary layer is prone to separate as apg plays a dominant role and u y is equal to zero in the separation point before the complete transition phenomenon the separation can considerably spread to a larger distance for the outer region of the lsb the laminar boundary layer causes the entrainment to be low at the fore of the lsb and the entrainment rate gradually starts to increase due to the transition further downstream the transition completes and the flow reaches sufficient energized level to reattach the boundary layer higher entrainment rate and larger reynolds stress are observed due to the turbulent diffusion at the end of the forepart of the outer region for the inside region of the lsb the flow at the forepart extends a larger region and its motion is trapped slow moving therefore this region is named the dead flow region and this region causes the pressure distribution curves to be constant because of zero pressure gradients genç et al 2012 2019 further downstream it is observed that the weak recirculation at the aft of the lsb and this causes the abrupt decrease at the pressure distribution curves u y is less than zero in this region after this region the turbulent reattachment is observed due to the energized flow following these expressions the results of the voltage variance obtained from hot film sensors will be compared with the smoke wire experiment in the following part a comparison of voltage variance results and smoke wire experiment for fx 84 w 150 airfoil was shown at re 3 5 104 and α 4 in fig 12 the flow was laminar at x c 0 1 and x c 0 2 since the fluctuations in these two points were lower resulting in that velocity profile was higher than zero u d y 0 starting of increased fluctuation at x c 0 48 indicated that the apg started to affect to the laminar flow but the laminar flow was still dominant as seen the hot film results it was observed that fluctuations decreased pronouncedly showing that the region close to x c 0 5 was separation point u d y 0 the first appearance of fluctuations picks at x c 0 6 revealed that the transition onset was observed and the apg played a dominant role in the flow the region between x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 was in the dead air region causing the zero pressure distribution to form the inherently constant trend at the pressure distribution curve moreover the turbulent reattachment formed around x c 0 79 regarding the comparison results for sd7062 airfoil at re 3 5 104 α 8 it was given in fig 13 similar to fx 84 w 150 airfoil reynolds number was the same while the angle of attack was increased from 4 to 8 according to the smoke wire result the flow separated at x c 0 3 and the turbulent reattachment occurred nearly at x c 0 61 it was seen that the lsb extended larger area even though reynolds number was not changed this explanation was twofold i sd7062 airfoil was thinner than fx 84 w 150 and utilizing a thinner airfoil caused the apg to change enormously resulting in the appearance of larger lsb ii increasing the angle of attack supplied the lsb to move towards further upstream fig 14 illustrated the comparison results for clark y airfoil which was thinner than fx 84 w 150 and sd7062 airfoils at re 7 104 and α 12 in contrast to the first two airfoils both reynolds number and angle of attack were increased for this airfoil from the explanation of voltage variance results the flow was laminar at x c 0 1 the small undulation at x c 0 2 revealed that the flow separated at this point because of the increase of the effect of the apg specifically the primary growth of breakdown and disturbance caused the fluctuation at x c 0 3 to present the peak and plateau these most probably indicated that the onset of the transition occurred at this point the points of x c 0 2 and x c 0 3 corresponded with the fore portion of the lsb as seen smoke wire results for x c 0 4 at which larger fluctuations because of shear layer roll up vortices formed causing the weak circulation and the dominant apg at the aft of the lsb this led the velocity profile to be less than zero as physically explaining amplification of unstable breakdown and disturbances caused shear layer roll up vortices to be formed in the aft part of the lsb as indicated in fig 11 shear layer roll up vortices simplified the entrainment of higher momentum flow from the outer part towards the near wall region concluding the turbulent reattachment at x c 0 57 the lsb completed its formation by occurring the turbulent reattachment to the solid surface after a while the flow passed to a fully turbulent region for wasp airfoil its results of voltage variance and smoke wire experiments were compared with each other as seen in fig 15 unlike the first three cases a short lsb formed at the leading edge of the airfoil because of the higher angle of attack additionally especially at x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 the lsb induced vortex shedding played a dominant role fig 15b from the voltage variance results two dominant plateaus as shown in red circle formed at x c 0 5 whereas three dominant plateaus as shown in a blue circle were observed at x c 0 6 similar to experimental and numerical investigations reported by koca et al 2018 and ducoin et al 2016 respectively these plateaus indicated that the lsb induced vortex shedding caused the peak fluctuation to form especially and specifically at x c 0 6 three dominant plateaus formed at the voltage variance result but their amplitude clearly and gradually decreased this was due to that the lsb induced vortices moved to further downstream along the vortex trajectory the sizes of vortices at the fore of trajectory were smaller but their frequencies were higher then these smaller vortices were larger when they moved towards the aft part of the trajectory as seen in fig 15b energies of bigger vortices at the aft part of the trajectory were less than those formed at forepart this led to bigger vortices to have less frequency resulting in the appearance of gradually decreasing fluctuations furthermore the dense fluctuations at x c 0 7 and x c 0 8 illustrated that the turbulent reattachment and fully turbulent phenomena occurred over the suction surface 3 3 flow induced vibrations over the turbine blade time dependent aerodynamic forces and their mean values were tabulated as given in fig 16 at re 3 5 104 for fx 84 w 150 airfoil instantaneous smoke wire results were also added at the graph to be supported and visualized regarding flow phenomena as seen in the smoke wire results the instantaneous images showing the short bubble at α 4 and bubble burst at α 16 revealed that the boundary layer phenomenon the lsb characteristics changed as mentioned in fig 10 and it moved towards further upstream when fx 84 w 150 airfoil angle of attack increased between 4 and 6 the long bubble formed the short bubble was observed at α 6 α 10 and the trailing edge separation appeared at α 10 α 12 and when the angle of attack was increased to α 12 the bubble bursting occurred and fully separated flow was shown these flow events affected the aerodynamic force results and the linearity of the force curves changed at the high reynolds number aerodynamics the sensitivity to the angle of attack of the order of 2π presents and based on the sensitivity to the angle of attack of the order of 2π an airfoil has a linear curve of cl however at low reynolds numbers real lift coefficients are lower than the theoretical ones due to the viscous effects and the transition the lsb and bursting at low reynolds flows flow phenomena cause the aerodynamic performance to decrease with the angle of attack increasing the lsb expands which produces the stall early and abruptly after the bubble burst time dependent force measurement results ensured which flow induced vibrations over the suction surface for example the fluctuations of time dependent force measurements for all airfoils at re 3 5 104 and α 12 were given in fig 17 specifically the undulations indicated that the lsb characteristics over the airfoil surface caused the cl and the cd to have a wavy curve for fx 84 w 150 airfoil the fluctuation in the cd curve was higher because of the long bubble while the cl curve undulation was lower fig 18 which caused flow induced vibrations at the edge wise direction to form as the airfoil camber was thinner the bubble converted to the short bubble fig 18 and also the fluctuation characteristics changed finally for wasp thin airfoil whereas the cd curve fluctuation was lower the one in the cl curve was higher which indicated that the flow induced vibrations at the flap wise direction would be effective in fig 19 instantaneous voltage variations versus the time second obtained from the hot film measurements at the location of the middle of the lsb for all airfoils were showed and the jumps in the instantaneous hot film results for fx 84 w150 airfoil pointed out the bubble bursting after long bubble formation which caused periodically flow induced vibrations to occur moreover for wasp airfoil higher hot film voltage undulations due to the flow were observed in fig 20d like higher fluctuations obtained from the force results in fig 18d consequently it was concluded in this study that the short bubble caused the more flow induced vibrations than the long bubble to form because the vortex formation due to the short bubble carried out near the leading edge of the airfoil as seen in fig 16b and the vortices moved towards the trailing edge by hitting the airfoil surface causing of having more vibration the vortices due to the long bubble occurred near the trailing edge of airfoil and the amount of the stroke of the vortices decreased to airfoil surface this affected less in terms of the blade vibration regarding the obtaining of more detailed information about flow induced vibrations like performed in the study of ducoin et al 2012 the force signal fluctuations were post processed in conjunction with using of a spectrogram a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time allowing to researchers to analyze possible dominant characteristics spectrum of frequencies in this respect spectrogram graphs indicating the time dependent spectral analysis results were seen in fig 20 these graphs belonged to force measurement results of fx 84 w 150 airfoil at re 3 5 104 and different angles of attack the red colors at the graphs pointed out the dominant frequencies for α 4 distribution of the dominant frequencies was continuous during 10 s at 350 hz while it was locally seen especially at 30 hz 140 hz and 200 hz the local appearance of some dominant frequencies at the graph meant that the frequency distribution changed over time this variation also indicated both change of aerodynamic forces and flow induced vibrations over time in this study the effects of the lsb and vortex formation due to the bubbles were mentioned in the previous section these aerodynamic flow phenomena were clearly illustrated thanks to the spectrogram graphs over time furthermore the distribution of the dominant frequencies red colors weakened with the increasing of the angle of attack meaning that the dominant effects of the flow on the aerodynamic forces decreased the changes at the aerodynamic forces with time caused the formation of stochastic vibrations these stochastic vibrations turned into stochastic fatigue loads of blades and affected blade life as a result of the experimental analysis presented in this study separations occurred in the cambered profiles in the blade root region due to long bubble and bubble bursting these separations caused the changes in the drag force over time which caused edge wise vibrations over the airfoil as seen in fig 21 edge wise vibrations triggered the blade to be forced backwards moreover it was seen that the short bubble formed at the tip section of blade with thinner airfoils the oscillations in the lift forces stem from the presence of the short bubble resulting in flap wise vibrations and the blade was forced upwards fig 21 additionally it was observed that flow induced vibrations on the blade changed regionally as different airfoils were used in the turbine blade hereby the aerodynamic vibrations edge wise and flap wise could be formed these aerodynamic vibrations caused the cyclic loads they could play crucial and determinant role in terms of design of up scaled turbines in the future causing the border of lifespan because of fatigue loads of structural and mechanical components 4 conclusion the present study focused on flow phenomena such as boundary layer transition and separation progress and formation of the lsb and stochastic flow vibrations over marine current offshore wind turbine blade by employing experimental investigations at re 3 5 104 and re 7 104 flow phenomena were assessed utilizing the smoke wire experiment to visualize the flow phenomena quasi shear layer measurement in the boundary layer via hot film sensor and time dependent aerodynamic force measurement the main conclusions can be summarized as follows detailed smoke wire experiment results showed that the lsb moved upstream diminished in the length for whole selected airfoils when the angle of attack increased supporting the earlier results reported by lambert and yarusevych 2019 moreover it was observed that the pre stall the stall and the post stall angles of attack did not change for fx 84 w 150 and sd7062 airfoils which were thicker and more camber when reynolds number increased from 3 5 104 to 7 104 but an increase of 2 at the stall triad of thinner and fewer camber airfoils including clark y and wasp with increasing of reynolds number it was speculated that utilizing thinner and less camber airfoil caused the effect of apg to be less forming more stable lsb this more stable characterization inside of the bubble hindered to the bubble burst resulting in the stall delay additionally narrower wake regions at lower angles of the attack became larger when the angle of attack increased agreeing with the findings presented by liu et al 2017b this caused the drag forces to be higher and the cd curve to increase gradually an extensive comparison of quasi shear layer measurement via hot film sensors and smoke wire experiments were employed from this comparison it was concluded that the fluctuation of raw signal data obtained from the hot film sensor was less for whole selected airfoils when the flow was laminar especially at further upstream the fluctuations started to increase especially at the fore and aft portion of the lsb it was executed that the fluctuation amplitude became dominant especially at the aft portion of the lsb due to the trapped rolling up vortices akhlaghi et al 2020 thanks to these structures which originated from the amplification of unstable breakdown and disturbances due to the transition the entrainment of higher momentum flow from the outer part towards near wall region were facilitated resulting in turbulent reattachment apart from the first thicker and more camber airfoils vortex shedding characteristics were also revealed for wasp airfoil at re 7 104 and α 16 further upstream at which the short bubble formed and this caused vortex sheds to be emerged rolling along the vortex trajectory these results exhibited well coherence in conjunction with the smoke wire results it was noticed that the short lsb induced these structures notably caused the fluctuation curves to have a dominant peak and plateau especially at x c 0 5 and x c 0 6 specifically for x c 0 6 case gradually decreased trends of dominant plateaus at the hot film signals confirmed that the last vortex shedding was weaker than ensuing vortex shedding comparing force and smoke wire results it can be observed that mean and time dependent aerodynamic force coefficients results reflect remarkably well trends with the trends obtained from smoke wire results it was illustrated that the cl curve increased with the raising of the angle of attack at α 18 the mild stall occurred at the cl curve due to the appearance of the bubble bursting additionally the time dependent force measurement results confirmed the presence of the lsb over the airfoil surface it was speculated that trapped rolling up vortices at aft portion on the lsb affected the cl curve trend for fx 84 w150 airfoil the fluctuation in the cd curve was higher because of the long bubble while the cl curve undulation was lower which caused flow induced vibrations at the edge wise direction to form as the airfoil camber was thinner the bubble converted to the short bubble and the cl curve fluctuation was higher which indicated that the flow induced vibrations at the flap wise direction would be effective moreover the short bubble caused the more flow induced vibrations than the long bubble to form because the vortex formation due to the short bubble carried out near the leading edge of the airfoil and the vortices moved towards the trailing edge by hitting the airfoil surface causing of having more vibration arcondoulis et al 2009 the dominant frequency obtained from spectrogram graphs indicating the time dependent spectral analysis results revealed that aerodynamic forces and flow induced vibrations changed with the presence of the lsb in addition the distribution of dominant frequency declined when the angle of attack increased flow induced vibrations on the blade changed regionally as different airfoils were used in the turbine blade as a result of low reynolds number flow phenomena the aerodynamic vibrations edge wise and flap wise could occur these aerodynamic vibrations caused the cyclic loads they could play crucial and determinant role in terms of design of up scaled turbines in the future causing the border of lifespan because of fatigue loads of structural and mechanical components as a consequence this experimental study will be future work for the aerodynamic researchers who interested in aiming at modifying the lsb with the active or passive genç et al 2020a 2020b 2020b durhasan 2020 karasu 2020 özden et al 2020 control implementations and increasing the aerodynamic performance of lifting surfaces such as turbine blades thereby laminar boundary layer separation and the formation of the lsb as seen as the main impediment to wind airfoil performance will be diminished by utilizing control techniques credit authorship

20171,as a kind of high performance ship compared with traditional mono hull the side hull position of a trimaran plays an essential role in the hydrodynamics and motion characteristics which is more significant for the seakeeping performance of a trimaran in waves of different headings in this paper the moving forward of trimaran in waves of various headings was simulated by a hybrid numerical method which combines the fully nonlinear potential flow theory and viscous flow theory the numerical method was validated firstly then the trimaran model with two different layouts was obtained by increasing the hull separation and moving the side hulls forward finally the motion of the trimaran with different layouts in waves of various headings was simulated and the effect of layout on the motion response and added resistance were investigated keywords trimaran hybrid method layout motion response added resistance 1 introduction in recent years the investigation on high performance ships attracted more and more attention of the researchers especially some widely engineering applied hull forms such as catamaran trimaran and asymmetric twin hull as one of the high performance ships trimaran has been widely applied in marine engineering cruise and navy ships by taking advantage of the two side hulls and the unique layout trimaran could obtain some special characteristics such as wide deck area good lateral stability lower resistance in both calm water and wave favorable interaction between the center hull and the side hulls in the past decades more and more attention has been put into studying the seakeeping performance of trimaran especially in waves of different parameters and headings hebblewhite et al 2006 investigated the effects of the longitudinal position of the side hulls on the heave and pitch of a representative trimaran hull in the head wave and a series of the experiments are carried out in the australian maritime college ship hydrodynamic centre which provided a starting point to investigate the effect of the trimaran s side hull position on the motions of the vessel sato et al 2007 applied the viscous flow method to simulate the motion of trimaran at low forward speed in waves of different headings and small wave steepness and the computed result was compared with the result of the tank test for validation fang and chen 2008 presented a spectral analysis method to study the wave loads of a trimaran with different side hull positions in waves of different headings at various speeds and a pulsating source potential incorporating the panel method and the linear free surface condition is applied by which the wave amplitude and the ship motion were assumed to be small xu and zhang 2011 carried out a parametric optimization of wave loads for trimaran with different layouts and side hull lengths through three dimensional potential theory and green s function and several speeds and wave headings were also considered to study the vertical wave loads and the transverse bending moment of trimaran in waves ma et al 2012 investigated the wave induced motion of trimaran in oblique waves by 2 5d potential flow theory and the rolling damping coefficients are obtained by free decay rolling experiment and energy method deng et al 2016 2019 studied the seakeeping performance of trimaran in regular head waves and oblique waves by both cfd and potential flow method and the effect of wave amplitude on the seakeeping performance in oblique waves was discussed wang et al 2018 applied a high speed slender body potential flow theory to calculate the motion response of trimaran in regular head waves and the side hull position with the minimum heave pitch and roll motion is obtained by a fast optimization method based on viscous flow theory nowruzi et al 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b carried out a series of numerical and experimental investigations on the seakeeping performance of the trimaran in both head waves and oblique waves the effect of wall function on the computed results was discussed and the numerical method was validated ghadimi et al 2019a 2019b 2021 simulated the motion of trimaran with different side hull arrangements in both head wave and oblique head wave and the effect of side hull position on the heave pitch and roll motion was studied by comparison between the computed results by the research about the seakeeping performance of trimaran in waves it could be seen that the effect of the side hull arrangement on the motion and added resistance of trimaran in head wave have been widely studied hebblewhite et al 2007 bulian et al 2008 xu and zhang 2011 wang et al 2018 ghadimi et al 2019 and the arrangement of side hulls has a significant effect on the motion and added resistance of trimaran nevertheless the knowledge about the seakeeping performance of trimaran with different side hull arrangements in waves of various headings is still limited most of the investigation about the motion of trimaran in waves of different headings is based on tank test and potential flow method kurultay 2003 ma et al 2012 nowruzi et al 2019 the nonlinear phenomenon or the roll motion in waves are usually neglected for the study based on the potential flow theory kurultay 2003 zong et al 2012 wang et al 2018 especially for steep waves such as the intermittent emergency of side hulls and green water more investigation about the influence of side hull position on the added resistance and motion response in waves of different headings at various speeds should be carried out for trimaran form the current work aims to systemically study the seakeeping performance of the trimaran with different side hull positions especially the effect of side hull performance in waves of different headings during the process of numerical simulation the incident waves are simulated by an external wave tank of qale fem quasi arbitrary lagrangian eulerian finite element method which is based on fnpt fully nonlinear potential flow method ma et al 2015 the internal domain solves the flow field near the trimaran and the ship motion based on viscous flow theory the transition zone and the interface connect the two domains the hybrid solver is called qalefoam yan et al 2019 gong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 developed based on the open source cfd computational fluid dynamics tool openfoam the trimaran model moves forward at various waves speeds and different wave conditions are simulated by changing the wave steepness wavelengths and wave headings when the trimaran moves forward the heave roll and pitch motion are monitored and the surge sway and yaw motion are fixed based on an engineering applied trimaran model two layouts of trimaran are obtained by enlarging the hull separation and longitudinally moving the side hulls forward the computed results are used for comparison and analysis to study the influence of the side hull position on the seakeeping performance of the trimaran 2 numerical method the governing equations and hybrid method of qalefoam are described briefly in this section then the computational domain and the mesh generation are introduced 2 1 governing equations a hybrid numerical method is used in this paper to simulate the absolute moving forward of trimaran in a numerical towing tank where the wave generation and propagation in the external wave tank are solved by fnpt based qale fem and the ship motion and the flow field near the ship are solved by viscous flow method based on openfoam the solver of the hybrid method is developed and used for the numerical simulation which is called qalefoam the details about the hybrid method and qalefoam has been discussed and presented in the previous work li et al 2018 gong et al 2020 2021 however for the completeness of the paper the governing equations of the hybrid method are briefly described here in the fnpt based external wave tank ma et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the flow is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational the external wave tank is fixed in the global coordinate system and the ship is moving forward in the fixed wave tank therefore no incident current is simulated and u c 0 the velocity potential of the flow field φ f is equal to the velocity potential of the wave φ w both the kinematic and dynamic condition is satisfied on the free surface and the lagrangian method is applied to keep the free surface nodes moving simultaneously with the flow particle to decrease the numerical dissipation of wave the horizontal motion of the wavemaker nodes is fixed so the nodes of the wavemaker can just move vertically which is called the semi lagrangian method huang et al 2007 the wave velocity potential φ satisfies the laplace equation the boundary condition on the self adaption wavemaker and wave absorber the left right and bottom boundary condition and the free surface condition as follows 1 φ 2 0 2 φ n n u 3 φ n 0 4 d r d t φ d φ d t g z 1 2 φ 2 z ζ where r is the position vector of the free surface u and n is the wave velocity vector and the normal vector on the boundary d d t is the total derivative to the time g is the gravitational acceleration the external wave tank is solved by time domain method in every time step the flow field is solved by qale fem by which the domain will be re meshed in every time step to keep the robustness of the grids the details about the hybrid method and qalefoam could be found in the previous work ma et al 2015 yan et al 2019 based on the viscous flow method the flow satisfied the conservation of mass and momentum and fluid s heat conduction and compressibility are neglected hence the ship motion and the flow field near the ship are solved by the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations coupled with the volume of fluid method by which the density and viscosity of fluid could be expressed by the volume factor α and the artificial compress technique rusche 2002 is used in openfoam to make sure the continuity of the variable value in the interface 5 ρ u x ρ v y ρ w z 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u g u p d μ 2 u f 7 ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α 8 μ μ w α μ a 1 α 9 α t u u g α u r 1 α 0 where ρ is the density u u v w is the velocity of flow field u g u g v g w g is the velocity of the grid motion wang et al 2013 p d is the dynamic pressure μ is the dynamic viscous coefficient f is the source term which represents the gravity in this paper u r m i n c α u m a x u is the relative compress velocity the default value of c α is 1 the internal ns domain is discretized by finite volume method the pressure implicit split operator algorithm issa 1986 with constant time step is adopted to solve the coupling equations of pressure and velocity the coupling approach used in the hybrid method is a one way coupling as shown in fig 1 a transition zone is imposed in the ns domain and attached to the interface boundaries as illustrated in fig 2 the wave velocity under the free surface is assigned to the interface as the boundary of the internal domain and a weighting coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 is used in the transition zone to make the velocity transform smoothly the details about the wave propagation between the two domains of the hybrid method can be found in the reference li et al 2018 yan et al 2019 gong et al 2020 2 2 computational domain of the hybrid method the coordinate system used by the hybrid method is as shown in fig 1 where x y z is the global coordinate system and x y z is the ship fixed coordinate system moving with the same translation and rotation speed of the ship both the governing equations of the external domain and the internal domain are solved in the global coordinate system x y z and the hydrodynamic force and moment will be translated to the ship fixed coordinate system x y z to solve the 6dof motion of the ship carrica et al 2007 the coupling effect of the pitch and roll motion plays an important role in the motion of trimaran in waves and the sway motion is usually neglected kurultay et al 2003 sato et al 2007 walree et al 2008 bulian et al 2008 onas and datla 2011 hence the heave roll and pitch motions are set free in this paper through qalefoam both a viscous flow computational domain and a viscous flow computational domain should be generated before the numerical simulation begins which is as shown in fig 1 for the qale fem the computational mesh moves to conform to the motion of the free surface and the structures and the details about the qale fem could be found in the reference ma and yan 2009 yan and ma 2010 by the hybrid method the computational domain of viscous flow theory is moving forward at the constant speed which is equal to the ship s speed hence the fixed wave tank should be larger enough to keep the ship moving in the tank in the computational domain of viscous flow theory near the ship the sketch of the domain size is as shown in fig 2 the grid is generated by the blockmesh and the snappyhexmesh which are the utilities of openfoam during the mesh generation process the mesh of the background is generated by blockmesh first and the region near the free surface and hull form is refined by topo boxes then the mesh of the internal viscous flow domain is generated by snappyhexmesh the mesh of the internal viscous flow domain is shown in fig 3 3 validation and verification because the hybrid method has been applied for the simulation of fsi fluid structure interaction and ship s motion in wave gong et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2019 the grid independence test has been carried out and the computed added resistance and motion response has been compared with the experimental result gong et al 2020 hence the work of the grid independence test is not included in this paper the main work in this section is to verify the accuracy of the current hybrid method in the simulation of the trimaran s motion in oblique waves in this section one trimaran model is used for the numerical simulation which is signed as tri1 and the computed result is compared with the experimental result in the reference dobashi 2014 the hull form of the tri1 is as shown in fig 4 the main characteristic dimensions of tri1 for validation is as follows b l 0 09 d l 0 04 c b 0 51 b 1 l 1 0 07 d 1 l 1 0 04 c b 1 0 38 p t l 0 11 where the l b d and c b are the waterline length waterline width draft and block coefficient of center hull l 1 b 1 d 1 and c b 1 are the corresponding dimensions of the side hull p t is the hull separation of the center hull and the side hull for the trimaran model used in this paper the stern of the side hulls is at the same longitudinal position as the stern of the center hull the working condition is set the same as that in the reference dobashi 2014 in the reference both f n 0 16 and f n 0 0 are used for the tank experiment because the trimaran is moving forward in this study hence only the experimental result of f n 0 16 is used for comparison in this paper the parameters of the incident waves are as follows β 150 λ l 0 5 2 5 a constant wave amplitude a k 0 033 0 007 where β is the wave headings λ is the wavelength a is the wave amplitude k is the wave number and a k represent the wave steepness in this paper β 180 means the head wave and β 0 means the stern wave the computed results by qalefoam are compared with the experimental and computed results from the reference by potential flow method the comparison is as shown in fig 5 it could be seen that the difference between the computed results and the experimental results is acceptable the main difference occurs near λ l 1 0 which is the wavelength that usually leads to the largest motion response of ships in waves when the wavelength gets larger the computed result is in good agreement with the experimental result compared with the computed results in the reference the current method could improve the prediction accuracy of heave motion to a large extent but for the pitch motion near λ l 1 0 the prediction by the potential flow method could be more accurate 4 results and discussions in this section a trimaran model with different side hull positions is used for numerical simulation by changing the working conditions of incident waves and forward speeds the influence of layouts on the seakeeping performance of trimaran in whole wave headings is discussed 4 1 trimaran model and side hull positions the trimaran model signed as tri2 is used for the numerical simulation in this section by changing the hull separation and the longitudinal position of the side hulls the influence of the layouts on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves of different parameters and headings at various speed is investigated the main characteristic dimensions of tri2 are b l 0 08 d l 0 04 c b 0 56 b 1 l 1 0 05 d 1 l 1 0 04 c b 1 0 54 the hull form of tri2 is as shown in fig 6 all the simulation is carried out by the hybrid solver qalefoam based on layout 1 which is one of the most widely engineering applied layouts layout 2 and layout 3 are obtained by enlarging the hull separation and moving the side hulls forward respectively the side hull position and the corresponding definition are as shown in table 1 and fig 4 a the hydrodynamics and nonlinear phenomenon of trimaran are significantly affected by the speed and wave parameters such as the intermittent emergence green water and slamming of side hulls hence five headings ranging from 0 to 180 are used and the waves of different steepness and length are simulated in each wave heading three froude numbers are used for the simulation which corresponds to the low designed and high speed the working conditions of different wave steepness and wavelength are as shown in table 2 4 2 the added resistance and motion in different wave steepness the computed result of the added resistance and motion response of tri2 is as shown in fig 7 fig 9 where different lines mean the computed result at different froude numbers as shown in table 2 when we discuss the effect of layouts in waves of different steepness a k the constant wavelength is set with λ l 1 09 from fig 7 it could be seen that the added resistance of trimaran is significantly affected by the side hull position for small wave steepness a k 0 058 however when the wave steepness gets larger the difference between the added resistance of different layouts is less obvious by comparing the added resistance of the three layouts it is found that from beam wave to stern wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls in the midship is always favorable to reduce the added resistance at various speeds in waves of different steepness especially for the oblique stern wave but in the head wave the added resistance of layout 3 is relatively larger than that of layout 1 and layout 2 for which the longitudinal position of the side hulls is closer to the stern of the ship it means that the longitudinal position of side hulls significantly influences the added resistance of trimaran fig 8 shows the effect of side hull position on the heave motion response of tri2 in waves of different steepness at various speeds by the comparison it could be seen that the effect of layout on the heave motion is not apparent especially for the low and medium speeds with f n 0 24 and 0 35 the primary influence of the layout appears at the head wave β 180 where layout 3 with side hulls moved forward will lead to the largest heave motion and the larger hull separation is favorable to obtain the smaller heave motion compared with the hull separation the effect of the longitudinal position on the heave motion of trimaran is relatively more noticeable in different wave headings and froude numbers as shown in fig 9 the effect of the layout on the pitch motion in waves of different steepness is similar to that of the heave motion therefore it could be found that the main difference between the three layouts occurs in the head and oblique head wave and moving the longitudinal position of side hulls forward will lead to more significant pitch motion especially for small froude number and wave steepness however dislike the heave motion in fig 8 the pitch motion of tri2 with different layouts is almost the same in the beam oblique stern and stern wave which perhaps means that the pitch motion is mainly affected by the encounter frequency when the encounter frequency is as low as the stern wave from fig 10 the significant influence of the side hull position on the roll motion is evident especially when the froude number and the wave steepness are low compared with layout 1 layout 2 with larger hull separation is advantageous for reducing the roll motion in waves of different headings and steepness at various speeds which is probably predictable however it could be noticed that layout 3 with the longitudinal position of the side hulls moved forward could also reduce the roll motion of the trimaran especially when the froude number and the wave steepness get larger layout 3 is of similar performance with layout 2 to reduce the roll motion in beam wave and oblique stern wave just when f n 0 47 a k 0 135 layout 3 will lead to more significant roll motion than layou1 and lyout2 fig 11 shows the wave profile of trimaran with different side hull positions and the figures are captured when the wave peak passes the bow of the center hull fig 11 a c e is bow oblique wave and fig 11 b d f is stern oblique waves the variation of the side hull position will change the relative position of side hulls in waves especially when the trimaran moves in the oblique waves the two side hulls will be in the peak and the valley of the incident waves respectively by the computed result from figs 8 10 we could find that the influence of side hull position on the roll motion amplitude is relatively more significant therefore it could be expected that the larger hull separation could decrease the roll motion in oblique waves however it could be noticed that moving the side body forward will also be advantageous for the roll motion in most cases especially for oblique head waves combined with fig 11 a c it could be seen that for layout 3 both the side hulls are in the valley of the incident waves nevertheless for layout 1 when one side hull is in the peak of the incident waves the other one is in the valley of the waves which will probably lead to more significant asymmetric force and roll moment 4 3 the added resistance and motion in different wavelength the computed added resistance and motion response of tri2 in waves of different lengths at various speeds is shown from fig 12 fig 15 where the computed results of different layouts are compared with each other to show the effect of side hull positions on the added resistance and motion of trimaran when changing the wavelength λ l the wave steepness is constant with a k 0 058 fig 12 is the added resistance of tri2 in waves of different lengths at various speeds by comparing the added resistance of different layouts it could be seen that the difference between the added resistance of the three layouts gets less apparent when the wavelength increases the comparison between the results of different wavelengths and speeds shows that the effect of layouts on added resistance is more significant for small wavelength λ l 0 88 1 09 and medium speed f n 0 35 except in the head wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls moved forward could noticeably reduce the added resistance of trimaran in waves especially for beam wave and oblique stern wave in the head wave the effect of layouts on the added resistance is not obvious and the added resistance of layout 3 is relatively a bit larger at high speed f n 0 47 than that of layout 1 and layout 2 with the longitudinal position of side hulls near the stern in fig 13 the heave motion of tri2 with different layouts in waves of various lengths is similar to that in waves of various steepness in fig 8 the effect of layouts on the heave motion is still limited in waves of length ranging from λ l 0 88 to λ l 1 47 the heave motion of trimaran with the longitudinal position of side hulls in the midship is relatively more significant than that of layout 2 and layout 3 especially in the oblique stern and stern waves of large wavelength it could also be found that the hull separation has little influence on the heave motion of trimaran in different speed and wave conditions and the variation trend of heave motion with layout 2 is almost the same as that with layout 1 as shown in fig 14 when trimaran moves in waves of different lengths at various speed the layout 1 and layout 2 is favorable to reduce the pitch motion of trimaran in waves and the advantage of layou1 and layout 2 to reducing pitch motion gets more obvious when the speed and wavelength get larger similar to the heave motion in fig 13 hull separation could affect the pitch motion of trimaran to a very small extent and the larger hull separation could reduce the pitch motion of trimaran at high speed f n 0 47 by the roll motion of tri2 in fig 15 it could be seen that both the longitudinal position and the separation of side hulls have a significant effect on the roll motion of trimaran in waves of different lengths and headings at various speeds compared with layout 1 both layout 2 and layout 3 could reduce the roll motion of trimaran in waves of heading ranging from oblique head wave to oblique stern wave which is similar to the phenomenon in waves of different steepness in fig 10 it could be noticed that when the forward speed of trimaran gets more significant such as f n 0 47 in fig 15 c f i l the roll motion of layout 3 is similar to layout 2 and the roll motion of layout 3 is even smaller in the short wave with λ l 0 88 1 09 and β 135 nevertheless as shown in fig 15 a when the speed and the wavelength are low the roll motion of both layout 3 and layout 1 is significantly larger than that of layout 2 whose hull separation is larger fig 16 shows the wave profile of trimaran with different layouts in waves of λ l 0 88 as shown as the computed pitch and roll motion in figs 14 and 15 layout 3 with the side hulls moved forward could to some extent decrease the roll motion in waves but the pitch motion of layout 3 is the largest in most cases which is evident in oblique head waves combined with fig 16 a c e it could be found that when the wave peak passing the bow of the ship the moving forward of side hulls will put the two side hulls in the wave peak and the bow wave crest could be seen near the bow of both side hulls which will probably lead to more significant pitch moment the effect of side hulls on the roll motion is similar to that fig 11 based on all of the computed added resistance and motion response of different wavelengths wave steepness and speeds the average values of the added resistance and motion response are computed as shown in fig 17 it could be noticed that the effect of side hull position on the added resistance and motion of trimaran is complicated in different working conditions to choose a side hull position of best seakeeping performance will be a great job and probably need multi object optimization which is not included in this paper hence the averaged motion and added resistance in different wave headings briefly show the comprehensive seakeeping performance of the three layouts by fig 17 it could be seen that the effect of the longitudinal position on the seakeeping performance of trimaran is more prominent especially for the average added resistance and the average roll amplitude compared with layout 1 layout 3 could essentially reduce the average added resistance and average roll motion but the average heave amplitude and the average pitch amplitude of layout 3 are a bit larger however for the hull separation the effect of the hull separation is not noticeable the hull separation could only significantly reduce the roll motion in all different wave headings 5 summary and conclusions in this paper the motion of trimaran with different layouts in waves are simulated by the hybrid numerical solver qalefoam which couples the fnpt based qale fem and viscous flow method first the grid convergence test is carried out and the experimental result is used to validate the numerical method then different speeds of trimaran and incident waves of various steepness lengths and headings are used to simulate the motion of trimaran in waves and the result is used to discuss and analyze the influence of side hull position on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves by the investigations in this paper the following observation and conclusion could be obtained 1 by comparing the results of the trimaran with different layouts it could be seen that except for the roll motion the hull separation has little effect on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves however when the wave steepness and the wavelength are small the larger hull separation could reduce the trimaran s added resistance and pitch motion to a limited extent to sum up layout 1 and layout 2 is of the similar variation trend of added resistance and motion response in waves of different parameters at various speeds and the main advantage of layout 2 with larger hull separation is to significantly reduce the roll motion in waves of different lengths steepness and headings 2 the longitudinal position has a noticeable influence on the seakeeping performance of trimaran except in head wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls moved forward could reduce the added resistance especially in beam wave oblique stern wave and stern wave and the added resistance could be even negative in some wave parameters and speed as shown in figs 7 and 12 when the hull separation is constant layout 3 could also reduce the roll motion of trimaran in most wave conditions but compared with layout 1 and layout 2 the heave and pitch motion of layout 3 is relatively more significant in waves of different headings though the effect of the layout on the heave and pitch motion is not as noticeable as that on the added resistance and roll motion 3 by the computed added resistance and roll motion of trimaran in waves of different lengths and steepness at various speeds the side hull position significantly affects the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves however with the wavelength and steepness increasing the effect of layouts gets less obvious especially for the added resistance and roll motion it is noted that the above observations not described in the current literature as far as we know are based only on the cases investigated in the paper their applications to a wider range of cases need further investigations credit authorship contribution statement jiaye gong methodology writing original

20171,as a kind of high performance ship compared with traditional mono hull the side hull position of a trimaran plays an essential role in the hydrodynamics and motion characteristics which is more significant for the seakeeping performance of a trimaran in waves of different headings in this paper the moving forward of trimaran in waves of various headings was simulated by a hybrid numerical method which combines the fully nonlinear potential flow theory and viscous flow theory the numerical method was validated firstly then the trimaran model with two different layouts was obtained by increasing the hull separation and moving the side hulls forward finally the motion of the trimaran with different layouts in waves of various headings was simulated and the effect of layout on the motion response and added resistance were investigated keywords trimaran hybrid method layout motion response added resistance 1 introduction in recent years the investigation on high performance ships attracted more and more attention of the researchers especially some widely engineering applied hull forms such as catamaran trimaran and asymmetric twin hull as one of the high performance ships trimaran has been widely applied in marine engineering cruise and navy ships by taking advantage of the two side hulls and the unique layout trimaran could obtain some special characteristics such as wide deck area good lateral stability lower resistance in both calm water and wave favorable interaction between the center hull and the side hulls in the past decades more and more attention has been put into studying the seakeeping performance of trimaran especially in waves of different parameters and headings hebblewhite et al 2006 investigated the effects of the longitudinal position of the side hulls on the heave and pitch of a representative trimaran hull in the head wave and a series of the experiments are carried out in the australian maritime college ship hydrodynamic centre which provided a starting point to investigate the effect of the trimaran s side hull position on the motions of the vessel sato et al 2007 applied the viscous flow method to simulate the motion of trimaran at low forward speed in waves of different headings and small wave steepness and the computed result was compared with the result of the tank test for validation fang and chen 2008 presented a spectral analysis method to study the wave loads of a trimaran with different side hull positions in waves of different headings at various speeds and a pulsating source potential incorporating the panel method and the linear free surface condition is applied by which the wave amplitude and the ship motion were assumed to be small xu and zhang 2011 carried out a parametric optimization of wave loads for trimaran with different layouts and side hull lengths through three dimensional potential theory and green s function and several speeds and wave headings were also considered to study the vertical wave loads and the transverse bending moment of trimaran in waves ma et al 2012 investigated the wave induced motion of trimaran in oblique waves by 2 5d potential flow theory and the rolling damping coefficients are obtained by free decay rolling experiment and energy method deng et al 2016 2019 studied the seakeeping performance of trimaran in regular head waves and oblique waves by both cfd and potential flow method and the effect of wave amplitude on the seakeeping performance in oblique waves was discussed wang et al 2018 applied a high speed slender body potential flow theory to calculate the motion response of trimaran in regular head waves and the side hull position with the minimum heave pitch and roll motion is obtained by a fast optimization method based on viscous flow theory nowruzi et al 2019a 2019b 2020a 2020b carried out a series of numerical and experimental investigations on the seakeeping performance of the trimaran in both head waves and oblique waves the effect of wall function on the computed results was discussed and the numerical method was validated ghadimi et al 2019a 2019b 2021 simulated the motion of trimaran with different side hull arrangements in both head wave and oblique head wave and the effect of side hull position on the heave pitch and roll motion was studied by comparison between the computed results by the research about the seakeeping performance of trimaran in waves it could be seen that the effect of the side hull arrangement on the motion and added resistance of trimaran in head wave have been widely studied hebblewhite et al 2007 bulian et al 2008 xu and zhang 2011 wang et al 2018 ghadimi et al 2019 and the arrangement of side hulls has a significant effect on the motion and added resistance of trimaran nevertheless the knowledge about the seakeeping performance of trimaran with different side hull arrangements in waves of various headings is still limited most of the investigation about the motion of trimaran in waves of different headings is based on tank test and potential flow method kurultay 2003 ma et al 2012 nowruzi et al 2019 the nonlinear phenomenon or the roll motion in waves are usually neglected for the study based on the potential flow theory kurultay 2003 zong et al 2012 wang et al 2018 especially for steep waves such as the intermittent emergency of side hulls and green water more investigation about the influence of side hull position on the added resistance and motion response in waves of different headings at various speeds should be carried out for trimaran form the current work aims to systemically study the seakeeping performance of the trimaran with different side hull positions especially the effect of side hull performance in waves of different headings during the process of numerical simulation the incident waves are simulated by an external wave tank of qale fem quasi arbitrary lagrangian eulerian finite element method which is based on fnpt fully nonlinear potential flow method ma et al 2015 the internal domain solves the flow field near the trimaran and the ship motion based on viscous flow theory the transition zone and the interface connect the two domains the hybrid solver is called qalefoam yan et al 2019 gong et al 2020 wang et al 2020 developed based on the open source cfd computational fluid dynamics tool openfoam the trimaran model moves forward at various waves speeds and different wave conditions are simulated by changing the wave steepness wavelengths and wave headings when the trimaran moves forward the heave roll and pitch motion are monitored and the surge sway and yaw motion are fixed based on an engineering applied trimaran model two layouts of trimaran are obtained by enlarging the hull separation and longitudinally moving the side hulls forward the computed results are used for comparison and analysis to study the influence of the side hull position on the seakeeping performance of the trimaran 2 numerical method the governing equations and hybrid method of qalefoam are described briefly in this section then the computational domain and the mesh generation are introduced 2 1 governing equations a hybrid numerical method is used in this paper to simulate the absolute moving forward of trimaran in a numerical towing tank where the wave generation and propagation in the external wave tank are solved by fnpt based qale fem and the ship motion and the flow field near the ship are solved by viscous flow method based on openfoam the solver of the hybrid method is developed and used for the numerical simulation which is called qalefoam the details about the hybrid method and qalefoam has been discussed and presented in the previous work li et al 2018 gong et al 2020 2021 however for the completeness of the paper the governing equations of the hybrid method are briefly described here in the fnpt based external wave tank ma et al 2015 yan et al 2019 the flow is assumed to be incompressible inviscid and irrotational the external wave tank is fixed in the global coordinate system and the ship is moving forward in the fixed wave tank therefore no incident current is simulated and u c 0 the velocity potential of the flow field φ f is equal to the velocity potential of the wave φ w both the kinematic and dynamic condition is satisfied on the free surface and the lagrangian method is applied to keep the free surface nodes moving simultaneously with the flow particle to decrease the numerical dissipation of wave the horizontal motion of the wavemaker nodes is fixed so the nodes of the wavemaker can just move vertically which is called the semi lagrangian method huang et al 2007 the wave velocity potential φ satisfies the laplace equation the boundary condition on the self adaption wavemaker and wave absorber the left right and bottom boundary condition and the free surface condition as follows 1 φ 2 0 2 φ n n u 3 φ n 0 4 d r d t φ d φ d t g z 1 2 φ 2 z ζ where r is the position vector of the free surface u and n is the wave velocity vector and the normal vector on the boundary d d t is the total derivative to the time g is the gravitational acceleration the external wave tank is solved by time domain method in every time step the flow field is solved by qale fem by which the domain will be re meshed in every time step to keep the robustness of the grids the details about the hybrid method and qalefoam could be found in the previous work ma et al 2015 yan et al 2019 based on the viscous flow method the flow satisfied the conservation of mass and momentum and fluid s heat conduction and compressibility are neglected hence the ship motion and the flow field near the ship are solved by the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations coupled with the volume of fluid method by which the density and viscosity of fluid could be expressed by the volume factor α and the artificial compress technique rusche 2002 is used in openfoam to make sure the continuity of the variable value in the interface 5 ρ u x ρ v y ρ w z 0 6 ρ u t ρ u u g u p d μ 2 u f 7 ρ ρ w α ρ a 1 α 8 μ μ w α μ a 1 α 9 α t u u g α u r 1 α 0 where ρ is the density u u v w is the velocity of flow field u g u g v g w g is the velocity of the grid motion wang et al 2013 p d is the dynamic pressure μ is the dynamic viscous coefficient f is the source term which represents the gravity in this paper u r m i n c α u m a x u is the relative compress velocity the default value of c α is 1 the internal ns domain is discretized by finite volume method the pressure implicit split operator algorithm issa 1986 with constant time step is adopted to solve the coupling equations of pressure and velocity the coupling approach used in the hybrid method is a one way coupling as shown in fig 1 a transition zone is imposed in the ns domain and attached to the interface boundaries as illustrated in fig 2 the wave velocity under the free surface is assigned to the interface as the boundary of the internal domain and a weighting coefficient ranging from 0 to 1 is used in the transition zone to make the velocity transform smoothly the details about the wave propagation between the two domains of the hybrid method can be found in the reference li et al 2018 yan et al 2019 gong et al 2020 2 2 computational domain of the hybrid method the coordinate system used by the hybrid method is as shown in fig 1 where x y z is the global coordinate system and x y z is the ship fixed coordinate system moving with the same translation and rotation speed of the ship both the governing equations of the external domain and the internal domain are solved in the global coordinate system x y z and the hydrodynamic force and moment will be translated to the ship fixed coordinate system x y z to solve the 6dof motion of the ship carrica et al 2007 the coupling effect of the pitch and roll motion plays an important role in the motion of trimaran in waves and the sway motion is usually neglected kurultay et al 2003 sato et al 2007 walree et al 2008 bulian et al 2008 onas and datla 2011 hence the heave roll and pitch motions are set free in this paper through qalefoam both a viscous flow computational domain and a viscous flow computational domain should be generated before the numerical simulation begins which is as shown in fig 1 for the qale fem the computational mesh moves to conform to the motion of the free surface and the structures and the details about the qale fem could be found in the reference ma and yan 2009 yan and ma 2010 by the hybrid method the computational domain of viscous flow theory is moving forward at the constant speed which is equal to the ship s speed hence the fixed wave tank should be larger enough to keep the ship moving in the tank in the computational domain of viscous flow theory near the ship the sketch of the domain size is as shown in fig 2 the grid is generated by the blockmesh and the snappyhexmesh which are the utilities of openfoam during the mesh generation process the mesh of the background is generated by blockmesh first and the region near the free surface and hull form is refined by topo boxes then the mesh of the internal viscous flow domain is generated by snappyhexmesh the mesh of the internal viscous flow domain is shown in fig 3 3 validation and verification because the hybrid method has been applied for the simulation of fsi fluid structure interaction and ship s motion in wave gong et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yan et al 2019 the grid independence test has been carried out and the computed added resistance and motion response has been compared with the experimental result gong et al 2020 hence the work of the grid independence test is not included in this paper the main work in this section is to verify the accuracy of the current hybrid method in the simulation of the trimaran s motion in oblique waves in this section one trimaran model is used for the numerical simulation which is signed as tri1 and the computed result is compared with the experimental result in the reference dobashi 2014 the hull form of the tri1 is as shown in fig 4 the main characteristic dimensions of tri1 for validation is as follows b l 0 09 d l 0 04 c b 0 51 b 1 l 1 0 07 d 1 l 1 0 04 c b 1 0 38 p t l 0 11 where the l b d and c b are the waterline length waterline width draft and block coefficient of center hull l 1 b 1 d 1 and c b 1 are the corresponding dimensions of the side hull p t is the hull separation of the center hull and the side hull for the trimaran model used in this paper the stern of the side hulls is at the same longitudinal position as the stern of the center hull the working condition is set the same as that in the reference dobashi 2014 in the reference both f n 0 16 and f n 0 0 are used for the tank experiment because the trimaran is moving forward in this study hence only the experimental result of f n 0 16 is used for comparison in this paper the parameters of the incident waves are as follows β 150 λ l 0 5 2 5 a constant wave amplitude a k 0 033 0 007 where β is the wave headings λ is the wavelength a is the wave amplitude k is the wave number and a k represent the wave steepness in this paper β 180 means the head wave and β 0 means the stern wave the computed results by qalefoam are compared with the experimental and computed results from the reference by potential flow method the comparison is as shown in fig 5 it could be seen that the difference between the computed results and the experimental results is acceptable the main difference occurs near λ l 1 0 which is the wavelength that usually leads to the largest motion response of ships in waves when the wavelength gets larger the computed result is in good agreement with the experimental result compared with the computed results in the reference the current method could improve the prediction accuracy of heave motion to a large extent but for the pitch motion near λ l 1 0 the prediction by the potential flow method could be more accurate 4 results and discussions in this section a trimaran model with different side hull positions is used for numerical simulation by changing the working conditions of incident waves and forward speeds the influence of layouts on the seakeeping performance of trimaran in whole wave headings is discussed 4 1 trimaran model and side hull positions the trimaran model signed as tri2 is used for the numerical simulation in this section by changing the hull separation and the longitudinal position of the side hulls the influence of the layouts on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves of different parameters and headings at various speed is investigated the main characteristic dimensions of tri2 are b l 0 08 d l 0 04 c b 0 56 b 1 l 1 0 05 d 1 l 1 0 04 c b 1 0 54 the hull form of tri2 is as shown in fig 6 all the simulation is carried out by the hybrid solver qalefoam based on layout 1 which is one of the most widely engineering applied layouts layout 2 and layout 3 are obtained by enlarging the hull separation and moving the side hulls forward respectively the side hull position and the corresponding definition are as shown in table 1 and fig 4 a the hydrodynamics and nonlinear phenomenon of trimaran are significantly affected by the speed and wave parameters such as the intermittent emergence green water and slamming of side hulls hence five headings ranging from 0 to 180 are used and the waves of different steepness and length are simulated in each wave heading three froude numbers are used for the simulation which corresponds to the low designed and high speed the working conditions of different wave steepness and wavelength are as shown in table 2 4 2 the added resistance and motion in different wave steepness the computed result of the added resistance and motion response of tri2 is as shown in fig 7 fig 9 where different lines mean the computed result at different froude numbers as shown in table 2 when we discuss the effect of layouts in waves of different steepness a k the constant wavelength is set with λ l 1 09 from fig 7 it could be seen that the added resistance of trimaran is significantly affected by the side hull position for small wave steepness a k 0 058 however when the wave steepness gets larger the difference between the added resistance of different layouts is less obvious by comparing the added resistance of the three layouts it is found that from beam wave to stern wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls in the midship is always favorable to reduce the added resistance at various speeds in waves of different steepness especially for the oblique stern wave but in the head wave the added resistance of layout 3 is relatively larger than that of layout 1 and layout 2 for which the longitudinal position of the side hulls is closer to the stern of the ship it means that the longitudinal position of side hulls significantly influences the added resistance of trimaran fig 8 shows the effect of side hull position on the heave motion response of tri2 in waves of different steepness at various speeds by the comparison it could be seen that the effect of layout on the heave motion is not apparent especially for the low and medium speeds with f n 0 24 and 0 35 the primary influence of the layout appears at the head wave β 180 where layout 3 with side hulls moved forward will lead to the largest heave motion and the larger hull separation is favorable to obtain the smaller heave motion compared with the hull separation the effect of the longitudinal position on the heave motion of trimaran is relatively more noticeable in different wave headings and froude numbers as shown in fig 9 the effect of the layout on the pitch motion in waves of different steepness is similar to that of the heave motion therefore it could be found that the main difference between the three layouts occurs in the head and oblique head wave and moving the longitudinal position of side hulls forward will lead to more significant pitch motion especially for small froude number and wave steepness however dislike the heave motion in fig 8 the pitch motion of tri2 with different layouts is almost the same in the beam oblique stern and stern wave which perhaps means that the pitch motion is mainly affected by the encounter frequency when the encounter frequency is as low as the stern wave from fig 10 the significant influence of the side hull position on the roll motion is evident especially when the froude number and the wave steepness are low compared with layout 1 layout 2 with larger hull separation is advantageous for reducing the roll motion in waves of different headings and steepness at various speeds which is probably predictable however it could be noticed that layout 3 with the longitudinal position of the side hulls moved forward could also reduce the roll motion of the trimaran especially when the froude number and the wave steepness get larger layout 3 is of similar performance with layout 2 to reduce the roll motion in beam wave and oblique stern wave just when f n 0 47 a k 0 135 layout 3 will lead to more significant roll motion than layou1 and lyout2 fig 11 shows the wave profile of trimaran with different side hull positions and the figures are captured when the wave peak passes the bow of the center hull fig 11 a c e is bow oblique wave and fig 11 b d f is stern oblique waves the variation of the side hull position will change the relative position of side hulls in waves especially when the trimaran moves in the oblique waves the two side hulls will be in the peak and the valley of the incident waves respectively by the computed result from figs 8 10 we could find that the influence of side hull position on the roll motion amplitude is relatively more significant therefore it could be expected that the larger hull separation could decrease the roll motion in oblique waves however it could be noticed that moving the side body forward will also be advantageous for the roll motion in most cases especially for oblique head waves combined with fig 11 a c it could be seen that for layout 3 both the side hulls are in the valley of the incident waves nevertheless for layout 1 when one side hull is in the peak of the incident waves the other one is in the valley of the waves which will probably lead to more significant asymmetric force and roll moment 4 3 the added resistance and motion in different wavelength the computed added resistance and motion response of tri2 in waves of different lengths at various speeds is shown from fig 12 fig 15 where the computed results of different layouts are compared with each other to show the effect of side hull positions on the added resistance and motion of trimaran when changing the wavelength λ l the wave steepness is constant with a k 0 058 fig 12 is the added resistance of tri2 in waves of different lengths at various speeds by comparing the added resistance of different layouts it could be seen that the difference between the added resistance of the three layouts gets less apparent when the wavelength increases the comparison between the results of different wavelengths and speeds shows that the effect of layouts on added resistance is more significant for small wavelength λ l 0 88 1 09 and medium speed f n 0 35 except in the head wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls moved forward could noticeably reduce the added resistance of trimaran in waves especially for beam wave and oblique stern wave in the head wave the effect of layouts on the added resistance is not obvious and the added resistance of layout 3 is relatively a bit larger at high speed f n 0 47 than that of layout 1 and layout 2 with the longitudinal position of side hulls near the stern in fig 13 the heave motion of tri2 with different layouts in waves of various lengths is similar to that in waves of various steepness in fig 8 the effect of layouts on the heave motion is still limited in waves of length ranging from λ l 0 88 to λ l 1 47 the heave motion of trimaran with the longitudinal position of side hulls in the midship is relatively more significant than that of layout 2 and layout 3 especially in the oblique stern and stern waves of large wavelength it could also be found that the hull separation has little influence on the heave motion of trimaran in different speed and wave conditions and the variation trend of heave motion with layout 2 is almost the same as that with layout 1 as shown in fig 14 when trimaran moves in waves of different lengths at various speed the layout 1 and layout 2 is favorable to reduce the pitch motion of trimaran in waves and the advantage of layou1 and layout 2 to reducing pitch motion gets more obvious when the speed and wavelength get larger similar to the heave motion in fig 13 hull separation could affect the pitch motion of trimaran to a very small extent and the larger hull separation could reduce the pitch motion of trimaran at high speed f n 0 47 by the roll motion of tri2 in fig 15 it could be seen that both the longitudinal position and the separation of side hulls have a significant effect on the roll motion of trimaran in waves of different lengths and headings at various speeds compared with layout 1 both layout 2 and layout 3 could reduce the roll motion of trimaran in waves of heading ranging from oblique head wave to oblique stern wave which is similar to the phenomenon in waves of different steepness in fig 10 it could be noticed that when the forward speed of trimaran gets more significant such as f n 0 47 in fig 15 c f i l the roll motion of layout 3 is similar to layout 2 and the roll motion of layout 3 is even smaller in the short wave with λ l 0 88 1 09 and β 135 nevertheless as shown in fig 15 a when the speed and the wavelength are low the roll motion of both layout 3 and layout 1 is significantly larger than that of layout 2 whose hull separation is larger fig 16 shows the wave profile of trimaran with different layouts in waves of λ l 0 88 as shown as the computed pitch and roll motion in figs 14 and 15 layout 3 with the side hulls moved forward could to some extent decrease the roll motion in waves but the pitch motion of layout 3 is the largest in most cases which is evident in oblique head waves combined with fig 16 a c e it could be found that when the wave peak passing the bow of the ship the moving forward of side hulls will put the two side hulls in the wave peak and the bow wave crest could be seen near the bow of both side hulls which will probably lead to more significant pitch moment the effect of side hulls on the roll motion is similar to that fig 11 based on all of the computed added resistance and motion response of different wavelengths wave steepness and speeds the average values of the added resistance and motion response are computed as shown in fig 17 it could be noticed that the effect of side hull position on the added resistance and motion of trimaran is complicated in different working conditions to choose a side hull position of best seakeeping performance will be a great job and probably need multi object optimization which is not included in this paper hence the averaged motion and added resistance in different wave headings briefly show the comprehensive seakeeping performance of the three layouts by fig 17 it could be seen that the effect of the longitudinal position on the seakeeping performance of trimaran is more prominent especially for the average added resistance and the average roll amplitude compared with layout 1 layout 3 could essentially reduce the average added resistance and average roll motion but the average heave amplitude and the average pitch amplitude of layout 3 are a bit larger however for the hull separation the effect of the hull separation is not noticeable the hull separation could only significantly reduce the roll motion in all different wave headings 5 summary and conclusions in this paper the motion of trimaran with different layouts in waves are simulated by the hybrid numerical solver qalefoam which couples the fnpt based qale fem and viscous flow method first the grid convergence test is carried out and the experimental result is used to validate the numerical method then different speeds of trimaran and incident waves of various steepness lengths and headings are used to simulate the motion of trimaran in waves and the result is used to discuss and analyze the influence of side hull position on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves by the investigations in this paper the following observation and conclusion could be obtained 1 by comparing the results of the trimaran with different layouts it could be seen that except for the roll motion the hull separation has little effect on the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves however when the wave steepness and the wavelength are small the larger hull separation could reduce the trimaran s added resistance and pitch motion to a limited extent to sum up layout 1 and layout 2 is of the similar variation trend of added resistance and motion response in waves of different parameters at various speeds and the main advantage of layout 2 with larger hull separation is to significantly reduce the roll motion in waves of different lengths steepness and headings 2 the longitudinal position has a noticeable influence on the seakeeping performance of trimaran except in head wave layout 3 with the longitudinal position of side hulls moved forward could reduce the added resistance especially in beam wave oblique stern wave and stern wave and the added resistance could be even negative in some wave parameters and speed as shown in figs 7 and 12 when the hull separation is constant layout 3 could also reduce the roll motion of trimaran in most wave conditions but compared with layout 1 and layout 2 the heave and pitch motion of layout 3 is relatively more significant in waves of different headings though the effect of the layout on the heave and pitch motion is not as noticeable as that on the added resistance and roll motion 3 by the computed added resistance and roll motion of trimaran in waves of different lengths and steepness at various speeds the side hull position significantly affects the added resistance and motion of trimaran in waves however with the wavelength and steepness increasing the effect of layouts gets less obvious especially for the added resistance and roll motion it is noted that the above observations not described in the current literature as far as we know are based

20172,the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the progression of damage to sloped coastal structures such as revetments dikes and mound breakwaters by applying dimensional analysis the adequacy of the derived functional relationship was verified with the same experimental data rock layer over impermeable dikes under irregular waves and four dike slopes originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula the method addresses the epistemic uncertainty of the damage evolution model and its dependence on the experimental design and technique the non dimensional incident sea state characteristics at the foot of the slope relative water depth relative wave height wave steepness sea state persistence and number of waves it is specific to each dike slope specifically the scarcity of experimental data in shallow water conditions are considered accordingly the sigmoid function is proposed as an alternate model to quantify the progression in the current state of knowledge it is uncertain how the formulas based on lab experiments perform for real world design conditions more research in the form of further test series is thus necessary to explore this new approach in greater depth keywords sloping coastal structures dimensional analysis damage evolution experimental design 1 introduction forty per cent of the world s population lives

warming and one of its main effects rising sea levels call this territorial model into question in the last several years various alternatives for coastal protection adaptation and mitigation have been proposed the challenge of protecting the coast from the effects of global warming necessarily involves quantifying the resilience of structures as well as their intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty these new demands ask for new coastal and ocean engineering philosophy regarding the socioeconomic and environmental impact of human interventions baquerizo and losada 2008 losada et al 2009 revetments dikes and mound breakwaters are the most common type of sloped coastal structures because of their ability to break and or dissipate wave energy they can also be constructed with different materials and their armor units can be of different shapes and sizes their design construction and management are a major investment which extends over successive phases throughout their life cycle since during their useful life their state and conditions may change the effects of the intrinsic uncertainty e g due to wave climate variability were significant when computing the damage level in the middle of the 20th century nowadays the quantification of epistemic uncertainty kroon et al 2020 namely the uncertainty introduced by the model of damage progression s d of the principal failure modes whether correlated or independent is a major knowledge deficit in the optimization of coastal structures lira loarca et al 2019 rom 1 1 2018 to effectively determine uncertainty and thus estimate the total investment cost rom 1 1 2018 it is necessary to have predictive models of the hydrodynamic and structural behavior of the works over the useful life of the project in practical coastal engineering the stability of the slope of rock armored mound breakwaters is usually verified by applying laboratory based empirical formulas the earliest formula by iribarren and nogales 1949 and the reductionist simplified version of hudson 1959 were modified after the publication of battjes 1974 on the surf similarity parameter currently most of the formulas used to verify the stability of the armor units of the main layer are formally like the van der meer 1988 formula which is based on a significant number of experiments in a wave flume with different typologies van der meer concluded that the stability of rubble mound revetments and breakwaters can be described by the following dimensionless variables h s d n 50 δ s ξ m cot α s d n w p and proposed a formula for plunging waves and another for surging waves in consonance with the state of the art the formula did not include the relative water depth h l n s h s d n 50 δ s is the stability number hudson 1959 α is the slope angle and ξ m o ir i r tan α h s l is the iribarren number iribarren and nogales 1949 d n50 is the nominal diameter of the rock layer defined by d n50 m 50 ρ s 1 3 where m 50 is the average stone mass which is 50 of the value on the mass distribution curve δ s ρ s ρ w 1 is the relative mass density and ρ s ρ w are the mass density of the rock and water respectively according to van der meer 1987 s d a e d n 50 2 is the dimensionless damage and a e is the eroded cross sectional area of the profile a physical description of s d is the number of cubic stones with a side of d n50 eroded within a width of one d n50 h s and l are the incident significant wave height and wavelength respectively at the toe of the slope n w is the number of waves in the sea state and p is a notional permeability parameter van der meer 1988 it can be applied not only to calculate the stability number n s based on the damage level s d but also to calculate s d based on n s despite its widespread use the van der meer formula is subject to a permanent process of experimental revision most of these revisions are only refinements of the statistical wave descriptors used recently etemad shahidi et al 2020 eliminated p and included a permeability coefficient c p basically all of the revised formulas have the same formal structure and almost the same non dimensional variables it is surprising that in the last 40 years few researchers have considered the effect of the relative water depth at the toe of the slope on the progression of damage under non breaking conditions before the waves reached the structure melby and hughes 2004 derived a stability formula based on the maximum wave momentum flux hughes 2004 and concluded that when the water depth was incorporated a better description of stability surging and plunging breaker types was obtained furthermore as noted by ahrens et al 1993 and recovering the concerns of hughes 2004 there are few laboratory data for shallow water conditions of near depth limited breaking relative to water depth at the structure toe so it can be concluded that there is no certainty about the performance of laboratory based wave stability formulas for what may be the design condition for coastal protection under global warming the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the progression or spatio temporal evolution of the damage to sloped coastal structures such as revetments dikes and mound breakwaters this method was applied to a two diameter thick rock layer placed on an impermeable core and four dike slopes and verified with the same experimental data originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula this method addresses some open questions related to the design of coastal protection with laboratory based formulas that have an impact on uncertainty and total cost investment in regard to the following 1 the role of the relative water depth h l on the damage evolution s d and its interplay with the slope m and wave steepness h i l 2 the dependence of the damage evolution s d including the initiation of damage and destruction on the experimental design and technique 3 the performance of laboratory based wave stability formulas for what may be the design condition the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the generalized buckingham s π theorem sonin 2001 is applied to obtain a function that relates the damage level and its spatiotemporal evolution to the characteristics of the wave train section 3 explores the form of the function and verifies it against the experimental data of van der meer 1988 section 4 analyzes the interplay of the slope and the characteristics of the incident wave train on the progression of damage including the generated value of the relative wave height h i h in section 5 the sources of epistemic uncertainty are discussed section 6 proposes as an alternate model the sigmoid function this is followed in section 7 by a brief discussion of the challenges of maritime engineering and physical experiments the paper ends with a summary of the most important conclusions that can be derived from this research the two appendixes show the fit and correlation coefficients specific for each tested slope 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 which were obtained for the linear relationship eq 10 also included is the sigmoid function eq 12 2 reformulation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the damage to a sloping coastal structure the structure used to test the methodology presented in this study is a sloping non overtopped dike composed of an impermeable core and a main layer of rock rubble in this dike α is the angle of the seaward slope the independent variables governing the evolution of the main layer are the following losada and giménez curto 1979 a environment sea bottom slope β b depth at the toe of the slope h density ρ w and dynamic viscosity of the water μ and gravity acceleration g b incident waves descriptors of the characteristic wave height and period h i and t m wavelength l energy spectrum and incidence angle θ c breakwater typology main layer composed of rock rubble with a nominal diameter d n50 armor unit density ρ s number of sublayers n c sublayer thickness e slope of the dike m tan α d time from the beginning of the experiment t to form this complete set of independent variables it was necessary to adopt certain simplifications which did not alter the generality of the results obtained horizontal bottom β b 0 normal incidence θ 0 and single peak wave spectrum since the slope of the dike m is dimensionless it is not included in the complete set of independent variables but is regarded as a previously specified geometric characteristic of the structure such as the type and shape of the armor unit the temporal evolution of the main armor layer is quantified by a e the eroded cross sectional area of the profile it is determined by the values of the following n 11 independent quantities 1 a e f h ρ w μ g h i l d n 50 ρ s e t t m the persistence of the sea state can be unambiguously separated from the complete set of independent quantities to form the dimensionless variable t t 0 t m time t 0 is included to account for the state of the breakwater at instant t 0 and to satisfy the compatibility condition changes in the origin of times should not alter the accumulated damage value castillo et al 2012 melby and kobayashi 1998 1999 then 2 a e f 1 h ρ w μ g h i l d n 50 ρ s e f 2 t t 0 t m the function f 1 depends on the rest of the complete set n 9 among others there are n f 4 variables that define the characteristics of the rubble mound layer and its thickness and the fluid dynamic viscosity d n 50 ρ s μ e whose value remains constant throughout the experiment once a dimensionally independent subset is chosen k f 3 d n 50 ρ s μ f 1 depends on a set of n n f k f 8 independent variables then when a reduced set is selected from an independent subset of k variables ρ w g l the non dimensional eroded cross sectional area of the profile should depend on a set of n n k nf kf 5 dimensionless variables and on the value of f 2 at the dimensionless time t t 0 t m 3 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 h l h i l ρ s ρ w d n 50 g d n 50 μ w ρ w e d n 50 f 2 t t 0 t m where s d represents the dimensionless output or the progression of the damage or cumulative damage at t t 0 t m of the experiment the third and fourth monomial in eq 3 can be combined to define a single non dimensional quantity d 4a d d n 50 g δ s d n 50 ν 4b ν μ w ρ w where d is the particle parameter first defined by madsen and grant 1976 who related it to the shields parameter in conditions of incipient sediment transport in the context of sloping breakwaters it is a suitable armor unit parameter that can be used to analyze the scale effects similar to a reynolds number and to compare the flow and stability of different types of units tested in the same conditions furthermore by dimensionalizing the thickness of the main layer with the diameter of the armor unit the functional relationship eq 3 can be written as follows 5 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 h l h i l d e f 2 t t 0 t m as can be observed the thickness of the main armor layer e is determined based on the nominal size of unit d n50 and on the shape factor of unit k p and the number of layers n c gómez martín and medina 2014 6a e n c k p d n 50 6b e e d n 50 n c k p in the practical example see fig 1 a sloping non overtopped dike composed of an impermeable core and a main layer of rock rubble the nondimensional quantities e d δ s and their corresponding dimensional quantities n c k p d n50 have a constant value in all the experiments under such conditions the functional relationship between the dimensionless quantities cumulative damage incident wave characteristics and persistence of the sea state is the following 7 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 h l h i l f 2 t t 0 t m eq 7 is the formal structure of the equation for the cumulative damage in a sea state and a storm sequence of sea states in addition bridgman s principle of absolute significance holds for the cumulative damage sd a physical quantity it thus has a monomial formula functional relationship if it is in the form of a specific power law díaz carrasco et al 2020 clavero et al 2020 and moragues and losada 2021 showed that the product of the relative water depth and wave steepness at the toe of the dike χ h l h i l is an alternative similarity parameter to the iribarren number and can be used to quantify the wave breaker type flow characteristics and wave energy transformation on the slope for this reason a monomial formula with the same power law form obtained was chosen to describe the cumulative damage of the rock layer over impermeable dikes 8 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 χ f 2 t t 0 t m this signifies that the results are dimensionally homogeneous and intuitively interpretable the π theorem does not provide the form of the functional relationship this form can only be obtained by physical or numerical experimentation or by theoretically solving the problem sonin 2001 in this study the choice of functions f 1 2 is based on data shen et al 2014 which depend on the experimental design and technique more specifically these are the following i slope of the dike ii sample space defining sequences of subsequent sea state pairs h l h i l and their persistence or number of waves n w and iii the criteria determining the sounding strategy of the cumulative damage once the test is finished and the section is rebuilt accordingly f 1 2 were then selected to model van der meer s experimental output 2 1 graphical representation of the experimental design and sample space the sample space fig 2 is the geometric locus of the experimental points defined by their coordinates wave steepness and relative water depth from a geometric perspective the limit values of h l and hi l in the wave flume are determined by the water depth at the toe of the dike h and slope m and if applicable the characteristics of the mantle and core which are the sides of the quadrilateral the log transformation of the relative water depth h l and wave steepness h i l was applied for the sake of completeness the figure includes the maximum wave steepness of a regular progressive wave train propagating in a constant water depth as calculated with miche s 1944 equation each line χ h i l h l is the geometric location of wave trains of the same breaker type moragues and losada 2021 their location depends on and is specific to the slope gradient and the characteristics of the dike moreover each line γ h i l h l h i h is the geometric location of wave trains with the same relative wave height at the toe of the slope their location depends on the characteristics of the wave flume and its generation system the sample space helps to identify and select the values of the main parameters h l h i l as a function of the slope m generation system breaker type χ and the relative wave height γ in contrast to battjes 1974 the dependence of the relative water depth cannot be ignored since for each value of the depth and slope different sequences of breaker types and relative wave height are obtained in addition they depend specifically among others on the slope m as can be observed the sample space is a continuum and real values of h l and h i l depend on the generation system as well as the experimental design and technique 3 fitting the function to the experimental data of van der meer 1988 this section analyzes the damage observed during wave flume experiments on the rock layer over impermeable dikes by van der meer 1988 in the experimental set the dike was constructed using the same rock type nominal diameter and relative density and n c 2 since a water depth of h 0 80 m was applied in all the tests h d and e remained constant four slopes were tested 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 which meant that there were four different datasets to fit to the corresponding function fig 2 shows van der meer s 1988 sample space for the four slopes the majority of the experimental points are located inside a hexagon with parallel sides two by two the red straight dashed lines represent the constant value of χ h l h i l the green straight dashed lines represent the constant value of γ h i h van der meer 1988 carried out the experiments experimental technique in test series ts generally a ts consisted of five complete tests cts with the same average wave period constant h l but with increasing incident significant wave heights hi the output of a test series ts generally consisted of two sets of data n w 1000 and 3000 of five pairs of values of s d corresponding to a given h l and five increasing values of h i l it consisted of a pre test sounding a test of 1000 waves an intermediate sounding a test of 2000 more waves and a final sounding after each complete test the armor layer was removed and rebuilt because of the experimental technique for each ct t 0 0 and t t m n w were the average number of waves in the test and f 2 n w therefore based on the method of dimensional analysis da for each slope m and for number of waves n w there is a functional relationship between the output s d and the alternate slope similarity parameter 9 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 χ when s d χ is selected and the log is taken on both sides eq 9 produces a linear model 10 l o g s d a m l o g χ b m χ m i n χ χ m a x a m and b m are the fit coefficients of the straight line which are specific to each of the slopes 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 and number of waves n w 1000 and 3000 table 1 shows the fit parameters and correlation coefficients for slope 1 3 n w 1000 and 3000 waves and relative water depth h l r 2 is the linear regression coefficient in appendix ia table a i gives the parameters of the straight line for the other three slopes 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 van der meer 1988 noticed the existence of a linear relation for nw 0 1000 waves by using a log transform of the sample space it is possible to anticipate the experimental results of each ct wave steepness of a ts relative depth as can be observed χ m i n and χ m a x in eq 10 define the interval of application of the equation i e the experimental interval fig 3 shows the experimental values and the best fit lines of log sd based on log χ for a slope of 1 3 and seven relative water depths after being impinged by n w 1000 and 3000 waves for each relative depth h l log s d and log χ have an approximately linear relation the data corresponding to low values of h l shallow water are located to the left of the graph where the most probable breaker types are surging or collapsing breakers the data for intermediate and deep water are located to the right of the graph where the most probable breaker types are collapsing or plunging breakers in all cases the damage level becomes greater as h i l increases in other words as the wave height increases and n s the fit lines of the two sets of number of waves slightly converge as the damage level decreases start of damage and they slightly diverge as the damage level increases destruction as can be observed practically all of the five tests with n w 1000 end with a damage level lower than that observed with n w 3000 limits χ m i n and χ m a x in eq 10 correspond to the start of damage s d 0 and a representative value of destruction s d max respectively as discussed in section 5 indeed van der meer 1988 table 3 2 indicates that s d 0 2 log 2 0 70 and s d max 12 log 12 2 5 should be considered for start of damage and destruction respectively when a static stable structure of rock is designed with slope 1 3 4 the interplay of the non dimensional independent quantities in the evolution of damage for a given number of waves the interplay of the three quantities h l and h i l and slope m is most usefully and accurately represented by graphical representations in a 2d system in terms of pairs of values while the other quantity remains constant accordingly there are three possibilities i to combine values of h l and h i l while m remains constant fig 3 ii to combine values of m and h i l while h l remains constant fig 4 or iii to combine values of m and h l while h i l remains constant fig 4 shows the log transform of the cumulative damage s d against the log transform of the slope m 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 6 for three relative water depths a h l 0 1863 b h l 0 1496 and c h l 0 0970 several values of χ h l h i l and n w 1000 waves the values of log s d were calculated by applying the linear relationship eq 12 its coefficients a m b m depend on the relative water depth and the slope and are given in table 1 for slope m 1 3 as well as in appendix i see table i a for the other three tested slopes m 1 2 1 4 1 6 for the set of milder slopes 1 6 and 1 4 as the slope steepens the damage grows with increasing wave steepness and decreasing water depths except for large values of h l and small values of h i l for the set steep slopes 1 3 and 1 2 the growth rate of the damage depends on the relative values of slope m h l and h i l however the highest damage levels are produced with small values of h l large values of wave steepness and slope m 1 3 for h l 0 1496 the worst damage always occurs with m 1 2 for h l 0 097 the worst damage depends on the wave steepness except for low wave steepness the damage generally increases as the slope and wave steepness increases the growth rate depends on the relative water depth for the same wave steepness the damage is greater as h l decreases although there is no information pertaining to m 2 3 and h l 0 095 based on other experimental data iribarren 1965 losada and giménez curto 1979 losada et al 1986 it can be generally assumed that for a given n w the growth rate of the cumulative damage is not a monotonic function of the slope and depends on the relative values of h l and h i l the effects are concomitant as described by the alternate similarity parameter χ h l h i l as shown in the following sections the singular behavior of the slope is relevant to the analysis of the performance of sloped coastal structures under oblique wave attack losada and giménez curto 1982 as can be observed the persistence of the sea states is different although the average number of waves is the same t n w t m the sea states with a larger average wave period are of longer duration losada and giménez curto 1981 obtained the relation between the failure probability when the persistence of the sea state is t hours and the failure probability when the persistence of the sea state is 1 h these results highlight the importance of sea state persistence in relation to failure probability 4 1 interplay of h l and hi l for a fixed damage level nw 1000 and slope 1 3 fig 5 shows the sample space log transform of h i l and h l of van der meer s 1988 experiments for a dike with a double armor layer and an impermeable core and slope m 1 3 the points identify the pairs of values of wave steepness and relative water depth for fixed damage levels s d 1 2 7 7 4 20 1 24 after impinging n w 1000 waves fit curves are drawn for each set of five values the values of s d are calculated by applying eq 10 coefficients a m b m are given in table 1 and also in table i a of appendix i for slopes 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 for a given value of s d and once chosen the slope m water depth h and average wave period t m then eq 11 can be used to obtain the log transform value of the wave steepness log h i l x axis fig 5 the colour bands in fig 5 are separated by lines of constant χ and determine the transition of the breaker types on the slope for slope 1 3 an estimate of the domains where each breaker type prevails is the following surging χ 0 0008 weak bore 0 0008 χ 0 0012 strong bore 0 0012 χ 0 002 and strong plunging 0 002 χ 0 01 their position and value are approximate and are based on galvin s classification as extended by moragues and losada 2021 and on van der meer 1988 4 2 the limited generated relative wave height hi h it should be highlighted that the form of the cumulative damage curves changes significantly for relative shallow water depth figs 5 and 6 unfortunately van der meer tested all the slopes with h l 0 090 and γ h i h in the interval 0 05 h i h 0 37 fig 2 however for the shallow water test series h l 0 095 the interval was even narrower 0 10 h i h 0 20 fig 5 this is a standard limitation of the wave flumes that needs to be considered and standardized so according to hughes 2004 it is uncertain how the derived formulas based on lab experiments perform for what may be the design conditions 4 3 potential design curves in function of the stability number and h l for selected damage levels fig 6 shows potential design curves n s h i δ s d n 50 versus the log transform of h l derived from van der meers 1988 experiments for a dike with a double armor layer and an impermeable core and slope m 1 3 the curves provide the value of the stability number for fixed values of the damage level s d 1 0 2 7 7 4 20 1 24 0 after impinging n w 1000 waves the input data are the incident significant wave height h i and mean wave period t m the water depth at the toe of the structure the relative density of the rock and the damage level s d for a specific value of h l water depth and mean wave period the curves provide the values of n s and thus of h s to determine the evolution of the damage level from s d 1 0 up to a value of 24 0 after impinging n w 1000 waves see fig 5 it should be underlined that the calculated incident significant wave heights are linked to the selected mean wave period t m in other words the chosen value of h l therefore the potential design curves provide a simple method of assessing the dependence of the damage level s d on the wave period the stretches of each dashed line have different slope because they were obtained from experimental data for discrete h l values 4 4 dependence of damage evolution on experimental design and technique the experimental design and technique specify the way the test series are carried out a the relationship between h l and h i l b number of waves and c when the section is rebuilt this relationship is generally one of the following see fig 5 constant h l horizontal trend constant h i l or i r vertical trend and a linear relationship between log h l and log h i l oblique trend as represented in the equation 11 y ax b where y log h l x log h i l and a and b are the slope and the independent parameter of the straight line as reflected in fig 5 the test series ts of the van der meer 1988 experiments follow lines of constant h l or to be more precise of constant period in addition the damage evolution in each complete test ct was observed after impinging n w 1000 and 2000 more waves with constant h i l once the ct finished the section was reconstructed vidal et al 2006 studied a breakwater with slope 1 2 and performed ts where the value of the iribarren number i r i e wave steepness remained constant and n w 500 for regular waves and n w 1000 for irregular waves then without rebuilding the section they gradually increased the significant wave height and wave period while i r remained constant by increasing both h i and t and maintaining the water depth constant as a result each subsequent ts had a lower relative water depth fig 7 a and b shows the damage evolution compared to log h l h i l under irregular and regular waves respectively as can be observed the damage grows as log χ decreases in other words with a constant wave steepness larger wave height and wave period and a shallow water depth constant water depth and larger wave period in the context of a different experimental design and technique the damage evolution curves of the same breakwater typology could be different van der meer rebuilt the section after ct and n w 3000 waves with h l constant vidal et al 2006 rebuilt the section after reaching the destruction of the slope with h i l constant the link between experimental design and technique data analysis and the evolution of damage depends on the interplay of the slope wave steepness relative water depth and the persistence of the sea state consequently the datasets of van der meer 1988 and of vidal et al 2006 are not homogeneous 5 sources of epistemic uncertainty of the lab based stability formulas the prediction of the damage evolution of sloped structures for coastal and harbor protection is at the core of their design and estimate of their total investment cost rom 1 1 2018 these predictions and their impact on the surrounding coastline are influenced by many uncertainties a distinction is generally made between intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty van gelder 2000 epistemic uncertainty is related to current knowledge regarding processes models observations and methods this section examines the epistemic uncertainty in the lab based stability formulas developed following the van der meer 1988 methodology the sources of uncertainty considered are the following 1 exclusion of the non dimensional parameter relative water depth h l 2 scarcity of experimental data due to the limitation of the relative wave height and 3 mixing of non homogeneous lab data to develop a new formula 5 1 exclusion of the relative water depth h l the first and most important step in dimensional analysis is to identify a complete set of independent quantities that determine the value of the dependent variable damage s d however if the analysis is based on a set that omits even one independent quantity that affects the value the dimensional analysis will give erroneous results sonin 2001 van der meer 1988 based the selection of non dimensional variables on empirical grounds and other formulas rather than on dimensional analysis the set of variables selected by van der meer 1988 namely the slope iribarren number i r stability number n s number of waves n w and the notional permeability parameter p cannot be deduced with dimensional analysis at that time following battjes 1974 the formula did not include the relative water depth fig 8 shows the damage level measured in the laboratory as compared to the damage level calculated with the formula eqs 3 23 3 24 and 3 25 in van der meer 1988 with n w 3000 waves of the rock layer over an impermeable slope 1 3 the relative water depth values are identified the formula does not account for the scatter that can be observed in the results which increases as the damage level grows this scatter depends on the interplay of relative water depth the wave steepness and slope and on the small values of the relative water depth in van der meer s experiments the majority of the trials pertain to iribarren damage there are only a few data regarding the start of damage and destruction table 3 2 of van der meer 1988 shows that it would be wise to consider s d 0 2 and s d max 12 in the design of a statically stable rock structure with a slope 1 3 this information makes it possible to design and calculate a rock layer over an impermeable dike with a slope m so that it can withstand a given sea state and undergo damage within the interval s d 0 s d s d max 5 2 scarcity of experimental data in shallow water with large values of h i h and possible consequences this prudent interval of application is further motivated because of the experimental limitations of the wave flumes to generate non breaking shallow water wave trains arriving at the toe of the slope with h i h 0 14 the following example should clarify the problem the objective was to calculate the damage to an impermeable rock slope d n50 0 6 m δ s 1 63 with a slope angle 1 3 and water depth at the toe h 6 m for a sea state with incident significant wave height h i 2 m and wave period t m 8 3 s at the toe of the slope and n w 1000 waves impinging on the structure the dimensionless parameters of the design are h l 0 1001 h i l 0 0333 χ 0 0033 and γ 0 3333 as can be observed fig 2 log h l 2 3 and log h i l 3 4 this sea state was not tested by van der meer 1988 the available experimental data are in the interval shown in fig 3 and eq 10 0 0010 χ 0 0015 applying eq 10 for χinf χsup 0 0010 0 0016 h inf h sup 0 60 0 96 n s inf n s sup 0 62 0 98 the following damage interval s d inf s d sup 1 4 13 3 is obtained these values are very close to the experimental values the expected wave breaker types are weak and strong bore mantle destruction s d max 24 would have occurred with χ 0 0018 and γ 0 18 h i d 1 08 n s d 1 10 under strong bore wave breakers the example h l 0 1001 χ 0 0033 and γ 0 3333 is evidently outside the application range of the model and in the domain of strong plunging breakers under such conditions eq 10 is not valid and without experimental information the prediction of the damage level would be very uncertain on the other hand according to van der meer s 1987 formula his eq 11 for m 1 3 ξ z 2 44 his eq 4 and plunging breakers and a 4 1 and n s 2 08 n w 1000 then s d 10 24 see his fig 3 the formula is unable to accurately predict the damage to the structure 5 3 mixing data from different experimental designs and techniques to develop a new formula fig 9 shows the same dataset for the damage level measured in the laboratory as compared to the damage level calculated with the revised formula of etemad shahidi et al 2020 with n w 3000 waves impinging on the rock layer of an impermeable slope 1 3 the new formula is based on a large number of non homogeneous experimental datasets among others data from van der meer 1988 and vidal et al 2006 the scatter is much larger than the original van der meer formula 6 an alternate prediction method the sigmoid function following iribarren 1965 losada and giménez curto 1979 and vidal et al 2006 the damage level can be organized in three regions i start of damage s d 0 ii developing damage or iribarren damage s d iii destruction s d max as representative values of the two regions start of damage s d 0 and destruction s d max comply with the following inequality 0 s d 0 s d s d max see herrera et al 2017 for further details therefore start of damage s d 0 and destruction s d max are specific to the response of a certain dike breakwater typology and should depend on the nature of the dike rom 0 0 2002 furthermore they should play an important role in the optimization of dike design and total cost during the dike s useful life pianc 2016 rom 1 1 2018 there are two reasons for this the first reason is that the dike s design should consider the shape of the transitions between the three regions and the subsequent influence of the change of wave breaker type the second reason is that the scope of the dike breakwater design should be widened so that it includes the role that such transitions play in the organization of the total project in its useful life this pertains to the processes resources repair strategies elaboration of decision trees and finally the analysis of the profitability and risk level of the investment this knowledge is essential to optimize economically and environmentally the design of the coastal structure in view of the predicted sea level rise in the present and in future years accordingly this study proposes as a first stage the sigmoid function which incorporates representative values of the start of damage and destruction regions s d 0 s d max the application of the sigmoid function to model the evolution of damage in a slope has a theoretical justification churchill and usagi 1972 this function has often been used in other engineering fields and has been successfully applied to quantify the hydrodynamic performance of sloped impermeable structures and mound breakwaters vílchez et al 2016 díaz carrasco et al 2020 moragues et al 2020 it should be useful in their experimental design and also improve the experimental technique and tools used in this research the function was slightly modified to model s d s d max the ratio between the observed damage and the representative damage of the destruction region 12 s d s d m a x 1 1 l o g χ a χ γ χ 0 s d 0 s d m a x s d s d m a x 1 where γ χ is a blending coefficient that describes a uniform transition between the limit values of the maximum and minimum level of damage s d 0 s d max and a χ is the inflection point of the sigmoid curve which is specific to each slope angle m and relative water depth h l consequently the sigmoid curve determines the interval of log χ i e h i l in which the damage level evolves from the start of damage s d 0 to destruction s d max the parameters of the sigmoid in eq 12 γ χ a χ for slope 1 3 with 95 confidence bounds for n w 1000 and 3000 waves are given in appendix ib start of damage s d 0 is characterized by the random behavior of its values between zero damage and an upper bound on average s d 0 slowly evolves with log χ in the start of damage region until a threshold is reached after which the evolution rapidly increases for moderate increases of log χ i e increases of h i or n s the threshold value for each slope more or less corresponds to the value given in table 3 2 in van der meer 1988 the advantage of this definition of damage is that it does not depend on the length of the slope van der meer 1987 it is then shown that the wave steepness values h i l h i or n s that are required to reach this threshold also depend on the relative water depth h l a representative value of the destruction region depends on the availability of materials to develop an s profile and on the type of wave breaking this influences the evolution of damage in the destruction region as described and analyzed by iribarren 1965 ahrens 1989 torum 1998 losada et al 1986 melby and kobayashi 1999 kobayashi et al 2010 and kobayashi et al 2013 fig 10 represents the quotient sd s d max which varies in the interval 0 1 depending on log χ a n w 1000 waves b n w 3000 waves and slope 1 3 s d s d max represents the damage rate that is exceeded when log χ is greater than a certain value in addition this quotient quantifies the proportion of the number of stones displaced in relation to those displaced in the destruction of the breakwater once the relative depth is selected the graph could represent the proportion of the destruction of the main layer depending on h i or the stability number the sigmoid function replicates the output results of each ts h l constant measured in a slope m impinged by an average number of waves n w however to capture the damage evolution of both the upper and lower tails of the sigmoid function based on lab experiments the experimental design and technique must be significantly improved this is a major challenge for maritime engineering 7 the challenge of maritime engineering as previously mentioned the objective of this paper was to stimulate innovative research to improve the design tools based on knowledge of the performance of coastal structures under wind wave and long wave actions the overall performance of revetments dikes and mound breakwaters depends on the kinematic and dynamic regimes as well as on the incident wave transformation when the wave train interacts with the structure its quantification should thus take into account the following three laws 1 the energy conservation law used to estimate the energy transformation in the wave structure interaction 2 the mass conservation law applicable to the calculation of run up run down and overtopping and 3 the momentum conservation law used to calculate the forces and momentums on the armor units of the maritime structure rom 0 0 2002 rom 1 1 2018 in his seminal paper battjes 1974 proposed using the iribarren number to characterize a number of surf variables namely breaker type wave energy transformation and flow characteristics ahrens and mccartney 1975 and bruun and günbak 1977 added the k d factor of armor stability to this list furthermore benedicto et al 2004 experimentally showed the connection between damage progression and the evolution of the wave energy transformation on the slope vilchez et al 2017 experimentally showed that for narrow banded incident wave trains the probability density function of the total wave height on a sloping structure evolves from a rayleigh distribution to a weibull bi parametric distribution depending on the energy dissipation by wave breaking and friction in the porous medium these references are among those in consonance with battjes s proposal but which are applied to sloping structures that spatiotemporally evolve depending on wave structure interaction the connection between the performance of the three sets of variables describing the three laws still hold but now include the dependence on relative water depth as shown by moragues et al 2020 for breaker types díaz carrasco et al 2020 for wave energy transformation and this research for damage progression on the other hand and in line with the major recommendations and technical criteria used throughout the world the project design of a coastal structure should address the verification of the different failure modes that can affect its stability nowadays this verification is usually performed under the assumption that failure modes are independent folgueras et al 2018 showed the design limitations imposed by this hypothesis rom 1 1 2018 describes a project design methodology based on the progression of damage and concomitant failure modes that could trigger other failure modes it is also based on the decision regarding when to repair the structure to avoid its collapse a new challenge for maritime and coastal engineering is to improve the current state of the art and to develop new design tools based on the knowledge of the integrated performance of coastal structures which would lead to a more integral and unified methodology from this perspective physical experiments on coastal structures should provide a multivariate response even though some of them are not functions of the same set of dimensionless factors all of them are correlated this research shows the power of the method of dimensional analysis da whose validity was established by the buckingham π theorem for univariate responses in the early 20th century eck et al 2020 extended the theorem to the multivariate case and developed basic criteria for the multivariate design of da nevertheless to prevent the failure of the da model e g the omission of a key explanatory variable certain precautions should be taken such as the robust da design approach albrecht et al 2013 moreover the statistical analysis of the data should be strengthened by the previous formalization of the da in the form of regression analysis latent errors in covariates and robustness shen et al 2014 and the verification of the homogeneity of the data set moreover the statistical invariance principle recognizes that the outcome of a physical experiment should be the same if the measurement scale were transformed thus the potential relationship between the π theorem and statistical invariance put the theorem in a stochastic framework to quantify uncertainties in deterministic physical models lee and zidek 2020 8 conclusions revetments dikes and mound breakwaters are three of the most common coastal and harbor structures because of their ability to break and or dissipate wave energy and also because a wide variety of materials and armor unit sizes can be used in their construction their hydrodynamic performance and damage evolution depend on the kinematic and dynamic incident wave transformation regimes which occur when the waves interact with the structure for many years now a wide variety of alternatives for the protection adaptation and mitigation of the coastline in the face of global warming have been formulated this challenge necessarily involves quantifying the resilience of structures along with their intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty in practical coastal engineering the design and stability of rock armored dikes and breakwaters are verified by applying empirical formulas currently most of these stability formulas have the formal structure of the van der meer formula the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the damage evolution of sloped coastal structures by applying dimensional analysis da to evaluate its dependence on the experimental design and technique as an example this analysis focused on a dike with a two diameter thick rock layer over an impermeable core under non breaking conditions before the waves reached the structure the adequacy of the derived functional relationship was verified with the same experimental data rock layer over impermeable dikes under irregular waves originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula the main conclusions derived from this research are the following 1 the re analysis of van der meer s experimental data reveals that the interplay of m h l and h i l is a complex process the effects of relative water depth and wave steepness on the evolution of damage are concomitant and complementary and should not be analyzed separately 2 for each of the four dike slopes tested by van der meer 1988 there is a functional relationship between the output damage s d and the input determined by an alternate slope similarity parameter and the number of incident waves n w this relationship is specific for each slope and furthermore depends on the experimental design and technique 3 for the shallow water test series h l 0 095 the tested interval by van der meer was 0 10 h i h 0 20 the progression of damage might change significantly for relative shallow water depth and large values of the relative wave height at the toe of the slope 4 the sigmoid function is proposed as an alternate prediction method to capture the damage evolution of both the lower tail initiation of damage and upper tail destruction of the function the experimental design and technique must be significantly improved 5 given the current state of knowledge it is uncertain how stability formulas derived from lab experiments perform for what may be the design condition this is a major challenge for maritime engineering one of the main aims of this study was to stimulate innovative research that would ultimately improve and enhance the knowledge and design of tools for revetments dikes and breakwaters however to advance further in this direction and extend this new model to permeable core typologies new tests series are necessary evidently the research presented in this paper does not have sufficient scope to replace van der meer type formulas nonetheless one of its evident merits is that it reveals an innovative paradigm for the experimental and technical design of coastal structures which could be further discussed at the coastlab international coastal engineering or coastal structures conferences with a view to coordinating and furthering scientific and technical advancement only in this way can the major challenges to modern coastal engineering today be satisfactorily addressed credit authorship contribution statement miguel á losada

20172,the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the progression of damage to sloped coastal structures such as revetments dikes and mound breakwaters by applying dimensional analysis the adequacy of the derived functional relationship was verified with the same experimental data rock layer over impermeable dikes under irregular waves and four dike slopes originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula the method addresses the epistemic uncertainty of the damage evolution model and its dependence on the experimental design and technique the non dimensional incident sea state characteristics at the foot of the slope relative water depth relative wave height wave steepness sea state persistence and number of waves it is specific to each dike slope specifically the scarcity of experimental data in shallow water conditions are considered accordingly the sigmoid function is proposed as an alternate model to quantify the progression in the current state of knowledge it is uncertain how the formulas based on lab experiments perform for real world design conditions more research in the form of further test series is thus necessary to explore this new approach in greater depth keywords sloping coastal structures dimensional analysis damage evolution experimental design 1 introduction forty per cent of the world s population lives near the coast and many of the world s major cities are directly located on the seashore spain alone has a coastline of over 8000 km roughly half of which is occupied by human activities global warming and one of its main effects rising sea levels call this territorial model into question in the last several years various alternatives for coastal protection adaptation and mitigation have been proposed the challenge of protecting the coast from the effects of global warming necessarily involves quantifying the resilience of structures as well as their intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty these new demands ask for new coastal and ocean engineering philosophy regarding the socioeconomic and environmental impact of human interventions baquerizo and losada 2008 losada et al 2009 revetments dikes and mound breakwaters are the most common type of sloped coastal structures because of their ability to break and or dissipate wave energy they can also be constructed with different materials and their armor units can be of different shapes and sizes their design construction and management are a major investment which extends over successive phases throughout their life cycle since during their useful life their state and conditions may change the effects of the intrinsic uncertainty e g due to wave climate variability were significant when computing the damage level in the middle of the 20th century nowadays the quantification of epistemic uncertainty kroon et al 2020 namely the uncertainty introduced by the model of damage progression s d of the principal failure modes whether correlated or independent is a major knowledge deficit in the optimization of coastal structures lira loarca et al 2019 rom 1 1 2018 to effectively determine uncertainty and thus estimate the total investment cost rom 1 1 2018 it is necessary to have predictive models of the hydrodynamic and structural behavior of the works over the useful life of the project in practical coastal engineering the stability of the slope of rock armored mound breakwaters is usually verified by applying laboratory based empirical formulas the earliest formula by iribarren and nogales 1949 and the reductionist simplified version of hudson 1959 were modified after the publication of battjes 1974 on the surf similarity parameter currently most of the formulas used to verify the stability of the armor units of the main layer are formally like the van der meer 1988 formula which is based on a significant number of experiments in a wave flume with different typologies van der meer concluded that the stability of rubble mound revetments and breakwaters can be described by the following dimensionless variables h s d n 50 δ s ξ m cot α s d n w p and proposed a formula for plunging waves and another for surging waves in consonance with the state of the art the formula did not include the relative water depth h l n s h s d n 50 δ s is the stability number hudson 1959 α is the slope angle and ξ m o ir i r tan α h s l is the iribarren number iribarren and nogales 1949 d n50 is the nominal diameter of the rock layer defined by d n50 m 50 ρ s 1 3 where m 50 is the average stone mass which is 50 of the value on the mass distribution curve δ s ρ s ρ w 1 is the relative mass density and ρ s ρ w are the mass density of the rock and water respectively according to van der meer 1987 s d a e d n 50 2 is the dimensionless damage and a e is the eroded cross sectional area of the profile a physical description of s d is the number of cubic stones with a side of d n50 eroded within a width of one d n50 h s and l are the incident significant wave height and wavelength respectively at the toe of the slope n w is the number of waves in the sea state and p is a notional permeability parameter van der meer 1988 it can be applied not only to calculate the stability number n s based on the damage level s d but also to calculate s d based on n s despite its widespread use the van der meer formula is subject to a permanent process of experimental revision most of these revisions are only refinements of the statistical wave descriptors used recently etemad shahidi et al 2020 eliminated p and included a permeability coefficient c p basically all of the revised formulas have the same formal structure and almost the same non dimensional variables it is surprising that in the last 40 years few researchers have considered the effect of the relative water depth at the toe of the slope on the progression of damage under non breaking conditions before the waves reached the structure melby and hughes 2004 derived a stability formula based on the maximum wave momentum flux hughes 2004 and concluded that when the water depth was incorporated a better description of stability surging and plunging breaker types was obtained furthermore as noted by ahrens et al 1993 and recovering the concerns of hughes 2004 there are few laboratory data for shallow water conditions of near depth limited breaking relative to water depth at the structure toe so it can be concluded that there is no certainty about the performance of laboratory based wave stability formulas for what may be the design condition for coastal protection under global warming the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the progression or spatio temporal evolution of the damage to sloped coastal structures such as revetments dikes and mound breakwaters this method was applied to a two diameter thick rock layer placed on an impermeable core and four dike slopes and verified with the same experimental data originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula this method addresses some open questions related to the design of coastal protection with laboratory based formulas that have an impact on uncertainty and total cost investment in regard to the following 1 the role of the relative water depth h l on the damage evolution s d and its interplay with the slope m and wave steepness h i l 2 the dependence of the damage evolution s d including the initiation of damage and destruction on the experimental design and technique 3 the performance of laboratory based wave stability formulas for what may be the design condition the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the generalized buckingham s π theorem sonin 2001 is applied to obtain a function that relates the damage level and its spatiotemporal evolution to the characteristics of the wave train section 3 explores the form of the function and verifies it against the experimental data of van der meer 1988 section 4 analyzes the interplay of the slope and the characteristics of the incident wave train on the progression of damage including the generated value of the relative wave height h i h in section 5 the sources of epistemic uncertainty are discussed section 6 proposes as an alternate model the sigmoid function this is followed in section 7 by a brief discussion of the challenges of maritime engineering and physical experiments the paper ends with a summary of the most important conclusions that can be derived from this research the two appendixes show the fit and correlation coefficients specific for each tested slope 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 which were obtained for the linear relationship eq 10 also included is the sigmoid function eq 12 2 reformulation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the damage to a sloping coastal structure the structure used to test the methodology presented in this study is a sloping non overtopped dike composed of an impermeable core and a main layer of rock rubble in this dike α is the angle of the seaward slope the independent variables governing the evolution of the main layer are

variables it was necessary to adopt certain simplifications which did not alter the generality of the results obtained horizontal bottom β b 0 normal incidence θ 0 and single peak wave spectrum since the slope of the dike m is dimensionless it is not included in the complete set of independent variables but is regarded as a previously specified geometric characteristic of the structure such as the type and shape of the armor unit the temporal evolution of the main armor layer is quantified by a e the eroded cross sectional area of the profile it is determined by the values of the following n 11 independent quantities 1 a e f h ρ w μ g h i l d n 50 ρ s e t t m the persistence of the sea state can be unambiguously separated from the complete set of independent quantities to form the dimensionless variable t t 0 t m time t 0 is included to account for the state of the breakwater at instant t 0 and to satisfy the compatibility condition changes in the origin of times should not alter the accumulated damage value castillo et al 2012 melby and kobayashi 1998 1999 then 2 a e f 1 h ρ w μ g h i l d n 50 ρ s e f 2 t t 0 t m the function f 1 depends on the rest of the complete set

throughout the experiment once a dimensionally independent subset is chosen k f 3 d n 50 ρ s μ f 1 depends on a set of n n f k f 8 independent variables then when a reduced set is selected from an independent subset of k variables ρ w g l the non dimensional eroded cross sectional area of the profile should depend on a set of n n k nf kf 5 dimensionless variables and on the value of f 2 at the dimensionless time t t 0 t m 3 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 h l h i l ρ s ρ w d n 50 g d n 50 μ w ρ w e d n 50 f 2 t t 0 t m where s d represents the dimensionless output or the progression of the damage or cumulative damage at t t 0 t m of the experiment the third and fourth monomial in eq 3 can be combined to define a single non dimensional quantity d 4a d d n 50 g δ s d n 50 ν 4b ν μ w ρ w where d is the particle parameter first defined by madsen and grant 1976 who related it to the shields parameter in conditions of incipient sediment transport in the context of sloping breakwaters it is a suitable armor unit parameter that can be used to analyze the scale effects similar to a reynolds number and to compare the flow and stability of different types of units tested in the same conditions furthermore by dimensionalizing the thickness of the main layer with the diameter of the armor unit the functional relationship eq 3 can be written as follows 5 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 h l h i l d e f 2 t t 0 t m as can be observed the thickness of the main armor layer e is determined based on the nominal size of unit d n50 and on the shape factor of unit k p and the number of layers n c gómez martín

structure of the equation for the cumulative damage in a sea state and a storm sequence of sea states in addition bridgman s principle of absolute significance holds for the cumulative damage sd a physical quantity it thus has a monomial formula functional relationship if it is in the form of a specific power law díaz carrasco et al 2020 clavero et al 2020 and moragues and losada 2021 showed that the product of the relative water depth and wave steepness at the toe of the dike χ h l h i l is an alternative similarity parameter to the iribarren number and can be used to quantify the wave breaker type flow characteristics and wave energy transformation on the slope for this reason a monomial formula with the same power law form obtained was chosen to describe the cumulative damage of the rock layer over impermeable dikes 8 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 χ f 2 t t 0 t m this signifies that the results are dimensionally homogeneous and intuitively interpretable the π theorem does not provide the form of the functional relationship this form can only be obtained by physical or numerical experimentation or by theoretically solving the problem sonin 2001 in this study the choice of functions f 1 2 is based on data shen et al 2014 which depend on the experimental design and technique more specifically these are the following i slope of the dike ii sample space defining sequences of subsequent sea state pairs h l h i l and their persistence or number of waves n w and iii the criteria determining the sounding strategy of the cumulative damage once the test is finished and the section is rebuilt accordingly f 1 2 were then selected to model van der meer s experimental output 2 1 graphical representation of the experimental design and sample space the sample space fig 2 is the geometric locus of the experimental points defined by their coordinates wave steepness and relative water depth from a geometric perspective the limit values of h l and hi l in the wave flume are determined by the water depth at the toe of the dike h and slope m and if applicable the characteristics of the mantle and core which are the sides of the quadrilateral the log transformation of the relative water depth h l and wave steepness h i l was applied for the sake of completeness the figure includes the maximum wave steepness of a regular progressive wave train propagating in a constant water depth as calculated with miche s 1944 equation each line χ h i l h l is the geometric location of wave trains of the same breaker type moragues and losada 2021 their location depends on and is specific to the slope gradient and the characteristics of the dike moreover each line γ h i l h l h i h is the geometric location of wave trains with the same relative wave height at the toe of the slope their location depends on the characteristics of the wave flume and its generation system the sample space helps to identify and select the values of the main parameters h l h i l as a function of the slope m generation system breaker type χ and the relative wave height γ in contrast to battjes 1974 the dependence of the relative water depth cannot be ignored since for each value of the depth and slope different sequences of breaker types and relative wave height are obtained in addition they depend specifically among others on the slope m as can be observed the sample space is a continuum and real values of h l and h i l depend on the generation system as well as the experimental design and technique 3 fitting the function to the experimental data of van der meer 1988 this section analyzes the damage observed during wave flume experiments on the rock layer over impermeable dikes by van der meer 1988 in the experimental set the dike was constructed using the same rock type nominal diameter and relative density and n c 2 since a water depth of h 0 80 m was applied in all the tests h d and e remained constant four slopes were tested 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 which meant that there were four different datasets to fit to the corresponding function fig 2 shows van der meer s 1988 sample space for the four slopes the majority of the experimental points are located inside a hexagon with parallel sides two by two the red straight dashed lines represent the constant value of χ h l h i l the green straight dashed lines represent the constant value of γ h i h van der meer 1988 carried out the experiments experimental technique in test series ts generally a ts consisted of five complete tests cts with the same average wave period constant h l but with increasing incident significant wave heights hi the output of a test series ts generally consisted of two sets of data n w 1000 and 3000 of five pairs of values of s d corresponding to a given h l and five increasing values of h i l it consisted of a pre test sounding a test of 1000 waves an intermediate sounding a test of 2000 more waves and a final sounding after each complete test the armor layer was removed and rebuilt because of the experimental technique for each ct t 0 0 and t t m n w were the average number of waves in the test and f 2 n w therefore based on the method of dimensional analysis da for each slope m and for number of waves n w there is a functional relationship between the output s d and the alternate slope similarity parameter 9 s d a e d n 50 2 f 1 χ when s d χ is selected and the log is taken on both sides eq 9 produces a linear model 10 l o g s d a m l o g χ b m χ m i n χ χ m a x a m and b m are the fit coefficients of the straight line which are specific to each of the slopes 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 6 and number of waves n w 1000 and 3000 table 1 shows the fit parameters and correlation coefficients for slope 1 3 n w 1000 and 3000 waves and relative water depth h l r 2 is the linear regression coefficient in appendix ia table a i gives the parameters of the straight line for the other three slopes 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 van der meer 1988 noticed the existence of a linear relation for nw 0 1000 waves by using a log transform of the sample space it is possible to anticipate the experimental results of each ct wave steepness of a ts relative depth as can be observed χ m i n and χ m a x in eq 10 define the interval of application of the equation i e the experimental interval fig 3 shows the experimental values and the best fit lines of log sd based on log χ for a slope of 1 3 and seven relative water depths after being impinged by n w 1000 and 3000 waves for each relative depth h l log s d and log χ have an approximately linear relation the data corresponding to low values of h l shallow water are located to the left of the graph where the most probable breaker types are surging or collapsing breakers the data for intermediate and deep water are located to the right of the graph where the most probable breaker types are collapsing or plunging breakers in all cases the damage level becomes greater as h i l increases in other words as the wave height increases and n s the fit lines of the two sets of number of waves slightly converge as the damage level decreases start of damage and they slightly diverge as the damage level increases destruction as can be observed practically all of the five tests with n w 1000 end with a damage level lower than that observed with n w 3000 limits χ m i n and χ m a x in eq 10 correspond to the start of damage s d 0 and a representative value of destruction s d max respectively as discussed in section 5 indeed van der meer 1988 table 3 2 indicates that s d 0 2 log 2 0 70 and s d max 12 log 12 2 5 should be considered for start of damage and destruction respectively when a static stable structure of rock is designed with slope 1 3 4 the interplay of the non dimensional independent quantities in the evolution of damage for a given number of waves the interplay of the three quantities h l and h i l and slope m is most usefully and accurately represented by graphical representations in a 2d system in terms of pairs of values while the other quantity remains constant accordingly there are three possibilities i to combine values of h l and h i l while m remains constant fig 3 ii to combine values of m and h i l while h l remains constant fig 4 or iii to combine values of m and h l while h i l remains constant fig 4 shows the log transform of the cumulative damage s d against the log transform of the slope m 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 6 for three relative water depths a h l 0 1863 b h l 0 1496 and c h l 0 0970 several values of χ h l h i l and n w 1000 waves the values of log s d were calculated by applying the linear relationship eq 12 its coefficients a m b m depend on the relative water depth and the slope and are given in table 1 for slope m 1 3 as well as in appendix i see table i a for the other three tested slopes m 1 2 1 4 1 6 for the set of milder slopes 1 6 and 1 4 as the slope steepens the damage grows with increasing wave steepness and decreasing water depths except for large values of h l and small values of h i l for the set steep slopes 1 3 and 1 2 the growth rate of the damage depends on the relative values of slope m h l and h i l however the highest damage levels are produced with small values of h l large values of wave steepness and slope m 1 3 for h l 0 1496 the worst damage always occurs with m 1 2 for h l 0 097 the worst damage depends on the wave steepness except for low wave steepness the damage generally increases as the slope and wave steepness increases the growth rate depends on the relative water depth for the same wave steepness the damage is greater as h l decreases although there is no information pertaining to m 2 3 and h l 0 095 based on other experimental data iribarren 1965 losada and giménez curto 1979 losada et al 1986 it can be generally assumed that for a given n w the growth rate of the cumulative damage is not a monotonic function of the slope and depends on the relative values of h l and h i l the effects are concomitant as described by the alternate similarity parameter χ h l h i l as shown in the following sections the singular behavior of the slope is relevant to the analysis of the performance of sloped coastal structures under oblique wave attack losada and giménez curto 1982 as can be observed the persistence of the sea states is different although the average number of waves is the same t n w t m the sea states with a larger average wave period are of longer duration losada and giménez curto 1981 obtained the relation between the failure probability when the persistence of the sea state is t hours and the failure probability when the persistence of the sea state is 1 h these results highlight the importance of sea state persistence in relation to failure probability 4 1 interplay of h l and hi l for a fixed damage level nw 1000 and slope 1 3 fig 5 shows the sample space log transform of h i l and h l of van der meer s 1988 experiments for a dike with a double armor layer and an impermeable core and slope m 1 3 the points identify the pairs of values of wave steepness and relative water depth for fixed damage levels s d 1 2 7 7 4 20 1 24 after impinging n w 1000 waves fit curves are drawn for each set of five values the values of s d are calculated by applying eq 10 coefficients a m b m are given in table 1 and also in table i a of appendix i for slopes 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 for a given value of s d and once chosen the slope m water depth h and average wave period t m then eq 11 can be used to obtain the log transform value of the wave steepness log h i l x axis fig 5 the colour bands in fig 5 are separated by lines of constant χ and determine the transition of the breaker types on the slope for slope 1 3 an estimate of the domains where each breaker type prevails is the following surging χ 0 0008 weak bore 0 0008 χ 0 0012 strong bore 0 0012 χ 0 002 and strong plunging 0 002 χ 0 01 their position and value are approximate and are based on galvin s classification as extended by moragues and losada 2021 and on van der meer 1988 4 2 the limited generated relative wave height hi h it should be highlighted that the form of the cumulative damage curves changes significantly for relative shallow water depth figs 5 and 6 unfortunately van der meer tested all the slopes with h l 0 090 and γ h i h in the interval 0 05 h i h 0 37 fig 2 however for the shallow water test series h l 0 095 the interval was even narrower 0 10 h i h 0 20 fig 5 this is a standard limitation of the wave flumes that needs to be considered and standardized so according to hughes 2004 it is uncertain how the derived formulas based on lab experiments perform for what may be the design conditions 4 3 potential design curves in function of the stability number and h l for selected damage levels fig 6 shows potential design curves n s h i δ s d n 50 versus the log transform of h l derived from van der meers 1988 experiments for a dike with a double armor layer and an impermeable core and slope m 1 3 the curves provide the value of the stability number for fixed values of the damage level s d 1 0 2 7 7 4 20 1 24 0 after impinging n w 1000 waves the input data are the incident significant wave height h i and mean wave period t m the water depth at the toe of the structure the relative density of the rock and the damage level s d for a specific value of h l water depth and mean wave period the curves provide the values of n s and thus of h s to determine the evolution of the damage level from s d 1 0 up to a value of 24 0 after impinging n w 1000 waves see fig 5 it should be underlined that the calculated incident significant wave heights are linked to the selected mean wave period t m in other words the chosen value of h l therefore the potential design curves provide a simple method of assessing the dependence of the damage level s d on the wave period the stretches of each dashed line have different slope because they were obtained from experimental data for discrete h l values 4 4 dependence of damage evolution on experimental design and technique the experimental design and technique specify the way the test series are carried out a the relationship between h l and h i l b number of waves and c when the section is rebuilt this relationship is generally one of the following see fig 5 constant h l horizontal trend constant h i l or i r vertical trend and a linear relationship between log h l and log h i l oblique trend as represented in the equation 11 y ax b where y log h l x log h i l and a and b are the slope and the independent parameter of the straight line as reflected in fig 5 the test series ts of the van der meer 1988 experiments follow lines of constant h l or to be more precise of constant period in addition the damage evolution in each complete test ct was observed after impinging n w 1000 and 2000 more waves with constant h i l once the ct finished the section was reconstructed vidal et al 2006 studied a breakwater with slope 1 2 and performed ts where the value of the iribarren number i r i e wave steepness remained constant and n w 500 for regular waves and n w 1000 for irregular waves then without rebuilding the section they gradually increased the significant wave height and wave period while i r remained constant by increasing both h i and t and maintaining the water depth constant as a result each subsequent ts had a lower relative water depth fig 7 a and b shows the damage evolution compared to log h l h i l under irregular and regular waves respectively as can be observed the damage grows as log χ decreases in other words with a constant wave steepness larger wave height and wave period and a shallow water depth constant water depth and larger wave period in the context of a different experimental design and technique the damage evolution curves of the same breakwater typology could be different van der meer rebuilt the section after ct and n w 3000 waves with h l constant vidal et al 2006 rebuilt the section after reaching the destruction of the slope with h i l constant the link between experimental design and technique data analysis and the evolution of damage depends on the interplay of the slope wave steepness relative water depth and the persistence of the sea state consequently the datasets of van der meer 1988 and of vidal et al 2006 are not homogeneous 5 sources of epistemic uncertainty of the lab based stability formulas the prediction of the damage evolution of sloped structures for coastal and harbor protection is at the core of their design and estimate of their total investment cost rom 1 1 2018 these predictions and their impact on the surrounding coastline are influenced by many uncertainties a distinction is generally made between intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty van gelder 2000 epistemic uncertainty is related to current knowledge regarding processes models observations and methods this section examines the epistemic uncertainty in the lab based stability formulas developed following the van der meer 1988 methodology the sources of uncertainty considered are the following 1 exclusion of the non dimensional parameter relative water depth h l 2 scarcity of experimental data due to the limitation of the relative wave height and 3 mixing of non homogeneous lab data to develop a new formula 5 1 exclusion of the relative water depth h l the first and most important step in dimensional analysis is to identify a complete set of independent quantities that determine the value of the dependent variable damage s d however if the analysis is based on a set that omits even one independent quantity that affects the value the dimensional analysis will give erroneous results sonin 2001 van der meer 1988 based the selection of non dimensional variables on empirical grounds and other formulas rather than on dimensional analysis the set of variables selected by van der meer 1988 namely the slope iribarren number i r stability number n s number of waves n w and the notional permeability parameter p cannot be deduced with dimensional analysis at that time following battjes 1974 the formula did not include the relative water depth fig 8 shows the damage level measured in the laboratory as compared to the damage level calculated with the formula eqs 3 23 3 24 and 3 25 in van der meer 1988 with n w 3000 waves of the rock layer over an impermeable slope 1 3 the relative water depth values are identified the formula does not account for the scatter that can be observed in the results which increases as the damage level grows this scatter depends on the interplay of relative water depth the wave steepness and slope and on the small values of the relative water depth in van der meer s experiments the majority of the trials pertain to iribarren damage there are only a few data regarding the start of damage and destruction table 3 2 of van der meer 1988 shows that it would be wise to consider s d 0 2 and s d max 12 in the design of a statically stable rock structure with a slope 1 3 this information makes it possible to design and calculate a rock layer over an impermeable dike with a slope m so that it can withstand a given sea state and undergo damage within the interval s d 0 s d s d max 5 2 scarcity of experimental data in shallow water with large values of h i h and possible consequences this prudent interval of application is further motivated because of the experimental limitations of the wave flumes to generate non breaking shallow water wave trains arriving at the toe of the slope with h i h 0 14 the following example should clarify the problem the objective was to calculate the damage to an impermeable rock slope d n50 0 6 m δ s 1 63 with a slope angle 1 3 and water depth at the toe h 6 m for a sea state with incident significant wave height h i 2 m and wave period t m 8 3 s at the toe of the slope and n w 1000 waves impinging on the structure the dimensionless parameters of the design are h l 0 1001 h i l 0 0333 χ 0 0033 and γ 0 3333 as can be observed fig 2 log h l 2 3 and log h i l 3 4 this sea state was not tested by van der meer 1988 the available experimental data are in the interval shown in fig 3 and eq 10 0 0010 χ 0 0015 applying eq 10 for χinf χsup 0 0010 0 0016 h inf h sup 0 60 0 96 n s inf n s sup 0 62 0 98 the following damage interval s d inf s d sup 1 4 13 3 is obtained these values are very close to the experimental values the expected wave breaker types are weak and strong bore mantle destruction s d max 24 would have occurred with χ 0 0018 and γ 0 18 h i d 1 08 n s d 1 10 under strong bore wave breakers the example h l 0 1001 χ 0 0033 and γ 0 3333 is evidently outside the application range of the model and in the domain of strong plunging breakers under such conditions eq 10 is not valid and without experimental information the prediction of the damage level would be very uncertain on the other hand according to van der meer s 1987 formula his eq 11 for m 1 3 ξ z 2 44 his eq 4 and plunging breakers and a 4 1 and n s 2 08 n w 1000 then s d 10 24 see his fig 3 the formula is unable to accurately predict the damage to the structure 5 3 mixing data from different experimental designs and techniques to develop a new formula fig 9 shows the same dataset for the damage level measured in the laboratory as compared to the damage level calculated with the revised formula of etemad shahidi et al 2020 with n w 3000 waves impinging on the rock layer of an impermeable slope 1 3 the new formula is based on a large number of non homogeneous experimental datasets among others data from van der meer 1988 and vidal et al 2006 the scatter is much larger than the original van der meer formula 6 an alternate prediction method the sigmoid function following iribarren 1965 losada and giménez curto 1979 and vidal et al 2006 the damage level can be organized in three regions i start of damage s d 0 ii developing damage or iribarren damage s d iii destruction s d max as representative values of the two regions start of damage s d 0 and destruction s d max comply with the following inequality 0 s d 0 s d s d max see herrera et al 2017 for further details therefore start of damage s d 0 and destruction s d max are specific to the response of a certain dike breakwater typology and should depend on the nature of the dike rom 0 0 2002 furthermore they should play an important role in the optimization of dike design and total cost during the dike s useful life pianc 2016 rom 1 1 2018 there are two reasons for this the first reason is that the dike s design should consider the shape of the transitions between the three regions and the subsequent influence of the change of wave breaker type the second reason is that the scope of the dike breakwater design should be widened so that it includes the role that such transitions play in the organization of the total project in its useful life this pertains to the processes resources repair strategies elaboration of decision trees and finally the analysis of the profitability and risk level of the investment this knowledge is essential to optimize economically and environmentally the design of the coastal structure in view of the predicted sea level rise in the present and in future years accordingly this study proposes as a first stage the sigmoid function which incorporates representative values of the start of damage and destruction regions s d 0 s d max the application of the sigmoid function to model the evolution of damage in a slope has a theoretical justification churchill and usagi 1972 this function has often been used in other engineering fields and has been successfully applied to quantify the hydrodynamic performance of sloped impermeable structures and mound breakwaters vílchez et al 2016 díaz carrasco et al 2020 moragues et al 2020 it should be useful in their experimental design and also improve the experimental technique and tools used in this research the function was slightly modified to model s d s d max the ratio between the observed damage and the representative damage of the destruction region 12 s d s d m a x 1 1 l o g χ a χ γ χ 0 s d 0 s d m a x s d s d m a x 1 where γ χ is a blending coefficient that describes a uniform transition between the limit values of the maximum and minimum level of damage s d 0 s d max and a χ is the inflection point of the sigmoid curve which is specific to each slope angle m and relative water depth h l consequently the sigmoid curve determines the interval of log χ i e h i l in which the damage level evolves from the start of damage s d 0 to destruction s d max the parameters of the sigmoid in eq 12 γ χ a χ for slope 1 3 with 95 confidence bounds for n w 1000 and 3000 waves are given in appendix ib start of damage s d 0 is characterized by the random behavior of its values between zero damage and an upper bound on average s d 0 slowly evolves with log χ in the start of damage region until a threshold is reached after which the evolution rapidly increases for moderate increases of log χ i e increases of h i or n s the threshold value for each slope more or less corresponds to the value given in table 3 2 in van der meer 1988 the advantage of this definition of damage is that it does not depend on the length of the slope van der meer 1987 it is then shown that the wave steepness values h i l h i or n s that are required to reach this threshold also depend on the relative water depth h l a representative value of the destruction region depends on the availability of materials to develop an s profile and on the type of wave breaking this influences the evolution of damage in the destruction region as described and analyzed by iribarren 1965 ahrens 1989 torum 1998 losada et al 1986 melby and kobayashi 1999 kobayashi et al 2010 and kobayashi et al 2013 fig 10 represents the quotient sd s d max which varies in the interval 0 1 depending on log χ a n w 1000 waves b n w 3000 waves and slope 1 3 s d s d max represents the damage rate that is exceeded when log χ is greater than a certain value in addition this quotient quantifies the proportion of the number of stones displaced in relation to those displaced in the destruction of the breakwater once the relative depth is selected the graph could represent the proportion of the destruction of the main layer depending on h i or the stability number the sigmoid function replicates the output results of each ts h l constant measured in a slope m impinged by an average number of waves n w however to capture the damage evolution of both the upper and lower tails of the sigmoid function based on lab experiments the experimental design and technique must be significantly improved this is a major challenge for maritime engineering 7 the challenge of maritime engineering as previously mentioned the objective of this paper was to stimulate innovative research to improve the design tools based on knowledge of the performance of coastal structures under wind wave and long wave actions the overall performance of revetments dikes and mound breakwaters depends on the kinematic and dynamic regimes as well as on the incident wave transformation when the wave train interacts with the structure its quantification should thus take into account the following three laws 1 the energy conservation law used to estimate the energy transformation in the wave structure interaction 2 the mass conservation law applicable to the calculation of run up run down and overtopping and 3 the momentum conservation law used to calculate the forces and momentums on the armor units of the maritime structure rom 0 0 2002 rom 1 1 2018 in his seminal paper battjes 1974 proposed using the iribarren number to characterize a number of surf variables namely breaker type wave energy transformation and flow characteristics ahrens and mccartney 1975 and bruun and günbak 1977 added the k d factor of armor stability to this list furthermore benedicto et al 2004 experimentally showed the connection between damage progression and the evolution of the wave energy transformation on the slope vilchez et al 2017 experimentally showed that for narrow banded incident wave trains the probability density function of the total wave height on a sloping structure evolves from a rayleigh distribution to a weibull bi parametric distribution depending on the energy dissipation by wave breaking and friction in the porous medium these references are among those in consonance with battjes s proposal but which are applied to sloping structures that spatiotemporally evolve depending on wave structure interaction the connection between the performance of the three sets of variables describing the three laws still hold but now include the dependence on relative water depth as shown by moragues et al 2020 for breaker types díaz carrasco et al 2020 for wave energy transformation and this research for damage progression on the other hand and in line with the major recommendations and technical criteria used throughout the world the project design of a coastal structure should address the verification of the different failure modes that can affect its stability nowadays this verification is usually performed under the assumption that failure modes are independent folgueras et al 2018 showed the design limitations imposed by this hypothesis rom 1 1 2018 describes a project design methodology based on the progression of damage and concomitant failure modes that could trigger other failure modes it is also based on the decision regarding when to repair the structure to avoid its collapse a new challenge for maritime and coastal engineering is to improve the current state of the art and to develop new design tools based on the knowledge of the integrated performance of coastal structures which would lead to a more integral and unified methodology from this perspective physical experiments on coastal structures should provide a multivariate response even though some of them are not functions of the same set of dimensionless factors all of them are correlated this research shows the power of the method of dimensional analysis da whose validity was established by the buckingham π theorem for univariate responses in the early 20th century eck et al 2020 extended the theorem to the multivariate case and developed basic criteria for the multivariate design of da nevertheless to prevent the failure of the da model e g the omission of a key explanatory variable certain precautions should be taken such as the robust da design approach albrecht et al 2013 moreover the statistical analysis of the data should be strengthened by the previous formalization of the da in the form of regression analysis latent errors in covariates and robustness shen et al 2014 and the verification of the homogeneity of the data set moreover the statistical invariance principle recognizes that the outcome of a physical experiment should be the same if the measurement scale were transformed thus the potential relationship between the π theorem and statistical invariance put the theorem in a stochastic framework to quantify uncertainties in deterministic physical models lee and zidek 2020 8 conclusions revetments dikes and mound breakwaters are three of the most common coastal and harbor structures because of their ability to break and or dissipate wave energy and also because a wide variety of materials and armor unit sizes can be used in their construction their hydrodynamic performance and damage evolution depend on the kinematic and dynamic incident wave transformation regimes which occur when the waves interact with the structure for many years now a wide variety of alternatives for the protection adaptation and mitigation of the coastline in the face of global warming have been formulated this challenge necessarily involves quantifying the resilience of structures along with their intrinsic and epistemic uncertainty in practical coastal engineering the design and stability of rock armored dikes and breakwaters are verified by applying empirical formulas currently most of these stability formulas have the formal structure of the van der meer formula the objective of this research was to develop a new methodology to assess the damage evolution of sloped coastal structures by applying dimensional analysis da to evaluate its dependence on the experimental design and technique as an example this analysis focused on a dike with a two diameter thick rock layer over an impermeable core under non breaking conditions before the waves reached the structure the adequacy of the derived functional relationship was verified with the same experimental data rock layer over impermeable dikes under irregular waves originally used to obtain the van de meer stability formula the main conclusions derived from this research are the following 1 the re analysis of van der meer s experimental data reveals that the interplay of m h l and h i l is a complex process the effects of relative water depth and wave steepness on the evolution of damage are concomitant and complementary and should not be analyzed separately 2 for each of the four dike slopes tested by van der meer 1988 there is a functional relationship between the output damage s d and the input determined by an alternate slope similarity parameter and the number of incident waves n w this relationship is specific for each slope and furthermore depends on the experimental design and technique 3 for the shallow water test series h l 0 095 the tested interval by van der meer was 0 10 h i h 0 20 the progression of damage might change significantly for relative shallow water depth and large values of the relative wave height at the toe of the slope 4 the sigmoid function is proposed as an alternate prediction method to capture the damage evolution of both the lower tail initiation of damage and upper tail destruction of the function the experimental design and technique must be significantly improved 5 given the current state of knowledge it is uncertain how stability formulas derived from lab experiments perform for what may be the design condition this is a major challenge for maritime engineering one of the main aims of this study was to stimulate innovative research that would ultimately improve and enhance the knowledge and design of tools for revetments dikes and breakwaters however to advance further in this direction and extend this new model to permeable core typologies new tests series are necessary evidently the research presented in this paper does not have sufficient scope to replace van der meer type formulas nonetheless one of its evident merits is that it reveals an innovative paradigm for the experimental and technical design of coastal structures which could be further discussed at the coastlab international coastal engineering or coastal structures conferences with a view to coordinating and furthering scientific and technical advancement only in this way can the major challenges to modern coastal engineering today be satisfactorily addressed credit authorship contribution statement miguel á losada

20173,ocean wave is one of the main factors to cause the 6 degrees of freedom motion of ships accurate wave surface prediction is paramount to ship safety the artificial neural network based wave prediction ann wp model is a phase resolved wave prediction model based on artificial intelligence which can provide high precision prediction results of wave surface however it needs training with a large dataset to make the model obtain a satisfying prediction performance when unknown sea states not included in the training data appear in practice the reliability of the prediction results is low in this study the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states is investigated based on wave tank experiment the data distribution of training data set is considered as one of the factors that affects the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states based on this consideration data mixing is employed to improve the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states through this method the prediction error of the model for unknown sea states decreased by approximately 5 0 10 0 keywords phase resolved wave prediction nonlinear wave field ann wp model performance of artificial intelligence model tank experiment 1 introduction severe sea states affect ship navigation significantly the wave can act on a ship and cause it to oscillate with 6 degrees of freedom as sea states change large movements occur which threaten ship safety thus the wave prediction is necessary the traditional wave prediction method aims at forecasting wave spectrum which cannot give the time history of wave surfaces phase resolved wave prediction technology is an effective strategy to predict accurate wave surfaces since the 1990s much attention has been paid to the phase resolved wave prediction technology morris 1992 the key idea is to treat the wave elevation as both a hydrodynamic and a random signal process thus the wave elevation can be analyzed to obtain hydrodynamic propagation characteristics of the wave field by signal analysis halliday 2011 this method is a hybrid hydrodynamic signal method the prediction algorithm is mainly divided into three parts wave elevation decomposition wave propagation characteristics analysis future wave surface calculation at present fourier transform ft is a major strategy that is used to decompose wave elevation halliday 2011 on this basis nonlinear wave prediction methods have been developed using nls and hos in the wave propagation characteristics there are two choices of wave propagation velocity phase or group velocity at the initial stage the phase velocity was considered the propagation velocity of wave components calculated by fast ft fft because the purpose of phase resolved wave prediction is predicting wave elevation edgar 2000 in subsequent studies it was found that using phase velocity to predict wave elevation was more consistent with experiment results abusedra l 2011 qi 2017 started from the perspective of a similar transformation function and expanded the wave number referring to taylor expansion while trying to explain that the group velocity not the phase velocity is the propagation velocity of wave component but there were some problems in the proof process in the prediction of wave elevation the simple linear wave model gradually changes to a weakly nonlinear wave model second order stokes model and then changes to a stronger nonlinear wave model nonlinear schrödinger equation high order spectrum method the results show that nonlinear models can effectively improve the wave surface prediction accuracy especially at high sea states klein et al 2020 the hybrid hydrodynamic signal phase resolved wave model provides a feasible strategy for phase resolved wave prediction and good prediction results are obtained in experiments however there are still some problems in its basic principle first the mathematical basis of ft assumes the signal process to be linear and stationary but the actual wave is nonlinear and non stationary so there will be some inadaptability second for the wave propagation velocity problem the group velocity as the wave component propagation velocity has only been verified experimentally there is still no widely accepted theoretical explanation third in the prediction of wave surface calculation although the nonlinear model can provide high precision wave surface values its computational efficiency is markedly lower than the linear model as such affecting its real time performance because of these problems other methods have been employed to realize phase resolved wave prediction the artificial intelligence ai method is a data fitting method for strongly nonlinear and non stationary data which has unique benefits for problems that are difficult to solve using traditional physical equation methods the ai method utilizes many neurons with simple structure to build the model through data training the ai model constantly adjusts the coefficients and weights of neurons to fit the physical functions after the data training the outputs of ai are equal to the results of physical functions and the model can be used to solve complex physical problems moreover artificial intelligence has high computational efficiency rupp m et al 2012 as an essential wave characteristic the significant wave height prediction has received attention asma et al 2012 krasnopolsky et al 2002 makarynskyy et al 2004 2006 jain et al 2011 in terms of wave surface prediction some special models for wave prediction such as artificial neural network based wave prediction ann wp duan 2020 and convolutional recurrent neural network crnn fazlolah mohaghegh 2020 models have also been developed the ann wp uses artificial neural network ann to acquire the relationship between the wave time history data of a measured point and the future time data of a predicted point and establishes a prediction model crnn transforms a one dimensional wave time period to a two dimensional matrix and uses recurrent neural networks rnn with convolution structure to acquire the wave features and establish a prediction model both of these models can achieve high precision phase resolved wave prediction the most important characteristic of ai phase resolved wave prediction models is that they do not rely on the wave propagation hydrodynamic equations they use time history wave data to directly establish the relationship between historical wave elevation and future wave elevation as well as directly avoid the propagation velocity problem of the hybrid phase resolved wave model but it brings another problem ai models such as ann wp model obtain the ability of wave prediction through data training the characteristics of data determine the predicted ability of models for example if we use wave data of sea state 5 to train model we just ensure the predicted results under sea state 5 if we use this model to predict wave under sea state 6 we don t know the predicted performance of this model in here sea state 6 is unknown sea state the performance of ai based phase resolved wave predicted models under unknown sea states is an important problem affecting the engineering application of these models generally the similarity of data set is the mainly factor that influent the performance under unknown conditions kernel methods are often combined with regularization techniques in order to ensure the performance of machine learning model under unknown conditions jäkel et al 2008 this method utilizes pretreatment to improve the similarity between different data sets meanwhile both the different data set characteristics and characteristics extractive technique will affect the model performance under unknown conditions oreski 2017 in this study we focus on the ann wp model the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the ann wp model section 3 details a wave tank experiment the data obtained from the experiment are used in the subsequent section section 4 verifies the performance of the ann wp model as well as investigates its performance under unknown sea states finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 ann wp model 2 1 principle of phase resolved wave prediction the essence of the ann wp model is the wave propagation in the temporal spatial domain assuming the wave propagation is unidirectional when the wave propagates forward the downstream wave is generated by the upstream wave thus when we have finite upstream wave time data we can use the upstream wave to represent the downstream wave as eq 1 1 η n f x n η x d x where η x is the wave of location x and f x n η x is the contribution of downstream wave at location x to a certain location n if we disperse the space as in fig 1 eq 1 can represent as eq 2 the terms of left side of eq 2 are the contributions of wave at location i to location n 2 η n f 1 n η 1 f 2 n η 2 f 3 n η 3 f i n η i f n 1 n η n 1 i 1 n 1 f i n η i meanwhile if we consider only two adjacent locations i and i 1 the wave of i 1 can be represented by wave of i as eq 3 3 η i 1 f i i 1 η i where f i i 1 is the contribution of wave at location i to location i 1 consequently we can represent eq 2 as eq 4 4 η n f 1 n η 1 f 2 n η 2 f 3 n η 3 f i n η i f n 1 n η n 1 f 1 n η 1 f 2 n f 1 2 η 1 f 3 n f 2 3 f 1 2 η 1 f 1 n f 2 1 f n 1 n 2 η n 1 f η 1 based on eq 4 we can obtain the relationship between the downstream wave of a certain location n and the upstream wave of location 1 this relationship is the goal that the ann wp model obtains from the training data 2 2 numerical algorithms of the ann wp model as an effective phase resolved wave prediction method the ann wp model has been developed duan 2020 fundamentally the ann wp algorithm uses ann or called multilayer perceptron mlp which is a classic ai model a typical ann structure has three parts input hidden and output layers the input layer receives the wave data of a measured position the output layer outputs the future wave data of a predicted position the hidden layer extracts the wave propagation characteristics from the inputted wave data based on these the ann wp model establishes the relationship between a measured and predicted position fig 2 table 1 shows the ann structure which refers the previous researches law 2020 duan 2020 each layer of the ann model consists of several neurons the number of neurons in each layer is artificially set in this paper we use arithmetic sequence to set the number of neurons of each layer to consider the stability when data is transferred between different layers relu is universally used in the many models as a kind of typical activation function we use it as activation function for ann wp model neurons have two functions receiving upper level data and using a nonlinear activation function to process them when neurons receive upper level data weights will be assigned to each data to represent the impact of data from different sources for a detailed description of the ann wp model refer to previous work duan 2020 3 water tank experiment to investigate the predictive ability and performance of the ann wp model wave propagation tests were performed in a wave tank of harbin engineering university the size of the tank is 50 30 10 m3 equipped with a wave maker the experimental wave spectrum is the jonswap spectrum the peak elevation parameter was 3 3 and the scale ratio was 1 46 we developed an experiment to relate to sea states 4 7 table 2 sixteen probes were installed in a wave tank to measure the wave surface fig 3 the distance between two adjacent probes was 1 5 m the wave probes were produced by techno service type twg 600s the sampling interval is 0 05s the length of experimental wave data of each sea state is 600s then we slip the window establish the next relationship between wave data of 1 probe and n probe t0 1 t1 1 to t1 1 t2 1 if we continually slip the window we can get the data set according to these wave data we built a data set of 10000 size under each sea state the 80 of data set is used as training set the 10 is validation set the 10 is test set in this study we use the root mean square error rmse ε and non dimensional rmse ndrmse ε to evaluate the prediction results as shown in eq 5 and eq 6 respectively 5 ε n p r e η i p r e η i m e a 2 n p r e 6 ε n p r e η i p r e η i m e a 2 n p r e h s where h s is the significant height η i p r e is the predictive wave surface in moment i η i m e a is the measured wave surface in moment i and n p r e is the amount of data 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of ann wp model first the predictive ability of the ann wp model under the training sea state is verified based on the experimental data wave data of different sea states are used to train the ann wp model the trained models are used to predict the wave elevation under the training sea state fig 4 a d shows the prediction results of these models these models provide highly accurate predicted wave elevation under the training sea state they can accurately predict the large peak value of the wave surface and some subtle wave surface fluctuation features from table 3 the ndrmses are less than 6 0 and the rmses are less than 0 3 m the more details can refer in work of duan 2020 4 2 the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states here we discuss the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states first the model trained by sea state 4 is used to predict the wave elevation under sea states 5 6 and 7 fig 5 shows the results the prediction error greatly increased under sea state 5 the ndrmse increased from 5 5 to 14 1 table 4 there is an obvious deviation at the peak and the predictive ability of the high frequency components of the wave elevation significantly decreased 370 385s when the sea state rises to 6 the ndrmse increases to 19 4 one reason for the increase in error is the prediction error of the peak value another reason is that the phase of the predicted peak value has a larger deviation and some segments even have the reverse phase 375s when the sea state rises to 7 the source of the error to further increase under sea states 5 and 6 the predicted peak value deviates from the experimental data but their lengths of time are approximately equal however in sea state 7 the length of time of the predicted peak segment deviated from the experiment data the lengths of some segments were longer 360 370s while some were shorter 385 390s the model trained by sea state 5 is used to predict wave elevation under sea states 4 6 and 7 fig 6 there is a certain deviation between the predicted and experiment results under sea state 4 in the phase the prediction result is consistent with the experiment but there is a greater deviation in the amplitude the deviation in the amplitude is the main reason the rmse and ndrmse increased rapidly when the sea state rises to 6 the ndrmse of the wave elevation does not change significantly the prediction result is the same as that in sea state 4 when the sea state rises to 7 the prediction error increases to some extent but it keeps a goodness of fit in the time history table 5 the model trained by sea state 6 is used to predict the wave elevation under sea state 4 5 and 7 the prediction results are similar to those of the model trained by sea state 5 although some segments cannot give accurate prediction results under sea states 4 5 and 7 385 395s for sea state 4 380 390s for sea state 5 and 340 345s for sea state 7 the results are consistent with the experiment in phase fig 7 owing to the large deviation in amplitude the ndrmses are relatively high see table 6 the model trained by sea state 7 is used to predict wave elevation of sea state 4 5 and 6 fig 8 there is a large deviation in phase and amplitude between the prediction result and the experiment under sea state 4 in addition there is a phase inversion appearing in local areas 365s the ndrmse is 23 8 table 7 when the sea state rises to 5 prediction accuracy improves in the amplitude and phase alignment and ndrmse reduces to 19 6 the reason is that the ann wp model is an ai model and the essence is the data statistics the data distribution of sea state 5 data is closer to sea state 7 than sea state 4 thus the prediction accuracy is improved however the phase deviation still appears 380s when the sea state rises to 6 although the error increases slightly the predicted wave surface can give a high frequency characteristic of waves 375 385s and the phase error is improved to a certain extent fig 9 shows the prediction error variance of trained models with various sea states under different sea states the error significantly increases under unknown sea states when the ann wp model is trained the model obtains the wave propagation characteristics from the training data therefore the wave data characteristics determine the prediction performance of ann wp model there are many wave data characteristics such as data distribution wave spectrum directional spectrum climate pattern significant wave height wave period etc in this paper we just consider the effect of data distribution figs 10 13 are the data distribution of different sea states the distribution range of wave surface elevation and wave height gradually increases with the increase of sea states the wave surface data changes from 4 m 4 m of sea state 4 to 12 m 12 m of sea state 7 when using the model trained by sea sate 4 to predict the wave elevation under sea states 5 6 and 7 there are no large values in the training data the wave elevation with large amplitude including nonlinearity cannot be predicted correctly under higher sea states similarly for the model trained by sea state 7 owing to the wide range of wave height distributed in the training data it is easy to identify the wave elevation of a lower sea state as a small segment of the high sea state when predicting the lower sea state wave surface therefore the prediction result is larger than the experiment result the data distribution of sea state 5 and 6 is moderate which can cover a considerable part of the wave elevation distribution of lower and higher sea states therefore the models trained by the data of these two sea states have better predicted performance under other unknown sea states 4 3 prediction performance an optimized method of the ann wp model based on data mixing from the above analysis it can be found that the data distribution can affect the prediction performance under unknown sea states based on this consideration we attempt to mix the data of different sea states to optimize the performance of the ann wp model the mixing strategy is shown in table 8 the model is trained with different mixed strategies and the trained model is used to predict the wave elevation under unknown sea states as shown in figs 14 16 and tables 9 11 the prediction accuracy of the model trained with mixed sea states is significantly higher than that trained with a single sea state under unknown sea states the phenomena of inverse phase and high frequency missing significantly decreased although the amplitude deviation is still obvious the improvement of phase makes the ndrmse decrease by approximately 5 0 10 0 however the prediction accuracy of the model trained with a mixed sea state is lower than that of a single sea state under the known sea state the reason is that due to the data mixing the wave characteristics of different sea states are mixed the irrelevant information interferes ann wp model to accurately extract the characteristics of a single sea state this phenomenon shows that using mixed sea states to train the ann wp model can significantly improve the performance under unknown sea states meanwhile the prediction error is stable at approximately 15 0 under different sea states fig 17 as the sea state increases the ndrmse has a slightly downward trend when the rmse error increases the reason for this trend is the great prediction ability of nonlinear data of the ann wp model so high accurate prediction results are obtained with an increase in sea state meanwhile according to fig 17 the mixing of medium sea states seems more useful than mixing of low sea states and high sea states and further adding more wave information doesn t seem to significantly improve the predicted performance although the optimized method can improve the prediction accuracy under unknown sea states it has some improvement space and we will focus on this in future work 5 conclusion in this paper the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states is analyzed first the basic structure and calculation principle of the ann wp model are introduced then the ann wp model is verified experimentally next the model trained by a single sea state is used to predict the wave elevation under unknown sea states and we discuss the performance under different sea states finally based on the consideration that data distribution can affect the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states the data mixing is adopted to improve the prediction performance of the model under unknown sea states the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states was low the prediction error increased rapidly from less than 5 5 under known sea states to more than 15 0 under unknown sea states from the perspective of data distribution this phenomenon is analyzed although the prediction error increases under unknown sea states a trained ann wp model still has a certain prediction ability the model trained with a low sea state data can give a rough phase and amplitude of wave elevation under a higher sea state however there are some phenomena of phase misalignment and high frequency loss and the prediction error is large the model trained by high sea state can give the rough wave surface fluctuation and phase under low sea state there are also some phenomena of phase misalignment and high frequency loss and the prediction error is large the reason is that there are some similarities of wave propagation characteristics between different sea states therefore the trained models have a certain ability to predict wave elevation under unknown sea states based on the consideration that data distribution of training data set can affect the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states data mixing as an optimization method is used to improve the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states through data mixing of different sea states the prediction error has an improvement of about 10 0 under unknown sea states these results show that the data mixing can improve the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states meanwhile it is found that there is no significant difference in the prediction results of the models trained by different data mixed strategies and the error is about 15 0 under different sea states in this paper we just use data mixing to build the data sets and optimize the predicted performance under unknown sea states and don t optimize the mixing strategies through optimize the mixing strategies we think the predicted error will further decrease credit authorship contribution statement xuewen ma

model second order stokes model and then changes to a stronger nonlinear wave model nonlinear schrödinger equation high order spectrum method the results show that nonlinear models can effectively improve the wave surface prediction accuracy especially at high sea states klein et al 2020 the hybrid hydrodynamic signal phase resolved wave model provides a feasible strategy for phase resolved wave prediction and good prediction results are obtained in experiments however there are still some problems in its basic principle first the mathematical basis of ft assumes the signal process to be linear and stationary but the actual wave is nonlinear and non stationary so there will be some inadaptability second for the wave propagation velocity problem the group velocity as the wave component propagation velocity has only been verified experimentally there is still no widely accepted theoretical explanation third in the prediction of wave surface calculation although the nonlinear model can provide high precision wave surface values its computational efficiency is markedly lower than the linear model as such affecting its real time performance because of these problems other methods have been employed to realize phase resolved wave prediction the artificial intelligence ai method is a data fitting method for strongly nonlinear and non stationary data which has unique benefits for problems that are difficult to solve using traditional physical equation methods the ai method utilizes many neurons with simple structure to build the model through data training the ai model constantly adjusts the coefficients and weights of neurons to fit the physical functions after the data training the outputs of ai are equal to the results of physical functions and the model can be used to solve complex physical problems moreover artificial intelligence has high computational efficiency rupp m et al 2012 as an essential wave characteristic the significant wave height prediction has received attention asma et al 2012 krasnopolsky et al 2002 makarynskyy et al 2004 2006 jain et al 2011 in terms of wave surface prediction some special models for wave prediction such as artificial neural network based wave prediction ann wp duan 2020 and convolutional recurrent neural network crnn fazlolah mohaghegh 2020 models have also been developed the ann wp uses artificial neural network ann to acquire the relationship between the wave time history data of a measured point and the future time data of a predicted point and establishes a prediction model crnn transforms a one dimensional wave time period to a two dimensional matrix and uses recurrent neural networks rnn with convolution structure to acquire the wave features and establish a prediction model both of these models can achieve high precision phase resolved wave prediction the most important characteristic of ai phase resolved wave prediction models is that they do not rely on the wave propagation hydrodynamic equations they use time history wave data to directly establish the relationship between historical wave elevation and future wave elevation as well as directly avoid the propagation velocity problem of the hybrid phase resolved wave model but it brings another problem ai models such as ann wp model obtain the ability of wave prediction through data training the characteristics of data determine the predicted ability of models for example if we use wave data of sea state 5 to train model we just ensure the predicted results under sea state 5 if we use this model to predict wave under sea state 6 we don t know the predicted performance of this model in here sea state 6 is unknown sea state the performance of ai based phase resolved wave predicted models under unknown sea states is an important problem affecting the engineering application of these models generally the similarity of data set is the mainly factor that influent the performance under unknown conditions kernel methods are often combined with regularization techniques in order to ensure the performance of machine learning model under unknown conditions jäkel et al 2008 this method utilizes pretreatment to improve the similarity between different data sets meanwhile both the different data set characteristics and characteristics extractive technique will affect the model performance under unknown conditions oreski 2017 in this study we focus on the ann wp model the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the ann wp model section 3 details a wave tank experiment the data obtained from the experiment are used in the subsequent section section 4 verifies the performance of the ann wp model as well as investigates its performance under unknown sea states finally section 5 concludes this paper 2 ann wp model 2 1 principle of phase resolved wave prediction the essence of the ann wp model is the wave propagation in the temporal spatial domain assuming the wave propagation is unidirectional when the wave propagates forward the downstream wave is generated by the upstream wave thus when we have finite upstream wave time data we can use the upstream wave to represent the downstream wave as eq 1 1 η n f x n η x d x where η x is the wave of location x and f x n η x is the contribution of downstream wave at location x to a certain location n if we disperse the space as in fig 1 eq 1 can represent as eq 2 the terms of left side of eq 2 are the contributions of wave at location i to location n 2 η n f 1 n η 1 f 2 n η 2 f 3 n η 3 f i n η i f n 1 n η n 1 i 1 n 1 f i n η i meanwhile if we consider only two adjacent locations i and i 1 the wave of i 1 can be represented by wave of i as eq 3 3 η i 1 f i i 1 η i where f i i 1 is the contribution of wave at location i to location i 1 consequently we can represent eq 2 as eq 4 4 η n f 1 n η 1 f 2 n η 2 f 3 n η 3 f i n η i f n 1 n η n 1 f 1 n η 1 f 2 n f 1 2 η 1 f 3 n f 2 3 f 1 2 η 1 f 1 n f 2 1 f n 1 n 2 η n 1 f η 1 based on eq 4 we can obtain the relationship between the downstream wave of a certain location n and the upstream wave of location 1 this relationship is the goal that the ann wp model obtains from the training data 2 2 numerical algorithms of the ann wp model as an effective phase resolved wave prediction method the ann wp model has been developed duan 2020 fundamentally the ann wp algorithm uses ann or called multilayer perceptron mlp which is a classic ai model a typical ann structure has three parts input hidden and output layers the input layer receives the wave data of a measured position the output layer outputs the future wave data of a predicted position the hidden layer extracts the wave propagation characteristics from the inputted wave data based on these the ann wp model establishes the relationship between a measured and predicted position fig 2 table 1 shows the ann structure which refers the previous researches law 2020 duan 2020 each layer of the ann model consists of several neurons the number of neurons in each layer is artificially set in this paper we use arithmetic sequence to set the number of neurons of each layer to consider the stability when data is transferred between different layers relu is universally used in the many models as a kind of typical activation function we use it as activation function for ann wp model neurons have two functions receiving upper level data and using a nonlinear activation function to process them when neurons receive upper level data weights will be assigned to each data to represent the impact of data from different sources for a detailed description of the ann wp model refer to previous work duan 2020 3 water tank experiment to investigate the predictive ability and performance of the ann wp model wave propagation tests were performed in a wave tank of harbin engineering university the size of the tank is 50 30 10 m3 equipped with a wave maker the experimental wave spectrum is the jonswap spectrum the peak elevation parameter was 3 3 and the scale ratio was 1 46 we developed an experiment to relate to sea states 4 7 table 2 sixteen probes were installed in a wave tank to measure the wave surface fig 3 the distance between two adjacent probes was 1 5 m the wave probes were produced by techno service type twg 600s the sampling interval is 0 05s the length of experimental wave data of each sea state is 600s then we slip the window establish the next relationship between wave data of 1 probe and n probe t0 1 t1 1 to t1 1 t2 1 if we continually slip the window we can get the data set according to these wave data we built a data set of 10000 size under each sea state the 80 of data set is used as training set the 10 is validation set the 10 is test set in this study we use the root mean square error rmse ε and non dimensional rmse ndrmse ε to evaluate the prediction results as shown in eq 5 and eq 6 respectively 5 ε n p r e η i p r e η i m e a 2 n p r e 6 ε n p r e η i p r e η i m e a 2 n p r e h s where h s is the significant height η i p r e is the predictive wave surface in moment i η i m e a is the measured wave surface in moment i and n p r e is the amount of data 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of ann wp model first the predictive ability of the ann wp model under the training sea state is verified based on the experimental data wave data of different sea states are used to train the ann wp model the trained models are used to predict the wave elevation under the training sea state fig 4 a d shows the prediction results of these models these models provide highly accurate predicted wave elevation under the training sea state they can accurately predict the large peak value of the wave surface and some subtle wave surface fluctuation features from table 3 the ndrmses are less than 6 0 and the rmses are less than 0 3 m the more details can refer in work of duan 2020 4 2 the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states here we discuss the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states first the model trained by sea state 4 is used to predict the wave elevation under sea states 5 6 and 7 fig 5 shows the results the prediction error greatly increased under sea state 5 the ndrmse increased from 5 5 to 14 1 table 4 there is an obvious deviation at the peak and the predictive ability of the high frequency components of the wave elevation significantly decreased 370 385s when the sea state rises to 6 the ndrmse increases to 19 4 one reason for the increase in error is the prediction error of the peak value another reason is that the phase of the predicted peak value has a larger deviation and some segments even have the reverse phase 375s when the sea state rises to 7 the source of the error to further increase under sea states 5 and 6 the predicted peak value deviates from the experimental data but their lengths of time are approximately equal however in sea state 7 the length of time of the predicted peak segment deviated from the experiment data the lengths of some segments were longer 360 370s while some were shorter 385 390s the model trained by sea state 5 is used to predict wave elevation under sea states 4 6 and 7 fig 6 there is a certain deviation between the predicted and experiment results under sea state 4 in the phase the prediction result is consistent with the experiment but there is a greater deviation in the amplitude the deviation in the amplitude is the main reason the rmse and ndrmse increased rapidly when the sea state rises to 6 the ndrmse of the wave elevation does not change significantly the prediction result is the same as that in sea state 4 when the sea state rises to 7 the prediction error increases to some extent but it keeps a goodness of fit in the time history table 5 the model trained by sea state 6 is used to predict the wave elevation under sea state 4 5 and 7 the prediction results are similar to those of the model trained by sea state 5 although some segments cannot give accurate prediction results under sea states 4 5 and 7 385 395s for sea state 4 380 390s for sea state 5 and 340 345s for sea state 7 the results are consistent with the experiment in phase fig 7 owing to the large deviation in amplitude the ndrmses are relatively high see table 6 the model trained by sea state 7 is used to predict wave elevation of sea state 4 5 and 6 fig 8 there is a large deviation in phase and amplitude between the prediction result and the experiment under sea state 4 in addition there is a phase inversion appearing in local areas 365s the ndrmse is 23 8 table 7 when the sea state rises to 5 prediction accuracy improves in the amplitude and phase alignment and ndrmse reduces to 19 6 the reason is that the ann wp model is an ai model and the essence is the data statistics the data distribution of sea state 5 data is closer to sea state 7 than sea state 4 thus the prediction accuracy is improved however the phase deviation still appears 380s when the sea state rises to 6 although the error increases slightly the predicted wave surface can give a high frequency characteristic of waves 375 385s and the phase error is improved to a certain extent fig 9 shows the prediction error variance of trained models with various sea states under different sea states the error significantly increases under unknown sea states when the ann wp model is trained the model obtains the wave propagation characteristics from the training data therefore the wave data characteristics determine the prediction performance of ann wp model there are many wave data characteristics such as data distribution wave spectrum directional spectrum climate pattern significant wave height wave period etc in this paper we just consider the effect of data distribution figs 10 13 are the data distribution of different sea states the distribution range of wave surface elevation and wave height gradually increases with the increase of sea states the wave surface data changes from 4 m 4 m of sea state 4 to 12 m 12 m of sea state 7 when using the model trained by sea sate 4 to predict the wave elevation under sea states 5 6 and 7 there are no large values in the training data the wave elevation with large amplitude including nonlinearity cannot be predicted correctly under higher sea states similarly for the model trained by sea state 7 owing to the wide range of wave height distributed in the training data it is easy to identify the wave elevation of a lower sea state as a small segment of the high sea state when predicting the lower sea state wave surface therefore the prediction result is larger than the experiment result the data distribution of sea state 5 and 6 is moderate which can cover a considerable part of the wave elevation distribution of lower and higher sea states therefore the models trained by the data of these two sea states have better predicted performance under other unknown sea states 4 3 prediction performance an optimized method of the ann wp model based on data mixing from the above analysis it can be found that the data distribution can affect the prediction performance under unknown sea states based on this consideration we attempt to mix the data of different sea states to optimize the performance of the ann wp model the mixing strategy is shown in table 8 the model is trained with different mixed strategies and the trained model is used to predict the wave elevation under unknown sea states as shown in figs 14 16 and tables 9 11 the prediction accuracy of the model trained with mixed sea states is significantly higher than that trained with a single sea state under unknown sea states the phenomena of inverse phase and high frequency missing significantly decreased although the amplitude deviation is still obvious the improvement of phase makes the ndrmse decrease by approximately 5 0 10 0 however the prediction accuracy of the model trained with a mixed sea state is lower than that of a single sea state under the known sea state the reason is that due to the data mixing the wave characteristics of different sea states are mixed the irrelevant information interferes ann wp model to accurately extract the characteristics of a single sea state this phenomenon shows that using mixed sea states to train the ann wp model can significantly improve the performance under unknown sea states meanwhile the prediction error is stable at approximately 15 0 under different sea states fig 17 as the sea state increases the ndrmse has a slightly downward trend when the rmse error increases the reason for this trend is the great prediction ability of nonlinear data of the ann wp model so high accurate prediction results are obtained with an increase in sea state meanwhile according to fig 17 the mixing of medium sea states seems more useful than mixing of low sea states and high sea states and further adding more wave information doesn t seem to significantly improve the predicted performance although the optimized method can improve the prediction accuracy under unknown sea states it has some improvement space and we will focus on this in future work 5 conclusion in this paper the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states is analyzed first the basic structure and calculation principle of the ann wp model are introduced then the ann wp model is verified experimentally next the model trained by a single sea state is used to predict the wave elevation under unknown sea states and we discuss the performance under different sea states finally based on the consideration that data distribution can affect the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states the data mixing is adopted to improve the prediction performance of the model under unknown sea states the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states was low the prediction error increased rapidly from less than 5 5 under known sea states to more than 15 0 under unknown sea states from the perspective of data distribution this phenomenon is analyzed although the prediction error increases under unknown sea states a trained ann wp model still has a certain prediction ability the model trained with a low sea state data can give a rough phase and amplitude of wave elevation under a higher sea state however there are some phenomena of phase misalignment and high frequency loss and the prediction error is large the model trained by high sea state can give the rough wave surface fluctuation and phase under low sea state there are also some phenomena of phase misalignment and high frequency loss and the prediction error is large the reason is that there are some similarities of wave propagation characteristics between different sea states therefore the trained models have a certain ability to predict wave elevation under unknown sea states based on the consideration that data distribution of training data set can affect the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states data mixing as an optimization method is used to improve the performance of the ann wp model under unknown sea states through data mixing of different sea states the prediction error has an improvement of about 10 0 under unknown sea states these results show that the data mixing can improve the performance of ann wp model under unknown sea states meanwhile it is found that there is no significant difference in the prediction results of the models trained by different data mixed strategies and the error is about 15 0 under different sea states in this paper we just use data mixing to build the data sets and optimize the predicted performance under unknown sea states and don t optimize the mixing strategies through optimize the mixing strategies we think the predicted error will further decrease credit authorship contribution statement xuewen ma

20174,offshore wind power has gained much attention as a clean and renewable source of energy in cold regions offshore wind farms owfs face many challenges due to sea ice cover in response to these challenges this paper establishes a scheme to evaluate sea ice parameters for the design of wind power projects we have successfully applied this scheme to the owf in the bohai sea the scheme is based on data from sea ice satellite images operational forecasting systems and field tests the ice period joint probability distribution function of ice velocity and thickness and return period rp of thickness are investigated moreover we determine the air temperature relationship between the owf and laizhou city then the effective ice temperature is calculated for the owf based on the air temperature combining the rps of ice temperature and thickness we compute the rps of bending and compression strengths which are two key parameters for the ice load design of wind turbine towers our scheme is feasible to implement and can provide complete sea ice information for owfs from the stages of design and construction to operation keywords sea ice offshore wind farm bohai sea probability distribution function return period 1 introduction as a clean and sustainable energy source wind power is a substitute for fossil fuel and is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions recently with the trend of global warming many cold regions have been proposed for building offshore wind farms owfs toimil et al 2020 barstad et al 2014 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 in particular observations show that the performance of wind turbines increases under very cold climactic conditions witt et al 2021 however sea ice imposes a serious impact on the safety of owfs during the ice covered season pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 yu et al 2016 strategies to this challenge need to fully consider the influence of sea ice on the project from design and construction to operation sea ice parameters such as thickness velocity and ice period and their distributions must be estimated with sufficient accuracy pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 necci et al 2019 moreover databases should be updated by incorporating the trend of the last twenty years the accumulation of sea ice data from satellite images gu et al 2013 karvonen et al 2017 numerical models barstad et al 2014 lledó et al 2019 and field observations xu et al 2020 comprehensively benefits the evaluation of sea ice parameters many works focus on the additional ice loads induced by the collision between drifting ice and the wind turbine tower or foundation dynamical ice loads are likely to cause the vibration of offshore wind turbine owt support structures battisti et al 2006 gravesen et al 2005 yu et al 2016 successive vibrations can cause fatigue of support structures and even failure barker et al 2005 moreover vibrations induced by collisions threaten the stability of foundations battisti et al 2006 pryor and barthelmie 2013 which are subjected to the risk of uneven settlement worse collisions might be disastrous in jeopardizing the owts because carbon steel shows brittle behavior under extremely low temperatures necci et al 2019 witt et al 2021 moreover sea ice accumulation on towers can influence local wave conditions and dynamic sea ice behavior zhang et al 2019 thus increasing ice and wave loads on foundations battisti et al 2006 to mitigate static and dynamic ice loads attaching an ice breaking cone to offshore wind towers at water level is suggested pryor and barthelmie 2013 shi et al 2016 ye et al 2018 because the cone can induce bending failure of floating level ice this method has been verified due to its widely effective application to jacket oil platforms wang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 with which the structure of owts have many similarities mróz et al 2008 therefore the conical structure of ice breaking cones is also applicable to owts zhu et al 2021 to accomplish the same effectiveness the design of owts necessitates the evaluation of environmental sea ice parameters gravesen et al 2005 ye et al 2018 therefore sea ice period velocity thickness compressive strength and bending strength should be thoroughly inspected to economically optimize the design and construction of owts yu et al 2016 seidel and hendrikse 2018 sinsabvarodom et al 2020 the abovementioned evaluation is a comprehensive method combining sea ice environmental parameters into a calculation of design parameters for ocean engineering the uncertainty of sea ice environment may impose additional risk on owts pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 however methods and procedures have seldom been reported for such an evaluation some agencies lower the risk by giving their recommendations of offshore sites for wind energy exploitation and these recommendations only give an estimation for the rough selection of the project site laakso et al 2010 considering the sea ice period thickness motion strength and concentration a risk assessment index system is proposed to evaluate sea ice disasters gu et al 2013 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2019 xu et al 2019 this system is used to evaluate the risk of offshore platforms with ice breaking cones and promote the response strategy for sea ice disasters the evaluation focuses on the performance of the structure rather than concerns about investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of sea ice parameters ouyang et al 2017 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2019 in practice sea ice environmental parameters need to be further converted into design parameters for ocean engineering zonation of sea ice disasters is another option to lower the risk for owts for example as a seasonal ice covered region the bohai sea is divided into 18 zones according to the potential risk induced by sea ice yang 2000 li et al 2004 each zone has its own design criteria based on sea ice parameters several oil platforms have been constructed since 2000 by considering sea ice zones however this method largely depends on data before 2000 and engages in a few objective judgments previous results cannot meet the current requirements of owts for the specified project there needs to be a higher accuracy for sea ice parameters gu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 sinsabvarodom et al 2020 moreover the database should be updated by incorporating the trend of the last twenty years gong et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 in particular the accumulation of sea ice data from high resolution satellite images numerical models and field observations definitely benefits the evaluation of sea ice parameters for owts in this paper we developed a scheme to evaluate sea ice parameters for an offshore wind farm owf by integrating several data resources the major procedure is shown in fig 1 satellite images were used to estimate the ice period the sea ice numerical forecasting system provided the velocity and thickness to determine the probability density function pdf and return period rp we used the air temperature from a field monitor to calculate the effective ice temperature several studies have assessed the sea ice strength and its brine volume which is a function of the temperature and salinity of sea ice based on the fitted function we derived the rp of sea ice compressive and bending strengths from rps of the ice thickness and effective ice temperature the experiment evaluating sea ice mechanical properties was carried out near the owf the results were compared to verify the strengths of rps this procedure is very feasible and can be applied to other designs of owts that suffer from similar challenges caused by ice cover 2 data and methods the planned owf is located in laizhou bay which is in the most southern part of the bohai sea the location is marked with a red star in fig 2 and the owf includes two components each component has a power generation capacity of 300 mw and is facilitated by one booster station of 220 kv they consist of 91 and 48 units of wind power generators respectively to lower the ice load they were designed with ice breaking cones therefore the water level in the ice covered season is a key parameter to determine the proper position for the installation of the cone however this paper focuses on the ice period thickness velocity and strength the pdf joint pdf and rp of sea ice parameters are also calculated laizhou bay is one of the regions containing the most abundant wind energy especially during winter gao et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 it is usually covered by sea ice from the middle of december to early february of the following year compared with the other three bays laizhou bay has the lowest severity of sea ice gu et al 2013 however when the ice covered season arrives sea ice occasionally imposes a significant impact on human activities such as navigation fish farms and oil exploration the sea ice risk should also not be negligible for the owts to reduce the risk caused by flowing ice cover satellite images and numerical models have been routinely used to monitor and forecast the evolution of sea ice for more than twenty years our analysis was mainly based on these two data resources furthermore data from field observations and mechanical experiments benefited our analysis 2 1 the sea ice parameters extracted from satellite images satellite images were obtained from noaa and modis for this analysis after 2000 modis images replaced those of noaa to monitor sea ice in laizhou bay former images have a resolution of 250 m and are more competent to capture sea ice properties than latter images which have a resolution of 1 0 km we collected more than 500 frames of sea ice images for laizhou bay in ice covered seasons from 1997 to 2020 the sea ice edge was manually depicted on images as shown by the pink line in fig 2 based on sea ice coverage the first and last days of sea ice presence could be designated for the project site then the length of the ice covered season was evaluated the sea ice concentration and thickness were extracted from the satellite images according to the optical characteristics of the sea ice surface in addition oceanographic stations oil platforms and field investigations acquired some sea ice data such as the velocity thickness concentration and distance from the shore for fast ice the field observation data were further assimilated to make corrections for the extraction of the sea ice element field combining those sources of data we also formed the initial sea ice parameter fields which were essential to the operational system of numerical sea ice forecasting 2 2 operational sea ice forecasting system sea ice velocity and thickness were mainly obtained from the operational sea ice forecasting system which has been built for more than 20 years at the national marine environmental forecasting center nmefc wu et al 2000 the forecasting system routinely provides sea ice information fig 3 to the public it also delivers warning messages to specific customers that run oil platforms ship transportation companies and marine farms when a severe grade of sea ice appears in the bohai sea the system consists of large scale high resolution and fine forecasting models these three levels serve different aims with different resolutions and constitutive relation models of sea ice essentially the data from the high resolution forecasting model were adopted its resolution reached 0 01 and the time effectiveness was guaranteed to be at least 72 h as mentioned above the initial fields of thickness and concentration were retrieved from the satellite images forcing fields such as currents and winds were obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model which was operationally run at the nmefc the elastic viscous plastic evp relation model was applied to simulate sea ice dynamics this constitutive relation caused parallel computing to be conveniently carried out for the program compared with satellite images the 48 h guaranteed rates of sea ice edges concentrations and areas were all above 90 based on the data from oil platforms the 48 h guaranteed rate of thickness and velocity exceeded 85 considering the engineering site and the practical requirements of the analysis we collected 14085 groups of the sea ice velocities and thicknesses for the past ten years from 2010 to 2020 the sampling frequency was 0 5 h and four sampling points around the project were considered the data distributions of sea ice thickness and velocity are shown in fig 4 2 3 air temperature at the project site the air temperature at the site was a key parameter to determine the effective sea ice temperature which determined the recurrence interval of the sea ice strength however there were no records of air temperature for the project site on the ocean fortunately we obtained the 60 year time series of air temperature for laizhou city between 1959 and 2018 as shown in fig 2 the city is located approximately 26 km at east of the project site furthermore the air temperature of the project site was recorded from 1 january to 1 march the 60 day data were used to determine the relationship of the daily minimum air temperatures between the project site and laizhou city a quadratic function was used to fit the points in fig 5 we obtained the equation 1 y 0 0083 x 2 0 62 x 1 06 to fit the relationship of the temperatures with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 88 this equation was used to transform the yearly minimum temperature of laizhou city to that of the project site for the past 60 years the result of the transformation is exhibited in section 3 2 4 computation of the effective ice temperature assuming that the heat conduction of sea ice cover remained stable under the persistent action of the minimum air temperature we derived the following identities frankenstein and garner 1967 2 q k t w t a α 1 t w t iw α 2 t ia t a λ h t iw t ia where q is the heat flux kj m2 h k is the heat transfer coefficient kj m2 h k t w is the sea water temperature c t a is the air temperature c t iw is the temperature of the interface between ice and sea water c t ia is the temperature of the interface between ice and air c and α 1 and α 2 are the proposed coefficients kj m2 h k furthermore the heat transfer coefficient can be expressed as 3 k α 1 1 λ 1 h α 2 1 1 where λ is the heat conductive coefficient kj m2 h and h is the sea ice thickness m according to reference wu et al 2001 we set α 1 522 5 kj m2 h k α 2 196 5 kj m2 h k λ 84 0 kj m h and t w 1 4 c for the bohai sea then t ia and t iw were computed as follows 4 t ia k t w t a α 2 t a 5 t iw t w k t w t a α 1 under the assumption that the distribution of ice temperature is linear we assumed the midpoint temperature to be the effective sea ice temperature thus 6 t e t ia t iw 2 the above deduction showed that the computation of the effective sea ice temperature necessitated the air temperature and sea ice thickness of the rp 2 5 uniaxial compression and three point bending experiments we carried out a mechanical property experiment to investigate the strength of sea ice in the winter of 2019 which was a warm winter over laizhou bay thus it was not easy to search for level ice that satisfied the requirements of this study finally we confirmed the sampling site marked in fig 2 for this experiment the sampling point was approximately 25 km from the project site level ice with an average thickness of approximately 15 cm existed the salinity of sea water was 21 ppt at the sampling point when the samples were prepared for the experiment the air temperature ice temperature and sea water temperature were 3 7 c 2 c and 0 1 c respectively the sea ice block was cut off from the ice cover and transported to the low temperature laboratory as shown in fig 6 uniaxial compression and three point bending experiments were performed to determine the sea ice compression and bending strengths these two mechanical parameters maintain a close relationship with ocean engineering designs to follow the suggestion that the ratio of height to width should approach 2 5 timco and weeks 2010 we finely processed the ice specimen to the dimensions of 70 mm 70 mm 175 mm a a h for the uniaxial compression experiment as shown in fig 6 a the compression strength was determined by the following equation 7 σ c f max a 2 a specimens of 70 mm 70 mm 500 mm b h l was adopted for the three point bending process in fig 6 b the l h ratio of 7 10 ensured the hypothesis of the beam deformation of the beam we computed the bending strength as follows 8 σ b 3 2 p max l b h 2 the experiment was carried out in low temperature laboratory the environmental temperatures were controlled around 15 10 and 5 c this manipulation helped form different temperatures of sea ice in total there were 25 specimens for the uniaxial compression experiment and 24 specimens for the three point bending experiment 3 results 3 1 ice period of the project site in general the ice period started at the freeze up date continued through the heavy ice and melting ice dates and ended at the breakup date corresponding to these four dates the ice period consisted of three stages freezing stage heavy ice stage and melting ice stage the freeze up date was the first day that we observed sea ice in satellite images and the breakup date was the last day that we observed sea ice in satellite images however there has been no definition to exactly specify the heavy ice date and melting ice date we combined satellite images numerical models and subjective judgement to estimate these two dates here coverage and longevity were the two most important factors under consideration the basic statistical parameters of these four ice dates are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the ice period was concentrated in early january to mid february corresponding to the four types of dates their mean and median dates were in chronological order however the distributions of the ice dates were quite variable they occupied a wide span and largely overlapped with each other this manifested that the interannual variability was significant for those four types of ice dates for example the freeze up dates extended from jan 14th to feb 25th with a length of 43 days the freeze up date heavy ice date and melting ice date all occurred between january 10th and 28th these 19 days comprised the main part of the ice period at the project site the ice period lasted 21 days on average for the past twenty years from 2001 to 2020 as shown in fig 8 the freezing stage and melting ice stage predominated the ice period evolution the heavy ice stage only accounted for approximately one quarter of the ice period and the longest stage was 18 days in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 which were the most severe ice years in the past twenty years in laizhou bay however the length of each ice stage significantly fluctuated every year fig 8 shows that there were six years without sea ice at the project site in particular five of them occurred in the past seven years from 2014 to 2020 the ice period maintained a close relationship with ice degrades in laizhou bay 3 2 probability density function of sea ice velocity and thickness velocities less than 12 cm s and thicknesses of 5 15 cm appeared most frequently at the project site the means of sea ice velocity and thickness were 10 03 cm s and 9 98 cm respectively both exhibited an asymmetrical distribution the thickness tended to be slightly larger than the mean while the velocity evidently inclined toward lower values and comprised many extreme data fig 9 shows the distribution of the flow direction at the project site the predominant directions were nearly northeast for offshore flow ice and nearly southwest for onshore flow ice with reference to fig 9 the predominant direction of flowing ice was almost perpendicular to the coastline the direction distribution was tightly associated with predominant winter currents and winds in laizhou bay we divided the velocity data into 12 groups with a bin of 5 cm s to estimate the pdf as shown in fig 10 a monotonic function may be applicable to fit the pdf we attempted an exponential distribution f v λ e λ v v 0 to simulate the observed density and obtained the rate parameter λ 0 084 and the determinant coefficient r 2 0 97 so the fitting pdf of the velocity was given as 9 f v 0 084 e 0 084 v v 0 where v represents the magnitude of the flow ice velocity the thicknesses were divided into 19 groups with bin size of 1 cm the inset of fig 11 shows that the sea ice thickness had a skewed distribution with a negative coefficient of skewness of 0 48 this indicated that most of the values were concentrated on the right side of the mean thickness which was 9 98 cm taking into consideration the distribution shape and the coefficient of skewness that was close to zero we conjectured that the log normal distribution may conform to the trend of the thickness pdf however the coefficient of skewness of the log normal distribution was positive so we made a reversal transformation of the thickness values to satisfy this requirement with h 21 h 0 here h 0 represented the sea ice thickness this transformation also considered the maximum thickness of 20 0 cm in our samples the histogram of the reversal transformation is shown in fig 11 then the pdf of h could be fitted by the equation below 10 p h 1 2 π σ h exp 1 2 σ 2 ln h μ 2 h 0 where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ln h respectively as shown in fig 11 we used nonlinear fitting to obtain μ 2 35 and σ 0 40 with a determinant coefficient r 2 0 77 3 3 sea ice thickness of return period the sea ice thickness of the rp is a key element to be considered by ocean engineering in cold regions the probability of thickness h h p can be expressed as 11 p h h p 1 h p f h d h where h p is the specified thickness of sea ice and f h is the pdf of sea ice thickness then the rp of n years for sea ice thickness satisfies the equation below 12 n 1 p 1 p h h p where p is the design frequency of the thickness in general p was set to 0 2 0 1 0 05 0 02 and 0 01 corresponding to rp values of n 5 10 20 50 and 100 years we used a pearson iii distribution to estimate the rp of n years the pdf of the pearson iii distribution included two undetermined parameters α and β as 13 f h β α γ α h α 1 e β h 0 h based on the yearly maximum thicknesses from the past twenty years we calculated α 1 11 and β 0 134 as shown in fig 12 the anticipated extreme sea ice thicknesses were between 13 0 and 34 6 for n 5 100 years for the project site as listed in table 2 3 4 air temperature and effective ice temperature the theory in section 2 4 showed that air temperature was a prerequisite for the computation of the effective ice temperature the minimum temperature t 1 of laizhou city is displayed in fig 13 we interpolated t 1 into the minimum temperature t 2 of the project site through quadratic function 1 as shown in fig 13 t 2 was raised from the t 1 curve which signifies that the temperature of the project site was universally and significantly higher than that of laizhou city however both of the minimum temperatures had an increasing trend for the past twenty years similar to the computation of the rp for the thickness we adopted a pearson iii distribution with two parameters α and β to estimate the rp of the temperatures see fig 14 we obtained α 12 83 and β 1 78 for the temperature of the project site as shown in fig 14 curve t 2 remained almost equidistance from the curve t 1 the rp temperatures of n 5 100 years were 12 7 8 8 c and 18 0 13 5 c for t 1 and t 2 respectively two types of rp maintained a narrow range of less than 5 c for n 5 100 years the rp of the thickness h and the air temperature t 1 were needed to compute the rp of the effective sea ice temperature h was used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient k in equations 4 and 5 and the air temperature followed t a t 1 we assumed that the rps of h and t 1 occurred at the same time because the sea ice thickness had a close relationship with the air temperature therefore we substituted h and t 1 into equation 6 to obtain the rp of the effective ice temperature t e which was a key parameter to compute the rp of sea ice strength as expected the environmental temperature should be frequently lower than the ice temperature and the sea surface temperature should be higher than that of the land under extreme low temperature conditions therefore these three types of rps performed well with t e t 1 t 2 for every column in table 3 moreover t e preserved a very good linear relationship with t 1 and t 2 as shown in fig 15 so the air temperature of the land adjacent to the project site could provide a good clue to estimate the rp of the effective ice temperature 3 5 sea ice strength and its rp sea ice compression strength and bending strength were the two most important parameters for wpfs in cold regions sinsabvarodom et al 2020 based on the effective ice temperature in section 3 4 the brine volume was determined with frankenstein and garner 1967 14 v b s i 0 532 49 185 t i 22 9 c t i 0 5 c where t i is the ice temperature c and s i is the ice salinity s i was measured at the sampling site and was between 1 5 ppt an average brine volume 3 64 ppt was adopted in our computation here the method for computing the compression strength σ c in reference wu et al 2001 was as follows 15 σ c 4 42 0 30 v b in accordance with reference ji et al 2011 the bending strength σ f can be expressed as an exponential form of v b as shown below 16 σ f 2 41 exp 4 29 v b with s i and t i known in equation 14 we obtained the compression strength and bending strength for the specified rp which are listed in table 4 the boxplots of the sea ice strength are shown in fig 16 for the mechanical experiment the compression strength was of high discreteness and covered the range from 1 0 mpa to 3 0 mpa with a mean of 2 20 mpa the bending strength centered at a mean of 1 07 mpa with a range of 0 6 1 5 mpa compared with the boxplot of the experimental data the compression of the rp tended to approach large values while the bending strengths were close to the average level overall the computed strengths of the rp were all within the ranges of the experimental data 4 discussion 4 1 pdfs of the velocity and thickness bin size plays an important role in the estimation of the pdf different bin sizes may influence the shape of the histogram which is fundamental to derive the pdf from the sampling data our selection considered the model of the pdf and the number of divided groups the bin sizes guaranteed the goodness of fit with determinant coefficients r 2 of 0 77 and 0 97 for the thickness and velocity respectively furthermore we used the empirical probability density function epdf to investigate the influence of the fitting of the histogram the epdf can be fitted by using a nonparametric density estimation method such as the kernel density estimation so it was not a prerequisite of the bin size to group the sampling data figs 17 and 18 show that the distribution of the epdf conforms well to the typical distributions which were computed based on the bin sizes in figs 10 and 11 to quantitatively evaluate comparability we adopted the log normal and exponential models of the pdf to fit the epdf in figs 17 and 18 the two types of fitting functions agree very well therefore our selection of bin size is appropriate to compute the pdf of the sea ice velocity and thickness here we applied the transformation h 21 h 0 to better fit the log normal distribution which was used to estimate the pdf of the thickness in bohai bay ji et al 2002 this transformation considered the maximum thickness 20 cm of the database from the sea ice forecasting model for the past 21 years the maximum thickness has not reached the level of the 20 year rp 23 cm this situation is expected to continue with a high probability due to global warming the exponential distribution of the velocity reveals that the owf is located in the sea area where the sea ice dynamics are relatively weak with most velocities less than 15 cm s zhang et al 2019 the depth of laizhou bay is mainly less than 10 m with a flat seabed and the narrow bay mouth limits exchange with the outer sea hainbucher et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 therefore a weak hydrodynamics environment exists which remains strongly correlated with sea ice dynamics in ocean engineering a joint pdf of velocity and thickness is desired to design offshore structures we first inspected the correlation of the thickness with the velocity of sea ice to accomplish this we used spearman s correlation coefficient ρ one reason was that the thickness and velocity did not follow a gaussian distribution another reason was that ρ could probe the nonlinear monotonic association we obtained ρ 0 14 which showed that the correlation was very weak or null moreover hoeffding s independence test was carried out it is a nonparametric test to detect a wide variety of dependence structures beyond monotonic association we computed hoeffding s measure of dependence d 0 01 which signifies that the two variables were almost independent in engineering we could hereby accept the approximation that the velocity is independent of the thickness subsequently the joint pdf was simply calculated by f v p h which is shown in fig 19 however it is not always applicable to fit ice velocity or thickness to the standard pdfs occasionally the collected data sample does not match any known probability distribution even with the assistance of data transforms and the parameterization of the distribution function in this paper the sample of data does not satisfy any existing distribution in addition the velocity and thickness may not be simply regarded as independent variables under some conditions of ocean dynamics and topography therefore it is inapplicable to multiply two pdfs to obtain the joint pdf of sea ice velocity and thickness instead of fitting the pdfs the epdf can directly use a nonparametric density estimation method to accomplish the middle part of the scheme in fig 1 4 2 the distribution and trend of sea ice strengths as shown in fig 16 some experimental strengths surpassed the sea ice strengths of the 100 year rp in particular the bending strength only reached the average level of the strengths derived from the experiment in this experiment the sea ice specimens were maintained for at least 24 h at a constant temperature this manipulation basically guaranteed the same temperature of the specimens as that of the storage environment in this study the minimum environmental temperature was set to at least 5 c in a low temperature laboratory whereas the effective ice temperature was only 5 44 c for the 100 year rp the seas ice strength was quite sensitive to temperature with a negative correlation a lower temperature indicates a higher strength this analysis was mainly based on the air temperature of the past sixty years and the sea ice parameters of the past twenty years in fig 13 we can observe the increasing trend of the air temperature with significant fluctuation for those years during winter the air temperature of the project site increases at a rate of 0 416 c per decade which is near the mean state of 0 382 c per decade of laizhou bay ouyang et al 2017 yan et al 2017 obviously global warming influences the local conditions of the bohai sea to some degree gong et al 2007 therefore the sea ice condition of laizhou bay become less heavy with some fluctuations which is also manifested by the data from satellite images and field observations yan et al 2020 in particular the frequency of the zero ice year significantly increases for the past ten years as shown in fig 8 due to the relatively stable sea ice dynamics of the owf rafted and ridged ice are rarely observed within the owf the thickness of rafted ice may be ignored for the design of owts otherwise a safety coefficient of 1 5 should be sufficient to guarantee the safety of the designed thickness if global warming continues the sea ice strengths and thickness are anticipated to exhibit a declining trend for the design of owfs 5 conclusion in summary we developed a scheme to appraise sea ice conditions for the design parameters of owfs this procedure was carried out for the owf in the bohai sea the ice period lasts 21 days on average and the days from january 10th to 28th should be carefully considered for the project the directions of the flowing ice are concentrated in the northeast and southwest the pdf of ice velocity obeys an exponential distribution which is characterized by the dominance of relatively low values these characteristics are manifested in the low dynamics of sea ice at the project site the thickness is mainly between 5 cm and 15 cm and its pdf is captured by the log normal distribution through the data transformation the velocity is very low and is independence of the thickness so their joint pdf can be obtained by multiplying the two marginal pdfs the extreme thickness of the rp is also given depending on the pearson iii distribution of two parameters moreover combining the thickness and effective ice temperature of the rp we compute the rp of bending and compression strengths for wind turbine towers the calculated strengths are also verified by comparison with the experimental results these should be regarded as index strengths and may not be appropriate for direct use in ice load calculations how index strengths can be used to modify ice load algorithms is discussed in iso 19906 2019 overall the influence of sea ice on the owf is diminishing in the bohai sea under the background of a globally warming climate our scheme is easily implemented and can provide complete information for the owf from the design and construction stages to the operation stage with a slight alteration this scheme is applicable to other offshore projects that have similar structures and confront similar challenges as owfs in cold regions however the scheme mainly appraise the level ice parameters if pressure ridges are present then the scheme will need to be further developed to include them credit authorship contribution statement anliang wang conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing

20174,offshore wind power has gained much attention as a clean and renewable source of energy in cold regions offshore wind farms owfs face many challenges due to sea ice cover in response to these challenges this paper establishes a scheme to evaluate sea ice parameters for the design of wind power projects we have successfully applied this scheme to the owf in the bohai sea the scheme is based on data from sea ice satellite images operational forecasting systems and field tests the ice period joint probability distribution function of ice velocity and thickness and return period rp of thickness are investigated moreover we determine the air temperature relationship between the owf and laizhou city then the effective ice temperature is calculated for the owf based on the air temperature combining the rps of ice temperature and thickness we compute the rps of bending and compression strengths which are two key parameters for the ice load design of wind turbine towers our scheme is feasible to implement and can provide complete sea ice information for owfs from the stages of design and construction to operation keywords sea ice offshore wind farm bohai sea probability distribution function return period 1 introduction as a clean and sustainable energy source wind power is a substitute for fossil fuel and is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions recently with the trend of global warming many cold regions have been proposed for building offshore wind farms owfs toimil et al 2020 barstad et al 2014 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 in particular observations show that the performance of wind turbines increases under very cold climactic conditions witt et al 2021 however sea ice imposes a serious impact on the safety of owfs during the ice covered season pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 yu et al 2016 strategies to this challenge need to fully consider the influence of sea ice on the project from design and construction to operation sea ice parameters such as thickness velocity and ice period and their distributions must be estimated with sufficient accuracy pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 necci et al 2019 moreover databases should be updated by incorporating the trend of the last twenty years the accumulation of sea ice data from satellite images gu et al 2013 karvonen et al 2017 numerical models barstad et al 2014 lledó et al 2019 and field observations xu et al 2020 comprehensively benefits the evaluation of sea ice parameters many works focus on the additional ice loads induced by the collision between drifting ice and the wind turbine tower or foundation dynamical ice loads are likely to cause the vibration of offshore wind turbine owt support structures battisti et al 2006 gravesen et al 2005 yu et al 2016 successive vibrations can cause fatigue of support structures and even failure barker et al 2005 moreover vibrations induced by collisions threaten the stability of foundations battisti et al 2006 pryor and barthelmie 2013 which are subjected to the risk of uneven settlement worse collisions might be disastrous in jeopardizing the owts because carbon steel shows brittle behavior under extremely low temperatures necci et al 2019 witt et al 2021 moreover sea ice accumulation on towers can influence local wave conditions and dynamic sea ice behavior zhang et al 2019 thus increasing ice and wave loads on foundations battisti et al 2006 to mitigate static and dynamic ice loads attaching an ice breaking cone to offshore wind towers at water level is suggested pryor and barthelmie 2013 shi et al 2016 ye et al 2018 because the cone can induce bending failure of floating level ice this method has been verified due to its widely effective application to jacket oil platforms wang et al 2015 xu et al 2019 with which the structure of owts have many similarities mróz et al 2008 therefore the conical structure of ice breaking cones is also applicable to owts zhu et al 2021 to accomplish the same effectiveness the design of owts necessitates the evaluation of environmental sea ice parameters gravesen et al 2005 ye et al 2018 therefore sea ice period velocity thickness compressive strength and bending strength should be thoroughly inspected to economically optimize the design and construction of owts yu et al 2016 seidel and hendrikse 2018 sinsabvarodom et al 2020 the abovementioned evaluation is a comprehensive method combining sea ice environmental parameters into a calculation of design parameters for ocean engineering the uncertainty of sea ice environment may impose additional risk on owts pryor and barthelmie 2013 sharapov and shkhinek 2014 however methods and procedures have seldom been reported for such an evaluation some agencies lower the risk by giving their recommendations of offshore sites for wind energy exploitation and these recommendations only give an estimation for the rough selection of the project site laakso et al 2010 considering the sea ice period thickness motion strength and concentration a risk assessment index system is proposed to evaluate sea ice disasters gu et al 2013 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2019 xu et al 2019 this system is used to evaluate the risk of offshore platforms with ice breaking cones and promote the response strategy for sea ice disasters the evaluation focuses on the performance of the structure rather than concerns about investigating the spatiotemporal distribution of sea ice parameters ouyang et al 2017 srinivasan and nagavinothini 2019 in practice sea ice environmental parameters need to be further converted into design parameters for ocean engineering zonation of sea ice disasters is another option to lower the risk for owts for example as a seasonal ice covered region the bohai sea is divided into 18 zones according to the potential risk induced by sea ice yang 2000 li et al 2004 each zone has its own design criteria based on sea ice parameters several oil platforms have been constructed since 2000 by considering sea ice zones however this method largely depends on data before 2000 and engages in a few objective judgments previous results cannot meet the current requirements of owts for the specified project there needs to be a higher accuracy for sea ice parameters gu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 sinsabvarodom et al 2020 moreover the database should be updated by incorporating the trend of the last twenty years gong et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 in particular the accumulation of sea ice data from high resolution satellite images numerical models and field observations definitely benefits the evaluation of sea ice parameters for owts in this paper we developed a scheme to evaluate sea ice parameters for an offshore wind farm owf by integrating several data resources the major procedure is shown in fig 1 satellite images were used to estimate the ice period the sea ice numerical forecasting system provided the velocity and thickness to determine the probability density function pdf and return period rp we used the air temperature from a field monitor to calculate the effective ice temperature several studies have assessed the sea ice strength and its brine volume which is a function of the temperature and salinity of sea ice based on the fitted function we derived the rp of sea ice compressive and bending strengths from rps of the ice thickness and effective ice temperature the experiment evaluating sea ice mechanical properties was carried out near the owf the results were compared to verify the strengths of rps this procedure is very feasible and can be applied to other designs of owts that suffer from similar challenges caused by ice cover 2 data and methods the planned owf is located in laizhou bay which is in the most southern part of the bohai sea the location is marked with a red star in fig 2 and the owf includes two components each component has a power generation capacity of 300 mw and is facilitated by one booster station of 220 kv they consist of 91 and 48 units of wind power generators respectively to lower the ice load they were designed with ice breaking cones therefore the water level in the ice covered season is a key parameter to determine the proper position for the installation of the cone however this paper focuses on the ice period thickness velocity and strength the pdf joint pdf and rp of sea ice parameters are also calculated laizhou bay is one of the regions containing the most abundant wind energy especially during winter gao et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 it is usually covered by sea ice from the middle of december to early february of the following year compared with the other three bays laizhou bay has the lowest severity of sea ice gu et al 2013 however when the ice covered season arrives sea ice occasionally imposes a significant impact on human activities such as navigation fish farms and oil exploration the sea ice risk should also not be negligible for the owts to reduce the risk caused by flowing ice cover satellite images and numerical models have been routinely used to monitor and forecast the evolution of sea ice for more than twenty years our analysis was mainly based on these two data resources furthermore data from field observations and mechanical experiments benefited our analysis 2 1 the sea ice parameters extracted from satellite images satellite images were obtained from noaa and modis for this analysis after 2000 modis images replaced those of noaa to monitor sea ice in laizhou bay former images have a resolution of 250 m and are more competent to capture sea ice properties than latter images which have a resolution of 1 0 km we collected more than 500 frames of sea ice images for laizhou bay in ice covered seasons from 1997 to 2020 the sea ice edge was manually depicted on images as shown by the pink line in fig 2 based on sea ice coverage the first and last days of sea ice presence could be designated for the project site then the length of the ice covered season was evaluated the sea ice concentration and thickness were extracted from the satellite images according to the optical characteristics of the sea ice surface in addition oceanographic stations oil platforms and field investigations acquired some sea ice data such as the velocity thickness concentration and distance from the shore for fast ice the field observation data were further assimilated to make corrections for the extraction of the sea ice element field combining those sources of data we also formed the initial sea ice parameter fields which were essential to the operational system of numerical sea ice forecasting 2 2 operational sea ice forecasting system sea ice velocity and thickness were mainly obtained from the operational sea ice forecasting system which has been built for more than 20 years at the national marine environmental forecasting center nmefc wu et al 2000 the forecasting system routinely provides sea ice information fig 3 to the public it also delivers warning messages to specific customers that run oil platforms ship transportation companies and marine farms when a severe grade of sea ice appears in the bohai sea the system consists of large scale high resolution and fine forecasting models these three levels serve different aims with different resolutions and constitutive relation models of sea ice essentially the data from the high resolution forecasting model were adopted its resolution reached 0 01 and the time effectiveness was guaranteed to be at least 72 h as mentioned above the initial fields of thickness and concentration were retrieved from the satellite images forcing fields such as currents and winds were obtained from the weather research and forecasting wrf model which was operationally run at the nmefc the elastic viscous plastic evp relation model was applied to simulate sea ice dynamics this constitutive relation caused parallel computing to be conveniently carried out for the program compared with satellite images the 48 h guaranteed rates of sea ice edges concentrations and areas were all above 90 based on the data from oil platforms the 48 h guaranteed rate of thickness and velocity exceeded 85 considering the engineering site and the practical requirements of the analysis we collected 14085 groups of the sea ice velocities and thicknesses for the past ten years from 2010 to 2020 the sampling frequency was 0 5 h and four sampling points around the project were considered the data distributions of sea ice thickness and velocity are shown in fig 4 2 3 air temperature at the project site the air temperature at the site was a key parameter to determine the effective sea ice temperature which determined the recurrence interval of the sea ice strength however there were no records of air temperature for the project site on the ocean fortunately we obtained the 60 year time series of air temperature for laizhou city between 1959 and 2018 as shown in fig 2 the city is located approximately 26 km at east of the project site furthermore the air temperature of the project site was recorded from 1 january to 1 march the 60 day data were used to determine the relationship of the daily minimum air temperatures between the project site and laizhou city a quadratic function was used to fit the points in fig 5 we obtained the equation 1 y 0 0083 x 2 0 62 x 1 06 to fit the relationship of the temperatures with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 88 this equation was used to transform the yearly minimum temperature of laizhou city to that of the project site for the past 60 years the result of the transformation is exhibited in section 3 2 4 computation of the effective ice temperature assuming that the heat conduction of sea ice cover remained stable under the persistent action of the minimum air temperature we derived the following identities frankenstein and garner 1967 2 q k t w t a α 1 t w t iw α 2 t ia t a λ h t iw t ia where q is the heat flux kj m2 h k is the heat transfer coefficient kj m2 h k t w is the sea water temperature c t a is the air temperature c t iw is the temperature of the interface between ice and sea water c t ia is the temperature of the interface between ice and air c and α 1 and α 2 are the proposed coefficients kj m2 h k furthermore the heat transfer coefficient can be expressed as 3 k α 1 1 λ 1 h α 2 1 1 where λ is the heat conductive coefficient kj m2 h and h is the sea ice thickness m according to reference wu et al 2001 we set α 1 522 5 kj m2 h k α 2 196 5 kj m2 h k λ 84 0 kj m h and t w 1 4 c for the bohai sea then t ia and t iw were computed as follows 4 t ia k t w t a α 2 t a 5 t iw t w k t w t a α 1 under the assumption that the distribution of ice temperature is linear we assumed the midpoint temperature to be the effective sea ice temperature thus 6 t e t ia t iw 2 the above deduction showed that the computation of the effective sea ice temperature necessitated the air temperature and sea ice thickness of the rp 2 5 uniaxial compression and three point bending experiments we carried out a mechanical property experiment to investigate the strength of sea ice in the winter of 2019 which was a warm winter over laizhou bay thus it was not easy to search for level ice that satisfied the requirements of this study finally we confirmed the sampling site marked in fig 2 for this experiment the sampling point was approximately 25 km from the project site level ice with an average thickness of approximately 15 cm existed the salinity of sea water was 21 ppt at the sampling point when the samples were prepared for the experiment the air temperature ice temperature and sea water temperature were 3 7 c 2 c and 0 1 c respectively the sea ice block was cut off from the ice cover and transported to the low temperature laboratory as shown in fig 6 uniaxial compression and three point bending experiments were performed to determine the sea ice compression and bending strengths these two mechanical parameters maintain a close relationship with ocean engineering designs to follow the suggestion that the ratio of height to width should approach 2 5 timco and weeks 2010 we finely processed the ice specimen to the dimensions of 70 mm 70 mm 175 mm a a h for the uniaxial compression experiment as shown in fig 6 a the compression strength was determined by the following equation 7 σ c f max a 2 a specimens of 70 mm 70 mm 500 mm b h l was adopted for the three point bending process in fig 6 b the l h ratio of 7 10 ensured the hypothesis of the beam deformation of the beam we computed the bending strength as follows 8 σ b 3 2 p max l b h 2 the experiment was carried out in low temperature laboratory the environmental temperatures were controlled around 15 10 and 5 c this manipulation helped form different temperatures of sea ice in total there were 25 specimens for the uniaxial compression experiment and 24 specimens for the three point bending experiment 3 results 3 1 ice period of the project site in general the ice period started at the freeze up date continued through the heavy ice and melting ice dates and ended at the breakup date corresponding to these four dates the ice period consisted of three stages freezing stage heavy ice stage and melting ice stage the freeze up date was the first day that we observed sea ice in satellite images and the breakup date was the last day that we observed sea ice in satellite images however there has been no definition to exactly specify the heavy ice date and melting ice date we combined satellite images numerical models and subjective judgement to estimate these two dates here coverage and longevity were the two most important factors under consideration the basic statistical parameters of these four ice dates are listed in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the ice period was concentrated in early january to mid february corresponding to the four types of dates their mean and median dates were in chronological order however the distributions of the ice dates were quite variable they occupied a wide span and largely overlapped with each other this manifested that the interannual variability was significant for those four types of ice dates for example the freeze up dates extended from jan 14th to feb 25th with a length of 43 days the freeze up date heavy ice date and melting ice date all occurred between january 10th and 28th these 19 days comprised the main part of the ice period at the project site the ice period lasted 21 days on average for the past twenty years from 2001 to 2020 as shown in fig 8 the freezing stage and melting ice stage predominated the ice period evolution the heavy ice stage only accounted for approximately one quarter of the ice period and the longest stage was 18 days in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 which were the most severe ice years in the past twenty years in laizhou bay however the length of each ice stage significantly fluctuated every year fig 8 shows that there were six years without sea ice at the project site in particular five of them occurred in the past seven years from 2014 to 2020 the ice period maintained a close relationship with ice degrades in laizhou bay 3 2 probability density function of sea ice velocity and thickness velocities less than 12 cm s and thicknesses of 5 15 cm appeared most frequently at the project site the means of sea ice velocity and thickness were 10 03 cm s and 9 98 cm respectively both exhibited an asymmetrical distribution the thickness tended to be slightly larger than the mean while the velocity evidently inclined toward lower values and comprised many extreme data fig 9 shows the distribution of the flow direction at the project site the predominant directions were nearly northeast for offshore flow ice and nearly southwest for onshore flow ice with reference to fig 9 the predominant direction of flowing ice was almost perpendicular to the coastline the direction distribution was tightly associated with predominant winter currents and winds in laizhou bay we divided the velocity data into 12 groups with a bin of 5 cm s to estimate the pdf as shown in fig 10 a monotonic function may be applicable to fit the pdf we attempted an exponential distribution f v λ e λ v v 0 to simulate the observed density and obtained the rate parameter λ 0 084 and the determinant coefficient r 2 0 97 so the fitting pdf of the velocity was given as 9 f v 0 084 e 0 084 v v 0 where v represents the magnitude of the flow ice velocity the thicknesses were divided into 19 groups with bin size of 1 cm the inset of fig 11 shows that the sea ice thickness had a skewed distribution with a negative coefficient of skewness of 0 48 this indicated that most of the values were concentrated on the right side of the mean thickness which was 9 98 cm taking into consideration the distribution shape and the coefficient of skewness that was close to zero we conjectured that the log normal distribution may conform to the trend of the thickness pdf however the coefficient of skewness of the log normal distribution was positive so we made a reversal transformation of the thickness values to satisfy this requirement with h 21 h 0 here h 0 represented the sea ice thickness this transformation also considered the maximum thickness of 20 0 cm in our samples the histogram of the reversal transformation is shown in fig 11 then the pdf of h could be fitted by the equation below 10 p h 1 2 π σ h exp 1 2 σ 2 ln h μ 2 h 0 where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of ln h respectively as shown in fig 11 we used nonlinear fitting to obtain μ 2 35 and σ 0 40 with a determinant coefficient r 2 0 77 3 3 sea ice thickness of return period the sea ice thickness of the rp is a key element to be considered by ocean engineering in cold regions the probability of thickness h h p can be expressed as 11 p h h p 1 h p f h d h where h p is the specified thickness of sea ice and f h is the pdf of sea ice thickness then the rp of n years for sea ice thickness satisfies the equation below 12 n 1 p 1 p h h p where p is the design frequency of the thickness in general p was set to 0 2 0 1 0 05 0 02 and 0 01 corresponding to rp values of n 5 10 20 50 and 100 years we used a pearson iii distribution to estimate the rp of n years the pdf of the pearson iii distribution included two undetermined parameters α and β as 13 f h β α γ α h α 1 e β h 0 h based on the yearly maximum thicknesses from the past twenty years we calculated α 1 11 and β 0 134 as shown in fig 12 the anticipated extreme sea ice thicknesses were between 13 0 and 34 6 for n 5 100 years for the project site as listed in table 2 3 4 air temperature and effective ice temperature the theory in section 2 4 showed that air temperature was a prerequisite for the computation of the effective ice temperature the minimum temperature t 1 of laizhou city is displayed in fig 13 we interpolated t 1 into the minimum temperature t 2 of the project site through quadratic function 1 as shown in fig 13 t 2 was raised from the t 1 curve which signifies that the temperature of the project site was universally and significantly higher than that of laizhou city however both of the minimum temperatures had an increasing trend for the past twenty years similar to the computation of the rp for the thickness we adopted a pearson iii distribution with two parameters α and β to estimate the rp of the temperatures see fig 14 we obtained α 12 83 and β 1 78 for the temperature of the project site as shown in fig 14 curve t 2 remained almost equidistance from the curve t 1 the rp temperatures of n 5 100 years were 12 7 8 8 c and 18 0 13 5 c for t 1 and t 2 respectively two types of rp maintained a narrow range of less than 5 c for n 5 100 years the rp of the thickness h and the air temperature t 1 were needed to compute the rp of the effective sea ice temperature h was used to calculate the heat transfer coefficient k in equations 4 and 5 and the air temperature followed t a t 1 we assumed that the rps of h and t 1 occurred at the same time because the sea ice thickness had a close relationship with the air temperature therefore we substituted h and t 1 into equation 6 to obtain the rp of the effective ice temperature t e which was a key parameter to compute the rp of sea ice strength as expected the environmental temperature should be frequently lower than the ice temperature and the sea surface temperature should be higher than that of the land under extreme low temperature conditions therefore these three types of rps performed well with t e t 1 t 2 for every column in table 3 moreover t e preserved a very good linear relationship with t 1 and t 2 as shown in fig 15 so the air temperature of the land adjacent to the project site could provide a good clue to estimate the rp of the effective ice temperature 3 5 sea ice strength and its rp sea ice compression strength and bending strength were the two most important parameters for wpfs in cold regions sinsabvarodom et al 2020 based on the effective ice temperature in section 3 4 the brine volume was determined with frankenstein and garner 1967 14 v b s i 0 532 49 185 t i 22 9 c t i 0 5 c where t i is the ice temperature c and s i is the ice salinity s i was measured at the sampling site and was between 1 5 ppt an average brine volume 3 64 ppt was adopted in our computation here the method for computing the compression strength σ c in reference wu et al 2001 was as follows 15 σ c 4 42 0 30 v b in accordance with reference ji et al 2011 the bending strength σ f can be expressed as an exponential form of v b as shown below 16 σ f 2 41 exp 4 29 v b with s i and t i known in equation 14 we obtained the compression strength and bending strength for the specified rp which are listed in table 4 the boxplots of the sea ice strength are shown in fig 16 for the mechanical experiment the compression strength was of high discreteness and covered the range from 1 0 mpa to 3 0 mpa with a mean of 2 20 mpa the bending strength centered at a mean of 1 07 mpa with a range of 0 6 1 5 mpa compared with the boxplot of the experimental data the compression of the rp tended to approach large values while the bending strengths were close to the average level overall the computed strengths of the rp were all within the ranges of the experimental data 4 discussion 4 1 pdfs of the velocity and thickness bin size plays an important role in the estimation of the pdf different bin sizes may influence the shape of the histogram which is fundamental to derive the pdf from the sampling data our selection considered the model of the pdf and the number of divided groups the bin sizes guaranteed the goodness of fit with determinant coefficients r 2 of 0 77 and 0 97 for the thickness and velocity respectively furthermore we used the empirical probability density function epdf to investigate the influence of the fitting of the histogram the epdf can be fitted by using a nonparametric density estimation method such as the kernel density estimation so it was not a prerequisite of the bin size to group the sampling data figs 17 and 18 show that the distribution of the epdf conforms well to the typical distributions which were computed based on the bin sizes in figs 10 and 11 to quantitatively evaluate comparability we adopted the log normal and exponential models of the pdf to fit the epdf in figs 17 and 18 the two types of fitting functions agree very well therefore our selection of bin size is appropriate to compute the pdf of the sea ice velocity and thickness here we applied the transformation h 21 h 0 to better fit the log normal distribution which was used to estimate the pdf of the thickness in bohai bay ji et al 2002 this transformation considered the maximum thickness 20 cm of the database from the sea ice forecasting model for the past 21 years the maximum thickness has not reached the level of the 20 year rp 23 cm this situation is expected to continue with a high probability due to global warming the exponential distribution of the velocity reveals that the owf is located in the sea area where the sea ice dynamics are relatively weak with most velocities less than 15 cm s zhang et al 2019 the depth of laizhou bay is mainly less than 10 m with a flat seabed and the narrow bay mouth limits exchange with the outer sea hainbucher et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2016 therefore a weak hydrodynamics environment exists which remains strongly correlated with sea ice dynamics in ocean engineering a joint pdf of velocity and thickness is desired to design offshore structures we first inspected the correlation of the thickness with the velocity of sea ice to accomplish this we used spearman s correlation coefficient ρ one reason was that the thickness and velocity did not follow a gaussian distribution another reason was that ρ could probe the nonlinear monotonic association we obtained ρ 0 14 which showed that the correlation was very weak or null moreover hoeffding s independence test was carried out it is a nonparametric test to detect a wide variety of dependence structures beyond monotonic association we computed hoeffding s measure of dependence d 0 01 which signifies that the two variables were almost independent in engineering we could hereby accept the approximation that the velocity is independent of the thickness subsequently the joint pdf was simply calculated by f v p h which is shown in fig 19 however it is not always applicable to fit ice velocity or thickness to the standard pdfs occasionally the collected data sample does not match any known probability distribution even with the assistance of data transforms and the parameterization of the distribution function in this paper the sample of data does not satisfy any existing distribution in addition the velocity and thickness may not be simply regarded as independent variables under some conditions of ocean dynamics and topography therefore it is inapplicable to multiply two pdfs to obtain the joint pdf of sea ice velocity and thickness instead of fitting the pdfs the epdf can directly use a nonparametric density estimation method to accomplish the middle part of the scheme in fig 1 4 2 the distribution and trend of sea ice strengths as shown in fig 16 some experimental strengths surpassed the sea ice strengths of the 100 year rp in particular the bending strength only reached the average level of the strengths derived from the experiment in this experiment the sea ice specimens were maintained for at least 24 h at a constant temperature this manipulation basically guaranteed the same temperature of the specimens as that of the storage environment in this study the minimum environmental temperature was set to at least 5 c in a low temperature laboratory whereas the effective ice temperature was only 5 44 c for the 100 year rp the seas ice strength was quite sensitive to temperature with a negative correlation a lower temperature indicates a higher strength this analysis was mainly based on the air temperature of the past sixty years and the sea ice parameters of the past twenty years in fig 13 we can observe the increasing trend of the air temperature with significant fluctuation for those years during winter the air temperature of the project site increases at a rate of 0 416 c per decade which is near the mean state of 0 382 c per decade of laizhou bay ouyang et al 2017 yan et al 2017 obviously global warming influences the local conditions of the bohai sea to some degree gong et al 2007 therefore the sea ice condition of laizhou bay become less heavy with some fluctuations which is also manifested by the data from satellite images and field observations yan et al 2020 in particular the frequency of the zero ice year significantly increases for the past ten years as shown in fig 8 due to the relatively stable sea ice dynamics of the owf rafted and ridged ice are rarely observed within the owf the thickness of rafted ice may be ignored for the design of owts otherwise a safety coefficient of 1 5 should be sufficient to guarantee the safety of the designed thickness if global warming continues the sea ice strengths and thickness are anticipated to exhibit a declining trend for the design of owfs 5 conclusion in summary we developed a scheme to appraise sea ice conditions for the design parameters of owfs this procedure was carried out for the owf in the bohai sea the ice period lasts 21 days on average and the days from january 10th to 28th should be carefully considered for the project the directions of the flowing ice are concentrated in the northeast and southwest the pdf of ice velocity obeys an exponential distribution which is characterized by the dominance of relatively low values these characteristics are manifested in the low dynamics of sea ice at the project site the thickness is mainly between 5 cm and 15 cm and its pdf is captured by the log normal distribution through the data transformation the velocity is very low and is independence of the thickness so their joint pdf can be obtained by multiplying the two marginal pdfs the extreme thickness of the rp is also given depending on the pearson iii distribution of two parameters moreover combining the thickness and effective ice temperature of the rp we compute the rp of bending and compression strengths for wind turbine towers the calculated strengths are also verified by comparison with the experimental results these should be regarded as index strengths and may not be appropriate for direct use in ice load calculations how index strengths can be used to modify ice load algorithms is discussed in iso 19906 2019 overall the influence of sea ice on the owf is diminishing in the bohai sea under the background of a globally warming climate our scheme is easily implemented and can provide complete information for the owf from the design and construction stages to the operation stage with a slight alteration this scheme is applicable to other offshore projects that have similar structures and confront similar challenges as owfs in cold regions however the scheme mainly appraise the level ice parameters if pressure ridges are present then the scheme will need to be further developed to include them credit authorship contribution statement anliang wang conceptualization methodology writing original draft writing
