1410,this paper focuses on the multi objective optimization of the groundwater extraction scheme in the bouein myandasht aquifer iran in order to reduce the concentration of nitrate originating from agricultural activities and wastewater absorbent wells a simulation optimization model coupling an artificial neural network ann as the simulator with the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii as the optimizer are employed the simulator is trained by help of data generated by process based simulation models for groundwater flow modflow and solute transport mt3d the optimization objectives include 1 minimizing the contamination concentration and 2 maximizing the net benefit of the agricultural activities the outcome of the simulation optimization model is an optimized management strategy formed by the optimal values of the optimization parameters searched and obtained consisting of 1 seasonal groundwater extraction volume 2 the ratio of the wastewater which should be treated before being leached into the groundwater through the absorbent wells 3 the ratio of the fertilizers consumption and 4 the cultivated area for each of the main crops in the study area the results of the model suggest a groundwater extraction policy fulfilling the objectives of the optimization the optimal operating policy also indicates that a partly conflicting relation exists between minimizing the risk of groundwater contamination and maximizing the net benefits of the agricultural activities hence the focus of this paper is at finding the better and better pareto fronts in the objective space while dealing with the parts of the objective functions with less conflict to reach the optimal pareto front on which the full conflict between the objectives is held then an entropy based trade off reflected in designating a couple of weights assigned to the couple of objectives calculated for each solution in the bi objective space is held over the solutions lying on the optimal pareto front and finally the favorite solution minimizing the weighted distance to the ideal point in the objective space is achieved using the topsis method with this policy the regional nitrate concentration will be decreased by 36 7 20 45 and 21 6 in the first second and third study sub areas respectively as compared to those in the actual operation furthermore the model suggests 15 12 and 9 wastewater treatment and also 9 6 and 7 decrease in the fertilizer use in the first second and third study sub areas respectively keywords groundwater modeling nitrate contamination crop pattern planning multi objective optimization nsga ii artificial neural network ann 1 introduction the agricultural sectors are the major consumers of the nitrogen in the world nitrogen over exploitation is rated as a threat to the drinking water one of the main compounds of nitrogen is nitrate on the other hand the nitrate is taken into account as a predominant and prevalent pollutant contaminating the groundwater resources the existence of the nitrate in the aquifers is mainly resulting from the anthropogenic activities such as the use of the chemical fertilizers containing the nitrate the faulty wastewater treatment plants and improper disposal of the industrial anthropogenic and the animal trashes in nature therefore it is necessary to reduce the nitrate contamination concentration to prevent the groundwater contamination crisis in the future there is a wide range of applications of metamodels to simulate the parameters affecting the groundwater quality in groundwater management a metamodel also called a surrogate model e g asher et al 2015 is a computationally efficient surrogate for a more detailed numerical model these models are often recommended to be used for sensitivity analysis of the physics based numerical simulation models although metamodels do not directly deal with the sophistication of the numerical models they can be efficiently applied to numerically simulate the natural processes provided that sufficient data would be generated or prepared by the numerical models for the training of the metamodels the performance of the metamodels mainly depends on having a large range of data samples such that the range of the conditions the metamodels may be encountered in simulation have already existed in their training data such a set of training data may be generated from a series of numerical model runs over a range of conditions then a statistical learning technique is selected to train the metamodel such as a bayesian network bn an artificial neural network ann or support vector machine svm based on data derived from the numerical model fienen et al 2015 the metamodels benefit from two major advantages over commonly used physics based numerical models 1 reaching approximate decisions faster than a full numerical model and 2 they can rapidly develop screening level insights especially in an unmodeled study area fienen et al 2018 in other words the speed of imperfect but reasonable predictions often 60 to more than 90 of the insight from the process based numerical model nolan et al 2012 fienen and plant 2014 is more valuable for screening sometimes than more precise predictions requiring long runtimes these are several advantages of metamodels over the numerical simulation models making metamodels popular and widely used models in the simulation tasks even though the metamodels require the numerical physics based models to generate a series of accurate data for training them the advantages of using the metamodels are still preserved in fact linking the metamodels instead of the numerical ones to the optimizers to do the optimization tasks is of some advantages due to a large number of function evaluations fes there are to be accomplished when running the optimizers actually the metamodels require far less expensive computations as compared to the numerical simulation models when passing these fes endowing a considerable superiority to these models in this case in a study fienen et al 2016 developed a groundwater flow metamodel emulated using a bayesian network bn an artificial neural network ann and a gradient boosted regression tree gbrt constructed based on a dataset of the input and output of each of the metamodels generated by numerical models the aim was to evaluate the surface water depletion expressed as the source of water to wells in the lake michigan basin usa the results indicated the main choice between ann gbrt and the bn approach is a matter of preference and goals for the final outcome in another applied research on metamodels fienen et al 2018 used a gradient boosted regression tree statistical metamodel trained by the data derived from modflow modpath numerical models to estimate groundwater age for a glacial aquifer system in the lake michigan basin which is so large and discontinuous that a single numerical physics based model is unable to handle the results indicated that metamodels are capturing much of the system behavior inherent in the numerical models they are trained on as another research aiming application of metamodels sepahvand et al 2019 used genetic programming gp as another metamodel to estimate groundwater level drawdown in a semi arid region subject to conjunctive water use the study aimed at proposing an optimal multi crop pattern plan considering the agricultural net benefits to be maximized provided that the groundwater would remain sustained during the aquifer exploitation to supply the part of water demands the surface water failed to supply in the region one of the key factors contributing to hold a good balance between quantity and quality of the groundwater resources may be hidden in conjunctively use of the surface and ground water resources conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater may allow the use of poor quality surface or ground water as the quality of these resources of water can be actually compensated by each other when operating them at the same time singh 2014 in this field of study ejaz and peralta 1995 developed a simulation optimization model to address the conflicts between surface and ground water targeting maximization of steady conjunctive use while maximizing waste loading from a sewage treatment plant to the stream the conjunctive use of poor quality water for irrigation was also studied in different works datta and de jong 2002 kaur et al 2007 mandare et al 2008 and the beneficiaries of conjunctive use of surface and ground water were reflected in some other researches karimov et al 2012 mccallum et al 2013 nikoo et al 2013 there is also a wide range of studies targeting the control of the groundwater quality indicators considering the groundwater as a single source of water supply in the literature srdjevic 2007 applied the integrated social tools sc and analytical hierarchy process ahp to decision making in water resources and environmental management in this study the ahp was first employed as a decision support in one group and then was used in some subgroups while the aggregation was performed by sc at the whole group level the second methodology was found to be more promising in real decision situations pe√±a haro et al 2009 performed a holistic optimization method to determine the spatial and temporal fertilizer uses maximizing the agricultural net benefits subject to some constraints integrating the response matrix to allow simulating by superposition of the cumulative groundwater nitrate concentration of an aquifer resulting from multiple pollutant sources distributed over time and space kerachian et al 2010 proposed a methodology to resolve the conflict of interests among water users water supply and environmental protection agencies existing in conjunctive surface ground water use management minimizing the cost of groundwater pumping and the cost of building the wastewater collection system along with minimizing the nitrate concentration as well as controlling the water rise in the urban area were considered as the main utilities of different sectors involved in the problem the nsga ii was adopted as the optimizer to generate the trade off curves from which the best solution was derived utilizing the rubinstein bargaining theory mulligan et al 2014 utilized the hydraulic control method to revive the quality of groundwater resources they proposed two non linear optimization formulations to design and delineate the location and the rate of the discharge and recharge of the wells to mitigate the contamination concentration in the aquifer furthermore the galerkin two dimensional finite element method was employed as the simulator of the simulation optimization model used in this study pisciotta et al 2015 investigated the nitrate contamination in the aquifer of sicily city in italy the results indicated the role of the land on the nitrate concentration in the aquifers furthermore this study highlighted the domestic and industrial wastewater as the main sources of the pollution of the groundwater exner et al 2014 provided some 44 000 samples polluted to the nitrate to show the extension of the nitrate contamination in the maize cultivated areas in eastern nebraska in this study 1 3 million hectares of the land were modeled in terms of the irrigation and drainage systems the thickness of the saturated layer and the lithology to detect the contaminated areas and then 17 management models were implemented to reduce the nitrate contamination in the focused aquifer farhadi et al 2016 developed a modeling framework to find a sustainable solution for groundwater management in this study an nsga ii optimization model along with an ann model was used to generate a pareto optimal front targeting minimization of the irrigation water deficit maximization of equity in water allocation and finally minimization of the groundwater drawdown as the major conflicting objectives interested by different stakeholders an agent based model was also adopted to establish the social influential factors for the stakeholders to cooperate with the management decisions modified and fed to the nash bargaining model to hold a compromise eshtawi et al 2016 developed a combined swat modflow mt3d model to investigate the surface water and groundwater quality they investigated the responses of the groundwater level the nitrate concentration resulting from the agricultural activities and the chlorine concentration resulting from the seawater intrusion to the expansion of urbanism and the resulting variations in the urban water supply the authors also illustrated the potential of the uncommon water such as the desalination plants flood control the treated wastewater and the climatic change to damage the groundwater resources heydari et al 2016 developed an optimal water allocation model utilizing a quantity and quality simulation model implemented by the artificial neural networks ann and genetic programming gp an nsga ii model was adopted as the optimization model linked to the simulator targeting maximization of the water supply minimization of the groundwater drawdown and minimization of the water quality variations the results suggested a considerable decrease in the groundwater withdrawal along with the decrease of the total dissolved solids tds in the study area alizadeh et al 2017a 2017b developed a fuzzy based nsga ii simulation optimization model in which a monte carlo analysis fed by two physics based quality and quantity simulation models was utilized to generate sufficient data for a surrogate artificial neural network ann simulator a fuzzy transformation method ftm was then adopted to extract the trade off curves accounting for multiple stakeholders finally a fuzzy social choice fsc was used to suggest the best compromise point on the trade off curves to determine a sustainable allocation policy for groundwater management ghaseminejad and shourian 2019 developed a simulation optimization model integrating modflow simulation model and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to simultaneously minimize the cost of drilling pumping transfer and desalination of the pumped groundwater subject to constraints on the control of cumulative groundwater level drawdown as well as the maximum satisfaction of the water demands ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 developed an ant colony based simulation optimization model to tackle the overuse of the groundwater as a common pool resource of water using game theory defining several cooperation scenarios alizadeh et al 2017b utilized a linked nsga ii and m5p model trained and validated by the data provided by monte carlo analysis of calibrated modflow model to yield a simulation optimization model the model was then applied to solve a conflict resolution model of groundwater resource management utilizing social choice rules and fallback bargaining methods this paper aims at proposing a simulation optimization model to quantity quality modeling of an aquifer located in west central iran in the present study the main optimization objectives include 1 minimizing the nitrate contamination concentration and 2 maximizing the agricultural net benefits as can be seen these two objectives are potentially conflicting as minimizing the contamination concentration entails minimizing the groundwater extraction in the periods in which the initial nitrate concentration is high whereas decreasing the groundwater exploitation can degrade the agricultural net benefits especially when knowing that the only source of water to use for the irrigation of the study area of this paper is groundwater and improperly supplying the demands by this source of water can damage the crop yields and thus the net benefit considering the formal objectives of the optimization model the groundwater level is allowed to rise in the time steps in which the initial water quality is not so proper while the groundwater drawdown is somehow permitted when the initial water quality is suitable for drinking purposes as a result and in contrast to a number of the researches reviewed in this section there is not a constant and full prohibition on the groundwater overuse as this prohibition is mainly depending on the water quality level at any time step as well as the crops water stress to relieve the potential shortcomings in the water supply contributing the net benefits not to be declined hence the minimization of the groundwater level drawdowns is an informal goal of this study and is not directly embedded in the objectives of the optimization model the other main contribution of the present study as compared to other studies reviewed in this section is proposing an optimal multi crop pattern plan in accordance with the special circumstances facing the crops in this study in fact the crops should be assigned the appropriate cultivated areas such that the water demands are decreased so as to facilitate the potentially decreased groundwater use to properly supply these demands moreover the optimal multi crop pattern should be designated addressing these two facts depicted as follows 1 the more net benefit of the crops the more cultivated area will be assigned and 2 the more fertilizers used by some crops the less cultivated area will be assigned to those crops furthermore since the nsga ii optimizer generates a pareto front of a large number of the candidate solutions for the developed simulation optimization model in this paper a multi criteria decision analysis is to be adopted to discriminate the best solution offered by the optimal pareto front hence as another difference of this study with similar studies reviewed in this section which have mainly utilized conflict resolution models to extract the best solution in this paper a topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution analysis was carried out for selecting the best solution in which the weights are determined using shannon s entropy analysis which automatically impart importance to each of the objectives of the optimization model with no dependence on the experts knowledge or the prior knowledge on the objectives the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the methodology of this paper including a detailed explanation of the nsga ii as the main multi objective optimization algorithm employed to solve the optimization model presented in this paper in section 2 1 in section 2 2 a detailed step by step multi criteria analysis method is explained to select the best solution among the solutions rendered by the optimization model section 2 3 also presents a method to weighting the criteria used in the multi criteria analysis in order to select the best solution achieved through the optimization process section 3 1 is dedicated to introducing the study area and section 3 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the simulation optimization model introducing and explaining the functionality of the physics based modflow and mt3d models employed to generate data for the artificial neural network ann model as a metamodel used as the major simulator linked to the optimization model section 4 presents the results and discusses them in detail and finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii this algorithm is one of the pioneering multi objective genetic algorithms mogas first proposed by deb et al 2002 as an alternative to the previously proposed non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga proposed by srinivas and deb 1994 and widely used in water resources management literature kerachian et al 2010 farhadi et al 2016 heydari et al 2016 alizadeh et al 2017a 2017b 2019 the main advantages of nsga ii as compared to the nsga can be summarized as follows 1 the computational complexity of the nsga ii is less than that of nsga making this algorithm faster to run 2 a kind of elitism is incorporated to the nsga ii unlike the nsga which lacked such a capability and 3 replacing the hard to tune sharing parameter introduced in the nsga by a crowding distance operator in nsga ii in the nsga ii first several initial random chromosomes are generated to form the first generation of the algorithm then the selection process is implemented such that two or more chromosomes are selected from the population and then compared with each other in terms of both non domination and diversity this process is going on until a population at the size of the first population is generated then the crossover and mutation operators are imposed on the parents to generate new chromosomes now they are named off springs the probability of the crossover is usually taken more than 0 7 in order to local optima avoidance a mutation operator is also imposed on a selected gene the mutation probability is usually set to be less than 0 1 to prevent promising solutions from being degraded in the search space in other words the mutation operator should be cautiously imposed on the solutions so as not to cause the exploitation process to slow down or to be disrupted once a population of the off spring chromosomes is generated the previously generated population and the current population are merged together and then the non dominated sorting operator is implemented on the merged population then the population is halved and the half including the better frontiers is considered as the first half and actually the basic population to generate the next generation of the chromosomes then the new generation forms the mating pool containing the parents and the parents produce the off springs by performing the crossover and mutation and this process is going on until the stopping criterion is met deb et al 2002 as mentioned before after merging each generation with the next generation the frontiers must be composed on the other hand each chromosome in the merged population must be compared to any of the other chromosomes to make clear if it is a member of the current frontier or not in addition the comparison would be done with respect to all of the objectives when composing the first frontier one can figure out that this process is of the most computational complexity to be done hence if the number of the chromosomes or the population size of the algorithm is assumed to be n and the number of the objectives are assumed to be m then the dominant computational complexity of the nsga ii algorithm would be o mn 2 note that in this paper the nsga ii is implemented using a matlab code derived from faradars an educational website for the academic courses in persian 2 2 topsis multi criteria analysis since there is a number of points solutions found on the optimal pareto front generated by nsga ii one may desire to select the optimal solution on the pareto as the final result of the multi objective optimization process the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis first introduced by yoon and hwang 1995 is one of the popular multi criteria decision making methods especially applied to water resources management zahedi et al 2017 li et al 2018 ghazali et al 2018 gorgij et al 2019 there are a number of alternatives and a number of criteria for decision making in topsis utilizing topsis every point is attributed a relative score then the points alternative solutions are all ranked with respect to their relative scores and the best solution having the highest rank is chosen as the optimal final solution generated by the optimization the main steps of the topsis method are as follows step 1 form the decision matrix involving the numerical criteria in each alternative step 2 normalize the decision matrix through eq 1 1 n ij r ij i r ij 2 where r ij stands for the value assigned to the ith alternative in the jth criterion and n ij denotes the normalized value of the ith alternative in the jth criterion step 3 calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix through eq 2 2 v n d w n n where w n n is a diagonal weighting matrix including n weights in 0 1 corresponding to n criteria step 4 designate the hypothetical ideal and anti ideal alternative solutions in the multi criteria space through eqs 3 4 3 v j max j j v ij min j j v ij i 1 2 m 4 v j min j j v ij max j j v ij i 1 2 m step 5 calculate the distance between each alternative to the ideal and anti ideal solutions denoted by s i and s i respectively through eqs 5 6 5 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 2 m 6 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 2 m step 6 calculate the score of an alternative as the degree of its closeness to the anti ideal alternative denoted by c i through eq 7 7 c i s i s i s i step 7 rank the alternatives with respect to the value of c i such that the alternative having the highest c i is assigned the highest rank and the alternative with the lowest c i receives the lowest rank the higher the rank of an alternative solution the more desirable it will be in this paper the topsis analysis is utilized as a method to select the best solution among a number of solutions with respect to multiple criteria objectives after the optimal pareto front consisting of a number of solutions is generated by nsga ii 2 3 shannon s entropy for weighting the criteria when designating all of the decision making data the entropy method may be employed for weighting the criteria involved in the decision making process in the information theory the entropy is rated as an uncertainty measure expressed by a probability distribution function the measurement of this uncertainty was first accomplished by shannon 1948 hence the name shannon entropy was adopted for this method the steps of implementing the shannon entropy are as follows step 1 form the decision matrix step 2 normalize the decision matrix denote each element of this matrix by p ij step 3 calculating the entropy of each of the criteria the entropy is denoted by e j and the constant parameter k holds the amount of e j in 0 1 the e j can be obtained as follows 8 e j k i 1 m p ij lnp ij i 1 2 m step 4 calculate the degree of deviation of each criterion denoted by d j indicating how many significant data each of the criteria give to the decision maker for making his her final decision in general the less different the numerical values of a focused criterion the more the similarity among the competitive alternatives with respect to that criterion and thus the less the weight assigned to that criterion will be in this way the role of that criterion in decision making is accordingly decreased therefore the value of d j can be calculated as follows 9 d j 1 e j step 5 finally the weight of the jth criterion denoted by w j can be calculated as follows 10 w j d j d j a general flowchart of the management model used in this study can be seen in fig 1 3 case study 3 1 introduction of the study area in this paper the study area is bouein myandasht sub basin located at the northwestern of the gavkhouni river basin in west central iran this study area consists of the main plain covering an alluvial aquifer the total area of this sub basin is 981 km2 and the area of the alluvial aquifer is rated as 498 km2 the highest point at this area is located at the northern heights and is 3735 m high and the lowest point is located at the south of the plain being 2075 m lower from the surface of the free seas fig 2 displays the study area and its location in the greater gavkhouni river basin the precipitation in the study area annually ranges from 400 to 689 mm in the interval of 2010 2011 through the 2015 2016 hydrological years on average march benefits from the most precipitation in the study area with the precipitation of 87 1 mm in the heights and 72 8 mm in the plain the discharging wells amount to 651 wells with the annual discharge of 110 8 million cubic meters mcm in the 2010 2011 hydrological year in addition there are 751 springs discharging aquifer by 10 2 mcm as well as 88 qanats discharging 6 8 mcm in the 2010 2011 hydrological year it is noteworthy that qanat is an iranian ancient system of water supply which simply is a gently sloping underground channel to transport water from an aquifer or water well to surface for irrigation and drinking purposes acting as an underground aqueduct with a series of vertical access shafts the water consumption in the agricultural sector is rated as 175 6 mcm the drinking water amounts to 4 6 mcm and the industrial sector consumes a value of 0 5 mcm per year iran s water resources management company 2015 table 1 shows groundwater balance in this aquifer that indicated 22 3 mcm change in groundwater volume in the 2010 2011 hydrological year fig 3 indicates a more detailed scheme of the study area including plain boundary aquifer boundary and location of wells qanats springs absorbent wells and piezometers it should be noted that some springs qanats and wells are located outside the aquifer but are located in the plain which are karst type the nitrate can contaminate the aquifer and degrade the groundwater quality in the study area in three ways 1 leaching into the aquifer by the irrigation return flow 2 infiltration into the aquifer from the wastewater absorbent wells and 3 inflow into the aquifer across the boundaries to the adjacent aquifers 3 2 the simulation optimization model the simulation optimization model employed to solve the groundwater management problem of this paper can be formulated as follows as can be seen the optimization model consists of two main goals 1 minimizing the contamination concentration leached to the aquifer and 2 maximizing the total agricultural net benefits as a result both quantity and quality indicators prevailing in the water resources management in an agricultural area are offered in the formulation of the problem eqs 11 to 18 mathematically express the model furthermore a detailed scheme of the simulation optimization management model developed in this study can be seen in fig 4 11

planning period ha a ic max maximum cultivated area of the cth crop in the ith year in the planning period ha in the simulation optimization model formulation the first objective attempts to minimize the contamination concentration of the nitrate the minimization of this goal is performed when the total groundwater extraction is decreased as knowing that the less the groundwater extraction in all of the time steps the more the volume of the groundwater kept in the aquifer to dilute the nitrate load and thus the less the nitrate concentration will be then less groundwater should be extracted from the aquifer in the time steps whose initial nitrate concentration is higher and more groundwater should be extracted when the initial nitrate concentration is lower the second objective is to maximize the net benefit achieved by the farmers through agricultural activities this objective considers the costs of the crop cultivation the cost of the groundwater pumping and also the price of the water used and the crops the net benefits are all converted to the last year of the planning period with respect to the inflation rate in the region to better compare and add the net benefits of different years in order to reach the total net benefit the stakeholder of the first objective is the regional water company which monitors the quality of the groundwater used to drinking purposes the stakeholder of the second objective is the agricultural organization these two objectives are partly conflicting to each other especially when the nitrate concentration is high in the time steps in which the water demands are also high in this case the groundwater extraction is decided to be reduced to decrease the contamination concentration while there is a significant need to supply the water demands in order to achieve the maximum net benefits on the other hand the model tends to reduce the water demands in order to better supply the demands and increase the crop yields and the consequent net benefits for this purpose the more cultivated area should be assigned to the less water consuming crops and vice versa however the problems arise if the less water consuming crops are among the less beneficial crops as well in this way the net benefit is degraded this analysis shows that a compromise must be held between water consumption and the net benefit achieved by the agricultural sector and highlights the multi crop pattern planning as a necessary and at the same time very difficult task due to the numerous conflicting aspects involved in it affecting the water resources management purposes for the simulation of the quantity and quality indicators of the aquifer two physics based models including modflow and mt3d models are employed to implement these models first the map of the bouein myandasht aquifer was imported to the gis environment and then it was inserted into the groundwater simulation model gms aquaveo 2020 which in turn comprises modflow and mt3d as the quantity and quality simulation sub models respectively then the hydraulic boundaries were needed to be designated these boundaries are visible when drawing the isopotential groundwater paths by the modflow model as can be seen in fig 7 the aquifer involves 10 groundwater inflow boundary and only one outflow boundary data for 23 piezometers in adjacent aquifers were used for the general head boundary ghb boundary conditions in the modflow model in this figure the arrows indicate the boundaries with the constant flux and the other boundaries not pointed out with the arrows can be taken into account as no flow boundary conditions the hydraulic heads at each of the inflow outflow boundaries are defined and inserted to the modflow model based upon the hydraulic head data depicted in the official reports explaining the characteristics of the study area of this paper the inflow and outflow of the groundwater rates are also calculated by the modflow model using conducting the water balance process in the study area based on the observed data imported to the software in fig 7 the groundwater flow paths are perpendicular to the isopotential paths in this study all stress periods are considered four 3 month periods per hydrological year except for the steady state period of the groundwater appearing in the initial year 2010 2011 the simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater was carried out from 2010 to 2011 to the 2014 2015 hydrological years utilizing the mt3d model data for 8 sampling wells were used for initial concentration of nitrate in the aquifer the year 2010 2011 was taken into account as a steady period and the rest of the simulation period was assumed as an unsteady period and divided into 16 seasons each of which is representing one stress sub period the first three years of the unsteady period were considered for the calibration of the model and the fourth year was used for validating the simulation model the calibration parameters of the modflow model are hydraulic conductivity and specific yield the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated and estimated by the model run in the steady state initial year 2010 2011 while the specific yield was calibrated over the remaining unsteady years furthermore the recharge from the wastewater recharge from the agricultural return flow and recharge from the precipitation are also imported into the modflow model along with the groundwater discharge in a trial and error procedure to be assured of the accuracy of especially the total recharge value in this trial and error procedure the whole study area is divided into several polygons for each of which the required parameters including the seasonal inputs of the model derived from the reasonable ranges reported in the official surveys and the assumed constant calibrated parameters are defined and inserted to the model prior to run the model in the calibration phase at each iteration thus we incorporated as much information from the observations as possible to calibrate the simulation models furthermore the calibration of the mt3d model includes the estimation of the effective molecular diffusion coefficient longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the sorption distribution coefficient it is worth mentioning that although the degradation of nitrate in groundwater is an important process it is most commonly only included in a lumped approach in nutrient modeling studies especially on a large scale some local studies exist on how much and where nitrogen is degraded in the groundwater but many parameters such as soil texture the build up of soil organic matter land use and root zone characteristics are affecting degradation processes because it isn t the main focus of this research we did not directly consider the degradation of nitrate but in the process of calibration of mt3d was practically applied the results of the calibration of modflow and mt3d models include three criteria mean error me mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for the groundwater level and the nitrate concentration respectively as these performance criteria suggest the calibration of modflow yields the me equal to 0 42 m the mae equal to 1 79 m and the rmse equal to 2 6 m since all of these errors are less than the 20 of the aquifer thickness they are found acceptable and show a good calibration being done the calibration of mt3d also yields the me equal to 0 25 mg l the mae equal to 4 2 mg l and the rmse equal to 5 8 mg l since the mt3d reached the errors not exceeding the 20 of the standard contamination concentration depicted as 50 mg l the calibration process for this model can also be verified fig 8 displays the hydraulic conductivity spatial map obtained by simulation after the calibration process is accomplished the other main parameter calibrated is the specific yield the spatial map of this parameter can be seen in fig 9 the porosity is also varying between 0 15 and 0 23 after being calibrated in the study area the initial concentration of nitrate in the study area were used from 8 sampling wells fig 10 and was obtained equal to 25 71 mg l on average and at the end of simulation period winter 2015 obtained by mt3d model increasing to averagely 35 88 mg l fig 11 the main reasons accounting for the increase of the nitrate concentration by lapse of the time include 1 the increase of the nitrate holding fertilizers used by the farmers on the one hand and 2 the increase of the population of the rural regions producing untreated wastewater to be subjected by the aquifer on the other hand for facilitating the linkage between the simulation and optimization models as well as reducing the computational cost of the management model two multi layer perceptron feedforward neural network mlpfnn models implemented using the matlab neural net fitting tool were developed as the metamodels to simulate both the water quality and water quantity parameters required in every step of the optimization process after generating an adequate and accurate series of data including the groundwater level and the nitrate concentration calculated by modflow and mt3d models respectively to be used as the inputs and outputs of the mlpfnn models therefore one mlpfnn model was developed for estimating the groundwater level as a quantity indicator and another was developed for predicting the nitrate concentration as a quality indicator these models have an exchange with each other in other words the output of the mlpfnn estimating the groundwater level at a certain time step is used as one of the inputs of the mlpfnn estimating the nitrate concentration at the next time step however the output of the mlpfnn used for simulating the groundwater level at a certain time step is used as one of the inputs of the same mlpfnn to estimate its output at the next time step these models include one input layer one hidden layer comprising 10 neurons and one output layer representing the groundwater level in one model and the nitrate concentration in the other one the network is trained by levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm widely used for this task the tansig and purlin are adopted as the transfer functions of the hidden and output layers of the mlpfnn the input data include 95 hydrological and meteorological data series covering a variety of the climatic conditions such as wet normal and dry hydrological years in this way the mlpfnn can experience all hydrological conditions in its training data to be enabled to generalize the estimated relation it holds between the inputs and the simulated outputs to every arbitrary data series as knowing the mlpfnn can only interpolate the data by which it is trained an amount of 65 of all data was used for training 25 for validation and 10 was used for the test stage the input data series includes seven features as follows 1 the amount of the agricultural return flow and the precipitation quantity recharging the aquifer eq 19 calculates this feature 19 a is c 1 5 a ic cd sc 10 per 3650000 c 1 5 a ic where a is the aquifer recharge in m day per a coefficient used to calibrate the amount of infiltration of the water supplied regarding the soil characteristics and ratio of water infiltrating the focused aquifer and cd sc net water demand per unit cultivated area in mm 2 the contamination concentration at the surface which can be accompanied with the irrigation return flow to infiltrate the aquifer eq 20 depicts the way to calculate this feature 20 b is c 1 5 k c r 2 pper cd sc 10 where b is contamination concentration at the surface in mg l r 2 the ratio of the fertilizer infiltrating the aquifer taken into account as a decision variable and laid in 0 8 1 pper a coefficient used in order to calibrate the rate of contamination infiltration and k c is the amount of the fertilizer used for each crop in kg ha 3 the volume of groundwater discharge across the aquifer in m3 day 4 the initial groundwater level in m 5 the initial nitrate concentration in the aquifer in mg l 6 the volume of the wastewater recharging the aquifer through the absorbent wells in m3 day 7 the nitrate concentration of the wastewater recharging the aquifer through the absorbent wells in mg l since a part of the aquifer contamination is resulting from the absorbent wells the man made wastewater should be treated in order to reduce the nitrate concentration leached to the aquifer the rate of this treatment denoted by r 1 is multiplied by the nitrate concentration in the absorbent wells and presented to the mlpfnn thus this rate of treatment is taken into account as a decision variable and set to be in the range of 0 75 1 therefore the cultivated areas a ic the seasonal groundwater extraction volumes gw is r 1 and r 2 are all the decision variables of the optimization model and must be set through a multi objective optimization process for nsga ii the probability of crossover was set to 0 7 and the probability of mutation was set to 0 008 as is discussed in the methodology section furthermore an amount of 100 generations each of which includes 500 chromosomes were set for applying nsga ii for doing optimization in all regions of the study area 4 results and discussion in order to enhance the accuracy of the simulation optimization model used in this study the bouein myandasht aquifer is divided into three zones as shown in fig 3 the difference in the aquifer characteristics including the geographical distribution the amount of the precipitation the number of the wells and also the spatial variations of the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and the porosity of these three regions are all the reasons necessitating this regionalization of the study area fig 12 depicts the optimal pareto fronts obtained by the simulation optimization models for all regions in the study area figs 13 to 15 display the time series of the observed and optimized nitrate concentration at the end of each time step in the planning period over different regions of the study area training the simulation model the total correlation coefficients of the mlpfnn model with the groundwater level as the output were obtained equal to 0 9301 0 92672 and 0 99105 for the first second and third regions respectively furthermore the total correlation coefficients of the mlpfnn with the nitrate concentration as the output were achieved as 0 9983 0 9977 and 0 9909 for the first second and third regions respectively in addition the mean square errors mses reached 0 4129 0 3117 and 0 5305 m as the groundwater level was simulated by mlpfnn in the first second and third regions while these figures were achieved as 0 4229 0 3017 and 0 5205 mg l when the mlpfnn model was employed to estimate the nitrate concentration in the first second and third regions respectively the main fact about the application of the mlpfnns in this study is that these models are finally linked to the computationally expensive multi objective optimization model which is executed for a large number of runs to yield the optimal pareto front as the final result of the optimization in other words if we would link the physics based models rather than the mlpfnns to the multi objective optimization model there are a large number of objective function evaluations fes amounting to 50 000 in this study to be done by the optimizer and the physics based models must have to be run per each one of these fes namely for 50 000 times in total which in turn could considerably raise the computational complexity of the whole model as knowing that a computationally expensive procedure is done by these physics based models due to their intrinsic nature meanwhile the physics based models are employed in this study to only generate 95 data series for these models and only run for 95 times additionally there are two mlpfnns replacing two physics based models to be linked to the simulation optimization model and linking these two physics based models to the optimizer can contribute to escalating the problem of the costly computational executions of the linked model therefore the physics based models are used to generate more accurate data to train the mlpfnns and the mlpfnns are linked to the optimizer due to 1 their faster running and 2 the easier linkage to the optimizer as compared to the physics based models in fact the average contamination concentration computed by the simulation optimization model is consistently less than what observed in all regions of the study area such that the contamination is decreased by 14 to 34 against the observed values over the total period the results also indicate that the average actual nitrate concentration is consistently increasing and reaching the value of 42 75 mg l at the end of the planning period while the optimized nitrate concentration reaches 28 4 mg l indicating a 34 decrease in the contamination as compared to the actual conditions in the first region the r 1 multiplied by the nitrate concentration to show treatment of the wastewater flushed through the absorbent wells is set to be 0 85 on the other hand the nitrate concentration in the absorbent wells in the first region is more than that in other regions accordingly most of the nitrate contamination in the first region is due to the contamination resulting from the absorbent wells injecting contamination into the aquifer knowing the urbanization in the first region is much more than that in the other regions the high contamination injected by the absorbent wells in the first region could be justified in overall a decrease rate of 27 in the contamination is obtained by the model in the first region against the actual conditions in the second region the r 1 is determined to be 0 88 meaning that 12 of the domestic wastewater should be treated so as to decrease the nitrate concentration in the aquifer of this region on the other hand the r 2 is obtained equal to 0 94 indicating that the fertilizers used in this region should be decreased by 6 taking these policies the contamination concentration in the second region could be decreased by 13 as compared to what observed in the actual conditions in the third region the r 1 and r 2 are calculated by the model to be 0 91 and 0 93 respectively leading the fertilizers used in the region to be decreased by 115 5 kg ha furthermore the contamination reduction in the third region is to be 4 22 mg l as compared to that in the actual conditions the agricultural activities in the third region are more than two other regions and thus more groundwater is extracted in this region however the contamination in this region is less than that in two other regions the domestic sector producing the wastewater is also less than that in other regions however the less potential of this region to be contaminated could be accounted for by analyzing the aquifer boundaries in the region in fact the length of the common aquifer boundaries between this region and its adjacent aquifers is much more than that for other regions which in turn leads the contamination injected to the aquifer to be more diluted and therefore causes to decrease the contamination concentration another main reason for this behavior of the third region is hidden in its soil characteristics in fact the porosity of the soil in the third region is more than that in other regions contributing to rapidly make the dissolved contaminants move from this region in general the groundwater level computed by the simulation optimization model has risen in any time step as compared to the actual groundwater level mainly due to the management schemes including the decrease of the groundwater pumping crop pattern variations and decrease of the total cultivated area the groundwater level has been increased by 3 07 3 8 3 16 2 8 and 0 87 m over the years 2011 2015 revealing that more appropriate conditions have been provided for the aquifer in these years the figs 16 to 18 show the optimized and observed groundwater extraction volume in three regions of the study area over the whole planning period tables 2 to 4 depict the optimal multi crop pattern plan as the percentage of the total cultivated area in three regions of the study area prior to analyzing this pattern plan it is worth mentioning that the total cultivated area for the whole planning period over the study area is decreased as calculated by the simulation optimization model such that the cultivated area is decreased by 1955 920 and 649 ha in the first second and the third regions respectively this decrease in the total cultivated area is due to using only five dominant crops of the study area in the crop pattern of this study on the one hand the minimum and maximum of the areas allocated to each crop in the actual operation are considered as the bounds of the optimal areas of each crop and on the other hand the price of the crops plays the major role to designate an optimal multi crop pattern as the second goal of the optimization is actually addressing maximization of the net benefit achieved from the agricultural activities for instance in the study area of this paper the potato has a higher price and thus the optimization model shows the most interest to cultivate this crop assigning the maximum annual cultivated area to the potato against other crops participating in the multi crop pattern plan in the first region the maximum net benefits as well as the maximum nitrate contamination concentration are both reached in the 2014 2015 hydrological year in fact in this year most agricultural activities involve the cultivation of the most fertilizer consuming crops such as the potato being assigned 54 75 of the whole area cultivated in this year in the second region the contamination concentration in 2013 2014 is decreased as compared to its previous year however the maximum cultivated area belongs to this year in this region and the less area is assigned to the high fertilizer consuming potato crop in the crop pattern of this year in the second region in the second region the cultivated area allocated to the potato is generally less than that in the first and third regions especially in the last years of the planning period assigning less area to the potato could on the one hand make the net benefit be reduced as knowing the potato is the most beneficial crop in the present multi crop pattern in the region on the other hand the less the area cultivated by the potato the less the nitrate contamination will be as knowing the potato is the most fertilizer consuming crop too furthermore the cultivated areas attributed to different crops in the second region could hold a balance in the crop pattern and cause the pattern to be more diverse as the potato is no longer the dominant crop in this pattern in the second region in the third region the potato is still the dominant crop and the wheat and barley are competing to be assigned more cultivated areas in the hydrological years 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the area allocated to the potato is degraded which in turn contributes the contamination concentration to be decreased as the main source of the groundwater contamination in the third region is the agricultural activities involving potato cultivation in other words the simulation optimization model attempts to assign less cultivated area to the more fertilizer consuming crops while assigning more area to the less fertilizer consuming crops in this way not only the contamination concentration is minimized but also the net benefit is achieved as much as possible in fact the main task of such a simulation optimization model is to hold a proper trade off between the contamination concentration and the net benefit as the two main and conflicting objectives of this study to be optimized 5 conclusion the main goal of this study is to investigate the groundwater contamination concentration in the bouein myandasht aquifer thereby one can take the best management policies to reduce the contamination concentration of the aquifer extracted for the drinking purposes such that the net benefit of the farmers is also accessible as much as possible the model employed in this study is a simulation optimization model whose simulation portion is an artificial neural network ann model benefiting from the data generated by the modflow and mt3d physics based simulators in its training process and the optimization portion is non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii as a multi objective optimization model targeting two main goals 1 minimization of the contamination concentration and 2 maximization of the net benefit the secondary goal of the simulation optimization model is to present an optimal multi crop pattern plan for the study area for the hydrological years 2011 2012 through 2014 2015 the crop pattern obtained suggests the potato as the dominant crop being assigned the most of the cultivated area mainly due to its high prices and despite its role to add a considerable nitrate into the aquifer through consuming immense fertilizers the wheat and barley are ranked after the potato in a close competition since the hydrological year 2012 2013 in which the wheat price has become more than that of the barley the wheat receives more cultivated areas compared to the barley the alfalfa and the onion are ranked at the bottom of the multi crop pattern the reason why the onion is ranked as the last crop in the optimal pattern in spite of being a beneficial crop for the farmers is that the onion is rated as a crop consuming a considerable volume of the fertilizers and thus increasing the nitrate concentration in the groundwater and promoting the risk of drinking such a contaminated groundwater on the other hand the onion has high water requirements and this characteristic can cause its water demand not to be fully met and thus can damage the yield of the crop and reduces the net benefit expected to be achieved by this crop in addition the upper and lower bounds of the cultivated area of the onion were low in the planning period reflecting all of the roles the abovementioned characteristics of this crop play to make the farmers least interested in the cultivation of this crop furthermore the net benefit of the agricultural activities is in an ascending trend over the planning period which could return to increase of the prices of the crops over the planning period as a result of the inflation on the one hand and increase of the cultivated area of the beneficial crops on the other hand credit authorship

1410,this paper focuses on the multi objective optimization of the groundwater extraction scheme in the bouein myandasht aquifer iran in order to reduce the concentration of nitrate originating from agricultural activities and wastewater absorbent wells a simulation optimization model coupling an artificial neural network ann as the simulator with the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii as the optimizer are employed the simulator is trained by help of data generated by process based simulation models for groundwater flow modflow and solute transport mt3d the optimization objectives include 1 minimizing the contamination concentration and 2 maximizing the net benefit of the agricultural activities the outcome of the simulation optimization model is an optimized management strategy formed by the optimal values of the optimization parameters searched and obtained consisting of 1 seasonal groundwater extraction volume 2 the ratio of the wastewater which should be treated before being leached into the groundwater through the absorbent wells 3 the ratio of the fertilizers consumption and 4 the cultivated area for each of the main crops in the study area the results of the model suggest a groundwater extraction policy fulfilling the objectives of the optimization the optimal operating policy also indicates that a partly conflicting relation exists between minimizing the risk of groundwater contamination and maximizing the net benefits of the agricultural activities hence the focus of this paper is at finding the better and better pareto fronts in the objective space while dealing with the parts of the objective functions with less conflict to reach the optimal pareto front on which the full conflict between the objectives is held then an entropy based trade off reflected in designating a couple of weights assigned to the couple of objectives calculated for each solution in the bi objective space is held over the solutions lying on the optimal pareto front and finally the favorite solution minimizing the weighted distance to the ideal point in the objective space is achieved using the topsis method with this policy the regional nitrate concentration will be decreased by 36 7 20 45 and 21 6 in the first second and third study sub areas respectively as compared to those in the actual operation furthermore the model suggests 15 12 and 9 wastewater treatment and also 9 6 and 7 decrease in the fertilizer use in the first second and third study sub areas respectively keywords groundwater modeling nitrate contamination crop pattern planning multi objective optimization nsga ii artificial neural network ann 1 introduction the agricultural sectors are the major consumers of the nitrogen in the world nitrogen over exploitation is rated as a threat to the drinking water one of the main compounds of nitrogen is nitrate on the other hand the nitrate is taken into account as a predominant and prevalent pollutant contaminating the groundwater resources the existence of the nitrate in the aquifers is mainly resulting from the anthropogenic activities such as the use of the chemical fertilizers containing the nitrate the faulty wastewater treatment plants and improper disposal of the industrial anthropogenic and the animal trashes in nature therefore it is necessary to reduce the nitrate contamination concentration to prevent the groundwater contamination crisis in the future there is a wide range of applications of metamodels to simulate the parameters affecting the groundwater quality in groundwater management a metamodel also called a surrogate model e g asher et al 2015 is a computationally efficient surrogate for a more detailed numerical model these models are often recommended to be used for sensitivity analysis of the physics based numerical simulation models although metamodels do not directly deal with the sophistication of the numerical models they can be efficiently applied to numerically simulate the natural processes provided that sufficient data would be generated or prepared by the numerical models for the training of the metamodels the performance of the metamodels mainly depends on having a large range of data samples such that the range of the conditions the metamodels may be encountered in simulation have already existed in their training data such a set of training data may be generated from a series of numerical model runs over a range of conditions then a statistical learning technique is selected to train the metamodel such as a bayesian network bn an artificial neural network ann or support vector machine svm based on data derived from the numerical model fienen et al 2015 the metamodels benefit from two major advantages over commonly used physics based numerical models 1 reaching approximate decisions faster than a full numerical model and 2 they can rapidly develop screening level insights especially in an unmodeled study area fienen et al 2018 in other words the speed of imperfect but reasonable predictions often 60 to more than 90 of the insight from the process based numerical model nolan et al 2012 fienen and plant 2014 is more valuable for screening sometimes than more precise predictions requiring long runtimes these are several advantages of metamodels over the numerical simulation models making metamodels popular and widely used models in the simulation tasks even though the metamodels require the numerical physics based models to generate a series of accurate data for training them the advantages of using the metamodels are still preserved in fact linking the metamodels instead of the numerical ones to the optimizers to do the optimization tasks is of some advantages due to a large number of function evaluations fes there are to be accomplished when running the optimizers actually the metamodels require far less expensive computations as compared to the numerical simulation models when passing these fes endowing a considerable superiority to these models in this case in a study fienen et al 2016 developed a groundwater flow metamodel emulated using a bayesian network bn an artificial neural network ann and a gradient boosted regression tree gbrt constructed based on a dataset of the input and output of each of the metamodels generated by numerical models the aim was to evaluate the surface water depletion expressed as the source of water to wells in the lake michigan basin usa the results indicated the main choice between ann gbrt and the bn approach is a matter of preference and goals for the final outcome in another applied research on metamodels fienen et al 2018 used a gradient boosted regression tree statistical metamodel trained by the data derived from modflow modpath numerical models to estimate groundwater age for a glacial aquifer system in the lake michigan basin which is so large and discontinuous that a single numerical physics based model is unable to handle the results indicated that metamodels are capturing much of the system behavior inherent in the numerical models they are trained on as another research aiming application of metamodels sepahvand et al 2019 used genetic programming gp as another metamodel to estimate groundwater level drawdown in a semi arid region subject to conjunctive water use the study aimed at proposing an optimal multi crop pattern plan considering the agricultural net benefits to be maximized provided that the groundwater would remain sustained during the aquifer exploitation to supply the part of water demands the surface water failed to supply in the region one of the key factors contributing to hold a good balance between quantity and quality of the groundwater resources may be hidden in conjunctively use of the surface and ground water resources conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater may allow the use of poor quality surface or ground water as the quality of these resources of water can be actually compensated by each other when operating them at the same time singh 2014 in this field of study ejaz and peralta 1995 developed a simulation optimization model to address the conflicts between surface and ground water targeting maximization of steady conjunctive use while maximizing waste loading from a sewage treatment plant to the stream the conjunctive use of poor quality water for irrigation was also studied in different works datta and de jong 2002 kaur et al 2007 mandare et al 2008 and the beneficiaries of conjunctive use of surface and ground water were reflected in some other researches karimov et al 2012 mccallum et al 2013 nikoo et al 2013 there is also a wide range of studies targeting the control of the groundwater quality indicators considering the groundwater as a single source of water supply in the literature srdjevic 2007 applied the integrated social tools sc and analytical hierarchy process ahp to decision making in water resources and environmental management in this study the ahp was first employed as a decision support in one group and then was used in some subgroups while the aggregation was performed by sc at the whole group level the second methodology was found to be more promising in real decision situations pe√±a haro et al 2009 performed a holistic optimization method to determine the spatial and temporal fertilizer uses maximizing the agricultural net benefits subject to some constraints integrating the response matrix to allow simulating by superposition of the cumulative groundwater nitrate concentration of an aquifer resulting from multiple pollutant sources distributed over time and space kerachian et al 2010 proposed a methodology to resolve the conflict of interests among water users water supply and environmental protection agencies existing in conjunctive surface ground water use management minimizing the cost of groundwater pumping and the cost of building the wastewater collection system along with minimizing the nitrate concentration as well as controlling the water rise in the urban area were considered as the main utilities of different sectors involved in the problem the nsga ii was adopted as the optimizer to generate the trade off curves from which the best solution was derived utilizing the rubinstein bargaining theory mulligan et al 2014 utilized the hydraulic control method to revive the quality of groundwater resources they proposed two non linear optimization formulations to design and delineate the location and the rate of the discharge and recharge of the wells to mitigate the contamination concentration in the aquifer furthermore the galerkin two dimensional finite element method was employed as the simulator of the simulation optimization model used in this study pisciotta et al 2015 investigated the nitrate contamination in the aquifer of sicily city in italy the results indicated the role of the land on the nitrate concentration in the aquifers furthermore this study highlighted the domestic and industrial wastewater as the main sources of the pollution of the groundwater exner et al 2014 provided some 44 000 samples polluted to the nitrate to show the extension of the nitrate contamination in the maize cultivated areas in eastern nebraska in this study 1 3 million hectares of the land were modeled in terms of the irrigation and drainage systems the thickness of the saturated layer and the lithology to detect the contaminated areas and then 17 management models were implemented to reduce the nitrate contamination in the focused aquifer farhadi et al 2016 developed a modeling framework to find a sustainable solution for groundwater management in this study an nsga ii optimization model along with an ann model was used to generate a pareto optimal front targeting minimization of the irrigation water deficit maximization of equity in water allocation and finally minimization of the groundwater drawdown as the major conflicting objectives interested by different stakeholders an agent based model was also adopted to establish the social influential factors for the stakeholders to cooperate with the management decisions modified and fed to the nash bargaining model to hold a compromise eshtawi et al 2016 developed a combined swat modflow mt3d model to investigate the surface water and groundwater quality they investigated the responses of the groundwater level the nitrate concentration resulting from the agricultural activities and the chlorine concentration resulting from the seawater intrusion to the expansion of urbanism and the resulting variations in the urban water supply the authors also illustrated the potential of the uncommon water such as the desalination plants flood control the treated wastewater and the climatic change to damage the groundwater resources heydari et al 2016 developed an optimal water allocation model utilizing a quantity and quality simulation model implemented by the artificial neural networks ann and genetic programming gp an nsga ii model was adopted as the optimization model linked to the simulator targeting maximization of the water supply minimization of the groundwater drawdown and minimization of the water quality variations the results suggested a considerable decrease in the groundwater withdrawal along with the decrease of the total dissolved solids tds in the study area alizadeh et al 2017a 2017b developed a fuzzy based nsga ii simulation optimization model in which a monte carlo analysis fed by two physics based quality and quantity simulation models was utilized to generate sufficient data for a surrogate artificial neural network ann simulator a fuzzy transformation method ftm was then adopted to extract the trade off curves accounting for multiple stakeholders finally a fuzzy social choice fsc was used to suggest the best compromise point on the trade off curves to determine a sustainable allocation policy for groundwater management ghaseminejad and shourian 2019 developed a simulation optimization model integrating modflow simulation model and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to simultaneously minimize the cost of drilling pumping transfer and desalination of the pumped groundwater subject to constraints on the control of cumulative groundwater level drawdown as well as the maximum satisfaction of the water demands ghadimi and ketabchi 2019 developed an ant colony based simulation optimization model to tackle the overuse of the groundwater as a common pool resource of water using game theory defining several cooperation scenarios alizadeh et al 2017b utilized a linked nsga ii and m5p model trained and validated by the data provided by monte carlo analysis of calibrated modflow model to yield a simulation optimization model the model was then applied to solve a conflict resolution model of groundwater resource management utilizing social choice rules and fallback bargaining methods this paper aims at proposing a simulation optimization model to quantity quality modeling of an aquifer located in west central iran in the present study the main optimization objectives include 1 minimizing the nitrate contamination concentration and 2 maximizing the agricultural net benefits as can be seen these two objectives are potentially conflicting as minimizing the contamination concentration entails minimizing the groundwater extraction in the periods in which the initial nitrate concentration is high whereas decreasing the groundwater exploitation can degrade the agricultural net benefits especially when knowing that the only source of water to use for the irrigation of the study area of this paper is groundwater and improperly supplying the demands by this source of water can damage the crop yields and thus the net benefit considering the formal objectives of the optimization model the groundwater level is allowed to rise in the time steps in which the initial water quality is not so proper while the groundwater drawdown is somehow permitted when the initial water quality is suitable for drinking purposes as a result and in contrast to a number of the researches reviewed in this section there is not a constant and full prohibition on the groundwater overuse as this prohibition is mainly depending on the water quality level at any time step as well as the crops water stress to relieve the potential shortcomings in the water supply contributing the net benefits not to be declined hence the minimization of the groundwater level drawdowns is an informal goal of this study and is not directly embedded in the objectives of the optimization model the other main contribution of the present study as compared to other studies reviewed in this section is proposing an optimal multi crop pattern plan in accordance with the special circumstances facing the crops in this study in fact the crops should be assigned the appropriate cultivated areas such that the water demands are decreased so as to facilitate the potentially decreased groundwater use to properly supply these demands moreover the optimal multi crop pattern should be designated addressing these two facts depicted as follows 1 the more net benefit of the crops the more cultivated area will be assigned and 2 the more fertilizers used by some crops the less cultivated area will be assigned to those crops furthermore since the nsga ii optimizer generates a pareto front of a large number of the candidate solutions for the developed simulation optimization model in this paper a multi criteria decision analysis is to be adopted to discriminate the best solution offered by the optimal pareto front hence as another difference of this study with similar studies reviewed in this section which have mainly utilized conflict resolution models to extract the best solution in this paper a topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution analysis was carried out for selecting the best solution in which the weights are determined using shannon s entropy analysis which automatically impart importance to each of the objectives of the optimization model with no dependence on the experts knowledge or the prior knowledge on the objectives the organization of this paper is as follows section 2 describes the methodology of this paper including a detailed explanation of the nsga ii as the main multi objective optimization algorithm employed to solve the optimization model presented in this paper in section 2 1 in section 2 2 a detailed step by step multi criteria analysis method is explained to select the best solution among the solutions rendered by the optimization model section 2 3 also presents a method to weighting the criteria used in the multi criteria analysis in order to select the best solution achieved through the optimization process section 3 1 is dedicated to introducing the study area and section 3 2 presents the mathematical formulation of the simulation optimization model introducing and explaining the functionality of the physics based modflow and mt3d models employed to generate data for the artificial neural network ann model as a metamodel used as the major simulator linked to the optimization model section 4 presents the results and discusses them in detail and finally section 5 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii this algorithm is one of the pioneering multi objective genetic algorithms mogas first proposed by deb et al 2002 as an alternative to the previously proposed non dominated sorting genetic algorithm nsga proposed by srinivas and deb 1994 and widely used in water resources management literature kerachian et al 2010 farhadi et al 2016 heydari et al 2016 alizadeh et al 2017a 2017b 2019 the main advantages of nsga ii as compared to the nsga can be summarized as follows 1 the computational complexity of the nsga ii is less than that of nsga making this algorithm faster to run 2 a kind of elitism is incorporated to the nsga ii unlike the nsga which lacked such a capability and 3 replacing the hard to tune sharing parameter introduced in the nsga by a crowding distance operator in nsga ii in the nsga ii first several initial random chromosomes are generated to form the first generation of the algorithm then the selection process is implemented such that two or more chromosomes are selected from the population and then compared with each other in terms of both non domination and diversity this process is going on until a population at the size of the first population is generated then the crossover and mutation operators are imposed on the parents to generate new chromosomes now they are named off springs the probability of the crossover is usually taken more than 0 7 in order to local optima avoidance a mutation operator is also imposed on a selected gene the mutation probability is usually set to be less than 0 1 to prevent promising solutions from being degraded in the search space in other words the mutation operator should be cautiously imposed on the solutions so as not to cause the exploitation process to slow down or to be disrupted once a population of the off spring chromosomes is generated the previously generated population and the current population are merged together and then the non dominated sorting operator is implemented on the merged population then the population is halved and the half including the better frontiers is considered as the first half and actually the basic population to generate the next generation of the chromosomes then the new generation forms the mating pool containing the parents and the parents produce the off springs by performing the crossover and mutation and this process is going on until the stopping criterion is met deb et al 2002 as mentioned before after merging each generation with the next generation the frontiers must be composed on the other hand each chromosome in the merged population must be compared to any of the other chromosomes to make clear if it is a member of the current frontier or not in addition the comparison would be done with respect to all of the objectives when composing the first frontier one can figure out that this process is of the most computational complexity to be done hence if the number of the chromosomes or the population size of the algorithm is assumed to be n and the number of the objectives are assumed to be m then the dominant computational complexity of the nsga ii algorithm would be o mn 2 note that in this paper the nsga ii is implemented using a matlab code derived from faradars an educational website for the academic courses in persian 2 2 topsis multi criteria analysis since there is a number of points solutions found on the optimal pareto front generated by nsga ii one may desire to select the optimal solution on the pareto as the final result of the multi objective optimization process the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis first introduced by yoon and hwang 1995 is one of the popular multi criteria decision making methods especially applied to water resources management zahedi et al 2017 li et al 2018 ghazali et al 2018 gorgij et al 2019 there are a number of alternatives and a number of criteria for decision making in topsis utilizing topsis every point is attributed a relative score then the points alternative solutions are all ranked with respect to their relative scores and the best solution having the highest rank is chosen as the optimal final solution generated by the optimization the main steps of the topsis method are as follows step 1 form the decision matrix involving the numerical criteria in each alternative step 2 normalize the decision matrix through eq 1 1 n ij r ij i r ij 2 where r ij stands for the value assigned to the ith alternative in the jth criterion and n ij denotes the normalized value of the ith alternative in the jth criterion step 3 calculate the weighted normalized decision matrix through eq 2 2 v n d w n n where w n n is a diagonal weighting matrix including n weights in 0 1 corresponding to n criteria step 4 designate the hypothetical ideal and anti ideal alternative solutions in the multi criteria space through eqs 3 4 3 v j max j j v ij min j j v ij i 1 2 m 4 v j min j j v ij max j j v ij i 1 2 m step 5 calculate the distance between each alternative to the ideal and anti ideal solutions denoted by s i and s i respectively through eqs 5 6 5 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 2 m 6 s i j 1 n v ij v j 2 i 1 2 m step 6 calculate the score of an alternative as the degree of its closeness to the anti ideal alternative denoted by c i through eq 7 7 c i s i s i s i step 7 rank the alternatives with respect to the value of c i such that the alternative having the highest c i is assigned the highest rank and the alternative with the lowest c i receives the lowest rank the higher the rank of an alternative solution the more desirable it will be in this paper the topsis analysis is utilized as a method to select the best solution among a number of solutions with respect to multiple criteria objectives after the optimal pareto front consisting of a number of solutions is generated by nsga ii 2 3 shannon s entropy for weighting the criteria when designating all of the decision making data the entropy method may be employed for weighting the criteria involved in the decision making process in the information theory the entropy is rated as an uncertainty measure expressed by a probability distribution function the measurement of this uncertainty was first accomplished by shannon 1948 hence the name shannon entropy was adopted for this method the steps of implementing the shannon entropy are as follows step 1 form the decision matrix step 2 normalize the decision matrix denote each element of this matrix by p ij step 3 calculating the entropy of each of the criteria the entropy is denoted by e j and the constant parameter k holds the amount of e j in 0 1 the e j can be obtained as follows 8 e j k i 1 m p ij lnp ij i 1 2 m step 4 calculate the degree of deviation of each criterion denoted by d j indicating how many significant data each of the criteria give to the decision maker for making his her final decision in general the less different the numerical values of a focused criterion the more the similarity among the competitive alternatives with respect to that criterion and thus the less the weight assigned to that criterion will be in this way the role of that criterion in decision making is accordingly decreased therefore the value of d j can be calculated as follows 9 d j 1 e j step 5 finally the weight of the jth criterion denoted by w j can be calculated as follows 10 w j d j d j a general flowchart of the management model used in this study can be seen in fig 1 3 case study 3 1 introduction of the study area in this paper the study area is bouein myandasht sub basin located at the northwestern of the gavkhouni river basin in west central iran this study area consists of the main plain covering an alluvial aquifer the total area of this sub basin is 981 km2 and the area of the alluvial aquifer is rated as 498 km2 the highest point at this area is located at the northern heights and is 3735 m high and the lowest point is located at the south of the plain being 2075 m lower from the surface of the free seas fig 2 displays the study area and its location in the greater gavkhouni river basin the precipitation in the study area annually ranges from 400 to 689 mm in the interval of 2010 2011 through the 2015 2016 hydrological years on average march benefits from the most precipitation in the study area with the precipitation of 87 1 mm in the heights and 72 8 mm in the plain the discharging wells amount to 651 wells with the annual discharge of 110 8 million cubic meters mcm in the 2010 2011 hydrological year in addition there are 751 springs discharging aquifer by 10 2 mcm as well as 88 qanats discharging 6 8 mcm in the 2010 2011 hydrological year it is noteworthy that qanat is an iranian ancient system of water supply which simply is a gently sloping underground channel to transport water from an aquifer or water well to surface for irrigation and drinking purposes acting as an underground aqueduct with a series of vertical access shafts the water consumption in the agricultural sector is rated as 175 6 mcm the drinking water amounts to 4 6 mcm and the industrial sector consumes a value of 0 5 mcm per year iran s water resources management company 2015 table 1 shows groundwater balance in this aquifer that indicated 22 3 mcm change in groundwater volume in the 2010 2011 hydrological year fig 3 indicates a more detailed scheme of the study area including plain boundary aquifer boundary and location of wells qanats springs absorbent wells and piezometers it should be noted that some springs qanats and wells are located outside the aquifer but are located in the plain which are karst type the nitrate can contaminate the aquifer and degrade the groundwater quality in the study area in three ways 1 leaching into the aquifer by the irrigation return flow 2 infiltration into the aquifer from the wastewater absorbent wells and 3 inflow into the aquifer across the boundaries to the adjacent aquifers 3 2 the simulation optimization model the simulation optimization model employed to solve the groundwater management problem of this paper can be formulated as follows as can be seen the optimization model consists of two main goals 1 minimizing the contamination concentration leached to the aquifer and 2 maximizing the total agricultural net benefits as a result both quantity and quality indicators prevailing in the water resources management in an agricultural area are offered in the formulation of the problem eqs 11 to 18 mathematically express the model furthermore a detailed scheme of the simulation optimization management model developed in this study can be seen in fig 4 11

planning period ha a ic max maximum cultivated area of the cth crop in the ith year in the planning period ha in the simulation optimization model formulation the first objective attempts to minimize the contamination concentration of the nitrate the minimization of this goal is performed when the total groundwater extraction is decreased as knowing that the less the groundwater extraction in all of the time steps the more the volume of the groundwater kept in the aquifer to dilute the nitrate load and thus the less the nitrate concentration will be then less groundwater should be extracted from the aquifer in the time steps whose initial nitrate concentration is higher and more groundwater should be extracted when the initial nitrate concentration is lower the second objective is to maximize the net benefit achieved by the farmers through agricultural activities this objective considers the costs of the crop cultivation the cost of the groundwater pumping and also the price of the water used and the crops the net benefits are all converted to the last year of the planning period with respect to the inflation rate in the region to better compare and add the net benefits of different years in order to reach the total net benefit the stakeholder of the first objective is the regional water company which monitors the quality of the groundwater used to drinking purposes the stakeholder of the second objective is the agricultural organization these two objectives are partly conflicting to each other especially when the nitrate concentration is high in the time steps in which the water demands are also high in this case the groundwater extraction is decided to be reduced to decrease the contamination concentration while there is a significant need to supply the water demands in order to achieve the maximum net benefits on the other hand the model tends to reduce the water demands in order to better supply the demands and increase the crop yields and the consequent net benefits for this purpose the more cultivated area should be assigned to the less water consuming crops and vice versa however the problems arise if the less water consuming crops are among the less beneficial crops as well in this way the net benefit is degraded this analysis shows that a compromise must be held between water consumption and the net benefit achieved by the agricultural sector and highlights the multi crop pattern planning as a necessary and at the same time very difficult task due to the numerous conflicting aspects involved in it affecting the water resources management purposes for the simulation of the quantity and quality indicators of the aquifer two physics based models including modflow and mt3d models are employed to implement these models first the map of the bouein myandasht aquifer was imported to the gis environment and then it was inserted into the groundwater simulation model gms aquaveo 2020 which in turn comprises modflow and mt3d as the quantity and quality simulation sub models respectively then the hydraulic boundaries were needed to be designated these boundaries are visible when drawing the isopotential groundwater paths by the modflow model as can be seen in fig 7 the aquifer involves 10 groundwater inflow boundary and only one outflow boundary data for 23 piezometers in adjacent aquifers were used for the general head boundary ghb boundary conditions in the modflow model in this figure the arrows indicate the boundaries with the constant flux and the other boundaries not pointed out with the arrows can be taken into account as no flow boundary conditions the hydraulic heads at each of the inflow outflow boundaries are defined and inserted to the modflow model based upon the hydraulic head data depicted in the official reports explaining the characteristics of the study area of this paper the inflow and outflow of the groundwater rates are also calculated by the modflow model using conducting the water balance process in the study area based on the observed data imported to the software in fig 7 the groundwater flow paths are perpendicular to the isopotential paths in this study all stress periods are considered four 3 month periods per hydrological year except for the steady state period of the groundwater appearing in the initial year 2010 2011 the simulation of nitrate transport in groundwater was carried out from 2010 to 2011 to the 2014 2015 hydrological years utilizing the mt3d model data for 8 sampling wells were used for initial concentration of nitrate in the aquifer the year 2010 2011 was taken into account as a steady period and the rest of the simulation period was assumed as an unsteady period and divided into 16 seasons each of which is representing one stress sub period the first three years of the unsteady period were considered for the calibration of the model and the fourth year was used for validating the simulation model the calibration parameters of the modflow model are hydraulic conductivity and specific yield the hydraulic conductivity is calibrated and estimated by the model run in the steady state initial year 2010 2011 while the specific yield was calibrated over the remaining unsteady years furthermore the recharge from the wastewater recharge from the agricultural return flow and recharge from the precipitation are also imported into the modflow model along with the groundwater discharge in a trial and error procedure to be assured of the accuracy of especially the total recharge value in this trial and error procedure the whole study area is divided into several polygons for each of which the required parameters including the seasonal inputs of the model derived from the reasonable ranges reported in the official surveys and the assumed constant calibrated parameters are defined and inserted to the model prior to run the model in the calibration phase at each iteration thus we incorporated as much information from the observations as possible to calibrate the simulation models furthermore the calibration of the mt3d model includes the estimation of the effective molecular diffusion coefficient longitudinal dispersion coefficient and the sorption distribution coefficient it is worth mentioning that although the degradation of nitrate in groundwater is an important process it is most commonly only included in a lumped approach in nutrient modeling studies especially on a large scale some local studies exist on how much and where nitrogen is degraded in the groundwater but many parameters such as soil texture the build up of soil organic matter land use and root zone characteristics are affecting degradation processes because it isn t the main focus of this research we did not directly consider the degradation of nitrate but in the process of calibration of mt3d was practically applied the results of the calibration of modflow and mt3d models include three criteria mean error me mean absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse for the groundwater level and the nitrate concentration respectively as these performance criteria suggest the calibration of modflow yields the me equal to 0 42 m the mae equal to 1 79 m and the rmse equal to 2 6 m since all of these errors are less than the 20 of the aquifer thickness they are found acceptable and show a good calibration being done the calibration of mt3d also yields the me equal to 0 25 mg l the mae equal to 4 2 mg l and the rmse equal to 5 8 mg l since the mt3d reached the errors not exceeding the 20 of the standard contamination concentration depicted as 50 mg l the calibration process for this model can also be verified fig 8 displays the hydraulic conductivity spatial map obtained by simulation after the calibration process is accomplished the other main parameter calibrated is the specific yield the spatial map of this parameter can be seen in fig 9 the porosity is also varying between 0 15 and 0 23 after being calibrated in the study area the initial concentration of nitrate in the study area were used from 8 sampling wells fig 10 and was obtained equal to 25 71 mg l on average and at the end of simulation period winter 2015 obtained by mt3d model increasing to averagely 35 88 mg l fig 11 the main reasons accounting for the increase of the nitrate concentration by lapse of the time include 1 the increase of the nitrate holding fertilizers used by the farmers on the one hand and 2 the increase of the population of the rural regions producing untreated wastewater to be subjected by the aquifer on the other hand for facilitating the linkage between the simulation and optimization models as well as reducing the computational cost of the management model two multi layer perceptron feedforward neural network mlpfnn models implemented using the matlab neural net fitting tool were developed as the metamodels to simulate both the water quality and water quantity parameters required in every step of the optimization process after generating an adequate and accurate series of data including the groundwater level and the nitrate concentration calculated by modflow and mt3d models respectively to be used as the inputs and outputs of the mlpfnn models therefore one mlpfnn model was developed for estimating the groundwater level as a quantity indicator and another was developed for predicting the nitrate concentration as a quality indicator these models have an exchange with each other in other words the output of the mlpfnn estimating the groundwater level at a certain time step is used as one of the inputs of the mlpfnn estimating the nitrate concentration at the next time step however the output of the mlpfnn used for simulating the groundwater level at a certain time step is used as one of the inputs of the same mlpfnn to estimate its output at the next time step these models include one input layer one hidden layer comprising 10 neurons and one output layer representing the groundwater level in one model and the nitrate concentration in the other one the network is trained by levenberg marquardt back propagation algorithm widely used for this task the tansig and purlin are adopted as the transfer functions of the hidden and output layers of the mlpfnn the input data include 95 hydrological and meteorological data series covering a variety of the climatic conditions such as wet normal and dry hydrological years in this way the mlpfnn can experience all hydrological conditions in its training data to be enabled to generalize the estimated relation it holds between the inputs and the simulated outputs to every arbitrary data series as knowing the mlpfnn can only interpolate the data by which it is trained an amount of 65 of all data was used for training 25 for validation and 10 was used for the test stage the input data series includes seven features as follows 1 the amount of the agricultural return flow and the precipitation quantity recharging the aquifer eq 19 calculates this feature 19 a is c 1 5 a ic cd sc 10 per 3650000 c 1 5 a ic where a is the aquifer recharge in m day per a coefficient used to calibrate the amount of infiltration of the water supplied regarding the soil characteristics and ratio of water infiltrating the focused aquifer and cd sc net water demand per unit cultivated area in mm 2 the contamination concentration at the surface which can be accompanied with the irrigation return flow to infiltrate the aquifer eq 20 depicts the way to calculate this feature 20 b is c 1 5 k c r 2 pper cd sc 10 where b is contamination concentration at the surface in mg l r 2 the ratio of the fertilizer infiltrating the aquifer taken into account as a decision variable and laid in 0 8 1 pper a coefficient used in order to calibrate the rate of contamination infiltration and k c is the amount of the fertilizer used for each crop in kg ha 3 the volume of groundwater discharge across the aquifer in m3 day 4 the initial groundwater level in m 5 the initial nitrate concentration in the aquifer in mg l 6 the volume of the wastewater recharging the aquifer through the absorbent wells in m3 day 7 the nitrate concentration of the wastewater recharging the aquifer through the absorbent wells in mg l since a part of the aquifer contamination is resulting from the absorbent wells the man made wastewater should be treated in order to reduce the nitrate concentration leached to the aquifer the rate of this treatment denoted by r 1 is multiplied by the nitrate concentration in the absorbent wells and presented to the mlpfnn thus this rate of treatment is taken into account as a decision variable and set to be in the range of 0 75 1 therefore the cultivated areas a ic the seasonal groundwater extraction volumes gw is r 1 and r 2 are all the decision variables of the optimization model and must be set through a multi objective optimization process for nsga ii the probability of crossover was set to 0 7 and the probability of mutation was set to 0 008 as is discussed in the methodology section furthermore an amount of 100 generations each of which includes 500 chromosomes were set for applying nsga ii for doing optimization in all regions of the study area 4 results and discussion in order to enhance the accuracy of the simulation optimization model used in this study the bouein myandasht aquifer is divided into three zones as shown in fig 3 the difference in the aquifer characteristics including the geographical distribution the amount of the precipitation the number of the wells and also the spatial variations of the hydraulic conductivity specific yield and the porosity of these three regions are all the reasons necessitating this regionalization of the study area fig 12 depicts the optimal pareto fronts obtained by the simulation optimization models for all regions in the study area figs 13 to 15 display the time series of the observed and optimized nitrate concentration at the end of each time step in the planning period over different regions of the study area training the simulation model the total correlation coefficients of the mlpfnn model with the groundwater level as the output were obtained equal to 0 9301 0 92672 and 0 99105 for the first second and third regions respectively furthermore the total correlation coefficients of the mlpfnn with the nitrate concentration as the output were achieved as 0 9983 0 9977 and 0 9909 for the first second and third regions respectively in addition the mean square errors mses reached 0 4129 0 3117 and 0 5305 m as the groundwater level was simulated by mlpfnn in the first second and third regions while these figures were achieved as 0 4229 0 3017 and 0 5205 mg l when the mlpfnn model was employed to estimate the nitrate concentration in the first second and third regions respectively the main fact about the application of the mlpfnns in this study is that these models are finally linked to the computationally expensive multi objective optimization model which is executed for a large number of runs to yield the optimal pareto front as the final result of the optimization in other words if we would link the physics based models rather than the mlpfnns to the multi objective optimization model there are a large number of objective function evaluations fes amounting to 50 000 in this study to be done by the optimizer and the physics based models must have to be run per each one of these fes namely for 50 000 times in total which in turn could considerably raise the computational complexity of the whole model as knowing that a computationally expensive procedure is done by these physics based models due to their intrinsic nature meanwhile the physics based models are employed in this study to only generate 95 data series for these models and only run for 95 times additionally there are two mlpfnns replacing two physics based models to be linked to the simulation optimization model and linking these two physics based models to the optimizer can contribute to escalating the problem of the costly computational executions of the linked model therefore the physics based models are used to generate more accurate data to train the mlpfnns and the mlpfnns are linked to the optimizer due to 1 their faster running and 2 the easier linkage to the optimizer as compared to the physics based models in fact the average contamination concentration computed by the simulation optimization model is consistently less than what observed in all regions of the study area such that the contamination is decreased by 14 to 34 against the observed values over the total period the results also indicate that the average actual nitrate concentration is consistently increasing and reaching the value of 42 75 mg l at the end of the planning period while the optimized nitrate concentration reaches 28 4 mg l indicating a 34 decrease in the contamination as compared to the actual conditions in the first region the r 1 multiplied by the nitrate concentration to show treatment of the wastewater flushed through the absorbent wells is set to be 0 85 on the other hand the nitrate concentration in the absorbent wells in the first region is more than that in other regions accordingly most of the nitrate contamination in the first region is due to the contamination resulting from the absorbent wells injecting contamination into the aquifer knowing the urbanization in the first region is much more than that in the other regions the high contamination injected by the absorbent wells in the first region could be justified in overall a decrease rate of 27 in the contamination is obtained by the model in the first region against the actual conditions in the second region the r 1 is determined to be 0 88 meaning that 12 of the domestic wastewater should be treated so as to decrease the nitrate concentration in the aquifer of this region on the other hand the r 2 is obtained equal to 0 94 indicating that the fertilizers used in this region should be decreased by 6 taking these policies the contamination concentration in the second region could be decreased by 13 as compared to what observed in the actual conditions in the third region the r 1 and r 2 are calculated by the model to be 0 91 and 0 93 respectively leading the fertilizers used in the region to be decreased by 115 5 kg ha furthermore the contamination reduction in the third region is to be 4 22 mg l as compared to that in the actual conditions the agricultural activities in the third region are more than two other regions and thus more groundwater is extracted in this region however the contamination in this region is less than that in two other regions the domestic sector producing the wastewater is also less than that in other regions however the less potential of this region to be contaminated could be accounted for by analyzing the aquifer boundaries in the region in fact the length of the common aquifer boundaries between this region and its adjacent aquifers is much more than that for other regions which in turn leads the contamination injected to the aquifer to be more diluted and therefore causes to decrease the contamination concentration another main reason for this behavior of the third region is hidden in its soil characteristics in fact the porosity of the soil in the third region is more than that in other regions contributing to rapidly make the dissolved contaminants move from this region in general the groundwater level computed by the simulation optimization model has risen in any time step as compared to the actual groundwater level mainly due to the management schemes including the decrease of the groundwater pumping crop pattern variations and decrease of the total cultivated area the groundwater level has been increased by 3 07 3 8 3 16 2 8 and 0 87 m over the years 2011 2015 revealing that more appropriate conditions have been provided for the aquifer in these years the figs 16 to 18 show the optimized and observed groundwater extraction volume in three regions of the study area over the whole planning period tables 2 to 4 depict the optimal multi crop pattern plan as the percentage of the total cultivated area in three regions of the study area prior to analyzing this pattern plan it is worth mentioning that the total cultivated area for the whole planning period over the study area is decreased as calculated by the simulation optimization model such that the cultivated area is decreased by 1955 920 and 649 ha in the first second and the third regions respectively this decrease in the total cultivated area is due to using only five dominant crops of the study area in the crop pattern of this study on the one hand the minimum and maximum of the areas allocated to each crop in the actual operation are considered as the bounds of the optimal areas of each crop and on the other hand the price of the crops plays the major role to designate an optimal multi crop pattern as the second goal of the optimization is actually addressing maximization of the net benefit achieved from the agricultural activities for instance in the study area of this paper the potato has a higher price and thus the optimization model shows the most interest to cultivate this crop assigning the maximum annual cultivated area to the potato against other crops participating in the multi crop pattern plan in the first region the maximum net benefits as well as the maximum nitrate contamination concentration are both reached in the 2014 2015 hydrological year in fact in this year most agricultural activities involve the cultivation of the most fertilizer consuming crops such as the potato being assigned 54 75 of the whole area cultivated in this year in the second region the contamination concentration in 2013 2014 is decreased as compared to its previous year however the maximum cultivated area belongs to this year in this region and the less area is assigned to the high fertilizer consuming potato crop in the crop pattern of this year in the second region in the second region the cultivated area allocated to the potato is generally less than that in the first and third regions especially in the last years of the planning period assigning less area to the potato could on the one hand make the net benefit be reduced as knowing the potato is the most beneficial crop in the present multi crop pattern in the region on the other hand the less the area cultivated by the potato the less the nitrate contamination will be as knowing the potato is the most fertilizer consuming crop too furthermore the cultivated areas attributed to different crops in the second region could hold a balance in the crop pattern and cause the pattern to be more diverse as the potato is no longer the dominant crop in this pattern in the second region in the third region the potato is still the dominant crop and the wheat and barley are competing to be assigned more cultivated areas in the hydrological years 2012 2013 and 2013 2014 the area allocated to the potato is degraded which in turn contributes the contamination concentration to be decreased as the main source of the groundwater contamination in the third region is the agricultural activities involving potato cultivation in other words the simulation optimization model attempts to assign less cultivated area to the more fertilizer consuming crops while assigning more area to the less fertilizer consuming crops in this way not only the contamination concentration is minimized but also the net benefit is achieved as much as possible in fact the main task of such a simulation optimization model is to hold a proper trade off between the contamination concentration and the net benefit as the two main and conflicting objectives of this study to be optimized 5 conclusion the main goal of this study is to investigate the groundwater contamination concentration in the bouein myandasht aquifer thereby one can take the best management policies to reduce the contamination concentration of the aquifer extracted for the drinking purposes such that the net benefit of the farmers is also accessible as much as possible the model employed in this study is a simulation optimization model whose simulation portion is an artificial neural network ann model benefiting from the data generated by the modflow and mt3d physics based simulators in its training process and the optimization portion is non dominated sorting genetic algorithm type ii nsga ii as a multi objective optimization model targeting two main goals 1 minimization of the contamination concentration and 2 maximization of the net benefit the secondary goal of the simulation optimization model is to present an optimal multi crop pattern plan for the study area for the hydrological years 2011 2012 through 2014 2015 the crop pattern obtained suggests the potato as the dominant crop being assigned the most of the cultivated area mainly due to its high prices and despite its role to add a considerable nitrate into the aquifer through consuming immense fertilizers the wheat and barley are ranked after the potato in a close competition since the hydrological year 2012 2013 in which the wheat price has become more than that of the barley the wheat receives more cultivated areas compared to the barley the alfalfa and the onion are ranked at the bottom of the multi crop pattern the reason why the onion is ranked as the last crop in the optimal pattern in spite of being a beneficial crop for the farmers is that the onion is rated as a crop consuming a considerable volume of the fertilizers and thus increasing the nitrate concentration in the groundwater and promoting the risk of drinking such a contaminated groundwater on the other hand the onion has high water requirements and this characteristic can cause its water demand not to be fully met and thus can damage the yield of the crop and reduces the net benefit expected to be achieved by this crop in addition the upper and lower bounds of the cultivated area of the onion were low in the planning period reflecting all of the roles the abovementioned characteristics of this crop play to make the farmers least interested in the cultivation of this crop furthermore the net benefit of the agricultural activities is in an ascending trend over the planning period which could return to increase of the prices of the crops over the planning period as a result of the inflation on the one hand and increase of the cultivated area of the beneficial crops on the other hand credit authorship

1411,rates of natural source zone depletion nszd are increasingly being used to aid remedial decision making and light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl longevity estimates at petroleum release sites current nszd estimate methods based on analyses of carbon dioxide co2 and oxygen o2 soil gas concentration gradients gradient method assume linear concentration profiles with depth this assumption can underestimate the concentration gradients especially above lnapl sources that are typically characterized by curvilinear or semi curvilinear o2 and co2 concentration profiles in this work we proposed a new method that relies on calculating the o2 and co2 concentration gradient using a first order reaction model the method requires an estimate of the diffusive reaction length that can be easily derived from soil gas concentration data a simple step by step guide for applying the new method is provided nomographs were also developed to facilitate method application application of the nomographs using field data from published literature showed that nszd rates could be underestimated by nearly an order of magnitude if reactivity in the vadose zone is not accounted for the new method helps refine nszd rates estimation and improve risk based decision making at certain petroleum contaminated sites graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords nszd natural attenuation lnapl

light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl that migrate downward in the vadose zone under the force of gravity rivett et al 2011 during the vertical percolation the lnapl is partially entrapped in the pores of the soil as an immobile residual phase due to the establishment of capillary forces itrc 2009 if the quantity of the release is significant lnapls can reach the capillary fringe and partially penetrate the saturated zone u s epa 1995 lnapl constituents in the smear zone undergo a series of naturally occurring processes that can lead to a progressive reduction of the source mass lari et al 2019 in the late 90 s the main mechanism attributed to the natural attenuation of lnapl was the dissolution of the soluble constituents in groundwater and the subsequent aqueous phase biodegradation occurring through various terminal electron acceptor processes newell et al 2002 the term used to describe the attenuation of concentration of dissolved constituents in groundwater was monitored natural attenuation or mna u s epa 1999 later it was found that within the lnapl body and overlying capillary fringe methanogenic biodegradation of hydrocarbons occurs and generates ch4 and co2 amos and mayer 2006 the methane and petroleum hydrocarbons volatilized from the saturated zone are then aerobically biodegraded in the vadose zone leading to a consumption of o2 from the soil gas and a generation of co2 and heat itrc 2018 these processes were found to be the main drivers of the progressive depletion of lnapl sources garg et al 2017 the combination of the attenuation processes occurring in the saturated and in the vadose zone is commonly termed natural source zone depletion or nszd api 2017 itrc 2018 an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that nszd occurs in most sites impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons with measured depletion rates ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of liters per hectare per year e g see amos et al 2005 johnson et al 2006 lundegard and johnson 2006 sihota et al 2011 mccoy et al 2014 sihota and mayer 2015 eichert et al 2017 garg et al 2017 verginelli et al 2018 sihota et al 2018 kulkarni et al 2020 mchugh et al 2020 devaull et al 2020 as described in detail in the recent guidelines issued by api 2017 itrc 2018 and crc care 2018 over the last decades several approaches were successfully applied to quantify the nszd rates the most widely used methods involve mass flux estimates of bulk hydrocarbon attenuation based on measuring rates of co2 production with dynamic closed chambers dcc sihota et al 2011 or passive flux traps mccoy et al 2014 and assumptions of biodegradation reaction stoichiometry itrc 2018 nszd rates can also be estimated by calibrating reactive transport models to o2 co2 or petroleum hydrocarbon soil gas concentration data lahvis and baehr 1996 lahvis et al 1999 some sites with significant methane production may require the application of relatively sophisticated numerical modeling sihota and mayer 2012 such as the min3p dusty model molins and mayer 2007 in the so called gradient method the difference in o2 or co2 concentration between the upper and lower boundary control points of measurement divided by the vertical distance between the control points gives an estimate of the vertical concentration gradient which is used to calculate the diffusive flux using the fick s law johnson et al 2006 lundegard and johnson 2006 the o2 and co2 fluxes are then stoichiometrically converted into a nszd rate a critical step for the application of the gradient method is the selection of the upper and lower boundary control points of o2 and co2 data needed for the linearization of the concentration profile the api 2017 guidance provides some indication on the selection of these locations above the hydrocarbon reaction zone and based on geologic and gas profile shape considerations however depending on the type of hydrocarbons source and on the number of vertical soil gas sampling points this linear approximation can lead to inaccurate estimates of the concentration gradient especially in lnapl source areas where nszd rates are typically estimated specifically the linear approximation of the concentration gradient is expected to work well for dissolved phase sources in such scenario the aerobic reaction zone is usually developed in relatively close proximity to the water table above the source lahvis et al 2013 and the reaction zone is relatively short as the reaction can be considered almost instantaneous with respect to the diffusion of vapors in the vadose zone davis et al 2009 similarly in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons that typically show little o2 consumption and co2 production because of baseline soil respiration within the vadose zone devaull 2007 an associated flat rate of change in concentration over depth can be expected crc care 2018 above lnapl sources the position of the aerobic reaction is instead expected at some distance above the source zone because of higher hydrocarbon vapor mass flux abreu et al 2009 with thicker reaction zone compared to the one expected above dissolved phase sources davis et al 2005 fig 1 depicts the potential o2 and co2 profiles expected for the different scenarios discussed above note that these behaviors are analogous to the ones previously identified by roggemans et al 2001 and by davis et al 2005 for o2 and hydrocarbons thus in the presence of lnapl sources curvilinear or semi curvilinear o2 and co2 profiles are expected and in such cases the linear approximation underlying the traditional gradient method can fail to accurately predict the fluxes needed for the estimation of the natural attenuation rates to address this issue we propose a new approach for the gradient method that relies on simplified analytical solutions accounting for diffusive reactive transport the method is applied in a step wise fashion to estimate nszd rates based on data reported in published field studies the value of the method is illustrated through a comparative assessment of nszd rates determined using the new and traditional gradient methods 2 method development 2 1 analytical solutions the 1 d steady state analytical solutions were obtained assuming a homogenous soil with a constant diffusion coefficient as schematically illustrated in fig 2 fixed o2 and co2 concentrations at the ground surface and at the top of the anaerobic zone were set as boundary conditions for the derivation of the differential equations the exact analytical solutions obtained using these boundary conditions are reported in the supplementary material section here below are reported some simplified equations that approximate the exact solutions with errors typically in the order of 1 2 and in nearly all cases less than 15 the solutions were derived assuming a diffusion dominated transport of o2 and co2 in the vadose zone based on fick s law this assumption is common to many petroleum vapor intrusion models previously developed e g parker 2003 devaull 2007 davis et al 2009 verginelli and baciocchi 2011 2014 verginelli et al 2016a yao et al 2016 it is indeed recognized that in the vadose zone advection is usually negligible compared to diffusion mchugh and mcalary 2009 hers et al 2014 u s epa 2015 advection may become important at the ground surface and at depth near to the lnapl source zone when the rate of gas production from methanogenesis is high ma et al 2012 yao et al 2015 felice et al 2018 for instance molins et al 2010 estimated that at bemidji site advection was responsible for approximately 15 of the net flux of methane in the case of significant methanogenic biodegradation episodic bubble formation can also occur in the saturated zone that can lead to advective transport into the vadose zone amos et al 2005 sihota et al 2013 however according to the literature both advection and bubble formation are relevant only at depth near the water table e g in the capillary fringe on the other hand the advective flux due to barometric pumping caused by ambient pressure and temperature variations is usually limited to 1 m depth below ground surface mchugh and mcalary 2009 eklund 2016 and thus is not an issue for soil gas collected from probes located at greater depths 2 1 1 linear concentration profiles entire vadose zone the linear

of steps for applying the new nszd gradient method developed from the analytical solutions reported in the previous section a case study will be used to illustrate and reinforce the step by step process for the implementation of the analytical solutions 2 2 1 step 1 identify the appropriate analytical solution for each location the examination of the soil gas concentration profiles is first required to identify the behavior that best describes the field data the appropriate analytical solution can be inferred from the general shape of o2 or co2 soil gas concentration gradient in the region of the vadose zone where the soil gas data were collected as follows linear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1b and fig 2a associated with a relatively short reaction length which extends from the vapor source to below the lowermost soil gas sample location this scenario is most likely associated with dissolved phase or highly weathered lnapl sources with no methane generation the analytical solution that depicts this scenario is given by eqs 1 and 2 semi curvilinear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1c and fig 2b associated with a moderate reaction length which extends from the vapor source into the lower portion of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected this scenario is most likely associated with a slightly weathered lnapl source with little to no methane generation the analytical solution that defines this scenario is given by eqs 5 and 6 curvilinear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1d and fig 2c associated with a relatively long reaction length which extends from the source to ground surface i e across the entire portion of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected this scenario is most likely associated with a relatively fresh lnapl source with methane generation the analytical solution that defines this scenario is given by eqs 9 and 10 note that in some cases there will be insufficient soil gas data to assess whether the gradient is linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear in such cases it is recommended to apply all 3 analytical solutions to define a range of potential nszd rates 2 2 2 step 2 estimate the concentration gradient based on the selected behavior i e linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear profile the concentration gradient dc dz of o2 can be estimated as follows 15 dc o 2 dz o 2 upper o 2 lower Œ¥ z linear profile dc o 2 dz o 2 z lr o 2 semi curvilinear profile dc o 2 dz o 2 max lr o 2 curvilinear profile where lro2 is the reaction length for o2 o2 max is the concentration of o2 at the surface z 0 o2 z is the concentration of o2 at depth z at which the switch from a linear to a non linear concentration profile is observed o2 upper and o2 lower are the concentrations of o2 in the upper and lower control points for the application of the linear gradient method and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between these two points the concentration of o2 at the surface i e o2 max or o2 upper can be reasonably approximated by those of ambient air i e 20 9 that should be then converted in g m3 for the estimation of the concentration gradient for the definition of o2 z is critical the identification of the depth z i e the depth at which the switch from a linear to a non linear concentration profile is observed see fig 2 when the number of vertical soil gas probes are sufficient to define the vertical concentration profile e g 3 4 probes the z can be set as the depth of the soil gas probes at which the o2 gradient became more steep with depth for a limited number of vertical gas probes the z can be identified by calibrating eq 5 to fit field data the lower control point for oxygen o2 lower required for the linear profiles should be selected close to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil following the instructions suggested by api 2017 for co2 the concentration gradient dc dz can be estimated as follows 16 dc co 2 dz co 2 lower co 2 upper Œ¥ z linear profiles dc co 2 dz co 2 max lr co 2 curvilinear and semi curvilinear profiles where lrco2 is the reaction length for co2 co2 max is the maximum concentration in the vadose zone co2 upper and co2 lower are the concentrations of co2 in the upper and lower control points for the application of the linear gradient method and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between these two sampling points in contrast to o2 the maximum co2 concentration required for the estimation of the gradient for non linear profiles is more uncertain thus leading to potential underestimation of the concentration gradient hence the concentration gradient of co2 should be in most cases identified by calibrating the analytical solution to field data in this view nszd rates based on o2 concentration gradients are generally more accurate because of the uncertainty in estimating co2 max for the curvilinear and semi curvilinear profiles the other key parameter needed for the estimation of the concentration gradient is the reaction length lr here we propose two methods for the identification of lr the first method is based on the nomographs depicted in fig 3 that show for different values of the reaction length lr the o2 fig 3a and co2 fig 3b profiles with depth all the parameters are normalized to the anaerobic zone depth l and to the maximum o2 and co2 concentration note that for the curvilinear profiles the depth z is set equal to zero in this way the graph can be used for each specific case the anaerobic zone depth can be identified from soil gas data as the region where o2 concentrations diminish to 1 2 by plotting the field data in the figure the lr corresponding to the curve that best describes the vertical o2 or co2 concentration profile can be selected alternatively lr can be estimated from the change in o2 concentration over a specified depth specifically eq 9 can be rearranged to provide the expression needed for the estimation of lr from soil gas data 17 lr o 2 Œ¥ z ln o 2 z ln o 2 z Œ¥ z where o2 z and o2 z Œ¥z are the o2 gas concentrations measured at depths z and z Œ¥z and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between the sample points the sample points used in this equation should be selected above the top of lnapl source in the aerobic zone i e where o2 is higher than 1 2 and preferable in the region where the concentration profiles exhibit a curvilinear shape i e yellow zone in fig 1 when selecting these sample points it is critical to examine the location of the vapor probes relative to the location of key stratigraphy in order to use soil gas data representative of the main geology of the site furthermore soil gas probes located below the reaction zone should be avoided for instance high ch4 values with concentrations of o2 below 1 2 can be indicative of a soil gas probe below the reaction zone additionally review of soil boring logs can be used to identify the presence of residual lnapl in the vadose zone for instance as described by the itrc 2014 guidance the presence of lnapl in the vadose zone can be identified based on soil colors e g dark brown or black odors and voc data e g pid or fid higher than 500 ppm note also that high ch4 concentrations can create local pressure gradients and thus in this case the gradient method that neglects advection can underestimate the fluxes and the associated nszd rates in this case as used in molins et al 2010 analysis of nitrogen n2 at the proposed concentration gradient profiling depth may be helpful to verify the advective component from the calculated lr for o2 the reaction length for co2 can be estimated from eqs 11 and 12 assuming the same reaction rate constant Œª and air diffusion coefficients of 0 063 m2 h for o2 api 2010 and 0 05 m2 h for co2 massman 1998 18 lr co 2 lr co 2 lr o 2 lr o 2 0 9 lr o 2 2 2 3 step 3 optional validate the analytical solution validation and refinement of the reaction lengths and maximum o2 or co2 concentrations selected in step 2 can be achieved by comparing the concentration profile predicted by the analytical solution to the concentration profile measured in the field additionally from these comparisons it is possible to refine the values of the reaction length or the maximum o2 or co2 concentrations to best approximate the concentration profiles observed in the field 2 2 4 step 4 estimate the diffusion coefficients the diffusion coefficient deff is a key parameter for application of the gradient method the diffusion coefficients are dependent on soil type and more specifically the extent of moisture saturation of vadose zone soils thus site specific measurements at each soil gas probes are recommended for instance deff values can be estimated using site specific geotechnical data moisture content total porosity or in situ soil vapor diffusivity testing with tracer gases as shown by johnson et al 1998 when site specific values are not available a screening level assessment of nszd can be made by empirically calculating the diffusion coefficients with the millington and quirk 1961 equation 19 d eff d air Œ∏ a 10 3 Œ∏ e 2 where d air is the diffusion coefficients in air Œ∏ e the porosity of the soil and Œ∏ a the air filled porosity of the soil 2 2 5 step 5 estimate the mass flux from the concentration gradients and diffusion coefficients calculated as described in the previous steps it is possible to estimate the overall gas flux jtotal of o2 and co2 using fick s law 20 j total d eff dc dz where dc dz is the concentration gradient of o2 or co2 and deff the effective diffusion coefficient 2 2 6 step 6 correct for the baseline soil respiration as discussed earlier soils containing organic matter e g peat or humic matter carbonates or sulphides can consume o2 and or produce co2 itrc 2018 the soil respiration contribution must be determined and subtracted from the total flux to quantify the gas flux attributed only to nszd this can be done by background correction using radiocarbon isotopic 14c analysis to differentiate the co2 contribution from conversion of modern natural or fossil petroleum carbon carroll et al 2017 or by measuring the gas flux in a background location outside the lnapl footprint with similar surface and subsurface conditions sihota et al 2011 21 j nszd j total j background where jtotal is the total o2 or co2 flux measured above the hydrocarbon impacted soil and jbackground the flux measured in adjacent background locations not impacted by the lnapl 2 2 7 step 7 estimate the nszd rates nszd rates can be determined by stoichiometrically converting the measured gas flux of o2 or co2 using a reference compound 22 nszd j nszd Œ≥ where Œ≥ is the mass stoichiometric o2 or co2 coefficient in the hydrocarbons oxidation reaction typically the rate of nszd is estimated assuming octane as reference compound crc care 2018 23 c 8 h 18 12 5 o 2 8 co 2 g 9 h 2 o hence the stoichiometric coefficients of o2 Œ≥o2 and co2 Œ≥co2 are equal to 0 29 gc8h18 go2 and 0 32 gc8h18 gco2 respectively it is worth pointing out that the stoichiometric coefficients vary little for a wide range of hydrocarbons including methane 3 results and discussion 3 1 nomographs to estimate nszd rates nomographs were developed from the various analytical solutions to simplify the estimation of site specific nszd rates fig 4 the nomographs require estimates of reaction length the maximum concentrations of o2 and co2 and the o2 or co2 concentration gradient across the vadose zone region of interest as input fig 4a and b depicts the o2 and co2 fluxes calculated as a function of the reaction length lr for different maximum concentrations observed in the field 5 21 the reaction length to be used in these nomographs can be calculated from the field data either using the graphical method fig 3 or eq 17 for the estimation of the concentration gradient expressed as g m3 m the percentages of o2 and co2 were converted in g m3 assuming an average subsurface temperature of 15 c note that variations of the temperature within 10 c affect the estimated concentrations by less than 5 these nomographs should be used in both lnapl and background locations then the mass flux of o2 and co2 estimated above the hydrocarbon impacted soil should be corrected to account for the natural soil respiration by assuming the same diffusion coefficient for the hydrocarbon impacted area and the background location the correction of the mass flux can be done by subtracting to the concentration gradient value estimated for the hydrocarbon impacted soil the concentration gradient value estimated for the background location thus the corrected concentration gradient can be used in fig 4c and d to estimate the nszd rate as function of the type of soil coarse medium or fine grained soil assuming octane as reference compound to create this figure the o2 and co2 fluxes were estimated using the diffusion coefficients calculated with the millington and quirk 1961 equation the porosity and air filled porosity used for coarse medium and fine grained soils refer to the values suggested by u s epa 2017 for a sand loam and sandy clay soil according to the usda classification see supplementary material section 3 2 comparative assessment of concentration gradients fig 5 presents a comparison of the results obtained by the models described in this work with selected field data taken from the literature in particular the different sub figures report the concentrations of o2 and co2 measured at different depths in the vadose zone above the petroleum contaminated source expressed as a normalized depth z l and the corresponding concentration profiles simulated by the models table 1 reports a brief description of each site together with the values employed in the models to fit the field data from fig 5 it can be observed that the selected models resemble the concentration profiles observed in the field for the different behaviors discussed in the previous sections additionally from table 1 it can be noticed that the ratio of co2 and o2 reaction lengths lrco2 lro2 is near to 0 9 that as discussed before see eq 18 it is the value expected assuming the same reaction rate constant for o2 and co2 i e confirming the model assumptions based on the o2 concentration profiles depicted in the figure the concentration gradient dc dz was calculated for each site using the traditional approach and the modified method proposed in this work for non linear profiles for the traditional approach the concentration gradient dc dz was estimated either considering the maximum dc dz calculated for each interval depth or using as proposed by api 2017 the o2 concentration at the ground surface as upper point assumed equal to 21 and the o2 concentration measured at the depth of the aerobic to anaerobic zone i e the region where the o2 concentrations decrease to 1 2 as lower boundary control point see eq 15a for the modified gradient method eq 15b and eq 15c with the diffusive reaction lengths reported in table 1 were used a subsurface temperature of 15 c was used for the conversion of o2 percentage to concentration g m3 table 2 reports the concentration gradients for o2 calculated with the different methods described above from table 2 it can be observed that for the sites exhibiting an almost linear profiles site c and d in table 2 the traditional method indicated in the table as api method provides almost the same concentration gradient of the one calculated using the approach proposed in this work conversely for the other sites exhibiting curvilinear or semi curvilinear profiles the traditional gradient approach tends to underestimate the concentration gradient in particular the concentration gradients calculated using the lower and upper control points api method underestimates the o2 gradient from a 2 fold see site b in the table up to a 8 fold factor see site i in the table considering the maximum concentration gradient for each interval depth this underestimation is reduced to a maximum 4 fold factor see site h while for the sites exhibiting an almost linear profile with depth the traditional method slightly overestimated the o2 gradient these results confirm that for sites exhibiting an exponential behavior the application of the traditional gradient method can lead to inaccurate estimates of the o2 flux and of the associated nszd rates 3 3 application of the method to a case study to further illustrate the method introduced in this work this section reports an example of application to a case study presented in the api 2017 guidance where different nszd estimation methods were applied at a petroleum products terminal gradient passive flux traps and dynamic closed chamber dcc methods were applied at 4 locations of this site named nszd 1 nszd 2 nszd 3 and nszd 4 to evaluate the rates of nszd the soil gas sampling results needed for the application of the gradient method are summarized in table 3 along with the site specific diffusion coefficients here below we reported the step by step procedure presented in section 2 2 applied to this case study step 1 identify the appropriate analytical solution the first step for the application of the modified nszd gradient method is the examination of the soil gas concentration profiles to identify the behavior that best describes the field data from table 3 it can be observed that in all locations the o2 concentrations rapidly decreased with depth however for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations the concentrations of methane and gro gasoline range organics detected in the shallowest samples were still relevant indicating that the reaction zone was extending up to the surface for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations the concentrations of gro in the shallowest samples were instead below 10 mg m3 and the methane below 1 suggesting that the reaction was occurring in the deeper soil by plotting these data see fig 6 curvilinear concentration profiles can be observed for nszd 1 and nszd 2 whereas semi curvilinear profiles can be attributed to nszd 3 and nszd 4 step 2 estimate the concentration gradient as discussed in section 2 2 to calculate the concentration gradient the reaction length lr is first needed in this example the reaction lengths were calculated with eq 17 using the o2 data reported in table 3 for each location the calculated reaction lengths are reported in table 4 for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations the lr was calculated considering the shallowest sampling point 1 22 and 1 06 m and the soil gas probes with o2 concentrations higher than 1 i e 3 65 m for nszd 1 and 1 98 m for nszd 2 for instance for nszd 1 location considering the shallowest sample point 1 22 m and the sample point above the anaerobic zone where the o2 concentrations were higher than 1 i e 3 65 m the reaction length was calculated as follows 24 lr Œ¥ z ln o 2 z ln o 2 z Œ¥ z 3 65 1 22 ln 8 9 ln 1 6 1 42 m for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations the top of the reaction zone depth z was set equal to 1 22 m and the o2 concentration measured at this depth was used as the upper control point for the calculation of lr see eq 17 for the lower control point in nszd 4 the o2 measured at a depth of 2 13 m higher than 1 was used while for nszd 3 considering that the concentration of o2 in the probes was lower than 1 the reaction length was determined by fitting the field profiles with the concentration profiles estimated with eq 5 as shown in fig 6 next the o2 concentration gradients dc dz were calculated with eq 15 using for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations curvilinear profiles the maximum o2 concentration at the surface 20 9 or 288 g m3 considering a subsurface temperature of 10 c while for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations semi curvilinear profiles the o2 concentration at z see table 4 for instance for nszd 1 location the o2 concentration gradient was equal to 25 dc dz o 2 o 2 max lr 288 1 42 203 g m 3 m note that in the selected lower control points high ch4 concentrations were detected that can create local pressure gradients in this view the concentration gradients estimated with the method proposed in this work that neglects advection can be to some extent underestimated step 3 validate the analytical solution to check if the calculated lr values approximates well the field data they can be used in eqs 5 and 9 to estimate the vertical concentration profiles fig 6 shows that the profiles obtained with the model approximate well the field data in the same figure the profile obtained with the traditional gradient method is also reported highlighting that especially for nszd 1 and nszd 2 the linear concentration profile does not capture the behavior observed in the field step 4 estimate the diffusion coefficients in the case study presented in the api 2017 guidance site specific diffusion coefficients for o2 were calculated at the four soil gas sampling clusters through tracer tests with sf6 the calculated diffusion coefficients are reported in table 3 step 5 estimate the mass flux the o2 fluxes were then estimated using the fick s law assuming the site specific diffusion coefficients of o2 reported in table 3 for instance for nszd 1 location the o2 flux is equal to 26 j o 2 total d dc dz o 2 0 0033 86400 10000 203 5 8 g m 2 d for the other locations see table 4 step 6 correct for the baseline soil respiration in this case study soil gas data collected in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons were not available thus the nszd rates were calculated considering the total flux of o2 estimated at each location that also includes the o2 consumption due to the baseline soil respiration in this view the calculated nszd rates are certainly overestimated step 7 estimate the nszd rates finally the nszd rates see table 4 were calculated from the o2 flux estimated at each location assuming decane c10h22 as reference compound api 2017 for instance for nszd 1 location the nszd rate was calculated as follows 27 nszd j o 2 total Œ≥ 5 8 0 29 1 7 g m 2 d as discussed earlier in this case study soil gas data collected in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons were not available and thus the nszd rates refer to the total flux also including the o2 consumption due to the baseline soil respiration in this view the nszd rates reported in table 4 were compared with the results obtained with the other methods employed in the field without the correction for the background called in the api document as nszd uncorrected the outcome of this comparison is shown in fig 7 specifically the figure shows the nszd rates not corrected for the background estimated at the 4 locations with the two passive flux traps with the dynamic closed chambers dcc and with the gradient method gm for the latter the results obtained using either the refined approach proposed in this work refined gm or the traditional method traditional gm are reported as reference namely for the traditional gradient method the lower and upper control points selected in the api 2017 guidance were used see fig 6 from this comparison it is clear that for the nsdz 1 and nszd 2 locations which exhibit an exponential profile the traditional approach leads to nszd rates lower than the ones estimated with the other techniques up to a 4 fold factor see nszd 2 location this underestimation is less pronounced within a factor of 3 for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations where the assumption of a linear concentration profile with depth looks more reasonable see fig 6 conversely the application of the refined gradient method led to nszd rates in line with the other methods relying on surface flux measurement thus confirming the suitability of the proposed approach 4 conclusions the results shown in this work highlighted that for lnapl sites exhibiting non linear concentration profiles of o2 and co2 the traditional gradient method can underestimate the fluxes and associated nszd rates up to almost one order of magnitude in such cases the method based on reactive transport proposed in this work may be better suited the refinement of nszd rates is indeed important given that the experience gained in the last years shows that most all sites fall within a factor of 10 garg et al 2017 thus improving on that uncertainty would be critical in risk based decision making in terms of understanding whether nszd rates are sufficient to achieve regulatory standards e g mcls maximum contaminant levels within a reasonable time period or whether active remediation and eventually which type of active remediation is necessary in this view it is essential to keep in mind the underlying assumptions used to develop the analytical solutions proposed in this work for instance the model was derived assuming a homogenous soil and constant diffusion coefficient throughout the entire domain however sites characterized by the presence of different horizontal soil layers in the vadose zone could be characterized by vertically heterogeneous diffusion coefficients with consequent o2 and co2 profiles not captured by the simplified solutions presented here in such cases more complex solutions e g numerical models or other experimental field methods e g dcc passive flux traps might be preferred thus when using the modified nszd gradient method it is critical to examine the location of soil gas probes relative to the site stratigraphy the modified nszd gradient method should not be applied in areas where residual lnapl sources are present or suspected within the vertical region of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected i e present between soil gas probe locations lnapl sources are often identified from boring logs by the presence of staining odors or pid fid concentrations greater than 500 ppm itrc 2014 to reduce the uncertainty associated to the method more detailed characterization of the diffusion coefficients is recommended furthermore in the case that there will be insufficient soil gas data to assess whether the gradient is linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear applying the different analytical solutions proposed in this work may help to bound the range of nszd rates moreover quantifying the contribution of baseline respiration to o2 consumption and co2 production is critical to avoid overestimation of the nszd rates finally as for the other approaches the monitoring program should be designed to assess the temporal variability of the estimated nszd rates indeed although recent publications suggest that over a decade the nszd rate is generally zero order garg et al 2017 gas transport processes may undergo seasonal variations due to temperature and soil moisture effects sihota et al 2018 and water table fluctuations van de ven et al 2021 thus

1411,rates of natural source zone depletion nszd are increasingly being used to aid remedial decision making and light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl longevity estimates at petroleum release sites current nszd estimate methods based on analyses of carbon dioxide co2 and oxygen o2 soil gas concentration gradients gradient method assume linear concentration profiles with depth this assumption can underestimate the concentration gradients especially above lnapl sources that are typically characterized by curvilinear or semi curvilinear o2 and co2 concentration profiles in this work we proposed a new method that relies on calculating the o2 and co2 concentration gradient using a first order reaction model the method requires an estimate of the diffusive reaction length that can be easily derived from soil gas concentration data a simple step by step guide for applying the new method is provided nomographs were also developed to facilitate method application application of the nomographs using field data from published literature showed that nszd rates could be underestimated by nearly an order of magnitude if reactivity in the vadose zone is not accounted for the new

light non aqueous phase liquids lnapl that migrate downward in the vadose zone under the force of gravity rivett et al 2011 during the vertical percolation the lnapl is partially entrapped in the pores of the soil as an immobile residual phase due to the establishment of capillary forces itrc 2009 if the quantity of the release is significant lnapls can reach the capillary fringe and partially penetrate the saturated zone u s epa 1995 lnapl constituents in the smear zone undergo a series of naturally occurring processes that can lead to a progressive reduction of the source mass lari et al 2019 in the late 90 s the main mechanism attributed to the natural attenuation of lnapl was the dissolution of the soluble constituents in groundwater and the subsequent aqueous phase biodegradation occurring through various terminal electron acceptor processes newell et al 2002 the term used to describe the attenuation of concentration of dissolved constituents in groundwater was monitored natural attenuation or mna u s epa 1999 later it was found that within the lnapl body and overlying capillary fringe methanogenic biodegradation of hydrocarbons occurs and generates ch4 and co2 amos and mayer 2006 the methane and petroleum hydrocarbons volatilized from the saturated zone are then aerobically biodegraded in the vadose zone leading to a consumption of o2 from the soil gas and a generation of co2 and heat itrc 2018 these processes were found to be the main drivers of the progressive depletion of lnapl sources garg et al 2017 the combination of the attenuation processes occurring in the saturated and in the vadose zone is commonly termed natural source zone depletion or nszd api 2017 itrc 2018 an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that nszd occurs in most sites impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons with measured depletion rates ranging from thousands to tens of thousands of liters per hectare per year e g see amos et al 2005 johnson et al 2006 lundegard and johnson 2006 sihota et al 2011 mccoy et al 2014 sihota and mayer 2015 eichert et al 2017 garg et al 2017 verginelli et al 2018 sihota et al 2018 kulkarni et al 2020 mchugh et al 2020 devaull et al 2020 as described in detail in the recent guidelines issued by api 2017 itrc 2018 and crc care 2018 over the last decades several approaches were successfully applied to quantify the nszd rates the most widely used methods involve mass flux estimates of bulk hydrocarbon attenuation based on measuring rates of co2 production with dynamic closed chambers dcc sihota et al 2011 or passive flux traps mccoy et al 2014 and assumptions of biodegradation reaction stoichiometry itrc 2018 nszd rates can also be estimated by calibrating reactive transport models to o2 co2 or petroleum hydrocarbon soil gas concentration data lahvis and baehr 1996 lahvis et al 1999 some sites with significant methane production may require the application of relatively sophisticated numerical modeling sihota and mayer 2012 such as the min3p dusty model molins and mayer 2007 in the so called gradient method the difference in o2 or co2 concentration between the upper and lower boundary control points of measurement divided by the vertical distance between the control points gives an estimate of the vertical concentration gradient which is used to calculate the diffusive flux using the fick s law johnson et al 2006 lundegard and johnson 2006 the o2 and co2 fluxes are then stoichiometrically converted into a nszd rate a critical step for the application of the gradient method is the selection of the upper and lower boundary control points of o2 and co2 data needed for the linearization of the concentration profile the api 2017 guidance provides some indication on the selection of these locations above the hydrocarbon reaction zone and based on geologic and gas profile shape considerations however depending on the type of hydrocarbons source and on the number of vertical soil gas sampling points this linear approximation can lead to inaccurate estimates of the concentration gradient especially in lnapl source areas where nszd rates are typically estimated specifically the linear approximation of the concentration gradient is expected to work well for dissolved phase sources in such scenario the aerobic reaction zone is usually developed in relatively close proximity to the water table above the source lahvis et al 2013 and the reaction zone is relatively short as the reaction can be considered almost instantaneous with respect to the diffusion of vapors in the vadose zone davis et al 2009 similarly in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons that typically show little o2 consumption and co2 production because of baseline soil respiration within the vadose zone devaull 2007 an associated flat rate of change in concentration over depth can be expected crc care 2018 above lnapl sources the position of the aerobic reaction is instead expected at some distance above the source zone because of higher hydrocarbon vapor mass flux abreu et al 2009 with thicker reaction zone compared to the one expected above dissolved phase sources davis et al 2005 fig 1 depicts the potential o2 and co2 profiles expected for the different scenarios discussed above note that these behaviors are analogous to the ones previously identified by roggemans et al 2001 and by davis et al 2005 for o2 and hydrocarbons thus in the presence of lnapl sources curvilinear or semi curvilinear o2 and co2 profiles are expected and in such cases the linear approximation underlying the traditional gradient method can fail to accurately predict the fluxes needed for the estimation of the natural attenuation rates to address this issue we propose a new approach for the gradient method that relies on simplified analytical solutions accounting for diffusive reactive transport the method is applied in a step wise fashion to estimate nszd rates based on data reported in published field studies the value of the method is illustrated through a comparative assessment of nszd rates determined using the new and traditional gradient methods 2 method development 2 1 analytical solutions the 1 d steady state analytical solutions were obtained assuming a homogenous soil with a constant diffusion coefficient as schematically illustrated in fig 2 fixed o2 and co2 concentrations at the ground surface and at the top of the anaerobic zone were set as boundary conditions for the derivation of the differential equations the exact analytical solutions obtained using these boundary conditions are reported in the supplementary material section here below are reported some simplified equations that approximate the exact solutions with errors typically in the order of 1 2 and in nearly all cases less than 15 the solutions were derived assuming a diffusion dominated transport of o2 and co2 in the vadose zone based on fick s law this assumption is common to many petroleum vapor intrusion models previously developed e g parker 2003 devaull 2007 davis et al 2009 verginelli and baciocchi 2011 2014 verginelli et al 2016a yao et al 2016 it is indeed recognized that in the vadose zone advection is usually negligible compared to diffusion mchugh and mcalary 2009 hers et al 2014 u s epa 2015 advection may become important at the ground surface and at depth near to the lnapl source zone when the rate of gas production from methanogenesis is high ma et al 2012 yao et al 2015 felice et al 2018 for instance molins et al 2010 estimated that at bemidji site advection was responsible for approximately 15 of the net flux of methane in the case of significant methanogenic biodegradation episodic bubble formation can also occur in the saturated zone that can lead to advective transport into the vadose zone amos et al 2005 sihota et al 2013 however according to the literature both advection and bubble formation are relevant only at depth near the water table e g in the capillary fringe on the other hand the advective flux due to barometric pumping caused by ambient pressure and temperature variations is usually limited to 1 m depth below ground surface mchugh and mcalary 2009 eklund 2016 and thus is not an issue for soil gas collected from probes located at greater depths 2 1 1 linear concentration profiles entire vadose zone the linear

of steps for applying the new nszd gradient method developed from the analytical solutions reported in the previous section a case study will be used to illustrate and reinforce the step by step process for the implementation of the analytical solutions 2 2 1 step 1 identify the appropriate analytical solution for each location the examination of the soil gas concentration profiles is first required to identify the behavior that best describes the field data the appropriate analytical solution can be inferred from the general shape of o2 or co2 soil gas concentration gradient in the region of the vadose zone where the soil gas data were collected as follows linear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1b and fig 2a associated with a relatively short reaction length which extends from the vapor source to below the lowermost soil gas sample location this scenario is most likely associated with dissolved phase or highly weathered lnapl sources with no methane generation the analytical solution that depicts this scenario is given by eqs 1 and 2 semi curvilinear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1c and fig 2b associated with a moderate reaction length which extends from the vapor source into the lower portion of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected this scenario is most likely associated with a slightly weathered lnapl source with little to no methane generation the analytical solution that defines this scenario is given by eqs 5 and 6 curvilinear o2 or co2 gradient see fig 1d and fig 2c associated with a relatively long reaction length which extends from the source to ground surface i e across the entire portion of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected this scenario is most likely associated with a relatively fresh lnapl source with methane generation the analytical solution that defines this scenario is given by eqs 9 and 10 note that in some cases there will be insufficient soil gas data to assess whether the gradient is linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear in such cases it is recommended to apply all 3 analytical solutions to define a range of potential nszd rates 2 2 2 step 2 estimate the concentration gradient based on the selected behavior i e linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear profile the concentration gradient dc dz of o2 can be estimated as follows 15 dc o 2 dz o 2 upper o 2 lower Œ¥ z linear profile dc o 2 dz o 2 z lr o 2 semi curvilinear profile dc o 2 dz o 2 max lr o 2 curvilinear profile where lro2 is the reaction length for o2 o2 max is the concentration of o2 at the surface z 0 o2 z is the concentration of o2 at depth z at which the switch from a linear to a non linear concentration profile is observed o2 upper and o2 lower are the concentrations of o2 in the upper and lower control points for the application of the linear gradient method and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between these two points the concentration of o2 at the surface i e o2 max or o2 upper can be reasonably approximated by those of ambient air i e 20 9 that should be then converted in g m3 for the estimation of the concentration gradient for the definition of o2 z is critical the identification of the depth z i e the depth at which the switch from a linear to a non linear concentration profile is observed see fig 2 when the number of vertical soil gas probes are sufficient to define the vertical concentration profile e g 3 4 probes the z can be set as the depth of the soil gas probes at which the o2 gradient became more steep with depth for a limited number of vertical gas probes the z can be identified by calibrating eq 5 to fit field data the lower control point for oxygen o2 lower required for the linear profiles should be selected close to the top of the petroleum hydrocarbon impacted soil following the instructions suggested by api 2017 for co2 the concentration gradient dc dz can be estimated as follows 16 dc co 2 dz co 2 lower co 2 upper Œ¥ z linear profiles dc co 2 dz co 2 max lr co 2 curvilinear and semi curvilinear profiles where lrco2 is the reaction length for co2 co2 max is the maximum concentration in the vadose zone co2 upper and co2 lower are the concentrations of co2 in the upper and lower control points for the application of the linear gradient method and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between these two sampling points in contrast to o2 the maximum co2 concentration required for the estimation of the gradient for non linear profiles is more uncertain thus leading to potential underestimation of the concentration gradient hence the concentration gradient of co2 should be in most cases identified by calibrating the analytical solution to field data in this view nszd rates based on o2 concentration gradients are generally more accurate because of the uncertainty in estimating co2 max for the curvilinear and semi curvilinear profiles the other key parameter needed for the estimation of the concentration gradient is the reaction length lr here we propose two methods for the identification of lr the first method is based on the nomographs depicted in fig 3 that show for different values of the reaction length lr the o2 fig 3a and co2 fig 3b profiles with depth all the parameters are normalized to the anaerobic zone depth l and to the maximum o2 and co2 concentration note that for the curvilinear profiles the depth z is set equal to zero in this way the graph can be used for each specific case the anaerobic zone depth can be identified from soil gas data as the region where o2 concentrations diminish to 1 2 by plotting the field data in the figure the lr corresponding to the curve that best describes the vertical o2 or co2 concentration profile can be selected alternatively lr can be estimated from the change in o2 concentration over a specified depth specifically eq 9 can be rearranged to provide the expression needed for the estimation of lr from soil gas data 17 lr o 2 Œ¥ z ln o 2 z ln o 2 z Œ¥ z where o2 z and o2 z Œ¥z are the o2 gas concentrations measured at depths z and z Œ¥z and Œ¥z is the vertical distance between the sample points the sample points used in this equation should be selected above the top of lnapl source in the aerobic zone i e where o2 is higher than 1 2 and preferable in the region where the concentration profiles exhibit a curvilinear shape i e yellow zone in fig 1 when selecting these sample points it is critical to examine the location of the vapor probes relative to the location of key stratigraphy in order to use soil gas data representative of the main geology of the site furthermore soil gas probes located below the reaction zone should be avoided for instance high ch4 values with concentrations of o2 below 1 2 can be indicative of a soil gas probe below the reaction zone additionally review of soil boring logs can be used to identify the presence of residual lnapl in the vadose zone for instance as described by the itrc 2014 guidance the presence of lnapl in the vadose zone can be identified based on soil colors e g dark brown or black odors and voc data e g pid or fid higher than 500 ppm note also that high ch4 concentrations can create local pressure gradients and thus in this case the gradient method that neglects advection can underestimate the fluxes and the associated nszd rates in this case as used in molins et al 2010 analysis of nitrogen n2 at the proposed concentration gradient profiling depth may be helpful to verify the advective component from the calculated lr for o2 the reaction length for co2 can be estimated from eqs 11 and 12 assuming the same reaction rate constant Œª and air diffusion coefficients of 0 063 m2 h for o2 api 2010 and 0 05 m2 h for co2 massman 1998 18 lr co 2 lr co 2 lr o 2 lr o 2 0 9 lr o 2 2 2 3 step 3 optional validate the analytical solution validation and refinement of the reaction lengths and maximum o2 or co2 concentrations selected in step 2 can be achieved by comparing the concentration profile predicted by the analytical solution to the concentration profile measured in the field additionally from these comparisons it is possible to refine the values of the reaction length or the maximum o2 or co2 concentrations to best approximate the concentration profiles observed in the field 2 2 4 step 4 estimate the diffusion coefficients the diffusion coefficient deff is a key parameter for application of the gradient method the diffusion coefficients are dependent on soil type and more specifically the extent of moisture saturation of vadose zone soils thus site specific measurements at each soil gas probes are recommended for instance deff values can be estimated using site specific geotechnical data moisture content total porosity or in situ soil vapor diffusivity testing with tracer gases as shown by johnson et al 1998 when site specific values are not available a screening level assessment of nszd can be made by empirically calculating the diffusion coefficients with the millington and quirk 1961 equation 19 d eff d air Œ∏ a 10 3 Œ∏ e 2 where d air is the diffusion coefficients in air Œ∏ e the porosity of the soil and Œ∏ a the air filled porosity of the soil 2 2 5 step 5 estimate the mass flux from the concentration gradients and diffusion coefficients calculated as described in the previous steps it is possible to estimate the overall gas flux jtotal of o2 and co2 using fick s law 20 j total d eff dc dz where dc dz is the concentration gradient of o2 or co2 and deff the effective diffusion coefficient 2 2 6 step 6 correct for the baseline soil respiration as discussed earlier soils containing organic matter e g peat or humic matter carbonates or sulphides can consume o2 and or produce co2 itrc 2018 the soil respiration contribution must be determined and subtracted from the total flux to quantify the gas flux attributed only to nszd this can be done by background correction using radiocarbon isotopic 14c analysis to differentiate the co2 contribution from conversion of modern natural or fossil petroleum carbon carroll et al 2017 or by measuring the gas flux in a background location outside the lnapl footprint with similar surface and subsurface conditions sihota et al 2011 21 j nszd j total j background where jtotal is the total o2 or co2 flux measured above the hydrocarbon impacted soil and jbackground the flux measured in adjacent background locations not impacted by the lnapl 2 2 7 step 7 estimate the nszd rates nszd rates can be determined by stoichiometrically converting the measured gas flux of o2 or co2 using a reference compound 22 nszd j nszd Œ≥ where Œ≥ is the mass stoichiometric o2 or co2 coefficient in the hydrocarbons oxidation reaction typically the rate of nszd is estimated assuming octane as reference compound crc care 2018 23 c 8 h 18 12 5 o 2 8 co 2 g 9 h 2 o hence the stoichiometric coefficients of o2 Œ≥o2 and co2 Œ≥co2 are equal to 0 29 gc8h18 go2 and 0 32 gc8h18 gco2 respectively it is worth pointing out that the stoichiometric coefficients vary little for a wide range of hydrocarbons including methane 3 results and discussion 3 1 nomographs to estimate nszd rates nomographs were developed from the various analytical solutions to simplify the estimation of site specific nszd rates fig 4 the nomographs require estimates of reaction length the maximum concentrations of o2 and co2 and the o2 or co2 concentration gradient across the vadose zone region of interest as input fig 4a and b depicts the o2 and co2 fluxes calculated as a function of the reaction length lr for different maximum concentrations observed in the field 5 21 the reaction length to be used in these nomographs can be calculated from the field data either using the graphical method fig 3 or eq 17 for the estimation of the concentration gradient expressed as g m3 m the percentages of o2 and co2 were converted in g m3 assuming an average subsurface temperature of 15 c note that variations of the temperature within 10 c affect the estimated concentrations by less than 5 these nomographs should be used in both lnapl and background locations then the mass flux of o2 and co2 estimated above the hydrocarbon impacted soil should be corrected to account for the natural soil respiration by assuming the same diffusion coefficient for the hydrocarbon impacted area and the background location the correction of the mass flux can be done by subtracting to the concentration gradient value estimated for the hydrocarbon impacted soil the concentration gradient value estimated for the background location thus the corrected concentration gradient can be used in fig 4c and d to estimate the nszd rate as function of the type of soil coarse medium or fine grained soil assuming octane as reference compound to create this figure the o2 and co2 fluxes were estimated using the diffusion coefficients calculated with the millington and quirk 1961 equation the porosity and air filled porosity used for coarse medium and fine grained soils refer to the values suggested by u s epa 2017 for a sand loam and sandy clay soil according to the usda classification see supplementary material section 3 2 comparative assessment of concentration gradients fig 5 presents a comparison of the results obtained by the models described in this work with selected field data taken from the literature in particular the different sub figures report the concentrations of o2 and co2 measured at different depths in the vadose zone above the petroleum contaminated source expressed as a normalized depth z l and the corresponding concentration profiles simulated by the models table 1 reports a brief description of each site together with the values employed in the models to fit the field data from fig 5 it can be observed that the selected models resemble the concentration profiles observed in the field for the different behaviors discussed in the previous sections additionally from table 1 it can be noticed that the ratio of co2 and o2 reaction lengths lrco2 lro2 is near to 0 9 that as discussed before see eq 18 it is the value expected assuming the same reaction rate constant for o2 and co2 i e confirming the model assumptions based on the o2 concentration profiles depicted in the figure the concentration gradient dc dz was calculated for each site using the traditional approach and the modified method proposed in this work for non linear profiles for the traditional approach the concentration gradient dc dz was estimated either considering the maximum dc dz calculated for each interval depth or using as proposed by api 2017 the o2 concentration at the ground surface as upper point assumed equal to 21 and the o2 concentration measured at the depth of the aerobic to anaerobic zone i e the region where the o2 concentrations decrease to 1 2 as lower boundary control point see eq 15a for the modified gradient method eq 15b and eq 15c with the diffusive reaction lengths reported in table 1 were used a subsurface temperature of 15 c was used for the conversion of o2 percentage to concentration g m3 table 2 reports the concentration gradients for o2 calculated with the different methods described above from table 2 it can be observed that for the sites exhibiting an almost linear profiles site c and d in table 2 the traditional method indicated in the table as api method provides almost the same concentration gradient of the one calculated using the approach proposed in this work conversely for the other sites exhibiting curvilinear or semi curvilinear profiles the traditional gradient approach tends to underestimate the concentration gradient in particular the concentration gradients calculated using the lower and upper control points api method underestimates the o2 gradient from a 2 fold see site b in the table up to a 8 fold factor see site i in the table considering the maximum concentration gradient for each interval depth this underestimation is reduced to a maximum 4 fold factor see site h while for the sites exhibiting an almost linear profile with depth the traditional method slightly overestimated the o2 gradient these results confirm that for sites exhibiting an exponential behavior the application of the traditional gradient method can lead to inaccurate estimates of the o2 flux and of the associated nszd rates 3 3 application of the method to a case study to further illustrate the method introduced in this work this section reports an example of application to a case study presented in the api 2017 guidance where different nszd estimation methods were applied at a petroleum products terminal gradient passive flux traps and dynamic closed chamber dcc methods were applied at 4 locations of this site named nszd 1 nszd 2 nszd 3 and nszd 4 to evaluate the rates of nszd the soil gas sampling results needed for the application of the gradient method are summarized in table 3 along with the site specific diffusion coefficients here below we reported the step by step procedure presented in section 2 2 applied to this case study step 1 identify the appropriate analytical solution the first step for the application of the modified nszd gradient method is the examination of the soil gas concentration profiles to identify the behavior that best describes the field data from table 3 it can be observed that in all locations the o2 concentrations rapidly decreased with depth however for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations the concentrations of methane and gro gasoline range organics detected in the shallowest samples were still relevant indicating that the reaction zone was extending up to the surface for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations the concentrations of gro in the shallowest samples were instead below 10 mg m3 and the methane below 1 suggesting that the reaction was occurring in the deeper soil by plotting these data see fig 6 curvilinear concentration profiles can be observed for nszd 1 and nszd 2 whereas semi curvilinear profiles can be attributed to nszd 3 and nszd 4 step 2 estimate the concentration gradient as discussed in section 2 2 to calculate the concentration gradient the reaction length lr is first needed in this example the reaction lengths were calculated with eq 17 using the o2 data reported in table 3 for each location the calculated reaction lengths are reported in table 4 for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations the lr was calculated considering the shallowest sampling point 1 22 and 1 06 m and the soil gas probes with o2 concentrations higher than 1 i e 3 65 m for nszd 1 and 1 98 m for nszd 2 for instance for nszd 1 location considering the shallowest sample point 1 22 m and the sample point above the anaerobic zone where the o2 concentrations were higher than 1 i e 3 65 m the reaction length was calculated as follows 24 lr Œ¥ z ln o 2 z ln o 2 z Œ¥ z 3 65 1 22 ln 8 9 ln 1 6 1 42 m for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations the top of the reaction zone depth z was set equal to 1 22 m and the o2 concentration measured at this depth was used as the upper control point for the calculation of lr see eq 17 for the lower control point in nszd 4 the o2 measured at a depth of 2 13 m higher than 1 was used while for nszd 3 considering that the concentration of o2 in the probes was lower than 1 the reaction length was determined by fitting the field profiles with the concentration profiles estimated with eq 5 as shown in fig 6 next the o2 concentration gradients dc dz were calculated with eq 15 using for nszd 1 and nszd 2 locations curvilinear profiles the maximum o2 concentration at the surface 20 9 or 288 g m3 considering a subsurface temperature of 10 c while for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations semi curvilinear profiles the o2 concentration at z see table 4 for instance for nszd 1 location the o2 concentration gradient was equal to 25 dc dz o 2 o 2 max lr 288 1 42 203 g m 3 m note that in the selected lower control points high ch4 concentrations were detected that can create local pressure gradients in this view the concentration gradients estimated with the method proposed in this work that neglects advection can be to some extent underestimated step 3 validate the analytical solution to check if the calculated lr values approximates well the field data they can be used in eqs 5 and 9 to estimate the vertical concentration profiles fig 6 shows that the profiles obtained with the model approximate well the field data in the same figure the profile obtained with the traditional gradient method is also reported highlighting that especially for nszd 1 and nszd 2 the linear concentration profile does not capture the behavior observed in the field step 4 estimate the diffusion coefficients in the case study presented in the api 2017 guidance site specific diffusion coefficients for o2 were calculated at the four soil gas sampling clusters through tracer tests with sf6 the calculated diffusion coefficients are reported in table 3 step 5 estimate the mass flux the o2 fluxes were then estimated using the fick s law assuming the site specific diffusion coefficients of o2 reported in table 3 for instance for nszd 1 location the o2 flux is equal to 26 j o 2 total d dc dz o 2 0 0033 86400 10000 203 5 8 g m 2 d for the other locations see table 4 step 6 correct for the baseline soil respiration in this case study soil gas data collected in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons were not available thus the nszd rates were calculated considering the total flux of o2 estimated at each location that also includes the o2 consumption due to the baseline soil respiration in this view the calculated nszd rates are certainly overestimated step 7 estimate the nszd rates finally the nszd rates see table 4 were calculated from the o2 flux estimated at each location assuming decane c10h22 as reference compound api 2017 for instance for nszd 1 location the nszd rate was calculated as follows 27 nszd j o 2 total Œ≥ 5 8 0 29 1 7 g m 2 d as discussed earlier in this case study soil gas data collected in areas not impacted by hydrocarbons were not available and thus the nszd rates refer to the total flux also including the o2 consumption due to the baseline soil respiration in this view the nszd rates reported in table 4 were compared with the results obtained with the other methods employed in the field without the correction for the background called in the api document as nszd uncorrected the outcome of this comparison is shown in fig 7 specifically the figure shows the nszd rates not corrected for the background estimated at the 4 locations with the two passive flux traps with the dynamic closed chambers dcc and with the gradient method gm for the latter the results obtained using either the refined approach proposed in this work refined gm or the traditional method traditional gm are reported as reference namely for the traditional gradient method the lower and upper control points selected in the api 2017 guidance were used see fig 6 from this comparison it is clear that for the nsdz 1 and nszd 2 locations which exhibit an exponential profile the traditional approach leads to nszd rates lower than the ones estimated with the other techniques up to a 4 fold factor see nszd 2 location this underestimation is less pronounced within a factor of 3 for nszd 3 and nszd 4 locations where the assumption of a linear concentration profile with depth looks more reasonable see fig 6 conversely the application of the refined gradient method led to nszd rates in line with the other methods relying on surface flux measurement thus confirming the suitability of the proposed approach 4 conclusions the results shown in this work highlighted that for lnapl sites exhibiting non linear concentration profiles of o2 and co2 the traditional gradient method can underestimate the fluxes and associated nszd rates up to almost one order of magnitude in such cases the method based on reactive transport proposed in this work may be better suited the refinement of nszd rates is indeed important given that the experience gained in the last years shows that most all sites fall within a factor of 10 garg et al 2017 thus improving on that uncertainty would be critical in risk based decision making in terms of understanding whether nszd rates are sufficient to achieve regulatory standards e g mcls maximum contaminant levels within a reasonable time period or whether active remediation and eventually which type of active remediation is necessary in this view it is essential to keep in mind the underlying assumptions used to develop the analytical solutions proposed in this work for instance the model was derived assuming a homogenous soil and constant diffusion coefficient throughout the entire domain however sites characterized by the presence of different horizontal soil layers in the vadose zone could be characterized by vertically heterogeneous diffusion coefficients with consequent o2 and co2 profiles not captured by the simplified solutions presented here in such cases more complex solutions e g numerical models or other experimental field methods e g dcc passive flux traps might be preferred thus when using the modified nszd gradient method it is critical to examine the location of soil gas probes relative to the site stratigraphy the modified nszd gradient method should not be applied in areas where residual lnapl sources are present or suspected within the vertical region of the vadose zone where soil gas data were collected i e present between soil gas probe locations lnapl sources are often identified from boring logs by the presence of staining odors or pid fid concentrations greater than 500 ppm itrc 2014 to reduce the uncertainty associated to the method more detailed characterization of the diffusion coefficients is recommended furthermore in the case that there will be insufficient soil gas data to assess whether the gradient is linear semi curvilinear or curvilinear applying the different analytical solutions proposed in this work may help to bound the range of nszd rates moreover quantifying the contribution of baseline respiration to o2 consumption and co2 production is critical to avoid overestimation of the nszd rates finally as for the other approaches the monitoring program should be designed to assess the temporal variability of the estimated nszd rates indeed although recent publications suggest that over a decade the nszd rate is generally zero order garg et al 2017 gas transport processes may undergo seasonal variations due to temperature and soil moisture effects sihota et al 2018 and water table fluctuations van de ven et al 2021 thus

1412,some remediation techniques such as thermal remediation can significantly change the soil properties these changes can be beneficial or detrimental to the sequential application of nature based solutions this work evaluated the effects of thermal remediation on the properties of two tropical soils technosol and oxisol and discuss how these changes might impact both biotic and abiotic degradation processes bench tests using disturbed samples were performed under oxic and anoxic conditions whereas 3d physical models were used to simulate the heat distribution along undisturbed samples the changes in soils texture density hydraulic conductivity iron concentration mineralogy and microbiota were evaluated the properties of oxisol were more affected than those of technosol due to the higher levels in fe iii organic carbon and finer texture when heated in the range of 120 to 300 c under oxic and anoxic conditions the fe ii content and the magnetism intensity increased in oxisol probably due to the formation of magnetite under oxic conditions the burning of oxisol organic matter promoted an anoxic atmosphere favoring the formation of fe ii however the continuous increase of the temperature 300 c lead to the decrease of fe ii due to the transformation of magnetite to maghemite and then to hematite the heating process also promoted some minerals decomposition and cementation of the clay fraction increasing the soil texture bacterial populations were impacted but showed ability to recover at 60 c however above 100 c no culturable cells were recovered and at temperatures above 270 c soil sterilization occurred the changes observed especially in oxisol samples indicated that mild heating between 120 and 240 c in turn can increase the potential for abiotic degradation of some contaminants such as chlorinated solvents therefore heating conditions up to 240 c during thermal remediation can be defined as to promote beneficial changes in soil properties increasing its potential for natural attenuation by abiotic processes even when the microbiota is affected and improving its sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tropical soils thermal remediation biodegradation abiotic degradation 1 introduction as the use of nature based solutions nbs gain popularity to address societal challenges by improving ecosystem services the discussion on their applicability benefits and potential applications to contaminated sites remediation is still incipient cohen shacham et al 2016 lafortezza et al 2018 song et al 2019 typical nbs alternatives include bioremediation and phytoremediation abiotic degradation by naturally occurring minerals such as dechlorination of chlorinated solvents by fe ii minerals could also be part of a nbs resulting in increased natural attenuation rates he et al 2015 schaefer et al 2017 however there are limitations for these solutions such as type and extension of the contamination and time constraints song et al 2019 one alternative to deal with such limitations is to integrate nbs with technological and engineering solutions cohen shacham et al 2016 one technique applied to remediate high concentration zones in short times is in situ thermal remediation which is based on heating the subsurface to remove the contaminant colombano et al 2020 leite et al 2020 the soil and groundwater temperature might be increased using different techniques such as water or hot air injection steam thermal conduction low frequency electric heating radio frequency and micro heating waves or by a combination of these methods friis et al 2005 friis 2006 colombano et al 2020 the increase in temperature enhances contaminants volatilization by increasing the vapor pressure and henry s constant friis et al 2005 friis 2006 chen et al 2012 also the mobility of organic compounds is enhanced due to solubility increase and decrease of sorption viscosity and surface tension muller et al 2009 chen et al 2012 ding et al 2019 however since in general thermal remediation does not promote the contaminants in situ degradation it requires other technologies for contaminant removal and treatment blanchard and stamnes 1997 contaminant removal is usually achieved using soil vapor extraction or multiphase extraction systems friis et al 2005 friis 2006 suthersan et al 2017 more than 98 mass of volatile and semi volatile contaminants can be removed by this technique in relatively short operation times ding et al 2019 o brien et al 2018 vidonish et al 2016 the most used temperature range is 80 to 100 c but sometimes it can reach temperatures up to 600 c depending on the target contaminant and technique applied for heating for example to achieve 100 c in the treatment zone by thermal conduction heating temperatures applied in the heating element might range from 400 to 500 c the heating can cause significant changes to chemical physical and microbiological characteristics of the soil and groundwater such as changes in texture mineralogy chemistry ph and organic matter content o brien et al 2018 for example as the temperature reaches a mineral decomposition temperature amorphous phases are formed which can cement the clay particles forming larger particles altering the soil granulometry the ph of soils heated at low temperatures 250 c tends to remain stable or slightly decrease but at higher temperatures soil ph increases due to the combustion of organic matter o brien et al 2018 till et al 2015 also observed that the heating of minerals with fe iii as goethite at reducing atmosphere can promote the formation of fe ii clement et al 2011 and jordanova et al 2019 also observed an increase in magnetism in soils subjected to burning in these cases the heating generated by the fire in the presence of organic matter altered the redox conditions of iron oxides and hydroxides leading to a magnetic enhancement therefore considering that fe ii minerals can promote the abiotic dechlorination of some compounds the presence of minerals with fe iii as goethite and hematite during the thermal remediation might increase the rates of abiotic in situ contaminant mass degradation in brazil most soils are rich in minerals with fe iii due to the tropical climate resulting in increased iron oxides and hydroxides in soils such as oxisols the content of iron in these soils is greater than 360 g kg 1 embrapa 2006 also soil heating at low temperatures can stimulate the growth of microorganisms and consequently increase biodegradation rates horst et al 2018 temperatures in the mesophilic range between 25 c and 40 c can result in higher contaminant bioavailability and consequently biodegradability das 2014 however the process of in situ contaminants biodegradation may not happen or is not significant when the mass transferring mechanisms predominates the high energy demand to sustain high temperatures the need to treat contaminants ex situ after removal and the changes in soil properties are challenges for thermal in situ remediation when sustainability criteria are considered vidonish et al 2016 one alternative to increase in situ thermal remediation environmental compatibility is to combine it and use it to promote naturally occurring degradation processes biotic and abiotic truex et al 2007 badin et al 2016 horst et al 2018 therefore thermal remediation can be conceived as a first step to a nature based solution combining an initial contaminant mass removal by heating to a second step nbs this could potentially decrease the heating time and or temperature and promote changes in soil that are advantageous for a nbs therefore in this work we aimed to evaluate how thermal remediation might be engineered in tropical environments so its effects on soil characteristics and properties help promote nbs considering biotic and abiotic processes for contaminants degradation to achieve that bench tests disturbed samples and tests on 3d physical models undisturbed samples were performed to evaluate how soil properties are impacted under different environmental and heating conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 soils experimental tests were performed simulating thermal remediation in two types of soils from a tropical environment oxisol and a technosol oxisol is a tropical soil highly weathered rich in iron and aluminum oxides oxisol samples were obtained in piracicaba s√£o paulo state brazil at 0 85 m depth from the bw horizon the oxisol has been described in previous studies ferreira et al 2017 oliveira et al 2016 the soil samples described and classified as technosol by gomes 2019 were collected in diadema s√£o paulo state brazil at 1 60 m depth in the c horizon this soil horizon was formed in situ from the weathering of the parental rock granite present just below it the upper soil horizons were significantly altered by anthropogenic activities leading to its classification as technosol gomes 2019 2 2 heating tests two types of tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the heating process on the main characteristics and properties of the soils the first test studied the influence of oxidizing and reducing atmospheres in the heating process of the two studied soils disturbed samples at different temperatures ambient to 450 c the second test evaluated the heat distribution and dissipation and changes in soil properties in undisturbed technosol columns 3d physical model 2 2 1 disturbed soil samples heating in oxic and anoxic conditions thermal remediation might be applied in oxidizing or reducing atmosphere conditions even at oxidizing conditions the presence of organic matter in the soil composition can induce to anoxic conditions producing co2 by burning till and nowaczyk 2018 therefore these tests simulated soil heating under oxidizing and reducing conditions to evaluate the effect of the atmosphere on the soils physical chemical and mineralogical characteristics and properties both soils were used on these tests in the tests performed at oxidizing atmosphere 10 g of disturbed soil samples were put in a porcelain crucible and heated inside a muffle furnace gp cient√≠fica at temperatures ranging from 120 to 550 c for one and 3 h in the tests performed at reducing atmosphere a continuous nitrogen flow was supplied in a tubular muffle furnace edg equipamentos the samples 10 g were heated for 1 h at the same temperature range used in the oxidizing condition tests disturbed technosol samples were also used in microcosms containing 5 g soil to assess the influence of heating on the microbiota survival and ability to recolonize the soil microcosms were set in sterile 50 ml borosilicate serum flasks and heated at 60 100 270 and 350 c exposure time of soil to each temperature was based on the 3d physical model heating curve section 222 test 1 and was of 3 days for 60 and 100 c and 1 h for 270 and 350 c after heating the microcosms were incubated at 24 c for 10 30 60 and 90 days in order to detect the soil recolonization by the microbiota microcosms were set in quintuplicate for each temperature and incubation period the soil was moistened with 1 ml sterile distilled water before and after heating 2 2 2 three dimensional physical model undisturbed soil sample two 200 mm diameter 350 mm length undisturbed technosol soil columns were used as three dimensional models to simulate the heating process by thermal conduction to obtain the soil columns a trench was dug to the desired depth and a 2 mm thick stainless steel cylinder was used to collect the samples by percussion the soil columns were brought to the laboratory and the bottom and top parts were attached as shown in fig 1 the columns were slowly saturated over five days from bottom to top with deaired distilled water an electrical resistor was installed in the center of the model for soil heating the temperature distribution within the soil was monitored by thermocouple sensors positioned on 30 cm long rods installed inside the soil column these sensors were installed in 2 sections in the radial direction and each of these sections was composed by 3 rods installed vertically with 4 sensors in each one fig 2 an opening in the column cover was left open to prevent pressurization inside the column due to water vaporization this system was connected to a computer with a programmable logic controller plc associated to a supervisory software where the temperature data measured in each sensor were simultaneously read and registered at pre determined time intervals two different conditions were evaluated in the first condition test 1 the soil was initially saturated but water was not replaced during the heating process in this test the power applied was initially 250 w which was doubled after 2 h when the soil temperature stabilized at 100 c the heating process was ended when the temperature reached 450 c maximum admissible temperature in the resistance in test 2 the water level was kept constant at an elevation of 6 5 cm from the bottom of the column slightly below the interface between zones c and d fig 2 the resistance power was kept constant at 1000 w this test was performed twice test 2a and 2b using the same soil column to evaluate the impact of reheating on the soil thermal properties temperature data was collected every minute on test 1 and every 5 min on tests 2a and 2b the temperature data measured in the sensor located at position 1 zone b s1 zb were used to estimate the soil effective thermal conductivity of the bulk soil particles and fluids based on the temperature variation with time healy et al 1976 seiferlin et al 1996 colombano et al 2020 this sensor was selected for being located closer to the heating source and farther from the column extremities after cooling the soil column from test 1 was removed from the stainless steel cylinder and samples were carefully collected for characterization of physical chemical and mineralogical properties the soil samples were collected in three points from the center of the column p1 at the position where the soil was submitted to the highest temperature range up to 450 c p2 at the intermediate temperature maximum of 300 c and p3 at the lowest temperature range maximum of 240 c disturbed samples were analyzed for particle size distribution particle density organic carbon content chemical composition and micromorphology undisturbed samples were also collected for hydraulic conductivity determination 2 3 soil samples

identification of the structures was performed by comparison with the international center for diffraction data icdd soils chemical composition was analyzed by x ray fluorescence spectrometry axios advanced panalytical fe ii quantification was performed by the 1 10 phenanthroline method jeffery et al 1989 in this method 25 ml of the extracted sample prepared with hcl and hno3 was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask then 2 ml of sodium acetate buffer solution and 2 ml of 1 10 phenanthroline solution were added after 10 min the samples were analyzed on uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo scientific at 510 nm wavelength the fraction of organic carbon was determined by oxidation with potassium dichromate in the presence of sulphuric acid following the method proposed by camargo et al 2009 based on the walkley black method soil ph was determined based on the methodology presented in camargo et al 2009 in this analysis 25 ml of distilled water were added to 10 g of soil then the samples were shaken and left to rest for 1 h before the ph was measured in a ph meter hi 221 hanna instruments the soils specific surface area was determined using the adsorption and desorption nitrogen n2 isotherms by the bet brunauer emmet and teller method the soils samples were prepared and analyzed respectively in the vacprep 061 micromeritics and a gemini iii 2375 micromeritics the soil samples were subjected to vacuum 100 Œºm of hg and heated for 15 h 200 c the images showing the micromorphology of the studied soils were obtained by scanning electron microscopy jsm 6610lv jeol the samples were coated with carbon denton vacuum desk v before analysis the thermal effects on the soil samples were analyzed by studying the thermogravimetry tg its derivative dtg and the thermogravimetry tga curves thermal analyses were performed by means of a dtg 60h shimadzu operating from room temperature to 1000 c at 10 c min 1 in a flow of nitrogen grain size distribution was analyzed by laser diffraction on a cilas 1190 particle size analyzer with a detection range from 0 04 to 2500 Œºm and liquid dispersion the samples were processed based on the method developed by miller and schaetzl 2012 where 0 5 g of the soil were added to a falcon tube with 5 ml of sodium hexametaphosphate 1 g l 1 and 15 ml of distilled water and agitated for 48 h before being analyzed to quantify the changes in hydraulic conductivity k 20 mm long undisturbed samples were collected in a 6 mm id stainless steel pipe from the technosol column the samples were analyzed in a falling head permeameter particle density determination was performed by the ethyl alcohol and volumetric flask method embrapa 1997 densities of viable culturable heterotrophic bacteria were used as an indicator of the ability of the soil microbial community to resist the increased temperature impact and recolonize the soil after heating culturable heterotrophic bacteria counting was performed by the small drop assay system mazzocco et al 2009 in subsamples of 1 g soil previously vortexed for 2 min in10 ml sodium pyrophosphate aqueous solution 0 1 and settled for 30 min plates were incubated at 30 c for 3 days and colonies counted to estimate total colony forming units per gram of soil cfu g soil 1 total cell density in soil samples submitted to heating were estimated by fluorescence microscopy in 0 15 g soil subsamples previously vortexed for 15 min in 1 5 ml 0 1 sodium pyrophosphate aqueous solution containing 1 v v tween 10 and settled for 90 min supernatant aliquots of 5 Œºl were submitted to dapi staining fuchs et al 2007 in immunofluorescence slides coated with 0 1 gelatine solution counting was performed in a olympus bx51 phase contrast and fluorescence microscope equipped with a dp72 ccd image capture system numbers of total dapi stained cells per gram of soil were calculated from 25 fields of view per sample using the protocol described in bloem et al 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of heating under oxic and anoxic conditions 3 1 1 changes in mineralogical composition the main changes of mineralogical composition of soils samples due to heating under oxidizing technosol and oxisol and reducing oxisol atmospheres for 1 h at different temperatures can be analyzed in fig 3 originally both soils were composed by quartz q kaolinite k gibbsite g goethite go and hematite h however only technosol presented muscovite mu which like quartz came from the parental rock formed by granite these mineralogical compositions reflect the chemical composition of these soils fig 4 as oxisol is richer in fe2o3 from goethite and hematite while technosol has higher content in sio2 by the presence of quartz and muscovite besides inorganic components these soils also presented a fraction of organic carbon of 0 41 for technosol and 1 67 for oxisol oliveira et al 2016 in general the mineralogical composition of the studied soils changed as the heating temperature increased in both atmospheres at about 250 300 c gibbsite al oh 3 diffraction peaks disappeared in both soils while the intensity of muscovite in technosol increased due to its resistance to higher temperatures above 940 c fanning et al 1989 the kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 decomposition occurred at 450 550 c usually gibbsite alters to amorphous phase at temperatures as low as 200 c whereas goethite is transformed to hematite at temperatures of approximately 300 c cornell and schwertmann 2003 ferreira et al 2012 as most of the diffraction peaks of goethite coincide with those of hematite and both minerals are present in the original composition of the soil it is difficult to determine when one recrystallized from the other however thermal analysis of these soils described below indicate that hematite may have formed from goethite at about 260 c in oxisols samples heated at around 300 c in both conditions oxidizing and reducing atmospheres maghemite mh fe2o3 was identified similar as observed by ketterings et al 2010 although maghemite has magnetic properties shokrollahi 2017 only the oxisol samples heated at anoxic conditions presented higher magnetism when in contact with a magnet mineralogical analysis by xrd did not indicate the formation of new minerals with fe ii in composition such as magnetite according to the analysis of tg curve and its derivative dtg technosol lost about 8 2 of total mass up to approximately 650 c fig 5 for oxisol the total mass loss occurred around 700 c and was approximately 13 1 at temperatures below 150 c the adsorbed water was removed gasparini et al 2013 corresponding to a mass loss of 0 7 for technosol and 2 to oxisol two thermal events occurred in both soils one between 150 c and 330 c causing a decrease in mass of approximately 2 to technosol and 3 6 to oxisol due to the dehydroxylation of gibbsite and goethite another mass loss of 5 5 to technosol and 7 5 to oxisol occurred between 330 c and 670 c caused by the dehydroxylation of kaolinite from atd curve two endothermic peaks were observed in both soils one at 250 c related to the transformation of gibbsite to amorphous phase cornell and schwertmann 2003 and also of goethite Œ± feooh to hematite Œ± fe2o3 gialanella et al 2010 the other endothermic peak at 500 c corresponded to the formation of metakaolinite from kaolinite sperinck et al 2011 an exothermic peak at 995 c was also observed due to the formation of spinel type aluminosilicate phase and primary mullite kakali et al 2001 gasparini et al 2013 the mass loss of both soil samples heated in the temperature range of 25 450 c determined by the thermal analysis is compared in the table 1 oxisol lost more mass for presenting more organic matter and hydroxylated minerals such as gibbsite kaolinite and goethite than technosol rich in muscovite and quartz 3 1 2 changes in soil physical properties in general the average diameter d50 and the sand fraction of the studied soils in both conditions oxic and anoxic increased with temperature while the clayey fraction decreased table 2 and fig 6 the change in the silty fraction of both soils was not significant 5 heating for a prolonged period 3 h did not cause significant change in comparison to 1 h the changes in soils texture were likely caused by the mineralogy modifications structures of minerals of clay fraction as gibbsite and kaolinite decomposed during heating and cemented the clay sized particles resulting in larger particle sizes fanning et al 1989 o brien et al 2018 goethite recrystallization as hematite likely also lead to the formation of larger size particles till and nowaczyk 2018 cornell and schwertmann 2003 also observed that gibbsite alters to amorphous phase at temperatures as low as 200 c whereas goethite is transformed to hematite at temperatures of approximately 300 c these modifications could cause the increase of soil texture therefore as oxisol has higher content of clayey particles than technosol its sandy fraction also increased more the increase in particle size was greater under reducing than oxidizing atmosphere particularly at lower temperatures 120 to 250 c this contrasts with previous studies which indicated that in general changes in grain size are pronounced only at higher temperatures o brien et al 2018 similar to observed in our study bad√≠a and mart√≠ 2003 observed changes in texture due to heating at 250 c and associated these changes to modifications in fe and al silicates which are abundant in both soils tested here also till et al 2017 observed that nanocrystalline goethite can rapidly transform to fine grained magnetite under reducing conditions at moderately elevated temperatures t 210 270 c they also revealed that an intermediate fine grained hematite and poorly crystalline hematite aggregates phase occurred before the transformation of goethite to magnetite under oxidative heating only nanocrystalline hematite was produced till et al 2015 therefore the recrystallization of hematite and maghemite from the dehydroxylation of goethite during reductive heating could contribute to the increase soil texture the uniformity coefficient cu d60 d10 of soil samples indicated that both soils are well graded under oxidizing conditions the uniformity coefficient did not show significant changes for the technosol however under reducing conditions the cu increased with temperature because of the increase in the larger size particles d60 for the oxisol both d10 and d60 increased significantly with temperature resulting in no clear tendency in the uniformity coefficient the sem images show the micromorphology of natural and heated soils at around 250 c fig 7 the lamellar features of muscovite and the needle shape of goethite are prominent in technosol samples whereas the rounded particle shape of hematite in oxisol after heating under reducing atmosphere in both soils there are some aggregates with rounded shapes probably of hematite these rounded aggregate particles are larger in oxisol in reducing than oxidizing conditions contributing to the increased soil texture as observed in the grain size analysis fig 6 the specific surface area ssa results also indicate that reductive heating changed the texture of soil the ssa of oxisol heated at 250 c at reducing atmosphere was 20 lower 39 492 m2 g 1 than the original sample 49 406 m2 g 1 consistent with the observed increase in particle size the adsorption isotherms of the natural and heated at reducing condition oxisol samples are similar fig 8 and they were classified according to thommes et al 2015 as type iv with hysteresis loop type h1 the type iv adsorption isotherm is characteristic of mesoporous adsorbent materials which solids can retain molecules on their surface through physical physical bonding and chemical forces such as activated carbon hysteresis loop type h1 in turn is typical of porous materials that present agglomerates or complexes of spheres in a regular arrangement sing 1982 thommes et al 2015 3 1 3 reduction of iron under oxidizing and reducing atmospheres the original concentration of fe ii decreased in the technosol samples in all heating temperatures in contrast in oxisol the fe ii content increased in the temperature range of 120 to 250 c and then decreased fig 9 in contrast to what was observed for the grain size distribution heating at oxidizing conditions for a prolonged period 3 h lead to lower fe ii concentrations than obtained when heating for only 1 h usually the mechanism of formation of fe ii and magnetite in heated soil samples is associated with the dehydroxylation of goethites and the reduction and recrystallization of hematites till et al 2015 till and nowaczyk 2018 till et al 2015 demonstrated that the heating of nanogoethites in moderate temperatures 210 c in a reducing atmosphere generated dark red to pure black magnetites concurrently to the disappearance of goethite peaks in xrd analyzes in addition to an increase in magnetism in general two steps are necessary for the formation of magnetites first the loss of the hydroxide oh from the goethite structure Œ± feooh forming hematite Œ±fe2o3 and second the interaction of hematite with the reducing agent example co reducing it to magnetite fe3o4 according to the eqs 1 and 2 till et al 2015 1 2 Œ± feooh s Œ± fe 2 o 3 s h 2 o g 2 3 Œ± fe 2 o 3 s co g 2fe 3 o 4 s co 2 g since oxisol is rich in iron oxides such as hematites and goethites the increase in fe ii content in samples heated at 120 and 250 c under reducing atmosphere may be associated with these reactions interestingly iron reduction started at low temperatures 120 c but not associated with mineralogy changes the mineral phases with fe ii as magnetite were not identified by xrd fig 3 possibly due to their low concentration or for not being well crystallized in these samples the main diffraction peaks of goethite disappeared as the temperature increased instead of magnetite maghemite Œ≥ fe2o3 was identified in the x ray diffractograms of oxisol samples heated above 300 c under both atmospheres maghemite is a ferromagnetic iron oxide isostructural with magnetite and deficient in fe ii cornell and schwertmann 2003 this mineral can occur as the product of magnetite oxidation or as the product of heating water containing iron oxides like goethite Œ± feooh lepidocrocite Œ≥ feooh ferrihydrite 5fe2o3 9h2o in the presence of organic matter which promote the reducing atmosphere clement et al 2011 till et al 2015 jordanova et al 2019 therefore maghemite was possibly formed as an intermediate mineral from heating of goethites ferguson and hass 1958 till et al 2015 jordanova et al 2019 and even from magnetites that were originally present or were formed from goethite the final member of the thermal transformation of maghemite is hematite which can occur at around 570 to 690 c nonaka et al 2017 therefore the decrease in fe ii content in oxisols samples heated above 300 c when maghemites formed are likely due to the transformation of magnetite to maghemite and then to hematite also when magnetites are heated between 200 and 300 c a hematite layer may be formed covering a magnetite core clement et al 2011 till et al 2015 these changes may justify the reduction of fe ii concentrations for oxisol heated at temperatures 300 c in oxidizing atmosphere even to values below the unheated control as occurred for example in heating at 450 c for 1 h as shown in fig 9 jordanova et al 2019 also observed the formation of strongly magnetic iron oxide usually maghemite upon heating to moderately high temperatures around 300 to 400 c in the presence of organic matter the increase in fe ii content in the oxisol samples heated to 120 and 250 c for 1 h under oxidizing conditions was most likely caused by the presence of organic matter 10 in the soil whose heating promoted a reducing atmosphere till and nowaczyk 2018 also observed that the presence of organic matter subjected to burning can promote a reducing atmosphere necessary for the transformation of goethite into hematite and later to magnetite however when the heating time was increased to 3 h there was a significant decrease in the formation of fe ii possibly the amount of organic matter to maintain the reducing conditions was not enough for 3 h also till et al 2015 observed a decrease in magnetite content with increasing heating time due to the recrystallization of hematite even in reducing conditions as observed under reducing conditions heating for 1 h no magnetite was identified in these samples and maghemite was formed only above 300 c fig 3 in technosol the lower contents of fe oxides 5 and organic matter 8 composition were likely not sufficient to promote fe ii formation the increase of time of heating to 3 h process in oxidizing conditions also did not improved the fe ii formation in these samples the decrease of original content of fe ii of technosol in both atmospheres can be also caused by the formation of hematite during heating processes 3 1 4 heating impact on soil microbiota under the adopted experimental conditions heating negatively impacted the microbiota in all temperatures tested microcosms heated at 60 c were the only to recover in subsequent incubation at mesophilic conditions a decrease of two orders of magnitude after heating was observed when compared to natural soil and growth in the next 30 days incubation led to an increase in ufc g 1 of one order of magnitude 4 0 103 to 1 3 104 dapi counting also showed an increase of 5 67 106 to 1 36 107 cells g 1 along 30 days incubation after a decrease of one order of magnitude just after heating these results revealed that the microbial community was able to recover total cell densities but exposure to the higher temperature have imposed a negative impact on culturable heterotrophic soil microbiota at 100 c although cells were detected at one order of magnitude lower density than natural soil at dapi counts no culturable cells were recovered in incubations up to 90 days these results contrast with data reported in literature b√°rcenas moreno and b√•√•th 2009 guerrero et al 2005 bad√≠a and mart√≠ 2003 that shows a gradual recovery of microbial populations after heating at this temperature but indicates that at the technosol this may be a threshold for cell inactivation indeed at 270 and 350 c soil was completely sterilized since no colonies in small drop assay incubations or cells in total counts were detected in this case recolonization from less impacted adjacent soil is an important process to consider for the restoration of biological functions in remediated soil changes in soil properties described in previous sessions may result in an environment inhospitable for microbial recolonization and growth water and organic matter losses are the main deleterious changes at temperatures above 150 c but may be reversible or restored after human intervention above 250 c changes in mineralogy and particle size are more permanent and will demand adaptation of the microbiota to the altered conditions microorganisms interact with minerals in soil either dissolving them to free components to be used in their metabolism or transforming them thus interfering in the chemical composition of soil some minerals as kaolinite which was depleted in temperatures above 250 c in both tested soils was reported to positively influence cell division rates on the other hand it may demand more aggressive strategies from bacteria to solubilize nutrients than other clay minerals cuadros 2017 the observed increase in particle size also impact recolonization an increase in connectivity of pores caused by changes in pore architecture may favor the transport of cells from less impacted adjacent soil but it can contrast to a decrease in surficial area available for cell attachment juyal et al 2020 considering that microbiota in this work was severely affected at temperatures above 100 c further research on factors influencing recolonization can contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of thermal remediation in the technosol 3 2 heating in undisturbed samples 3 2 1 heat distribution and dissipation in all tests the temperature increased and reached a plateau at 100 c due to the presence of water fig 10 on the first test the temperature remained at 100 c for approximately 4 h when the column dried the temperature increased and reached values above 100 c in all monitored points the maximum temperature was 418 2 c recorded in sensor s1 zb at the middle distance sensor rods 2 and 5 the temperature reached maximum values around 250 c and the farthest rods 3 and 6 of 200 c on tests 2a and 2b the temperature increased faster due to the greater potency in the heating element 1000 w versus 500 w in test 1 in these tests zone d was always at or below 100 c due to the constant water replenishment heating on test 2b was faster than in 2a despite being the same soil column and same heating conditions on test 2a it took 515 min to reach a temperature of 400 c while on test 2b it was reached 20 earlier 420 min this is likely a consequence of the soil being previously subjected to heating as soon the resistance was switched off the temperature started decreasing on test 1 the cooling time was approximately twice the heating time 34 h an initial fast decrease was observed but from 60 to 25 c the rate of change was significantly smaller in this stage all sensors were at similar temperatures resulting in small temperature gradients on tests 2a and 2b the temperature dropped faster due to the greater temperature gradients and less stored heat in these tests fig 11 on test 1 the two sections 1 2 3 and 4 5 6 had similar readings with the temperature difference between sensors in equivalent positions always below 25 in contrast the temperature distribution on tests 2a and 2b was significantly different in the two sections the temperature difference between the two sections reached 180 and 150 c on tests 2a and 2b respectively maximum percentage differences were 91 and 57 for these two tests these differences in heat distribution were likely caused by soil heterogeneities even though the sampled soil horizon was relatively homogeneous and the distance between sections is of the order of tens of centimeters the thermal conductivity Œª on test 1 was calculated for two temperature ranges below 70 c and from 0 to 100 c table 3 the lower temperature range represents the soil in the presence of water variable water saturation and the higher temperature range represents the dry soil in the presence of water the thermal conductivity was approximately 30 times higher as would be expected since water has a much higher thermal conductivity than air of 0 59 w m 1 k 1 versus 0 0026 w m 1 k 1 for air chen 2008 mitchell and soga 2005 on tests 2a and 2b the thermal conductivity could not be determined at this range due to the limited number of data points below 70 c the soil sample used on test 1 had a thermal conductivity approximately three times lower than the sample used on test 2 this indicates that the soil thermal properties can vary significantly in short distances within the same soil horizon these heterogeneities may lead to different temperatures during thermal remediation the values determined are slightly lower than reported by kersten 1949 for silty and clayey soils of around 3 w m 1 c 1 a higher Œª was obtained for test 2b in comparison to 2a consistent with the observation that temperatures increased faster in this test the difference was less than 10 but still produced notable effects on the rate of heating this change is likely associated to the decomposition of minerals with lower thermal conductivity such as goethite and gibbsite 2 9 and 2 6 w m 1 k 1 respectively and the formation of more conductive minerals mainly hematite 11 3 w m 1 k 1 thermal conductivity 3 2 2 changes in soil physical and chemical properties the heating caused significant changes in soil morphological properties table 4 in general the soil closer to the resistance associated with higher temperatures had grey color fig 12 granular structure and coarser texture and were less cohesive and sticky moving the towards the column sides a darker color was observed millimetric streak followed by lighter brown and yellow colors closer to the column walls where the temperature was lower the color was similar to the natural sample a decrease in the plasticity index was also noticed by attah and etim 2020 for two tropical soils heated at 250 c and associated to the dehydration changes in mineralogy and soil microstructure at lower temperatures water boiling inside soil aggregates can also promote its disaggregation contributing to changes in soil texture albalasmeh et al 2013 the dark gray color of soil heated at maximum temperature may be produced by the burning of the soil organic carbon changes in grain size distribution were only significant for the highest temperature of 450 c in which the sand fraction almost doubled this result is consistent to what was verified in the tests with disturbed samples with the same soil at oxidizing conditions this change is likely due to the cementation of the particles by si and al oxides from the decomposition of the hydroxylated minerals during the heating process as observed in the tests with disturbed samples even though the grain size distribution was only altered at higher temperatures the hydraulic conductivity increased proportionally with the temperature r2 0 993 increasing up to 2 5 for 450 c this indicates that changes in the physical structure of the soil happen even at the lower temperatures a slight decrease in particle density in all heated samples also indicate changes in the physical properties the sem images of these soil samples fig 13 highlight the changes in the texture due to the increase of the particle size the change in particle size can be related to the destruction of some minerals as gibbsite and kaolinite during the evolution of heating process causing the cementation of particles while the lamellar feature become more evident at higher temperature due to the heat resisting properties of muscovite klein and dutrow 2012 chemical properties were also affected such as ph and fraction of organic carbon foc during the heating process the technosol ph increased from 4 2 to 5 2 due to the volatilization charring or complete oxidations of soil organic matter which occur at temperatures between 250 and 460 c sierra et al 2016 ngole jeme 2019 as evidenced by the decrease in the fraction of organic carbon foc the decrease in foc was proportional to the temperature r2 0 803 reaching a maximum of 0 12 similar to what was observed by han et al 2020 corresponding to approximately a 30 decrease the increase of sand sized particles and the decrease in the fraction of organic carbon can result in changes in other soil properties such as the sorption capacity the chemical composition in the three heating zones 240 c 300 c and 450 c were similar but differed to the natural sample table 4 the differences between the main oxides content in the natural and heated soil samples are likely due to the natural variation of mineral constituents in the soil particularly considering that point samples were collected from the undisturbed soil column while the natural soil sample was a homogenized soil sample the points indicated in the sem images of technosol samples at zones heated at 240 300 and 450 c fig 14a to c were evaluated by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds in general all samples presented high contents of o si al and fe besides k in the soil heated at 240 c and ti when heated at 300 c these differences on the chemical compositions correspond to the variation of minerals present in the soil the white fine elongated round shapes point 1 in soil heated at 240 c and 300 c in fig 14 are probably of hematite as they were rich in iron the particles with placoid form correspond to muscovite points 2 and 3 in soils heated respectively at 250 c and 350 c in fig 14 while the aggregate particles points 4 and 5 in soils heated at 250 c and point 1 at 450 c in fig 14 refer to agglomerate of particles cemented by si and al amorphous materials 3 3 results integration and potential implications to nature based solutions the observed changes in physical chemical mineralogical and biological properties caused by heating are summarized in fig 15 at the lower temperature range 120 c which corresponds to the range in which most in situ thermal remediation will be performed changes in mineralogy and chemical properties were already perceived dehydration and dihydroxylation of gibbsite to amorphous phase and goethite transformation to hematite occurred up to approximately 300 c from 120 to 300 c an increase in fe ii was observed for the soil with initially higher fe ii content oxisol in both oxic and anoxic conditions at initially oxic conditions the heating of soil organic carbon likely changed the redox conditions favoring fe ii formation in addition in soils that are rich in fe ii minerals abiotic degradation rate might be enhanced in this temperature range truex et al 2007 also increasing the potential for abiotic degradation because of the changes in mineralogy particle size increased due to cementation of the clay sized particles into sand the temperature in which the changes are more significant and the extent of the change varies with soil type and atmosphere condition in reducing conditions the change in texture occurs at lower temperatures and in greater extension the change in texture also reflects on increased hydraulic conductivity almost doubled and decreased surface area 20 lower the increase in fe ii and contaminant mobility higher k and lower foc indicate an increase in the potential for abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated solvents for the oxisol heated in temperatures up to 250 c in soils with greater organic content anoxic dechlorination could be even more favored the organic carbon burning could result in reducing conditions for prolonged periods and increased ph values due to the combustion of organic matter which are associated with greater rates of dechlorination lee and batchelor 2002 2004 o brien et al 2018 in contrast even at the lower temperature range biotic microbiological communities were impacted at 60 c a decrease in total cell counts showed that the soil microbiota was directly affected by temperature but after 10 days incubation at 30 c bacterial populations gradually recovered impacts of heating at 100 c were more severe with no recovery of culturable heterotrophic bacteria after up to 90 days incubation indicating that the microbiota may have been inactivated in temperatures above 100 c however temperature at this range was not expected to cause such an impact on microbial populations in soil although temperatures above 70 c are reported as being lethal to microbial cells except for thermotolerant and spore forming microorganisms ding et al 2019 heat transfer processes occurring in the soil can lead to the formation of steep gradients especially in unsaturated soils and to a heterogeneous distribution of areas little or severely affected by the heat certini 2005 which may explain reports of survival at heating temperatures of up 400 c b√°rcenas moreno and b√•√•th 2009 at temperatures of up to 100 c there could occur an increase in bioavailable nitrogen species no3 and nh4 ren et al 2020 and impact on organic carbon content is not expected to be significant as observed in this work studies of the impact of low temperature thermal treatment up to 250 c on the soil microbiota showed not only that the heating did not inactivate the cells but also the removal of contaminants overcame the impact of temperature on microbial populations as their desorption from soil resulted in an increase in cell numbers yi et al 2016 and a recovery of taxonomic diversity ren et al 2020 low temperature thermal remediation 70 c has even been indicated as a potentially green remedial alternative due to enhanced biodegradation rates among other effects horst et al 2018 however the negative effect of temperature on the microbiota is not only related to the intensity of heating but also to the time of exposure certini 2005 and this probably explain the poor recovery of the microbial populations observed in this work in field applications where the heating duration might reach days or weeks the effects might be even more pronounced than observed here nevertheless at this temperature range even though microbial processes may undergo some impact it is expected the microbiota to recover from heating also the steady physical and chemical soil properties make recolonization likely to occur the tests in vitro showed that at 270 c the soil was sterilized and no microbial cells observed but as mentioned before heterogeneous distribution of the impact under field conditions may allow for survival and microbial activity can still occur as observed by pape et al 2015 after the thermal treatment recolonization with microorganisms from adjacent less impacted areas or transported by water and air may also contribute for restoration of biological functions however further studies are needed to assess the impact of physical and chemical changes on the habitability of the remediated soil as the heating temperature increases to more than 300 c the changes in mineralogy physical and chemical properties become even greater dehydroxylation of kaolinite to amorphous material metakaolinite and maghemite formation is observed associated with that there is a decrease in fe ii content to values lower than before heating in both soils tested changes in texture become significant even in oxic conditions and the hydraulic conductivity increases even more by a factor of 1 5 also the foc decreases around 30 resulting in increased contaminant mobility due to decreased sorption the increased mobility is also expected due to a decrease in cation exchange capacity cec as observed in other studies ngole jeme 2019 attah and etim 2020 at these temperatures as shown in the microcosms heated at 350 c the soil was sterilized carbon and nutrient availability also decrease due to the decarboxylation of macromolecules in the soil at temperatures over 300 c as well as the volatilization of nitrogen compounds glass et al 2008 yi et al 2016 as microbial cells tend to move towards available substrates even in unsaturated soils juyal et al 2020 the reduction in carbon and nutrient contents can make recolonization more difficult in addition even though an increase in pore connectivity can favor the movement of microbiota from adjacent areas into the treated soil microorganisms tend to grow at the solid pore interface so the observed reduction in specific surface results in a smaller available area for microbial settlement juyal et al 2020 therefore after heating in this temperature range 300 c both biotic and abiotic processes become less likely to occur however this temperature range is rarely applied for in situ thermal remediation being more common for ex situ applications during thermal remediation temperature gradients are formed as observed in this study therefore different parts of the aquifer are subjected to different temperatures at the same time also the cooling down phase results in slightly elevated temperatures around 25 to 60 c for prolonged periods this might have beneficial implications for nbs for example abiotic degradation in this cooldown phase will be favored by a higher fe ii concentration formed due to heating above 120 c and the slightly elevated temperatures which lead to increased abiotic dechlorination rates when soil temperature and humidity return to ambient conditions the chemical and mineralogical changes caused by heating should be affected by pedogenetic processes over time but not reversed for example in relation to mineralogy composition minerals fully decomposed during heating such as kaolinite al2 si2o5 oh 4 will not form again however gibbsite can precipitate from soil solution forming nodules or coating soil particles muggler et al 2007 in addition despite goethite Œ± feooh not forming again by hematite Œ± fe2o3 rehydration it can crystalize from nucleation of dissolved and partially hydrolyzed fe3 ions e g fe oh 2 in the soil solution sposito 1989 therefore over time all properties related to soil texture can also be affected by the active pedogenetic processes a long term monitoring would be needed to fully characterize the changes after the remediation even though the conditions tested do not exactly replicate field conditions in terms of heating duration which are typically longer in the field than simulated here and temperature rate of increase the results obtained indicate processes that might be observed the different conditions tested indicate that some changes will occur relatively fast for example for the technosol heating under oxic conditions for 1 h disturbed samples and for around 10 h with a lower rate of temperature increase undisturbed sample produced similar results for changes in grain size distribution on the other hand an increase in heating time produced significant differences in the fe ii content when heating in oxidizing conditions most likely initially the organic matter burning promoted reducing conditions but with increasing heating time the atmosphere become oxidizing this illustrates how site specific properties and heating application conditions might lead to different results 4 conclusions the use of thermal remediation in tropical environments was evaluated considering how the soil changes might impact the potential for application of posterior nature based solutions the increase of temperature applied in this remediation technique can change the mineralogical chemical physical and microbiological characteristics of soils which in turn can affect the effectiveness of posterior nbs three main factors were identified as controlling the type and extent of the properties changes the first factor to be considered is the soil type particularly the organic matter content and mineralogy specifically related to the presence of iron minerals if iron minerals are initially present as was the case with the oxisol tested increased temperatures can lead to a change in the oxidation state of iron resulting in increased fe ii concentrations also the organic matter burning can lead to reducing environment conditions which also promote the transformation to fe ii the combination of a reducing condition increased fe ii minerals and higher ph increase the potential for abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated compounds in the tested soil with lower iron content less organic matter and coarser texture technosol the changes were less pronounced and needed higher temperatures to be significant the second major controlling factor is the heating temperature generally increasing temperature impacted microbial populations from inhibition at 60 c to severe impact at 100 c and soil sterilization at temperatures over 270 c however duration of heating and desiccation are variables to be tested in future experiments to better understand how microbial populations can resist to heating at higher temperatures in soil matrices when observing soil properties behavior at different temperatures recolonization of the soil with native microbiota seems likely to occur after heating up to 250 c but above 300 c is not clear whether changes in soil properties would negatively impact recolonization as the fact that cell migration is favored by increasing hydraulic conductivity contrasts with a decrease in the surface area available for cell settlement due to the shift in granulometry the formation of minerals capable of promoting abiotic degradation was achieved at a specific temperature range from 120 to 250 c the increase in temperature also resulted in greater contaminant mobility due to lower sorption and higher hydraulic conductivity these changes could also facilitate the injection of remedial solutions such as bioremediation amendments the third factor identified was the atmosphere reducing versus oxidizing during the heating phase reducing conditions caused more significant changes in physical and chemical properties formation of fe ii minerals was greater in reducing conditions and changes in grain size occurred at lower temperatures under reducing conditions therefore for some sites there is a potential for designing thermal remediation systems in a way that intrinsic degradation processes are favored allowing the application of nbs for example in sites contaminated by chlorinated compounds where iron minerals are present it is possible to define an ideal heating condition that allows the formation of fe ii potentially enhancing abiotic degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1412,some remediation techniques such as thermal remediation can significantly change the soil properties these changes can be beneficial or detrimental to the sequential application of nature based solutions this work evaluated the effects of thermal remediation on the properties of two tropical soils technosol and oxisol and discuss how these changes might impact both biotic and abiotic degradation processes bench tests using disturbed samples were performed under oxic and anoxic conditions whereas 3d physical models were used to simulate the heat distribution along undisturbed samples the changes in soils texture density hydraulic conductivity iron concentration mineralogy and microbiota were evaluated the properties of oxisol were more affected than those of technosol due to the higher levels in fe iii organic carbon and finer texture when heated in the range of 120 to 300 c under oxic and anoxic conditions the fe ii content and the magnetism intensity increased in oxisol probably due to the formation of magnetite under oxic conditions the burning of oxisol organic matter promoted an anoxic atmosphere favoring the formation of fe ii however the continuous increase of the temperature 300 c lead to the decrease of fe ii due to the transformation of magnetite to maghemite and then to hematite the heating process also promoted some minerals decomposition and cementation of the clay fraction increasing the soil texture bacterial populations were impacted but showed ability to recover at 60 c however above 100 c no culturable cells were recovered and at temperatures above 270 c soil sterilization occurred the changes observed especially in oxisol samples indicated that mild heating between 120 and 240 c in turn can increase the potential for abiotic degradation of some contaminants such as chlorinated solvents therefore heating conditions up to 240 c during thermal remediation can be defined as to promote beneficial changes in soil properties increasing its potential for natural attenuation by abiotic processes even when the microbiota is affected and improving its sustainability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords tropical soils thermal remediation biodegradation abiotic degradation 1 introduction as the use of nature based solutions nbs gain popularity to address societal challenges by improving ecosystem services the discussion on their applicability benefits and potential applications to contaminated sites remediation is still incipient cohen shacham et al 2016 lafortezza et al 2018 song et al 2019 typical nbs alternatives include bioremediation and phytoremediation abiotic degradation by naturally occurring minerals such as dechlorination of chlorinated solvents by fe ii minerals could also be part of a nbs resulting in increased natural attenuation rates he et al 2015 schaefer et al 2017 however there are limitations for these solutions such as type and extension of the contamination and time constraints song et al 2019 one alternative to deal with such limitations is to integrate nbs with technological and engineering solutions cohen shacham et al 2016 one technique applied to remediate high concentration zones in short times is in situ thermal remediation which is based on heating the subsurface to remove the contaminant colombano et al 2020 leite et al 2020 the soil and groundwater temperature might be increased using different techniques such as water or hot air injection steam thermal conduction low frequency electric heating radio frequency and micro heating waves or by a combination of these methods friis et al 2005 friis 2006 colombano et al 2020 the increase in temperature enhances contaminants volatilization by increasing the vapor pressure and henry s constant friis et al 2005 friis 2006 chen et al 2012 also the mobility of organic compounds is enhanced due to solubility increase and decrease of sorption viscosity and surface tension muller et al 2009 chen et al 2012 ding et al 2019 however since in general thermal remediation does not promote the contaminants in situ degradation it requires other technologies for contaminant removal and treatment blanchard and stamnes 1997 contaminant removal is usually achieved using soil vapor extraction or multiphase extraction systems friis et al 2005 friis 2006 suthersan et al 2017 more than 98 mass of volatile and semi volatile contaminants can be removed by this technique in relatively short operation times ding et al 2019 o brien et al 2018 vidonish et al 2016 the most used temperature range is 80 to 100 c but sometimes it can reach temperatures up to 600 c depending on the target contaminant and technique applied for heating for example to achieve 100 c in the treatment zone by thermal conduction heating temperatures applied in the heating element might range from 400 to 500 c the heating can cause significant changes to chemical physical and microbiological characteristics of the soil and groundwater such as changes in texture mineralogy chemistry ph and organic matter content o brien et al 2018 for example as the temperature reaches a mineral decomposition temperature amorphous phases are formed which can cement the clay particles forming larger particles altering the soil granulometry the ph of soils heated at low temperatures 250 c tends to remain stable or slightly decrease but at higher temperatures soil ph increases due to the combustion of organic matter o brien et al 2018 till et al 2015 also observed that the heating of minerals with fe iii as goethite at reducing atmosphere can promote the formation of fe ii clement et al 2011 and jordanova et al 2019 also observed an increase in magnetism in soils subjected to burning in these cases the heating generated by the fire in the presence of organic matter altered the redox conditions of iron oxides and hydroxides leading to a magnetic enhancement therefore considering that fe ii minerals can promote the abiotic dechlorination of some compounds the presence of minerals with fe iii as goethite and hematite during the thermal remediation might increase the rates of abiotic in situ contaminant mass degradation in brazil most soils are rich in minerals with fe iii due to the tropical climate resulting in increased iron oxides and hydroxides in soils such as oxisols the content of iron in these soils is greater than 360 g kg 1 embrapa 2006 also soil heating at low temperatures can stimulate the growth of microorganisms and consequently increase biodegradation rates horst et al 2018 temperatures in the mesophilic range between 25 c and 40 c can result in higher contaminant bioavailability and consequently biodegradability das 2014 however the process of in situ contaminants biodegradation may not happen or is not significant when the mass transferring mechanisms predominates the high energy demand to sustain high temperatures the need to treat contaminants ex situ after removal and the changes in soil properties are challenges for thermal in situ remediation when sustainability criteria are considered vidonish et al 2016 one alternative to increase in situ thermal remediation environmental compatibility is to combine it and use it to promote naturally occurring degradation processes biotic and abiotic truex et al 2007 badin et al 2016 horst et al 2018 therefore thermal remediation can be conceived as a first step to a nature based solution combining an initial contaminant mass removal by heating to a second step nbs this could potentially decrease the heating time and or temperature and promote changes in soil that are advantageous for a nbs therefore in this work we aimed to evaluate how thermal remediation might be engineered in tropical environments so its effects on soil characteristics and properties help promote nbs considering biotic and abiotic processes for contaminants degradation to achieve that bench tests disturbed samples and tests on 3d physical models undisturbed samples were performed to evaluate how soil properties are impacted under different environmental and heating conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 soils experimental tests were performed simulating thermal remediation in two types of soils from a tropical environment oxisol and a technosol oxisol is a tropical soil highly weathered rich in iron and aluminum oxides oxisol samples were obtained in piracicaba s√£o paulo state brazil at 0 85 m depth from the bw horizon the oxisol has been described in previous studies ferreira et al 2017 oliveira et al 2016 the soil samples described and classified as technosol by gomes 2019 were collected in diadema s√£o paulo state brazil at 1 60 m depth in the c horizon this soil horizon was formed in situ from the weathering of the parental rock granite present just below it the upper soil horizons were significantly altered by anthropogenic activities leading to its classification as technosol gomes 2019 2 2 heating tests two types of tests were performed to evaluate the effect of the heating process on the main characteristics and properties of the soils the first test studied the influence of oxidizing and reducing atmospheres in the heating process of the two studied soils disturbed samples at different temperatures ambient to 450 c the second test evaluated the heat distribution and dissipation and changes in soil properties in undisturbed technosol columns 3d physical model 2 2 1 disturbed soil samples heating in oxic and anoxic conditions thermal remediation might be applied in oxidizing or reducing atmosphere conditions even at oxidizing conditions the presence of organic matter in the soil composition can induce to anoxic conditions producing co2 by burning till and nowaczyk 2018 therefore these tests simulated soil heating under oxidizing and reducing conditions to evaluate the effect of the atmosphere on the soils physical chemical and mineralogical characteristics and properties both soils were used on these tests in the tests performed at oxidizing atmosphere 10 g of disturbed soil samples were put in a porcelain crucible and heated inside a muffle furnace gp cient√≠fica at temperatures ranging from 120 to 550 c for one and 3 h in the tests performed at reducing atmosphere a continuous nitrogen flow was supplied in a tubular muffle furnace edg equipamentos the samples 10 g were heated for 1 h at the same temperature range used in the oxidizing condition tests disturbed technosol samples were also used in microcosms containing 5 g soil to assess the influence of heating on the microbiota survival and ability to recolonize the soil microcosms were set in sterile 50 ml borosilicate serum flasks and heated at 60 100 270 and 350 c exposure time of soil to each temperature was based on the 3d physical model heating curve section 222 test 1 and was of 3 days for 60 and 100 c and 1 h for 270 and 350 c after heating the microcosms were incubated at 24 c for 10 30 60 and 90 days in order to detect the soil recolonization by the microbiota microcosms were set in quintuplicate for each temperature and incubation period the soil was moistened with 1 ml sterile distilled water before and after heating 2 2 2 three dimensional physical model undisturbed soil sample two 200 mm diameter 350 mm length undisturbed technosol soil columns were used as three dimensional models to simulate the heating process by thermal conduction to obtain the soil columns a trench was dug to the desired depth and a 2 mm thick stainless steel cylinder was used to collect the samples by percussion the soil columns were brought to the laboratory and the bottom and top parts were attached as shown in fig 1 the columns were slowly saturated over five days from bottom to top with deaired distilled water an electrical resistor was installed in the center of the model for soil heating the temperature distribution within the soil was monitored by thermocouple sensors positioned on 30 cm long rods installed inside the soil column these sensors were installed in 2 sections in the radial direction and each of these sections was composed by 3 rods installed vertically with 4 sensors in each one fig 2 an opening in the column cover was left open to prevent pressurization inside the column due to water vaporization this system was connected to a computer with a programmable logic controller plc associated to a supervisory software where the temperature data measured in each sensor were simultaneously read and registered at pre determined time intervals two different conditions were evaluated in the first condition test 1 the soil was initially saturated but water was not replaced during the heating process in this test the power applied was initially 250 w which was doubled after 2 h when the soil temperature stabilized at 100 c the heating process was ended when the temperature reached 450 c maximum admissible temperature in the resistance in test 2 the water level was kept constant at an elevation of 6 5 cm from the bottom of the column slightly below the interface between zones c and d fig 2 the resistance power was kept constant at 1000 w this test was performed twice test 2a and 2b using the same soil column to evaluate the impact of reheating on the soil thermal properties temperature data was collected every minute on test 1 and every 5 min on tests 2a and 2b the temperature data measured in the sensor located at position 1 zone b s1 zb were used to estimate the soil effective thermal conductivity of the bulk soil particles and fluids based on the temperature variation with time healy et al 1976 seiferlin et al 1996 colombano et al 2020 this sensor was selected for being located closer to the heating source and farther from the column extremities after cooling the soil column from test 1 was removed from the stainless steel cylinder and samples were carefully collected for characterization of physical chemical and mineralogical properties the soil samples were collected in three points from the center of the column p1 at the position where the soil was submitted to the highest temperature range up to 450 c p2 at the intermediate temperature maximum of 300 c and p3 at the lowest temperature range maximum of 240 c disturbed samples were analyzed for particle size distribution particle density organic carbon content chemical composition and micromorphology undisturbed samples were also collected for hydraulic conductivity determination 2 3 soil samples characterization to determine the changes in soil physical chemical mineralogical and microbiological properties due to heating the soils samples were characterized before and after the heating tests using the techniques described in sequence the soils mineralogical composition was determined in a x ray diffractometer d8 advance bruker the cu kŒ± radiation 40 kv 40 ma angular range 2Œ∏ from 2 to 65 with a pitch of 0 02 and counting time of 0 5 s step were used in this analysis for the interpretation of the x ray diffractograms the x pert high score plus software panalytical was used and the identification of the structures was performed by comparison with the international center for diffraction data icdd soils chemical composition was analyzed by x ray fluorescence spectrometry axios advanced panalytical fe ii quantification was performed by the 1 10 phenanthroline method jeffery et al 1989 in this method 25 ml of the extracted sample prepared with hcl and hno3 was transferred to a 50 ml volumetric flask then 2 ml of sodium acetate buffer solution and 2 ml of 1 10 phenanthroline solution were added after 10 min the samples were analyzed on uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s thermo scientific at 510 nm wavelength the fraction of organic carbon was determined by oxidation with potassium dichromate in the presence of sulphuric acid following the method proposed by camargo et al 2009 based on the walkley black method soil ph was determined based on the methodology presented in camargo et al 2009 in this analysis 25 ml of distilled water were added to 10 g of soil then the samples were shaken and left to rest for 1 h before the ph was measured in a ph meter hi 221 hanna instruments the soils specific surface area was determined using the adsorption and desorption nitrogen n2 isotherms by the bet brunauer emmet and teller method the soils samples were prepared and analyzed respectively in the vacprep 061 micromeritics and a gemini iii 2375 micromeritics the soil samples were subjected to vacuum 100 Œºm of hg and heated for 15 h 200 c the images showing the micromorphology of the studied soils were obtained by scanning electron microscopy jsm 6610lv jeol the samples were coated with carbon denton vacuum desk v before analysis the thermal effects on the soil samples were analyzed by studying the thermogravimetry tg its derivative dtg and the thermogravimetry tga curves thermal analyses were performed by means of a dtg 60h shimadzu operating from room temperature to 1000 c at 10 c min 1 in a flow of nitrogen grain size distribution was analyzed by laser diffraction on a cilas 1190 particle size analyzer with a detection range from 0 04 to 2500 Œºm and liquid dispersion the samples were processed based on the method developed by miller and schaetzl 2012 where 0 5 g of the soil were added to a falcon tube with 5 ml of sodium hexametaphosphate 1 g l 1 and 15 ml of distilled water and agitated for 48 h before being analyzed to quantify the changes in hydraulic conductivity k 20 mm long undisturbed samples were collected in a 6 mm id stainless steel pipe from the technosol column the samples were analyzed in a falling head permeameter particle density determination was performed by the ethyl alcohol and volumetric flask method embrapa 1997 densities of viable culturable heterotrophic bacteria were used as an indicator of the ability of the soil microbial community to resist the increased temperature impact and recolonize the soil after heating culturable heterotrophic bacteria counting was performed by the small drop assay system mazzocco et al 2009 in subsamples of 1 g soil previously vortexed for 2 min in10 ml sodium pyrophosphate aqueous solution 0 1 and settled for 30 min plates were incubated at 30 c for 3 days and colonies counted to estimate total colony forming units per gram of soil cfu g soil 1 total cell density in soil samples submitted to heating were estimated by fluorescence microscopy in 0 15 g soil subsamples previously vortexed for 15 min in 1 5 ml 0 1 sodium pyrophosphate aqueous solution containing 1 v v tween 10 and settled for 90 min supernatant aliquots of 5 Œºl were submitted to dapi staining fuchs et al 2007 in immunofluorescence slides coated with 0 1 gelatine solution counting was performed in a olympus bx51 phase contrast and fluorescence microscope equipped with a dp72 ccd image capture system numbers of total dapi stained cells per gram of soil were calculated from 25 fields of view per sample using the protocol described in bloem et al 1995 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison of heating under oxic and anoxic conditions 3 1 1 changes in mineralogical composition the main changes of mineralogical composition of soils samples due to heating under oxidizing technosol and oxisol and reducing oxisol atmospheres for 1 h at different temperatures can be analyzed in fig 3 originally both soils were composed by quartz q kaolinite k gibbsite g goethite go and hematite h however only technosol presented muscovite mu which like quartz came from the parental rock formed by granite these mineralogical compositions reflect the chemical composition of these soils fig 4 as oxisol is richer in fe2o3 from goethite and hematite while technosol has higher content in sio2 by the presence of quartz and muscovite besides inorganic components these soils also presented a fraction of organic carbon of 0 41 for technosol and 1 67 for oxisol oliveira et al 2016 in general the mineralogical composition of the studied soils changed as the heating temperature increased in both atmospheres at about 250 300 c gibbsite al oh 3 diffraction peaks disappeared in both soils while the intensity of muscovite in technosol increased due to its resistance to higher temperatures above 940 c fanning et al 1989 the kaolinite al2si2o5 oh 4 decomposition occurred at 450 550 c usually gibbsite alters to amorphous phase at temperatures as low as 200 c whereas goethite is transformed to hematite at temperatures of approximately 300 c cornell and schwertmann 2003 ferreira et al 2012 as most of the diffraction peaks of goethite coincide with those of hematite and both minerals are present in the original composition of the soil it is difficult to determine when one recrystallized from the other however thermal analysis of these soils described below indicate that hematite may have formed from goethite at about 260 c in oxisols samples heated at around 300 c in both conditions oxidizing and reducing atmospheres maghemite mh fe2o3 was identified similar as observed by ketterings et al 2010 although maghemite has magnetic properties shokrollahi 2017 only the oxisol samples heated at anoxic conditions presented higher magnetism when in contact with a magnet mineralogical analysis by xrd did not indicate the formation of new minerals with fe ii in composition such as magnetite according to the analysis of tg curve and its derivative dtg technosol lost about 8 2 of total mass up to approximately 650 c fig 5 for oxisol the total mass loss occurred around 700 c and was approximately 13 1 at temperatures below 150 c the adsorbed water was removed gasparini et al 2013 corresponding to a mass loss of 0 7 for technosol and 2 to oxisol two thermal events occurred in both soils one between 150 c and 330 c causing a decrease in mass of approximately 2 to technosol and 3 6 to oxisol due to the dehydroxylation of gibbsite and goethite another mass loss of 5 5 to technosol and 7 5 to oxisol occurred between 330 c and 670 c caused by the dehydroxylation of kaolinite from atd curve two endothermic peaks were observed in both soils one at 250 c related to the transformation of gibbsite to amorphous phase cornell and schwertmann 2003 and also of goethite Œ± feooh to hematite Œ± fe2o3 gialanella et al 2010 the other endothermic peak at 500 c corresponded to the formation of metakaolinite from kaolinite sperinck et al 2011 an exothermic peak at 995 c was also observed due to the formation of spinel type aluminosilicate phase and primary mullite kakali et al 2001 gasparini et al 2013 the mass loss of both soil samples heated in the temperature range of 25 450 c determined by the thermal analysis is compared in the table 1 oxisol lost more mass for presenting more organic matter and hydroxylated minerals such as gibbsite kaolinite and goethite than technosol rich in muscovite and quartz 3 1 2 changes in soil physical properties in general the average diameter d50 and the sand fraction of the studied soils in both conditions oxic and anoxic increased with temperature while the clayey fraction decreased table 2 and fig 6 the change in the silty fraction of both soils was not significant 5 heating for a prolonged period 3 h did not cause significant change in comparison to 1 h the changes in soils texture were likely caused by the mineralogy modifications structures of minerals of clay fraction as gibbsite and kaolinite decomposed during heating and cemented the clay sized particles resulting in larger particle sizes fanning et al 1989 o brien et al 2018 goethite recrystallization as hematite likely also lead to the formation of larger size particles till and nowaczyk 2018 cornell and schwertmann 2003 also observed that gibbsite alters to amorphous phase at temperatures as low as 200 c whereas goethite is transformed to hematite at temperatures of approximately 300 c these modifications could cause the increase of soil texture therefore as oxisol has higher content of clayey particles than technosol its sandy fraction also increased more the increase in particle size was greater under reducing than oxidizing atmosphere particularly at lower temperatures 120 to 250 c this contrasts with previous studies which indicated that in general changes in grain size are pronounced only at higher temperatures o brien et al 2018 similar to observed in our study bad√≠a and mart√≠ 2003 observed changes in texture due to heating at 250 c and associated these changes to modifications in fe and al silicates which are abundant in both soils tested here also till et al 2017 observed that nanocrystalline goethite can rapidly transform to fine grained magnetite under reducing conditions at moderately elevated temperatures t 210 270 c they also revealed that an intermediate fine grained hematite and poorly crystalline hematite aggregates phase occurred before the transformation of goethite to magnetite under oxidative heating only nanocrystalline hematite was produced till et al 2015 therefore the recrystallization of hematite and maghemite from the dehydroxylation of goethite during reductive heating could contribute to the increase soil texture the uniformity coefficient cu d60 d10 of soil samples indicated that both soils are well graded under oxidizing conditions the uniformity coefficient did not show significant changes for the technosol however under reducing conditions the cu increased with temperature because of the increase in the larger size particles d60 for the oxisol both d10 and d60 increased significantly with temperature resulting in no clear tendency in the uniformity coefficient the sem images show the micromorphology of natural and heated soils at around 250 c fig 7 the lamellar features of muscovite and the needle shape of goethite are prominent in technosol samples whereas the rounded particle shape of hematite in oxisol after heating under reducing atmosphere in both soils there are some aggregates with rounded shapes probably of hematite these rounded aggregate particles are larger in oxisol in reducing than oxidizing conditions contributing to the increased soil texture as observed in the grain size analysis fig 6 the specific surface area ssa results also indicate that reductive heating changed the texture of soil the ssa of oxisol heated at 250 c at reducing atmosphere was 20 lower 39 492 m2 g 1 than the original sample 49 406 m2 g 1 consistent with the observed increase in particle size the adsorption isotherms of the natural and heated at reducing condition oxisol samples are similar fig 8 and they were classified according to thommes et al 2015 as type iv with hysteresis loop type h1 the type iv adsorption isotherm is characteristic of mesoporous adsorbent materials which solids can retain molecules on their surface through physical physical bonding and chemical forces such as activated carbon hysteresis loop type h1 in turn is typical of porous materials that present agglomerates or complexes of spheres in a regular arrangement sing 1982 thommes et al 2015 3 1 3 reduction of iron under oxidizing and reducing atmospheres the original concentration of fe ii decreased in the technosol samples in all heating temperatures in contrast in oxisol the fe ii content increased in the temperature range of 120 to 250 c and then decreased fig 9 in contrast to what was observed for the grain size distribution heating at oxidizing conditions for a prolonged period 3 h lead to lower fe ii concentrations than obtained when heating for only 1 h usually the mechanism of formation of fe ii and magnetite in heated soil samples is associated with the dehydroxylation of goethites and the reduction and recrystallization of hematites till et al 2015 till and nowaczyk 2018 till et al 2015 demonstrated that the heating of nanogoethites in moderate temperatures 210 c in a reducing atmosphere generated dark red to pure black magnetites concurrently to the disappearance of goethite peaks in xrd analyzes in addition to an increase in magnetism in general two steps are necessary for the formation of magnetites first the loss of the hydroxide oh from the goethite structure Œ± feooh forming hematite Œ±fe2o3 and second the interaction of hematite with the reducing agent example co reducing it to magnetite fe3o4 according to the eqs 1 and 2 till et al 2015 1 2 Œ± feooh s Œ± fe 2 o 3 s h 2 o g 2 3 Œ± fe 2 o 3 s co g 2fe 3 o 4 s co 2 g since oxisol is rich in iron oxides such as hematites and goethites the increase in fe ii content in samples heated at 120 and 250 c under reducing atmosphere may be associated with these reactions interestingly iron reduction started at low temperatures 120 c but not associated with mineralogy changes the mineral phases with fe ii as magnetite were not identified by xrd fig 3 possibly due to their low concentration or for not being well crystallized in these samples the main diffraction peaks of goethite disappeared as the temperature increased instead of magnetite maghemite Œ≥ fe2o3 was identified in the x ray diffractograms of oxisol samples heated above 300 c under both atmospheres maghemite is a ferromagnetic iron oxide isostructural with magnetite and deficient in fe ii cornell and schwertmann 2003 this mineral can occur as the product of magnetite oxidation or as the product of heating water containing iron oxides like goethite Œ± feooh lepidocrocite Œ≥ feooh ferrihydrite 5fe2o3 9h2o in the presence of organic matter which promote the reducing atmosphere clement et al 2011 till et al 2015 jordanova et al 2019 therefore maghemite was possibly formed as an intermediate mineral from heating of goethites ferguson and hass 1958 till et al 2015 jordanova et al 2019 and even from magnetites that were originally present or were formed from goethite the final member of the thermal transformation of maghemite is hematite which can occur at around 570 to 690 c nonaka et al 2017 therefore the decrease in fe ii content in oxisols samples heated above 300 c when maghemites formed are likely due to the transformation of magnetite to maghemite and then to hematite also when magnetites are heated between 200 and 300 c a hematite layer may be formed covering a magnetite core clement et al 2011 till et al 2015 these changes may justify the reduction of fe ii concentrations for oxisol heated at temperatures 300 c in oxidizing atmosphere even to values below the unheated control as occurred for example in heating at 450 c for 1 h as shown in fig 9 jordanova et al 2019 also observed the formation of strongly magnetic iron oxide usually maghemite upon heating to moderately high temperatures around 300 to 400 c in the presence of organic matter the increase in fe ii content in the oxisol samples heated to 120 and 250 c for 1 h under oxidizing conditions was most likely caused by the presence of organic matter 10 in the soil whose heating promoted a reducing atmosphere till and nowaczyk 2018 also observed that the presence of organic matter subjected to burning can promote a reducing atmosphere necessary for the transformation of goethite into hematite and later to magnetite however when the heating time was increased to 3 h there was a significant decrease in the formation of fe ii possibly the amount of organic matter to maintain the reducing conditions was not enough for 3 h also till et al 2015 observed a decrease in magnetite content with increasing heating time due to the recrystallization of hematite even in reducing conditions as observed under reducing conditions heating for 1 h no magnetite was identified in these samples and maghemite was formed only above 300 c fig 3 in technosol the lower contents of fe oxides 5 and organic matter 8 composition were likely not sufficient to promote fe ii formation the increase of time of heating to 3 h process in oxidizing conditions also did not improved the fe ii formation in these samples the decrease of original content of fe ii of technosol in both atmospheres can be also caused by the formation of hematite during heating processes 3 1 4 heating impact on soil microbiota under the adopted experimental conditions heating negatively impacted the microbiota in all temperatures tested microcosms heated at 60 c were the only to recover in subsequent incubation at mesophilic conditions a decrease of two orders of magnitude after heating was observed when compared to natural soil and growth in the next 30 days incubation led to an increase in ufc g 1 of one order of magnitude 4 0 103 to 1 3 104 dapi counting also showed an increase of 5 67 106 to 1 36 107 cells g 1 along 30 days incubation after a decrease of one order of magnitude just after heating these results revealed that the microbial community was able to recover total cell densities but exposure to the higher temperature have imposed a negative impact on culturable heterotrophic soil microbiota at 100 c although cells were detected at one order of magnitude lower density than natural soil at dapi counts no culturable cells were recovered in incubations up to 90 days these results contrast with data reported in literature b√°rcenas moreno and b√•√•th 2009 guerrero et al 2005 bad√≠a and mart√≠ 2003 that shows a gradual recovery of microbial populations after heating at this temperature but indicates that at the technosol this may be a threshold for cell inactivation indeed at 270 and 350 c soil was completely sterilized since no colonies in small drop assay incubations or cells in total counts were detected in this case recolonization from less impacted adjacent soil is an important process to consider for the restoration of biological functions in remediated soil changes in soil properties described in previous sessions may result in an environment inhospitable for microbial recolonization and growth water and organic matter losses are the main deleterious changes at temperatures above 150 c but may be reversible or restored after human intervention above 250 c changes in mineralogy and particle size are more permanent and will demand adaptation of the microbiota to the altered conditions microorganisms interact with minerals in soil either dissolving them to free components to be used in their metabolism or transforming them thus interfering in the chemical composition of soil some minerals as kaolinite which was depleted in temperatures above 250 c in both tested soils was reported to positively influence cell division rates on the other hand it may demand more aggressive strategies from bacteria to solubilize nutrients than other clay minerals cuadros 2017 the observed increase in particle size also impact recolonization an increase in connectivity of pores caused by changes in pore architecture may favor the transport of cells from less impacted adjacent soil but it can contrast to a decrease in surficial area available for cell attachment juyal et al 2020 considering that microbiota in this work was severely affected at temperatures above 100 c further research on factors influencing recolonization can contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of thermal remediation in the technosol 3 2 heating in undisturbed samples 3 2 1 heat distribution and dissipation in all tests the temperature increased and reached a plateau at 100 c due to the presence of water fig 10 on the first test the temperature remained at 100 c for approximately 4 h when the column dried the temperature increased and reached values above 100 c in all monitored points the maximum temperature was 418 2 c recorded in sensor s1 zb at the middle distance sensor rods 2 and 5 the temperature reached maximum values around 250 c and the farthest rods 3 and 6 of 200 c on tests 2a and 2b the temperature increased faster due to the greater potency in the heating element 1000 w versus 500 w in test 1 in these tests zone d was always at or below 100 c due to the constant water replenishment heating on test 2b was faster than in 2a despite being the same soil column and same heating conditions on test 2a it took 515 min to reach a temperature of 400 c while on test 2b it was reached 20 earlier 420 min this is likely a consequence of the soil being previously subjected to heating as soon the resistance was switched off the temperature started decreasing on test 1 the cooling time was approximately twice the heating time 34 h an initial fast decrease was observed but from 60 to 25 c the rate of change was significantly smaller in this stage all sensors were at similar temperatures resulting in small temperature gradients on tests 2a and 2b the temperature dropped faster due to the greater temperature gradients and less stored heat in these tests fig 11 on test 1 the two sections 1 2 3 and 4 5 6 had similar readings with the temperature difference between sensors in equivalent positions always below 25 in contrast the temperature distribution on tests 2a and 2b was significantly different in the two sections the temperature difference between the two sections reached 180 and 150 c on tests 2a and 2b respectively maximum percentage differences were 91 and 57 for these two tests these differences in heat distribution were likely caused by soil heterogeneities even though the sampled soil horizon was relatively homogeneous and the distance between sections is of the order of tens of centimeters the thermal conductivity Œª on test 1 was calculated for two temperature ranges below 70 c and from 0 to 100 c table 3 the lower temperature range represents the soil in the presence of water variable water saturation and the higher temperature range represents the dry soil in the presence of water the thermal conductivity was approximately 30 times higher as would be expected since water has a much higher thermal conductivity than air of 0 59 w m 1 k 1 versus 0 0026 w m 1 k 1 for air chen 2008 mitchell and soga 2005 on tests 2a and 2b the thermal conductivity could not be determined at this range due to the limited number of data points below 70 c the soil sample used on test 1 had a thermal conductivity approximately three times lower than the sample used on test 2 this indicates that the soil thermal properties can vary significantly in short distances within the same soil horizon these heterogeneities may lead to different temperatures during thermal remediation the values determined are slightly lower than reported by kersten 1949 for silty and clayey soils of around 3 w m 1 c 1 a higher Œª was obtained for test 2b in comparison to 2a consistent with the observation that temperatures increased faster in this test the difference was less than 10 but still produced notable effects on the rate of heating this change is likely associated to the decomposition of minerals with lower thermal conductivity such as goethite and gibbsite 2 9 and 2 6 w m 1 k 1 respectively and the formation of more conductive minerals mainly hematite 11 3 w m 1 k 1 thermal conductivity 3 2 2 changes in soil physical and chemical properties the heating caused significant changes in soil morphological properties table 4 in general the soil closer to the resistance associated with higher temperatures had grey color fig 12 granular structure and coarser texture and were less cohesive and sticky moving the towards the column sides a darker color was observed millimetric streak followed by lighter brown and yellow colors closer to the column walls where the temperature was lower the color was similar to the natural sample a decrease in the plasticity index was also noticed by attah and etim 2020 for two tropical soils heated at 250 c and associated to the dehydration changes in mineralogy and soil microstructure at lower temperatures water boiling inside soil aggregates can also promote its disaggregation contributing to changes in soil texture albalasmeh et al 2013 the dark gray color of soil heated at maximum temperature may be produced by the burning of the soil organic carbon changes in grain size distribution were only significant for the highest temperature of 450 c in which the sand fraction almost doubled this result is consistent to what was verified in the tests with disturbed samples with the same soil at oxidizing conditions this change is likely due to the cementation of the particles by si and al oxides from the decomposition of the hydroxylated minerals during the heating process as observed in the tests with disturbed samples even though the grain size distribution was only altered at higher temperatures the hydraulic conductivity increased proportionally with the temperature r2 0 993 increasing up to 2 5 for 450 c this indicates that changes in the physical structure of the soil happen even at the lower temperatures a slight decrease in particle density in all heated samples also indicate changes in the physical properties the sem images of these soil samples fig 13 highlight the changes in the texture due to the increase of the particle size the change in particle size can be related to the destruction of some minerals as gibbsite and kaolinite during the evolution of heating process causing the cementation of particles while the lamellar feature become more evident at higher temperature due to the heat resisting properties of muscovite klein and dutrow 2012 chemical properties were also affected such as ph and fraction of organic carbon foc during the heating process the technosol ph increased from 4 2 to 5 2 due to the volatilization charring or complete oxidations of soil organic matter which occur at temperatures between 250 and 460 c sierra et al 2016 ngole jeme 2019 as evidenced by the decrease in the fraction of organic carbon foc the decrease in foc was proportional to the temperature r2 0 803 reaching a maximum of 0 12 similar to what was observed by han et al 2020 corresponding to approximately a 30 decrease the increase of sand sized particles and the decrease in the fraction of organic carbon can result in changes in other soil properties such as the sorption capacity the chemical composition in the three heating zones 240 c 300 c and 450 c were similar but differed to the natural sample table 4 the differences between the main oxides content in the natural and heated soil samples are likely due to the natural variation of mineral constituents in the soil particularly considering that point samples were collected from the undisturbed soil column while the natural soil sample was a homogenized soil sample the points indicated in the sem images of technosol samples at zones heated at 240 300 and 450 c fig 14a to c were evaluated by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds in general all samples presented high contents of o si al and fe besides k in the soil heated at 240 c and ti when heated at 300 c these differences on the chemical compositions correspond to the variation of minerals present in the soil the white fine elongated round shapes point 1 in soil heated at 240 c and 300 c in fig 14 are probably of hematite as they were rich in iron the particles with placoid form correspond to muscovite points 2 and 3 in soils heated respectively at 250 c and 350 c in fig 14 while the aggregate particles points 4 and 5 in soils heated at 250 c and point 1 at 450 c in fig 14 refer to agglomerate of particles cemented by si and al amorphous materials 3 3 results integration and potential implications to nature based solutions the observed changes in physical chemical mineralogical and biological properties caused by heating are summarized in fig 15 at the lower temperature range 120 c which corresponds to the range in which most in situ thermal remediation will be performed changes in mineralogy and chemical properties were already perceived dehydration and dihydroxylation of gibbsite to amorphous phase and goethite transformation to hematite occurred up to approximately 300 c from 120 to 300 c an increase in fe ii was observed for the soil with initially higher fe ii content oxisol in both oxic and anoxic conditions at initially oxic conditions the heating of soil organic carbon likely changed the redox conditions favoring fe ii formation in addition in soils that are rich in fe ii minerals abiotic degradation rate might be enhanced in this temperature range truex et al 2007 also increasing the potential for abiotic degradation because of the changes in mineralogy particle size increased due to cementation of the clay sized particles into sand the temperature in which the changes are more significant and the extent of the change varies with soil type and atmosphere condition in reducing conditions the change in texture occurs at lower temperatures and in greater extension the change in texture also reflects on increased hydraulic conductivity almost doubled and decreased surface area 20 lower the increase in fe ii and contaminant mobility higher k and lower foc indicate an increase in the potential for abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated solvents for the oxisol heated in temperatures up to 250 c in soils with greater organic content anoxic dechlorination could be even more favored the organic carbon burning could result in reducing conditions for prolonged periods and increased ph values due to the combustion of organic matter which are associated with greater rates of dechlorination lee and batchelor 2002 2004 o brien et al 2018 in contrast even at the lower temperature range biotic microbiological communities were impacted at 60 c a decrease in total cell counts showed that the soil microbiota was directly affected by temperature but after 10 days incubation at 30 c bacterial populations gradually recovered impacts of heating at 100 c were more severe with no recovery of culturable heterotrophic bacteria after up to 90 days incubation indicating that the microbiota may have been inactivated in temperatures above 100 c however temperature at this range was not expected to cause such an impact on microbial populations in soil although temperatures above 70 c are reported as being lethal to microbial cells except for thermotolerant and spore forming microorganisms ding et al 2019 heat transfer processes occurring in the soil can lead to the formation of steep gradients especially in unsaturated soils and to a heterogeneous distribution of areas little or severely affected by the heat certini 2005 which may explain reports of survival at heating temperatures of up 400 c b√°rcenas moreno and b√•√•th 2009 at temperatures of up to 100 c there could occur an increase in bioavailable nitrogen species no3 and nh4 ren et al 2020 and impact on organic carbon content is not expected to be significant as observed in this work studies of the impact of low temperature thermal treatment up to 250 c on the soil microbiota showed not only that the heating did not inactivate the cells but also the removal of contaminants overcame the impact of temperature on microbial populations as their desorption from soil resulted in an increase in cell numbers yi et al 2016 and a recovery of taxonomic diversity ren et al 2020 low temperature thermal remediation 70 c has even been indicated as a potentially green remedial alternative due to enhanced biodegradation rates among other effects horst et al 2018 however the negative effect of temperature on the microbiota is not only related to the intensity of heating but also to the time of exposure certini 2005 and this probably explain the poor recovery of the microbial populations observed in this work in field applications where the heating duration might reach days or weeks the effects might be even more pronounced than observed here nevertheless at this temperature range even though microbial processes may undergo some impact it is expected the microbiota to recover from heating also the steady physical and chemical soil properties make recolonization likely to occur the tests in vitro showed that at 270 c the soil was sterilized and no microbial cells observed but as mentioned before heterogeneous distribution of the impact under field conditions may allow for survival and microbial activity can still occur as observed by pape et al 2015 after the thermal treatment recolonization with microorganisms from adjacent less impacted areas or transported by water and air may also contribute for restoration of biological functions however further studies are needed to assess the impact of physical and chemical changes on the habitability of the remediated soil as the heating temperature increases to more than 300 c the changes in mineralogy physical and chemical properties become even greater dehydroxylation of kaolinite to amorphous material metakaolinite and maghemite formation is observed associated with that there is a decrease in fe ii content to values lower than before heating in both soils tested changes in texture become significant even in oxic conditions and the hydraulic conductivity increases even more by a factor of 1 5 also the foc decreases around 30 resulting in increased contaminant mobility due to decreased sorption the increased mobility is also expected due to a decrease in cation exchange capacity cec as observed in other studies ngole jeme 2019 attah and etim 2020 at these temperatures as shown in the microcosms heated at 350 c the soil was sterilized carbon and nutrient availability also decrease due to the decarboxylation of macromolecules in the soil at temperatures over 300 c as well as the volatilization of nitrogen compounds glass et al 2008 yi et al 2016 as microbial cells tend to move towards available substrates even in unsaturated soils juyal et al 2020 the reduction in carbon and nutrient contents can make recolonization more difficult in addition even though an increase in pore connectivity can favor the movement of microbiota from adjacent areas into the treated soil microorganisms tend to grow at the solid pore interface so the observed reduction in specific surface results in a smaller available area for microbial settlement juyal et al 2020 therefore after heating in this temperature range 300 c both biotic and abiotic processes become less likely to occur however this temperature range is rarely applied for in situ thermal remediation being more common for ex situ applications during thermal remediation temperature gradients are formed as observed in this study therefore different parts of the aquifer are subjected to different temperatures at the same time also the cooling down phase results in slightly elevated temperatures around 25 to 60 c for prolonged periods this might have beneficial implications for nbs for example abiotic degradation in this cooldown phase will be favored by a higher fe ii concentration formed due to heating above 120 c and the slightly elevated temperatures which lead to increased abiotic dechlorination rates when soil temperature and humidity return to ambient conditions the chemical and mineralogical changes caused by heating should be affected by pedogenetic processes over time but not reversed for example in relation to mineralogy composition minerals fully decomposed during heating such as kaolinite al2 si2o5 oh 4 will not form again however gibbsite can precipitate from soil solution forming nodules or coating soil particles muggler et al 2007 in addition despite goethite Œ± feooh not forming again by hematite Œ± fe2o3 rehydration it can crystalize from nucleation of dissolved and partially hydrolyzed fe3 ions e g fe oh 2 in the soil solution sposito 1989 therefore over time all properties related to soil texture can also be affected by the active pedogenetic processes a long term monitoring would be needed to fully characterize the changes after the remediation even though the conditions tested do not exactly replicate field conditions in terms of heating duration which are typically longer in the field than simulated here and temperature rate of increase the results obtained indicate processes that might be observed the different conditions tested indicate that some changes will occur relatively fast for example for the technosol heating under oxic conditions for 1 h disturbed samples and for around 10 h with a lower rate of temperature increase undisturbed sample produced similar results for changes in grain size distribution on the other hand an increase in heating time produced significant differences in the fe ii content when heating in oxidizing conditions most likely initially the organic matter burning promoted reducing conditions but with increasing heating time the atmosphere become oxidizing this illustrates how site specific properties and heating application conditions might lead to different results 4 conclusions the use of thermal remediation in tropical environments was evaluated considering how the soil changes might impact the potential for application of posterior nature based solutions the increase of temperature applied in this remediation technique can change the mineralogical chemical physical and microbiological characteristics of soils which in turn can affect the effectiveness of posterior nbs three main factors were identified as controlling the type and extent of the properties changes the first factor to be considered is the soil type particularly the organic matter content and mineralogy specifically related to the presence of iron minerals if iron minerals are initially present as was the case with the oxisol tested increased temperatures can lead to a change in the oxidation state of iron resulting in increased fe ii concentrations also the organic matter burning can lead to reducing environment conditions which also promote the transformation to fe ii the combination of a reducing condition increased fe ii minerals and higher ph increase the potential for abiotic dechlorination of chlorinated compounds in the tested soil with lower iron content less organic matter and coarser texture technosol the changes were less pronounced and needed higher temperatures to be significant the second major controlling factor is the heating temperature generally increasing temperature impacted microbial populations from inhibition at 60 c to severe impact at 100 c and soil sterilization at temperatures over 270 c however duration of heating and desiccation are variables to be tested in future experiments to better understand how microbial populations can resist to heating at higher temperatures in soil matrices when observing soil properties behavior at different temperatures recolonization of the soil with native microbiota seems likely to occur after heating up to 250 c but above 300 c is not clear whether changes in soil properties would negatively impact recolonization as the fact that cell migration is favored by increasing hydraulic conductivity contrasts with a decrease in the surface area available for cell settlement due to the shift in granulometry the formation of minerals capable of promoting abiotic degradation was achieved at a specific temperature range from 120 to 250 c the increase in temperature also resulted in greater contaminant mobility due to lower sorption and higher hydraulic conductivity these changes could also facilitate the injection of remedial solutions such as bioremediation amendments the third factor identified was the atmosphere reducing versus oxidizing during the heating phase reducing conditions caused more significant changes in physical and chemical properties formation of fe ii minerals was greater in reducing conditions and changes in grain size occurred at lower temperatures under reducing conditions therefore for some sites there is a potential for designing thermal remediation systems in a way that intrinsic degradation processes are favored allowing the application of nbs for example in sites contaminated by chlorinated compounds where iron minerals are present it is possible to define an ideal heating condition that allows the formation of fe ii potentially enhancing abiotic degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1413,high resolution characterization of complex dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated sites is crucial for developing effective remediation strategies the dnapl source zone is usually characterized by hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt however the hptt method may fail to capture the highly saturated pool dominated dnapl source zone architecture sza because partitioning tracers tend to bypass the low permeability zones where the pool dnapl accumulates resulting in a low resolution dnapl estimation with a limited number of measurements the estimation errors may be significant to overcome these difficulties time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert was integrated with the partitioning interwell tracer test pitt and hydraulic tomography ht to characterize the pool dominated dnapl sza herein we proposed an iterative joint inversion framework coupling the multiphase flow model with the ert forward model to estimate the heterogeneous permeability distribution and dnapl sza under this framework permeability was estimated using the hydraulic head data from ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was subsequently estimated by assimilating both the pitt and ert observations in stage 2 the permeability estimated from stage 1 was used as prior information for stage 2 and the dnapl saturation estimated from stage 2 was served as prior information for stage 1 in the next loop to form an iterative loop to improve the estimation of both permeability and dnapl sza the iterative joint inversion framework was evaluated in two numerical experiments with different heterogeneous structures by assimilating multi source datasets including hydraulic head partitioning interwell tracer concentration and electrical resistivity results show that with limited measurements of hptt method one can roughly capture the dnapl distribution missing the fine structure of the dnapl sza in contrast by incorporating multi source datasets the heterogeneous permeability and dnapl sza can be reconstructed with a higher resolution furthermore the inversion accuracy of the dnapl sza improves progressively as the iteration proceeds which demonstrates the advantage of utilizing complementary information from permeability and dnapl distribution through the iteration framework comparing with the results without loop iteration the estimation error is reduced by 17 3 for permeability and 8 6 for dnapl saturation in experiment 1 by 14 7 for permeability and 11 2 for dnapl saturation in experiment 2 through the iterative framework to further evaluate our framework we preformed the prediction of the depletion process of the dnapl source zone and plume based on the estimated dnapl sza results show that using the iterative framework the prediction of the sza depletion is greatly improved i e the estimation error of the dissolved downstream plume from the dnapl source zone after 3 years is reduced by 20 9 in experiment 1 and by 43 2 in experiment 2 respectively through the iterative framework this significant improvement is because the iterative method can better capture the spread of dnapl pool keywords iterative joint inversion framework time lapse electrical resistivity tomography dnapl source zone architecture hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography 1 introduction dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls contamination in the subsurface represents a challenging environmental problem worldwide national research council 2013 once leaked into the subsurface dnapl remains trapped as immobile discrete ganglia in pores or as high saturation pools above low permeability areas dekker and abriola 2000 kueper et al 2014 the high densities low interfacial tensions and low viscosities of dnapls can lead to deep penetration resulting in persistent source zones szs pankow and cherry 1996 previous studies have demonstrated that dnapl source zone architecture sza is significantly sensitive to subsurface heterogeneity i e small spatial variations in permeability may result in significantly different dnapl distribution ferrari et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 the spatial distribution mass and composition of dnapl present in the source zone need to be characterized in detail so that efficient remediation schemes can be designed especially comprehensively describing the heterogeneous structure of the subsurface system is a prerequisite for the high resolution characterization of dnapl sza the common methods used to characterize the dnapl source zone are groundwater monitoring wells and soil groundwater sampling kram et al 2001 however applications of this method to real world contaminated sites are usually difficult since it requires a large number of samples barcelona and jaglowski 1999 the collection of a large number of invasive samples is often cost prohibitive and practically impossible recently many indirect methods have been applied to characterize the dnapl contaminated sites moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 yeh and liu 2000 zhou and cardiff 2017 for example zhou and cardiff 2017 used oscillatory hydraulic testing oht to monitor napl migration dridi et al 2009 used partitioning interwell tracer test pitt and inverse modeling to characterize the dnapl sza during pitt a suite of tracers with a range of napl water partitioning coefficients are injected into the subsurface and then recovered in a downstream extraction well because of the presence of dnapl partitioning tracers are retarded however this method is not applicable in heterogeneous cases because heterogeneity interferes greatly on pitt estimation to extend this method to heterogeneous aquifers yeh and zhu 2007 proposed the hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt to reconstruct the dnapl sza hptt combines hydraulic tomography ht and partitioning tracer tomography ptt to invert the spatial distribution of both permeability and dnapl saturation in the hptt method ht is a sequential cross hole hydraulic test followed by the inversion of data to estimate the aquifer permeability based on this estimated permeability the dnapl saturation can be estimated by analyzing the breakthrough curves btcs of multiple partitioning tracers laboratory experiments have demonstrated that with sufficient invasive measurements this method can capture the main structure of the dnapl sz illman et al 2010 however high resolution characterization of dnapl sza still faces some challenges first with the presence of dnapl sz the hydraulic head data in hptt is affected by both permeability and dnapl saturation using ht to estimate the permeability without considering the prior information of dnapl distribution may result in poor permeability estimate which may fail to characterize the fine features of the sza second the limited invasive measurements make it difficult for high resolution characterization third compared to the source zone comprised of discrete ganglia the estimation error may be larger by hptt method in pool dominated dnapl source zone this is because in heterogeneous aquifers estimating pool dominated dnapl source zone by partitioning tracers may result in flow bypassing around the dnapl pools thereby causing difficulties in the dnapl imaging imhoff and pirestani 2004 moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 rao et al 2000 compared with hptt geophysical methods have advantages of low cost and high sampling density in subsurface characterization to overcome the inaccurate estimation caused by the scarcity of data and flow bypassing around the dnapl geophysical methods can be used as an additional source of information to improve dnapl characterization deng et al 2017 kang et al 2020 geophysical methods especially electrical resistivity tomography ert respond well to pool dominated dnapl and are widely used in detecting the sza naudet et al 2014 steelman et al 2017 in particular cross borehole ert was proposed to reconstruct resistivity cross sections in a higher resolution than that of surface based ert chambers et al 2010 sasaki 1992 cross borehole ert measures the difference in voltage generated by the injection of electric current between two electrodes implanted in the boreholes then the electric potentials induced by various combinations of transmitting and receiving electrodes are measured to interpret the distribution of the subsurface resistive or conductive zones in addition the time lapse ert method has a greater potential to monitor dnapl migration deng et al 2017 power et al 2014 with the time lapse cross borehole ert datasets the least squares difference inversion approach can be applied to invert the ert data into relevant hydrology information as a result of its simplicity power et al 2014 however this method has a cruder expression because of its regularization by isotropic smoothing zhou et al 2014 to overcome the over smoothing caused by the traditional inversion method a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion framework has been developed to incorporate the physics of the monitored process into the inversion of the geophysical data camporese et al 2015 pollock and cirpka 2012 tran et al 2014 in recent decades many inverse modeling methods have been developed to reconstruct the permeability franssen et al 2003 fu and jaime g√≥mez hern√°ndez 2009 or dnapl distribution kang et al 2020 kang et al 2018 yeh and zhu 2007 among them the restart ensemble kalman filter enkfr has been proven to be more computationally efficient and capable of handling nonlinearities between parameters and state variables hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 in this study we developed an iterative joint inversion framework with coupled multiphase flow and ert models to improve the permeability and pool dominated dnapl sza the iterative method based on enkfr was proposed to incorporate the information of dnapl saturation in its source zones into hydraulic head data under this framework permeability was calibrated by the ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was inverted by combining both pitt and ert in stage 2 the results from stage 1 were used as prior information for stage 2 and results from stage 2 were used as prior information for stage 1 in the next loop to form an iterative loop that can improve the accuracy of both permeability and dnapl sza estimations finally numerical experiments were used to validate and evaluate the performance of this framework 2 methods 2 1 forward model for generating dnapl sz and observation 2 1 1 forward model for generating dnapl

repeated until the end of assimilation 2 3 joint inversion framework based on iterative loop we propose an iterative joint inversion framework to couple the multiphase flow model and the ert forward model see fig 1 to consider the effect of permeability on dnapl distribution the forward and inverse models previously described were combined in an inversion framework with two stages in stage 1 the permeability was estimated using hydraulic head data eqs 1 2 in stage 2 the dnapl saturation distribution was estimated by the tracer concentration data eqs 1 3 and the ert data eqs 4 7 in stage 1 based on the initial guess for y ln k field and the prior information s n 0 the multiphase flow model is conducted to obtain the distribution of the hydraulic head then the enkfr is used to estimate the y field in stage 2 with the y field estimated from stage 1 and the initial guess for the s n field dnapl distribution field the multiphase flow model is applied to obtain the conservative and partitioning tracer distribution then the conservative tracer c f permeability y and dnapl distribution s n are used to obtain the electrical conductivity with the ert forward model eqs 4 7 the enkfr is used to estimate the s n field by integrating the multiphase flow model partitioning tracer data and ert forward model ert data after stage 2 to incorporate the dnapl saturation distribution information into ht we used the s n estimated from stage 2 as a prior for the permeability inversion in stage 1 the next iteration as a result this loop repeatedly iterates to obtain better estimations of both permeability and dnapl distribution in this study we used the root mean square error rmse values as the termination criterion the algorithm stopped when the difference in the rmse

two different configurations of pool dominated dnapl reference field were generated by different aquifer structures the correlation lengths of ln k were i x i z 5 m 1 5 m in experiment 1 and i x i z 15 m 1 5 m in experiment 2 respectively compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has longer low permeable lenses and larger dnapl releasing rate resulting in a larger extend pool dominated dnapl source zone both experiments were designed and conducted to further illustrate the applicability of the iterative inversion framework in both experiments hydraulic head data was collected during the ht process while both concentration sampling and time lapse ert measurement were collected during the pitt process the two dimensional 2d heterogeneous confined aquifer 16 m 8 m was discretized into 32 16 512 elements with a uniform element size of Œ¥x Œ¥ z 0 5 m zero flux boundaries were set to the top and bottom of the aquifer and a fixed hydraulic gradient of 0 005 was imposed to ensure groundwater flow from left to right the reference k fields absolute permeability fields see fig 2 were generated using the sequential gaussian simulation program sgsim with the exponential covariance function deutsch and journel 1998 the geostatistical parameters were listed in table 1 the value of the generated reference k was between 9 35 10 14 m2 and 2 79 10 10 m2 which were representative of fine sand sneed 2001 based on the reference ln k fields we used the utchem to simulate the leakage process of tetrachloroethylene pce and generate the pool dominated dnapl source zone to form the different pool dominated dnapl sza the dnapl volume and release are different in two experiments see table 1 after leakage and migration the pce infiltrated into the high permeability zone and was entrapped in low permeability zones see the reference s n in fig 2 conceptualization of the dnapl pools s n s nr max and ganglia s n s nr max led to the development of a simple metric by using the maximum residual dnapl saturation s nr max the ganglia to pool gtp mass ratio which quantifies mass distribution christ et al 2005 lemke et al 2004 14 gtp œÉ s n s n s nr max œÉ s n s n s nr max where represent the universal quantifier meaning for all s n is the dnapl saturation pool dominated dnapls were usually defined as source zones with a gtp lower than approximately 3 christ et al 2010 the gtp of the dnapl source zones in these two experiments were 0 95 and 0 38 respectively i e the pool dominated sza after the infiltration process we assume that the dnapl has reached equilibrium i e there is no further infiltration under such assumptions the dnapl can be regarded as an immobile contaminant source during the ht and pitt tests kang et al 2020 the model parameters used in the numerical experiments were listed in table 1 3 2 multiple observation data before characterizing the y and s n fields the sensitivity of resistivity to dnapl saturation must be tested to validate whether ert can be applied for dnapl inversion herein we illustrate that ert can be used for dnapl reconstruction in two ways first eq 4 demonstrates that the true electrical conductivity in the aquifer is directly proportional to the square of the water phase saturation m 2 indicating that the resistivity is sensitive to the dnapl saturation then we used an electrode array shown in fig 3 to perform a direct inversion of the apparent resistivity considering a 10 relative observation error fig 4 shows the resistivity field estimated from the direct inversion of each experiment wherein the high resistivity area from the ert estimation roughly matches the actual dnapl source zones in other words direct measurements from ert can roughly reflect the dnapl distribution therefore ert can be used to reconstruct the dnapl distribution when the dnapl distribution is improved more accurate dnapl prior information will be used to estimate permeability thus the addition of ert data is helpful for y ln k estimation the two experiments were used to evaluate the performance of the iterative inversion framework for both two experiments permeability was estimated using the ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was estimated by integrating both pitt and ert in stage 2 table 2 in stage 1 to conduct the ht four fully penetrating vertical wells were placed at x 0 m 5 3 m 10 6 m and 16 m in the aquifer each well has 8 observation ports see the red triangles in fig 3 and one or two injection ports fig 3 yellow rectangle we injected water into the aquifer at a constant rate of 10 m3 day at each injection port simultaneously the observation ports were used to collect hydraulic head data each port underwent injection for two days wherein the 6 injection ports experienced continuous water injection for a total of 12 days during each injection process 32 observation data points were obtained totaling 384 observation data points obtained in stage 1 in stage 2 we used the observation wells to conduct the pitt partitioning and conservative tracers were injected in each port of eight ports at x 0 at a rate of 3 m3 d and were pumped from each port of eight ports at x 16 m at a rate of 3 m3 d to obtain the tracer concentration data the remaining 16 ports at x 5 3 m and 10 6 m were also used to collect tracer concentration data with the steady state flow field a mixture of tracers was released in x 0 for 1 day herein 2 2 dimethyl 3 pentanol dmp n hexanol hex and 6 methyl 2 heptanol 6m2h were used as the partitioning tracers with a concentration of 0 5 kg m3 in each tracer wherein the partitioning coefficients of the partitioning tracer were 27 5 8 5 and 88 5 respectively moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 bromide in the form of nabr was selected to be the conservative tracer with a concentration of 5 kg m3 to induce a significant change in the conductivity of the water phase when injected into the subsurface for the ert survey 17 electrodes and 32 electrodes were set at the ground surface and the vertical boreholes respectively fig 3 these electrodes were placed 1 m apart in both ground surface and the vertical boreholes we used a dipole dipole configuration for the horizontal line johnson et al 2015 and bipole bipole array for the cross well measurements seferou et al 2013 the simulation was conducted for 10 days wherein the concentration and ert measurements were acquired once daily in total 720 partitioning tracer concentration data and 14 670 ert data were collected during pitt process after stage 2 the obtained s n was returned to stage 1 to begin loop 2 note that we added 1 3 and 10 relative errors to the hydraulic head tracer concentration and bulk resistivity respectively these levels of data noise were referred to previous study values jardani et al 2013 kowalsky et al 2011 3 3 inversion parameters in the proposed inversion framework the initial permeability realizations were generated by the sgsim and the initial ensemble of ln k were generated using the exponential covariance function with the geostatistical parameters shown in table 1 the realization size of y was set to 500 the initial realizations of the s n field were also generated by the sgsim with mean ln s n 4 6 s n 0 01 standard deviation œÉln sn 1 and correlation lengths of i x i z 5 m 3 m as the prior covariance model for both experiments despite their different dnapl szas the realization size of s n is the same as that of y 500 for both experiments here the termination threshold of iterative inversion Œ¥ see eq 12 is set as 0 01 to balance estimation accuracy and calculation cost to demonstrate the advantage of the iterative framework the rmse eq 13 was used as a criterion to indicate the goodness of the estimated y ln k and s n values in different cases chen and zhang 2006 jardani et al 2013 a workstation with an eight core 32 gigabyte random access memory ram and a 2 6 ghz central processing unit cpu was utilized to compute our simulations the computation times in a complete loop for the joint inversion case required herein were 38 1 h and 38 7 h in experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively according to the time required for each iteration if the framework needs multiple iterations the iteration cost is high and unacceptable thus a maximum iteration step size must also be set to avoid excessive iteration time here we set the maximum iteration number to 8 for two experiments 4 results the best estimates of the two experiments are shown in fig 5 to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework according to the framework termination criterion experiment 1 required 3 iterations and experiment 2 required 4 iterations to provide best estimates for results of the estimated dnapl distribution a threshold value of s n 0 01 was used because saturations less than 1 cannot be solved by inversion in experiment 1 the iterative joint inversion framework can well characterize the ln k and s n field the result of estimated ln k can capture the fine feature of the reference field based on the estimated ln k field the location of dnapl pool and spread range of ganglia can be reconstructed in high resolution compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has a more widespread dnapl source zone extent in the x direction which is more challenging for the dnapl imaging problem because the larger dnapl source zone with more pool dnapl can cause a more serious flow bypassing problem thereby reducing the accuracy of the hptt method despite all the difficulties the proposed method can still accurately reconstruct the distribution of permeability and dnapl in experiment 2 we further compare the evolutions of rmse about s n in experiments 1 and 2 to show the influence of different dnapl sza on the inversion results the evolutions of rmse about s n using iterative joint inversion framework in two experiments are demonstrated in fig 6 compared with experiment 2 the lower rmse value in experiment 1 demonstrates that the estimate is better in experiment 1 because dnapl source zone in experiment 2 has more widespread pool than experiment 1 which can cause more serious flow bypassing problem and bring greater challenges to the inversion as the number of iterations increases the estimation accuracy of s n will continue to improve in the initial iteration the rmse of s n decrease rapidly after two or three loops the rate of rmse decrease slow down and become stable in experiment 1 the extent of the dnapl source zone is small resulting in a small influence of prior information of s n on ht after three loops of iterations the rmse of the estimated s n field becomes stable compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has more widespread pool dominated dnapl distribution zone in horizontal direction and result in more impact on the ht process thus four loops of iterations are used to make the rmse stable 5 discussion in this section we discussed the influence of the number of iterations and different types of datasets on the estimation result for two experiments for experiment 1 three cases were designed in experiment 1 we show the estimated results of permeability and dnapl fields using ht pitt and ert data in three loops to discuss the influence of the number of iterations on estimation results table 3 based on the permeability field obtained from experiment 1 loop 1 the dnapl distribution was reconstructed using only pitt data in experiment 1 pitt only ert data in experiment 1 ert to discuss the influence of multi source datasets table 4 for experiment 2 all the cases were same as experiment 1 except for the reference ln k and dnapl distribution 5 1 the influence of the number of iterations 5 1 1 experiment 1 pool dominated sza with short lens configurator in experiment 1 three loops are needed to obtain the best approximate reference and ensemble mean of ln k and s n scatterplots of ln k and variance of the estimated s n distribution using ht pitt and ert methods in three loops are showed in fig 7 for permeability inversion the estimation methods were all based on the hydraulic head data thus the difference in the permeability estimation results is mainly caused by the difference in prior information s n during the iteration loops in fig 7b no prior information regarding dnapl distribution initial guess for s n 0 was applied to characterize the y field in loop 1 as the estimate can reconstruct the main structure of the permeability field the ht was determined to be a useful method for permeability characterization liu et al 2002 liu et al 2007 however due to the lack of prior information on dnapl distribution the ht method cannot distinguish the impact from s n and k on the hydraulic head which may result in a low resolution k imaging among these three loops fig 7e g the scatterplots and rmse value of the y field estimate were the worst in loop 1 fig 7e due to a lack of prior information on the dnapl field in fig 7b g as the iteration proceeds the estimate of the permeability improves due to the improved dnapl prior information fig 7c and d demonstrates that when the same observation method is used the accurate prior information of s n fig 7j leads to a good permeability result fig 7d thus integrating prior information of the dnapl distribution can improve the permeability estimate compared with the result without loop iteration fig 7e the rmse of the ln k estimation is reduced by 17 3 through the iterative framework fig 7g fig 7i demonstrates that using ert and pitt methods can capture the spatial distribution structure of dnapl field however due to poor prior information of permeability field fig 7b the results of fig 7i loop 1 are the worst in three loops comparing the ensemble mean and rmse of fig 7i k the estimated result of s n field improves with the successive loops the accuracy improvement of the y ln k value as prior information leads to a better estimation of the s n field therefore the accuracy of prior information y is crucial to the estimation of s n which is consistent with the results of previous studies e g yeh and zhu 2007 thus during the iteration the distribution of permeability and dnapl can improve each other and lead to more accurate estimation results of these two parameters compared with the result of case without loop iteration fig 7i the rmse of the s n estimation is reduced by 8 6 through the iterative framework fig 7k to evaluate the impact of the inversion result on predicting dnapl sz depletion we used the utchem to predicted the depletion of the dnapl source and plume based on s n and ln k field from the reference experiment 1 loop 1 and experiment 1 loop 3 the results of the predicted source and plume are shown in fig 8 although the spread of dnapl is not significant it can exist in the aquifer for decades in experiment 1 loop 1 we fail to accurately reproduce the depletion process of the dnapl source and the evolution of the dnapl plumes based on the estimated dnapl source without loop iteration compared with loop 1 loop 3 can successfully reproduce the results of the depletion of the dnapl source and plume by accurate estimation of the distribution of dnapl i e in the third year the rmse of the dissolution estimation is reduced by 20 9 in loop 3 compared with loop 1 as the dissolution progresses the gap of rmse in loop 1 and loop 3 gradually decreases and to 0 35 in the 50th year 5 1 2 experiment 2 pool dominated sza with long lens configurator in experiment 2 four loops are required to obtained the best estimate fig 9 shows reference and ensemble mean of y and s n scatterplots of y field and variance of the estimated s n distribution using ht pitt and ert method in four loops experiment 2 fig 9b demonstrates the estimation without prior information of the s n distribution can capture the main structure of the permeability field but fails to characterize the sharp change interface in k field due to the lack of dnapl distribution information the rmse value and scatterplots also show that y field in loop 1 fig 9f has the poorest results as compared with the other loops fig 9c e demonstrates that the prior information of the dnapl field fig 9m can improve the estimation result of permeability fig 9e with good prior information of the dnapl field one can better capture the sharp change interface in k field the scatterplots of the estimated versus reference ln k field can also indicate an improvement in permeability compared with the results of loop 1 fig 9f the rmse of the ln k estimation is reduced by 14 7 when the best prior information of s n is used fig 9i fig 9k demonstrates that the dnapl distribution can be characterized well by integrating pitt and ert data but compared with other loops in fig 9 the result of loop 1 is worst due to the poor prior information of y field in loops 1 4 of dnapl field the estimates of the dnapl distribution improves as iteration proceeds compared with the result of case without loop iteration fig 9k the rmse of the s n estimation is reduced by 11 2 through the four iterations fig 9n the depletion of the dnapl source and plume based on s n and ln k field from the reference the experiment 2 loop 1 and the experiment 2 loop 4 are predicted to demonstrate the advantage of the iterative inversion framework the results of the predicted source and plume are shown in fig 10 in experiment 2 loop 1 the depletion process of the dnapl source and the evolution of the dnapl plumes was poorly reproduced because of the inaccurate prior information of dnapl source zone without loop iteration by using an iterative framework experiment 2 loop 4 can successfully reproduce the results of the depletion of the dnapl source and plume i e in the third year the rmse of the dissolution estimation is reduced by 43 2 in loop 4 compared with loop 1 this significant improvement is because iterative method can better capture the spread of dnapl pool as the dissolution progresses the difference of rmse between loop 1 and loop 4 gradually decreases and to 12 7 in the 50th year 5 2 the influence of types of datasets 5 2 1 experiment 1 pool dominated sza with short lens configurator to illustrate the advantages of integrating multi source datasets we show the results of three cases using different datasets fig 11 in fig 11 experiments 1 1 pitt and 1 ert are the estimated dnapl fields by both pitt and ert data only pitt data and only ert data respectively see table 4 in experiment 1 the dnapl distribution was estimated by combining tracer and ert data the results of the ensemble mean and rmse showed that the dnapl distribution was well reproduced by combining these two datasets this indicates that ert can serve as a good supplement for the tracer data despite the ert s limited resolution it provides sufficient data for the study domain and is sensitive to highly saturated dnapl regions deng et al 2017 kang et al 2018 conversely with the constraint of high precision tracer data the uncertainty of the dnapl source zone inversion can be reduced note that the variance of the area where the dnapl accumulates is relatively lower as there is a large increase in the dnapl saturation thus the observation around this region is a better estimate resulting in a lower uncertainty in experiment 1 pitt the dnapl distribution was estimated using tracer data during the pitt however the spread of the dnapl source zones was overestimated in the aquifer due to the limited observation ports the flow bypassing problem that takes place in a low permeability region with high dnapl saturation may make the sza estimation even worse imhoff and pirestani 2004 the inaccurate prior information of ln k could also lead to the dnapl misestimation kang et al 2020 in experiment 1 ert low cost and data intensive ert was used to invert the pool dominated dnapl sza according to the petrophysical model we used eq 4 ert signals are sensitive to highly saturated dnapl compared with both experiments 1 and 1 pitt experiment 1 ert exhibits a rough range of the dnapl distribution however because of its low resolution the ert fails to accurately characterize the location of dnapl pools chambers et al 2010 to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our framework we analyzed five spatial metrics of the sza including dnapl mass x and z center and spread of mass see fig 12 the horizontal blue dotted lines represent the metrics calculated from the reference s n field fig 12 shows that combining the pitt and ert data experiment 1 has better performance than the cases using a single dataset experiment 1 pitt or experiment 1 ert in fig 12a the estimated dnapl mass in loop 3 experiment 1 loop 3 is more accurate than those in loop 1 experiment 1 loop 1 which demonstrates the advantage of the iterative framework in experiment 1 ert the mass of dnapl had a large variation indicating that ert derived results had high uncertainty in fig 12b and d the centers of dnapl distribution are closer to the reference and more concentrated by coupled ert and ptt data comparing to the result using single dataset fig 12c and e show that the spread of the dnapl source zone will perform better by using the iterative framework experiment 1 loop 3 than without loop iteration experiment 1 loop 1 5 2 2 experiment 2 pool dominated sza with long lens configurator based on the same prior information of the ln k field we further inverted the dnapl distribution with different methods in experiment 2 fig 13 experiments 2 2 pitt and 2 ert were the estimated dnapl fields by both pitt and ert data only pitt data and only ert data respectively table 4 in experiment 2 wherein both ert and pitt data were used we could produce a more accurate dnapl reconstruction these estimation results not only accurately determined the location of the dnapl distribution but also successfully characterized the shape of the dnapl sza compared with experiments 2 pitt and 2 ert the variance of the dnapl distribution lowered when the two datasets were integrated in experiment 2 pitt the pitt could approximately reconstruct the shape of the dnapl distribution however owing to the sparse data and flow bypassing problem the pitt data failed to reconstruct the dnapl sza with high resolution and overestimated the dnapl spread zone in experiment 2 ert only the ert data could roughly determine the location of the dnapl source zone compared with the results of experiments 2 and 2 pitt the ert data poorly characterized the shape of the dnapl source zone because of its low resolution in addition the high variance in experiment 2 ert is a problem that cannot be ignored in real world estimated results with high variances are easily affected by objective factors such as clay lens heterogeneity ironic concentration and soil moisture content resulting in misestimations of the dnapl distribution thus only the ert data cannot be used to estimate the dnapl source zone with high resolution fig 14 shows different metrics boxplots including dnapl mass x and z center and spread of mass of the estimated versus reference dnapl distribution for experiment 2 in fig 14 a the dnapl mass estimated from the ptt and ert data experiment 2 loop 1 is closer to the reference than those that utilized only a single dataset experiment 2 pitt or experiment 2 ert in fig 14b and d the centers of dnapl distribution ranges of experiment 2 loops 1 and 4 are closer to the reference which indicate that integrating the pitt and ert data performs better in estimating a large scale dnapl sza in fig 14c and e the estimated dnapl spread ranges in experiment 2 loop 4 are more accurate than those in experiment 2 loop 1 which illustrates the advantages of our iterative inversion framework 6 conclusions we developed an iterative joint inversion framework to characterize the dnapl sza in high resolution in the sand aquifers first the ert method was used as an additional source of information to improve dnapl characterization because of its low cost and high sampling density second an iterative method was proposed to incorporate the information of the dnapl saturation distribution into the ht process to improve k imaging in this iterative framework permeability was estimated by ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was identified by assimilating both the pitt data and ert measurements in stage 2 the results from stages 1 and 2 were used as prior information for each other to form an iterative loop to improve the estimation of both the permeability and the dnapl sza to test the performance of the proposed framework synthetic cases were conducted in two pool dominated dnapl sza quantitative comparisons were performed in two experiments using the following datasets 1 ht and pitt 2 ht and ert and 3 ht pitt and ert our results demonstrated that the iterative joint inversion framework can effectively estimate a pool dominated dnapl distribution with high resolution using single dataset pitt data or ert data one can capture the main patterns of the dnapl sza but fails to reproduce the finer structure of the dnapl source zone in contrast integrating hydrogeological and ert measurements can improve the dnapl characterization a small amount of high resolution tracer data can estimate the approximate location of dnapl source zone while as a supplement low resolution ert method can provide sufficient data to cover the entire domain through the proposed framework the inversion accuracy of the dnapl sza improves progressively with increasing iterative numbers comparing with the results without loop iteration the estimation error is reduced by 17 3 for permeability and 8 6 for dnapl saturation in experiment 1 by 14 7 for permeability and 11 2 for dnapl saturation in experiment 2 through the iterative framework we should emphasize that this study is a proof of concept field situations undoubtedly are more complicated than the synthetic cases and the iterative framework still has some limitations first the petrophysical model archie s law may face some uncertainties in reality for example the saturation and cementation exponent in archie s law are not always equal to 2 in different environments archie 1942 revil et al 2018 the temperature in the water is not always constant sen and goode 1992 to handle this petrophysical uncertainty one can consider petrophysical uncertainty in the bayesian framework by jointly estimating both the unknown parameters e g k s n and the petrophysical uncertainty brunetti and linde 2018 second our framework may fail to preserve the complex geological realism with complex facies distributions and complex dnapl sza because of the underlying gaussian assumptions on model parameters that are inherent in enkfr method used in this study although this study is based on numerical scenarios the application of the proposed framework in real world conditions would be practical because 1 the framework can easily extend to 3d cases as the methods used in our framework such as ht pitt and ert have been widely applied in the field 2 in addition to the data we used the framework easily incorporates various other types of field observations such as permeability data from direct sampling and dnapl dissolution data as dnapl sza characterization is complex imaging problem and often requires huge costs in this study we improve estimation results in a cost efficient way by coupling hptt and ert method through an iterative framework future work can attempt to extend our framework to more complex aquifers such as non gaussian aquifer with clay lenses while considering the uncertainties of the framework credit author statement qiongze guo investigation

1413,high resolution characterization of complex dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl contaminated sites is crucial for developing effective remediation strategies the dnapl source zone is usually characterized by hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt however the hptt method may fail to capture the highly saturated pool dominated dnapl source zone architecture sza because partitioning tracers tend to bypass the low permeability zones where the pool dnapl accumulates resulting in a low resolution dnapl estimation with a limited number of measurements the estimation errors may be significant to overcome these difficulties time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert was integrated with the partitioning interwell tracer test pitt and hydraulic tomography ht to characterize the pool dominated dnapl sza herein we proposed an iterative joint inversion framework coupling the multiphase flow model with the ert forward model to estimate the heterogeneous permeability distribution and dnapl sza under this framework permeability was estimated using the hydraulic head data from ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was subsequently estimated by assimilating both the pitt and ert observations in stage 2 the permeability estimated from stage 1 was used as prior information for stage 2 and the dnapl saturation estimated from stage 2 was served as prior information for stage 1 in the next loop to form an iterative loop to improve the estimation of both permeability and dnapl sza the iterative joint inversion framework was evaluated in two numerical experiments with different heterogeneous structures by assimilating multi source datasets including hydraulic head partitioning interwell tracer concentration and electrical resistivity results show that with limited measurements of hptt method one can roughly capture the dnapl distribution missing the fine structure of the dnapl sza in contrast by incorporating multi source datasets the heterogeneous permeability and dnapl sza can be reconstructed with a higher resolution furthermore the inversion accuracy of the dnapl sza improves progressively as the iteration proceeds which demonstrates the advantage of utilizing complementary information from permeability and dnapl distribution through the iteration framework comparing with the results without loop iteration the estimation error is reduced by 17 3 for permeability and 8 6 for dnapl saturation in experiment 1 by 14 7 for permeability and 11 2 for dnapl saturation in experiment 2 through the iterative framework to further evaluate our framework we preformed the prediction of the depletion process of the dnapl source zone and plume based on the estimated dnapl sza results show that using the iterative framework the prediction of the sza depletion is greatly improved i e the estimation error of the dissolved downstream plume from the dnapl source zone after 3 years is reduced by 20 9 in experiment 1 and by 43 2 in experiment 2 respectively through the iterative framework this significant improvement is because the iterative method can better capture the spread of dnapl pool keywords iterative joint inversion framework time lapse electrical resistivity tomography dnapl source zone architecture hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography 1 introduction dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls contamination in the subsurface represents a challenging environmental problem worldwide national research council 2013 once leaked into the subsurface dnapl remains trapped as immobile discrete ganglia in pores or as high saturation pools above low permeability areas dekker and abriola 2000 kueper et al 2014 the high densities low interfacial tensions and low viscosities of dnapls can lead to deep penetration resulting in persistent source zones szs pankow and cherry 1996 previous studies have demonstrated that dnapl source zone architecture sza is significantly sensitive to subsurface heterogeneity i e small spatial variations in permeability may result in significantly different dnapl distribution ferrari et al 2015 zheng et al 2015 the spatial distribution mass and composition of dnapl present in the source zone need to be characterized in detail so that efficient remediation schemes can be designed especially comprehensively describing the heterogeneous structure of the subsurface system is a prerequisite for the high resolution characterization of dnapl sza the common methods used to characterize the dnapl source zone are groundwater monitoring wells and soil groundwater sampling kram et al 2001 however applications of this method to real world contaminated sites are usually difficult since it requires a large number of samples barcelona and jaglowski 1999 the collection of a large number of invasive samples is often cost prohibitive and practically impossible recently many indirect methods have been applied to characterize the dnapl contaminated sites moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 yeh and liu 2000 zhou and cardiff 2017 for example zhou and cardiff 2017 used oscillatory hydraulic testing oht to monitor napl migration dridi et al 2009 used partitioning interwell tracer test pitt and inverse modeling to characterize the dnapl sza during pitt a suite of tracers with a range of napl water partitioning coefficients are injected into the subsurface and then recovered in a downstream extraction well because of the presence of dnapl partitioning tracers are retarded however this method is not applicable in heterogeneous cases because heterogeneity interferes greatly on pitt estimation to extend this method to heterogeneous aquifers yeh and zhu 2007 proposed the hydraulic partitioning tracer tomography hptt to reconstruct the dnapl sza hptt combines hydraulic tomography ht and partitioning tracer tomography ptt to invert the spatial distribution of both permeability and dnapl saturation in the hptt method ht is a sequential cross hole hydraulic test followed by the inversion of data to estimate the aquifer permeability based on this estimated permeability the dnapl saturation can be estimated by analyzing the breakthrough curves btcs of multiple partitioning tracers laboratory experiments have demonstrated that with sufficient invasive measurements this method can capture the main structure of the dnapl sz illman et al 2010 however high resolution characterization of dnapl sza still faces some challenges first with the presence of dnapl sz the hydraulic head data in hptt is affected by both permeability and dnapl saturation using ht to estimate the permeability without considering the prior information of dnapl distribution may result in poor permeability estimate which may fail to characterize the fine features of the sza second the limited invasive measurements make it difficult for high resolution characterization third compared to the source zone comprised of discrete ganglia the estimation error may be larger by hptt method in pool dominated dnapl source zone this is because in heterogeneous aquifers estimating pool dominated dnapl source zone by partitioning tracers may result in flow bypassing around the dnapl pools thereby causing difficulties in the dnapl imaging imhoff and pirestani 2004 moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 rao et al 2000 compared with hptt geophysical methods have advantages of low cost and high sampling density in subsurface characterization to overcome the inaccurate estimation caused by the scarcity of data and flow bypassing around the dnapl geophysical methods can be used as an additional source of information to improve dnapl characterization deng et al 2017 kang et al 2020 geophysical methods especially electrical resistivity tomography ert respond well to pool dominated dnapl and are widely used in detecting the sza naudet et al 2014 steelman et al 2017 in particular cross borehole ert was proposed to reconstruct resistivity cross sections in a higher resolution than that of surface based ert chambers et al 2010 sasaki 1992 cross borehole ert measures the difference in voltage generated by the injection of electric current between two electrodes implanted in the boreholes then the electric potentials induced by various combinations of transmitting and receiving electrodes are measured to interpret the distribution of the subsurface resistive or conductive zones in addition the time lapse ert method has a greater potential to monitor dnapl migration deng et al 2017 power et al 2014 with the time lapse cross borehole ert datasets the least squares difference inversion approach can be applied to invert the ert data into relevant hydrology information as a result of its simplicity power et al 2014 however this method has a cruder expression because of its regularization by isotropic smoothing zhou et al 2014 to overcome the over smoothing caused by the traditional inversion method a coupled hydrogeophysical inversion framework has been developed to incorporate the physics of the monitored process into the inversion of the geophysical data camporese et al 2015 pollock and cirpka 2012 tran et al 2014 in recent decades many inverse modeling methods have been developed to reconstruct the permeability franssen et al 2003 fu and jaime g√≥mez hern√°ndez 2009 or dnapl distribution kang et al 2020 kang et al 2018 yeh and zhu 2007 among them the restart ensemble kalman filter enkfr has been proven to be more computationally efficient and capable of handling nonlinearities between parameters and state variables hendricks franssen and kinzelbach 2008 in this study we developed an iterative joint inversion framework with coupled multiphase flow and ert models to improve the permeability and pool dominated dnapl sza the iterative method based on enkfr was proposed to incorporate the information of dnapl saturation in its source zones into hydraulic head data under this framework permeability was calibrated by the ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was inverted by combining both pitt and ert in stage 2 the results from stage 1 were used as prior information for stage 2 and results from stage 2 were used as prior information for stage 1 in the next loop to form an iterative loop that can improve the accuracy of both permeability and dnapl sza estimations finally numerical experiments were used to validate and evaluate the performance of this framework 2 methods 2 1 forward model for generating dnapl sz and observation 2 1 1 forward model for generating dnapl

repeated until the end of assimilation 2 3 joint inversion framework based on iterative loop we propose an iterative joint inversion framework to couple the multiphase flow model and the ert forward model see fig 1 to consider the effect of permeability on dnapl distribution the forward and inverse models previously described were combined in an inversion framework with two stages in stage 1 the permeability was estimated using hydraulic head data eqs 1 2 in stage 2 the dnapl saturation distribution was estimated by the tracer concentration data eqs 1 3 and the ert data eqs 4 7 in stage 1 based on the initial guess for y ln k field and the prior information s n 0 the multiphase flow model is conducted to obtain the distribution of the hydraulic head then the enkfr is used to estimate the y field in stage 2 with the y field estimated from stage 1 and the initial guess for the s n field dnapl distribution field the multiphase flow model is applied to obtain the conservative and partitioning tracer distribution then the conservative tracer c f permeability y and dnapl distribution s n are used to obtain the electrical conductivity with the ert forward model eqs 4 7 the enkfr is used to estimate the s n field by integrating the multiphase flow model partitioning tracer data and ert forward model ert data after stage 2 to incorporate the dnapl saturation distribution information into ht we used the s n estimated from stage 2 as a prior for the permeability inversion in stage 1 the next iteration as a result this loop repeatedly iterates to obtain better estimations of both permeability and dnapl distribution in this study we used the root mean square error rmse values as the termination criterion the algorithm stopped when the difference in the rmse

estimated field n x is the number of observation data 3 synthetic cases 3 1 case setup two numerical experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed joint inversion framework two different configurations of pool dominated dnapl reference field were generated by different aquifer structures the correlation lengths of ln k were i x i z 5 m 1 5 m in experiment 1 and i x i z 15 m 1 5 m in experiment 2 respectively compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has longer low permeable lenses and larger dnapl releasing rate resulting in a larger extend pool dominated dnapl source zone both experiments were designed and conducted to further illustrate the applicability of the iterative inversion framework in both experiments hydraulic head data was collected during the ht process while both concentration sampling and time lapse ert measurement were collected during the pitt process the two dimensional 2d heterogeneous confined aquifer 16 m 8 m was discretized into 32 16 512 elements with a uniform element size of Œ¥x Œ¥ z 0 5 m zero flux boundaries were set to the top and bottom of the aquifer and a fixed hydraulic gradient of 0 005 was imposed to ensure groundwater flow from left to right the reference k fields absolute permeability fields see fig 2 were generated using the sequential gaussian simulation program sgsim with the exponential covariance function deutsch and journel 1998 the geostatistical parameters were listed in table 1 the value of the generated reference k was between 9 35 10 14 m2 and 2 79 10 10 m2 which were representative of fine sand sneed 2001 based on the reference ln k fields we used the utchem to simulate the leakage process of tetrachloroethylene pce and generate the pool dominated dnapl source zone to form the different pool dominated dnapl sza the dnapl volume and release are different in two experiments see table 1 after leakage and migration the pce infiltrated into the high permeability zone and was entrapped in low permeability zones see the reference s n in fig 2 conceptualization of the dnapl pools s n s nr max and ganglia s n s nr max led to the development of a simple metric by using the maximum residual dnapl saturation s nr max the ganglia to pool gtp mass ratio which quantifies mass distribution christ et al 2005 lemke et al 2004 14 gtp œÉ s n s n s nr max œÉ s n s n s nr max where represent the universal quantifier meaning for all s n is the dnapl saturation pool dominated dnapls were usually defined as source zones with a gtp lower than approximately 3 christ et al 2010 the gtp of the dnapl source zones in these two experiments were 0 95 and 0 38 respectively i e the pool dominated sza after the infiltration process we assume that the dnapl has reached equilibrium i e there is no further infiltration under such assumptions the dnapl can be regarded as an immobile contaminant source during the ht and pitt tests kang et al 2020 the model parameters used in the numerical experiments were listed in table 1 3 2 multiple observation data before characterizing the y and s n fields the sensitivity of resistivity to dnapl saturation must be tested to validate whether ert can be applied for dnapl inversion herein we illustrate that ert can be used for dnapl reconstruction in two ways first eq 4 demonstrates that the true electrical conductivity in the aquifer is directly proportional to the square of the water phase saturation m 2 indicating that the resistivity is sensitive to the dnapl saturation then we used an electrode array shown in fig 3 to perform a direct inversion of the apparent resistivity considering a 10 relative observation error fig 4 shows the resistivity field estimated from the direct inversion of each experiment wherein the high resistivity area from the ert estimation roughly matches the actual dnapl source zones in other words direct measurements from ert can roughly reflect the dnapl distribution therefore ert can be used to reconstruct the dnapl distribution when the dnapl distribution is improved more accurate dnapl prior information will be used to estimate permeability thus the addition of ert data is helpful for y ln k estimation the two experiments were used to evaluate the performance of the iterative inversion framework for both two experiments permeability was estimated using the ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was estimated by integrating both pitt and ert in stage 2 table 2 in stage 1 to conduct the ht four fully penetrating vertical wells were placed at x 0 m 5 3 m 10 6 m and 16 m in the aquifer each well has 8 observation ports see the red triangles in fig 3 and one or two injection ports fig 3 yellow rectangle we injected water into the aquifer at a constant rate of 10 m3 day at each injection port simultaneously the observation ports were used to collect hydraulic head data each port underwent injection for two days wherein the 6 injection ports experienced continuous water injection for a total of 12 days during each injection process 32 observation data points were obtained totaling 384 observation data points obtained in stage 1 in stage 2 we used the observation wells to conduct the pitt partitioning and conservative tracers were injected in each port of eight ports at x 0 at a rate of 3 m3 d and were pumped from each port of eight ports at x 16 m at a rate of 3 m3 d to obtain the tracer concentration data the remaining 16 ports at x 5 3 m and 10 6 m were also used to collect tracer concentration data with the steady state flow field a mixture of tracers was released in x 0 for 1 day herein 2 2 dimethyl 3 pentanol dmp n hexanol hex and 6 methyl 2 heptanol 6m2h were used as the partitioning tracers with a concentration of 0 5 kg m3 in each tracer wherein the partitioning coefficients of the partitioning tracer were 27 5 8 5 and 88 5 respectively moreno barbero and illangasekare 2006 bromide in the form of nabr was selected to be the conservative tracer with a concentration of 5 kg m3 to induce a significant change in the conductivity of the water phase when injected into the subsurface for the ert survey 17 electrodes and 32 electrodes were set at the ground surface and the vertical boreholes respectively fig 3 these electrodes were placed 1 m apart in both ground surface and the vertical boreholes we used a dipole dipole configuration for the horizontal line johnson et al 2015 and bipole bipole array for the cross well measurements seferou et al 2013 the simulation was conducted for 10 days wherein the concentration and ert measurements were acquired once daily in total 720 partitioning tracer concentration data and 14 670 ert data were collected during pitt process after stage 2 the obtained s n was returned to stage 1 to begin loop 2 note that we added 1 3 and 10 relative errors to the hydraulic head tracer concentration and bulk resistivity respectively these levels of data noise were referred to previous study values jardani et al 2013 kowalsky et al 2011 3 3 inversion parameters in the proposed inversion framework the initial permeability realizations were generated by the sgsim and the initial ensemble of ln k were generated using the exponential covariance function with the geostatistical parameters shown in table 1 the realization size of y was set to 500 the initial realizations of the s n field were also generated by the sgsim with mean ln s n 4 6 s n 0 01 standard deviation œÉln sn 1 and correlation lengths of i x i z 5 m 3 m as the prior covariance model for both experiments despite their different dnapl szas the realization size of s n is the same as that of y 500 for both experiments here the termination threshold of iterative inversion Œ¥ see eq 12 is set as 0 01 to balance estimation accuracy and calculation cost to demonstrate the advantage of the iterative framework the rmse eq 13 was used as a criterion to indicate the goodness of the estimated y ln k and s n values in different cases chen and zhang 2006 jardani et al 2013 a workstation with an eight core 32 gigabyte random access memory ram and a 2 6 ghz central processing unit cpu was utilized to compute our simulations the computation times in a complete loop for the joint inversion case required herein were 38 1 h and 38 7 h in experiment 1 and experiment 2 respectively according to the time required for each iteration if the framework needs multiple iterations the iteration cost is high and unacceptable thus a maximum iteration step size must also be set to avoid excessive iteration time here we set the maximum iteration number to 8 for two experiments 4 results the best estimates of the two experiments are shown in fig 5 to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework according to the framework termination criterion experiment 1 required 3 iterations and experiment 2 required 4 iterations to provide best estimates for results of the estimated dnapl distribution a threshold value of s n 0 01 was used because saturations less than 1 cannot be solved by inversion in experiment 1 the iterative joint inversion framework can well characterize the ln k and s n field the result of estimated ln k can capture the fine feature of the reference field based on the estimated ln k field the location of dnapl pool and spread range of ganglia can be reconstructed in high resolution compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has a more widespread dnapl source zone extent in the x direction which is more challenging for the dnapl imaging problem because the larger dnapl source zone with more pool dnapl can cause a more serious flow bypassing problem thereby reducing the accuracy of the hptt method despite all the difficulties the proposed method can still accurately reconstruct the distribution of permeability and dnapl in experiment 2 we further compare the evolutions of rmse about s n in experiments 1 and 2 to show the influence of different dnapl sza on the inversion results the evolutions of rmse about s n using iterative joint inversion framework in two experiments are demonstrated in fig 6 compared with experiment 2 the lower rmse value in experiment 1 demonstrates that the estimate is better in experiment 1 because dnapl source zone in experiment 2 has more widespread pool than experiment 1 which can cause more serious flow bypassing problem and bring greater challenges to the inversion as the number of iterations increases the estimation accuracy of s n will continue to improve in the initial iteration the rmse of s n decrease rapidly after two or three loops the rate of rmse decrease slow down and become stable in experiment 1 the extent of the dnapl source zone is small resulting in a small influence of prior information of s n on ht after three loops of iterations the rmse of the estimated s n field becomes stable compared with experiment 1 experiment 2 has more widespread pool dominated dnapl distribution zone in horizontal direction and result in more impact on the ht process thus four loops of iterations are used to make the rmse stable 5 discussion in this section we discussed the influence of the number of iterations and different types of datasets on the estimation result for two experiments for experiment 1 three cases were designed in experiment 1 we show the estimated results of permeability and dnapl fields using ht pitt and ert data in three loops to discuss the influence of the number of iterations on estimation results table 3 based on the permeability field obtained from experiment 1 loop 1 the dnapl distribution was reconstructed using only pitt data in experiment 1 pitt only ert data in experiment 1 ert to discuss the influence of multi source datasets table 4 for experiment 2 all the cases were same as experiment 1 except for the reference ln k and dnapl distribution 5 1 the influence of the number of iterations 5 1 1 experiment 1 pool dominated sza with short lens configurator in experiment 1 three loops are needed to obtain the best approximate reference and ensemble mean of ln k and s n scatterplots of ln k and variance of the estimated s n distribution using ht pitt and ert methods in three loops are showed in fig 7 for permeability inversion the estimation methods were all based on the hydraulic head data thus the difference in the permeability estimation results is mainly caused by the difference in prior information s n during the iteration loops in fig 7b no prior information regarding dnapl distribution initial guess for s n 0 was applied to characterize the y field in loop 1 as the estimate can reconstruct the main structure of the permeability field the ht was determined to be a useful method for permeability characterization liu et al 2002 liu et al 2007 however due to the lack of prior information on dnapl distribution the ht method cannot distinguish the impact from s n and k on the hydraulic head which may result in a low resolution k imaging among these three loops fig 7e g the scatterplots and rmse value of the y field estimate were the worst in loop 1 fig 7e due to a lack of prior information on the dnapl field in fig 7b g as the iteration proceeds the estimate of the permeability improves due to the improved dnapl prior information fig 7c and d demonstrates that when the same observation method is used the accurate prior information of s n fig 7j leads to a good permeability result fig 7d thus integrating prior information of the dnapl distribution can improve the permeability estimate compared with the result without loop iteration fig 7e the rmse of the ln k estimation is reduced by 17 3 through the iterative framework fig 7g fig 7i demonstrates that using ert and pitt methods can capture the spatial distribution structure of dnapl field however due to poor prior information of permeability field fig 7b the results of fig 7i loop 1 are the worst in three loops comparing the ensemble mean and rmse of fig 7i k the estimated result of s n field improves with the successive loops the accuracy improvement of the y ln k value as prior information leads to a better estimation of the s n field therefore the accuracy of prior information y is crucial to the estimation of s n which is consistent with the results of previous studies e g yeh and zhu 2007 thus during the iteration the distribution of permeability and dnapl can improve each other and lead to more accurate estimation results of these two parameters compared with the result of case without loop iteration fig 7i the rmse of the s n estimation is reduced by 8 6 through the iterative framework fig 7k to evaluate the impact of the inversion result on predicting dnapl sz depletion we used the utchem to predicted the depletion of the dnapl source and plume based on s n and ln k field from the reference experiment 1 loop 1 and experiment 1 loop 3 the results of the predicted source and plume are shown in fig 8 although the spread of dnapl is not significant it can exist in the aquifer for decades in experiment 1 loop 1 we fail to accurately reproduce the depletion process of the dnapl source and the evolution of the dnapl plumes based on the estimated dnapl source without loop iteration compared with loop 1 loop 3 can successfully reproduce the results of the depletion of the dnapl source and plume by accurate estimation of the distribution of dnapl i e in the third year the rmse of the dissolution estimation is reduced by 20 9 in loop 3 compared with loop 1 as the dissolution progresses the gap of rmse in loop 1 and loop 3 gradually decreases and to 0 35 in the 50th year 5 1 2 experiment 2 pool dominated sza with long lens configurator in experiment 2 four loops are required to obtained the best estimate fig 9 shows reference and ensemble mean of y and s n scatterplots of y field and variance of the estimated s n distribution using ht pitt and ert method in four loops experiment 2 fig 9b demonstrates the estimation without prior information of the s n distribution can capture the main structure of the permeability field but fails to characterize the sharp change interface in k field due to the lack of dnapl distribution information the rmse value and scatterplots also show that y field in loop 1 fig 9f has the poorest results as compared with the other loops fig 9c e demonstrates that the prior information of the dnapl field fig 9m can improve the estimation result of permeability fig 9e with good prior information of the dnapl field one can better capture the sharp change interface in k field the scatterplots of the estimated versus reference ln k field can also indicate an improvement in permeability compared with the results of loop 1 fig 9f the rmse of the ln k estimation is reduced by 14 7 when the best prior information of s n is used fig 9i fig 9k demonstrates that the dnapl distribution can be characterized well by integrating pitt and ert data but compared with other loops in fig 9 the result of loop 1 is worst due to the poor prior information of y field in loops 1 4 of dnapl field the estimates of the dnapl distribution improves as iteration proceeds compared with the result of case without loop iteration fig 9k the rmse of the s n estimation is reduced by 11 2 through the four iterations fig 9n the depletion of the dnapl source and plume based on s n and ln k field from the reference the experiment 2 loop 1 and the experiment 2 loop 4 are predicted to demonstrate the advantage of the iterative inversion framework the results of the predicted source and plume are shown in fig 10 in experiment 2 loop 1 the depletion process of the dnapl source and the evolution of the dnapl plumes was poorly reproduced because of the inaccurate prior information of dnapl source zone without loop iteration by using an iterative framework experiment 2 loop 4 can successfully reproduce the results of the depletion of the dnapl source and plume i e in the third year the rmse of the dissolution estimation is reduced by 43 2 in loop 4 compared with loop 1 this significant improvement is because iterative method can better capture the spread of dnapl pool as the dissolution progresses the difference of rmse between loop 1 and loop 4 gradually decreases and to 12 7 in the 50th year 5 2 the influence of types of datasets 5 2 1 experiment 1 pool dominated sza with short lens configurator to illustrate the advantages of integrating multi source datasets we show the results of three cases using different datasets fig 11 in fig 11 experiments 1 1 pitt and 1 ert are the estimated dnapl fields by both pitt and ert data only pitt data and only ert data respectively see table 4 in experiment 1 the dnapl distribution was estimated by combining tracer and ert data the results of the ensemble mean and rmse showed that the dnapl distribution was well reproduced by combining these two datasets this indicates that ert can serve as a good supplement for the tracer data despite the ert s limited resolution it provides sufficient data for the study domain and is sensitive to highly saturated dnapl regions deng et al 2017 kang et al 2018 conversely with the constraint of high precision tracer data the uncertainty of the dnapl source zone inversion can be reduced note that the variance of the area where the dnapl accumulates is relatively lower as there is a large increase in the dnapl saturation thus the observation around this region is a better estimate resulting in a lower uncertainty in experiment 1 pitt the dnapl distribution was estimated using tracer data during the pitt however the spread of the dnapl source zones was overestimated in the aquifer due to the limited observation ports the flow bypassing problem that takes place in a low permeability region with high dnapl saturation may make the sza estimation even worse imhoff and pirestani 2004 the inaccurate prior information of ln k could also lead to the dnapl misestimation kang et al 2020 in experiment 1 ert low cost and data intensive ert was used to invert the pool dominated dnapl sza according to the petrophysical model we used eq 4 ert signals are sensitive to highly saturated dnapl compared with both experiments 1 and 1 pitt experiment 1 ert exhibits a rough range of the dnapl distribution however because of its low resolution the ert fails to accurately characterize the location of dnapl pools chambers et al 2010 to quantitatively evaluate the performance of our framework we analyzed five spatial metrics of the sza including dnapl mass x and z center and spread of mass see fig 12 the horizontal blue dotted lines represent the metrics calculated from the reference s n field fig 12 shows that combining the pitt and ert data experiment 1 has better performance than the cases using a single dataset experiment 1 pitt or experiment 1 ert in fig 12a the estimated dnapl mass in loop 3 experiment 1 loop 3 is more accurate than those in loop 1 experiment 1 loop 1 which demonstrates the advantage of the iterative framework in experiment 1 ert the mass of dnapl had a large variation indicating that ert derived results had high uncertainty in fig 12b and d the centers of dnapl distribution are closer to the reference and more concentrated by coupled ert and ptt data comparing to the result using single dataset fig 12c and e show that the spread of the dnapl source zone will perform better by using the iterative framework experiment 1 loop 3 than without loop iteration experiment 1 loop 1 5 2 2 experiment 2 pool dominated sza with long lens configurator based on the same prior information of the ln k field we further inverted the dnapl distribution with different methods in experiment 2 fig 13 experiments 2 2 pitt and 2 ert were the estimated dnapl fields by both pitt and ert data only pitt data and only ert data respectively table 4 in experiment 2 wherein both ert and pitt data were used we could produce a more accurate dnapl reconstruction these estimation results not only accurately determined the location of the dnapl distribution but also successfully characterized the shape of the dnapl sza compared with experiments 2 pitt and 2 ert the variance of the dnapl distribution lowered when the two datasets were integrated in experiment 2 pitt the pitt could approximately reconstruct the shape of the dnapl distribution however owing to the sparse data and flow bypassing problem the pitt data failed to reconstruct the dnapl sza with high resolution and overestimated the dnapl spread zone in experiment 2 ert only the ert data could roughly determine the location of the dnapl source zone compared with the results of experiments 2 and 2 pitt the ert data poorly characterized the shape of the dnapl source zone because of its low resolution in addition the high variance in experiment 2 ert is a problem that cannot be ignored in real world estimated results with high variances are easily affected by objective factors such as clay lens heterogeneity ironic concentration and soil moisture content resulting in misestimations of the dnapl distribution thus only the ert data cannot be used to estimate the dnapl source zone with high resolution fig 14 shows different metrics boxplots including dnapl mass x and z center and spread of mass of the estimated versus reference dnapl distribution for experiment 2 in fig 14 a the dnapl mass estimated from the ptt and ert data experiment 2 loop 1 is closer to the reference than those that utilized only a single dataset experiment 2 pitt or experiment 2 ert in fig 14b and d the centers of dnapl distribution ranges of experiment 2 loops 1 and 4 are closer to the reference which indicate that integrating the pitt and ert data performs better in estimating a large scale dnapl sza in fig 14c and e the estimated dnapl spread ranges in experiment 2 loop 4 are more accurate than those in experiment 2 loop 1 which illustrates the advantages of our iterative inversion framework 6 conclusions we developed an iterative joint inversion framework to characterize the dnapl sza in high resolution in the sand aquifers first the ert method was used as an additional source of information to improve dnapl characterization because of its low cost and high sampling density second an iterative method was proposed to incorporate the information of the dnapl saturation distribution into the ht process to improve k imaging in this iterative framework permeability was estimated by ht in stage 1 and the dnapl sza was identified by assimilating both the pitt data and ert measurements in stage 2 the results from stages 1 and 2 were used as prior information for each other to form an iterative loop to improve the estimation of both the permeability and the dnapl sza to test the performance of the proposed framework synthetic cases were conducted in two pool dominated dnapl sza quantitative comparisons were performed in two experiments using the following datasets 1 ht and pitt 2 ht and ert and 3 ht pitt and ert our results demonstrated that the iterative joint inversion framework can effectively estimate a pool dominated dnapl distribution with high resolution using single dataset pitt data or ert data one can capture the main patterns of the dnapl sza but fails to reproduce the finer structure of the dnapl source zone in contrast integrating hydrogeological and ert measurements can improve the dnapl characterization a small amount of high resolution tracer data can estimate the approximate location of dnapl source zone while as a supplement low resolution ert method can provide sufficient data to cover the entire domain through the proposed framework the inversion accuracy of the dnapl sza improves progressively with increasing iterative numbers comparing with the results without loop iteration the estimation error is reduced by 17 3 for permeability and 8 6 for dnapl saturation in experiment 1 by 14 7 for permeability and 11 2 for dnapl saturation in experiment 2 through the iterative framework we should emphasize that this study is a proof of concept field situations undoubtedly are more complicated than the synthetic cases and the iterative framework still has some limitations first the petrophysical model archie s law may face some uncertainties in reality for example the saturation and cementation exponent in archie s law are not always equal to 2 in different environments archie 1942 revil et al 2018 the temperature in the water is not always constant sen and goode 1992 to handle this petrophysical uncertainty one can consider petrophysical uncertainty in the bayesian framework by jointly estimating both the unknown parameters e g k s n and the petrophysical uncertainty brunetti and linde 2018 second our framework may fail to preserve the complex geological realism with complex facies distributions and complex dnapl sza because of the underlying gaussian assumptions on model parameters that are inherent in enkfr method used in this study although this study is based on numerical scenarios the application of the proposed framework in real world conditions would be practical because 1 the framework can easily extend to 3d cases as the methods used in our framework such as ht pitt and ert have been widely applied in the field 2 in addition to the data we used the framework easily incorporates various other types of field observations such as permeability data from direct sampling and dnapl dissolution data as dnapl sza characterization is complex imaging problem and often requires huge costs in this study we improve estimation results in a cost efficient way by coupling hptt and ert method through an iterative framework future work can attempt to extend our framework to more complex aquifers such as non gaussian aquifer with clay lenses while considering the uncertainties of the framework credit author statement qiongze guo investigation

1414,karst water with constituting major sources for water supply worldwide is vulnerable and prone to be polluted in this study it is reported that karst water polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pollution is caused by the infiltration of surface runoff in the bared carbonate areas which is of universal significance for the protection of groundwater resources in karst region hydro geochemistry stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr and characteristic ratio method were conducted together to illustrate the concentration distribution sources and pollution path of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater in the liulin karst water system of northern china the results showed that total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 39 25 to 16 830 ng l in groundwater with naphthalene being the dominant component and the median value increased gradually along the flow path the highest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations in karst water were mainly observed in the coal mining and the discharge areas based on the characteristic ratios the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the study area mainly come from local incomplete combustion of woods fossil fuels coal and liquid fuels the slight shift of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o and moderate 87sr 86sr ratios suggest that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in karst water is mainly polluted by surface runoff during rain events in the bared karst region the leakage of river water may partly contribute to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in some karst water which normally located close to the karst water river water mixing line this study provides a new technical method for tracing the sources and identifying the pollution paths of organic pollution in a karst water system graphical

most important sources of water supply du 2009 this aquifer is comprised of limestone dolomite and gypsum interbedded marl with a total thickness above 500 m the karst groundwater system is mainly recharged in the bared carbonate in the south east and north mountain areas leakage of river water serves as additional recharge sources the buried carbonate areas covered by thick sandstone and mudstone layers serves as the flow through area with the waters flowing from the north east and south parts of study area towards the liulin springs places where the springs emerge in the sanchuan

ground glass stoppered flasks which had been rinsed in sulfuric acid potassium dichromate lotion and heated at 180 c for 4 h before using the collection of water samples for pahs detection was performed according to the method suggested by shao et al 2014a it is briefed as 1 to filtrate water with a 0 45 Œºm glass microfiber filters 2 a solid phase extraction was used for pahs extraction 3 the extractants were subsequently transferred to a chromatographic column for cleanup and elution of pahs 4 the final volume of 0 5 ml eluate was obtained after rotary evaporation and nitrogen flush the stock standard of pahs was purchased from accustandara usa methanol dichloromethane and n hexane analytical grade were purchased from cnwbond germany the pahs concentrations were determined at the state key laboratory of biological and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan the condition of the instrument is summarized in appendix s1 all data were subject to strict quality control procedures 4 results and discussion 4 1 concentration and composition of pahs the statistical summary of the pahs concentrations in water samples from the liulin karst water system is given in table s1 the total concentration of pahs pahs ranged from 39 25 ng l to 16 830 ng l in groundwater with a mean value of 3463 ng l the pahs contents of groundwater samples in recharge area were from 527 8 ng l to 2171 ng l with a median value of 1112 ng l in runoff area pahs contents varied from 39 35 ng l to 16 830 ng l median value of 1580 ng l the maximum median and minimum concentrations of pahs in groundwater in discharge area were 15 273 ng l 7047 ng l and 2104 ng l respectively it can be seen that the median content of pahs in groundwater shows an increasing trend along the flow path the contents of pahs in surface water varied greatly from 59 8 ng l to 127 696 ng l with the mean value of 21 164 ng l the contents of 16 pahs components in the fracture water fw pore water pw karst water kw and surface water sw were statistically analyzed fig 2 it is observed that naphthalene nap was the dominant pahs in the water body in the study area with higher contents in most of karst water average value of 3981 ng l other pahs in karst water were between 0 7 ng l 34 9 ng l among them the contents of fluorene flu phenanthrene phe and benzo b fluoranthene bbf were moderate high 19 2 ng l 34 9 ng l while anthracene ant chrysene chr indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene inp dibenzo a h anthracene dia benzo ghi perylene bghip contents were low 3 ng l pore waters were characterized by moderately higher contents of flu phe bbf and benzo k fluoranthene bkf 15 3 ng l 36 4 ng l and lower values of acenaphthylene acy ant inp dia bghip 3 ng l the average content of nap in fissure groundwater was 1727 ng l and other pahs ranged between 2 2 ng l and 50 2 ng l with the lowest contents of pahs found in ant inp and dia 5 ng l the highest contents of nap were observed in surface water with the average value of 20 944 ng l and the contents of acenaphthene ace flu phe ant and fluoranthene fla were higher than 40 ng l 4 2 spatial distribution of pahs 4 2 1 distribution in surface water the pahs concentrations were relatively high in sanchuan river and its three main tributariers beichuan river dongchuan river and nanchuan river table s1 fig 3 higher contents of pahs were observed in the upstream of beichuan river and dongchuan river where population are concentrated with the fast urbanization emission of the vehicles and petrol stations could yield pahs pollution to air soil and the river larsen and baker 2003 wang et al 2017 wei et al 2015 therefore urbanization related to anthropogenic activities is the main factor for pahs pollution in these areas the content of pahs in nanchuan river was the lowest and showed a gradual increase trend from upstream to downstream further indicating the potential impact of big towns urbanization on river water pahs pollution 4 2 2 distribution in groundwater the variations of pahs concentration along the groundwater flow path from mafang town to the liulin spring groups were drawn to illustrate the spatial distribution of pahs in karst water fig 4 in the northern recharge area the water bearing stratum is basically metamorphic rock two fracture water samples in mafang and fangshan town were used for representation along the flow path karst groundwater pahs rose sharply when flowing through the coal mining area dawu town and the town area with heavy population liuling town this indicated that the pahs in karst water were likely to come from the local contamination such as coal combustion or traffic gas emission the outcrop strata are mainly ordovician and quaternary covered by clastic rocks and coal seams around dawu town where a large number of coal mining industries bloom it is well known that coal mining and the incomplete combustion of coke and coal will produce pahs rich contaminants lee et al 2005 liu et al 2009 huang et al 2014 buha markovi et al 2020 hence it is reasonable to infer that the abnormally high content of pahs in karst water is related to the local coalmines in the area when the karst water is blocked by the impermeable rocks at the discharge area and eventually turns into a group of karst springs in sanchuan river the groundwater depth is getting shallower due to the increase of population and improvement of social development in the big towns in the discharge area groundwater is easy to be polluted by vehicle emissions fuel combustion and increasing petroleum stations etc therefore urbanization is another major factor responsible for the pollution of pahs in karst water in the area 4 3 source analysis of pahs the sources of pahs are mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels grass woods and the discharge of crude oil related material guo et al 2007 hu et al 2013 ozaki et al 2020 to distinguish the possible sources among them the characteristic ratio method has been proved to be an effective way olivella et al 2006 tan et al 2011 as isomer compounds often have similar thermodynamic distribution coefficients and dynamic mass transfer coefficients the content ratios of individual pahs components like fla pyr pyrene and benzo a anthracene baa chr are widely used kannan et al 2005 jiao et al 2012 the identification standards of the relationship between the ratios and the sources are given in fig 5 yunker et al 2002 to identify the sources of pahs in the liulin karst water system inp inp bghip and baa baa chr versus fla fla pyr scatter map were plotted in fig 5 the fla fla pyr ratio of karst water is mostly greater than 0 5 in the study area indicating that the pahs is sourcing from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels meanwhile the inp inp bghip ratio of karst water is between 0 2 and 0 5 which suggest that karst water may receive pahs from mixed sources combustion and petroleum the ratio of baa chr is generally used as an indicator to judge the atmospheric transportation distance of pahs a small baa chr ratio indicates that pahs are migrated over long distances to contaminated sites wang et al 2012 wiriya et al 2013 conversely a larger baa chr ratio indicates a greater proportion of pahs from local sources as response to the less volatile advantage of baa it can be seen from the plot baa baa chr versus fla fla pyr that the content of non volatile baa in karst groundwater is higher than that of chr baa baa chr 0 5 illustrating that the pahs mainly come from the local pollution sources 4 4 pollution path identification 4 4 1 hydrogeochemistry scatter diagrams of pahs concentration with ph do hco3 ca2 no3 and cl are shown in fig 6 studies have shown that under neutral conditions limestone has the largest adsorption capacity for phe shao et al 2014b which means a lower pahs concentration is expectable in karst water with ph of 6 5 7 5 however karst water with higher pahs concentration has the ph values around 7 5 fig 6a indicating that ph may not be the most pivotal factors for the distribution of pahs in karst water the relationship between pahs concentration versus hco3 and ca2 contents fig 6b and c give us clues that the dissolution precipitation of carbonate may play an important role in the mobilization of pahs in karst water it is noticed that bicarbonate and calcium contents are positively related with the pahs concentration at lower hco3 and ca2 values as we all know that the increased hco3 and ca2 concentration stands for the strengthening of karstification and dissolution of calcite dolomite batch adsorption experiment conducted by shao et al 2014b show that the dissolution of limestone leads to the elevation of phe concentration in aqueous solution it is possible that the dissolution of carbonates causes the reduction of the sorption sites releasing more pahs into karst water the decrease of pahs concentration with the further increase of hco3 and ca2 contents may be due to the secondary precipitation of calcite and enhanced adsorption ability it is also found that higher pahs concentration mostly present in karst water samples with higher values of dissolved oxygen do fig 6d this further confirmed that the pahs in groundwater mainly come from the input of outdoor environment groundwater with higher pahs concentration normally has a moderate cl concentration fig 6f generally low chloride concentration exist in carbonate aquifers the elevated cl concentration supports the hypothesis that the pahs in groundwater is caused by the input of external pollutants according to the field investigation the overall concentration of nitrate in karst water is lower than that of fissure water and quaternary groundwater karst waters with a higher pahs concentration show low to moderate nitrate contents the lack of nitrate in carbonate aquifers suggests that it is derived from outside however karst waters with higher pahs concentration are not found in the samples with higher nitrate concentration fig 6e this indicates that agricultural activities considered as the major pollution sources of nitrate in the area are not the main factor for the pahs contamination in karst water several quaternary groundwater are characterized by higher no3 and pahs concentration suggesting the possible pahs pollution of shallow quaternary groundwater by agricultural activities such as irrigation or straw combustion etc 4 4 2 environmental stable isotopes 1 Œ¥d and Œ¥18o stable isotopes oxygen and hydrogen have been widely applied as a natural tracer for providing valuable information on sources pathways and water exchange in groundwater systems clark and fritz 1997 gao et al 2010 binder et al 2019 the relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥d in the liulin karst system was illustrated in fig 7 along with the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥d 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 6 42Œ¥18o 4 66 deng et al 2012 the pahs concentrations of karst water pore water fracture water and surface water were illustrated by the size of the symbols the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d of surface and groundwater in the liulin karst water system mostly fall on or close to the local atmospheric precipitation line indicating that the groundwater and surface water in the study area are mainly supplied by precipitation part of the surface and groundwater are affected by evaporation shifting to the right of the precipitation line the surface water with high pahs content lie near to the evaporation line reflecting the local pollution sources it is also suggested that the leakage of surface water to karst water occurs in the area as basing on the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d scatter map several karst water samples fall into the group of surface water samples suggesting that the leakage of surface water to karst water occurs in the area however river water leakage does not significantly lead to the elevation of pahs concentration in karst water based on the low pahs contents in these samples lower pahs contents were also observed in karst water samples located near the rainfall line indicating the direct input of pahs by rain infiltration into karst aquifers is limited it is interesting to note that karst waters with higher pahs contents are mainly positioned below the surface water evaporation line and keep a distance from the precipitation line the most possible explanation for this deviation is that these karst waters are recharged by the runoff water formed during the rain events under the effect of surface runoff large areas of bared karst stratum in liulin provide convenience for bulk atmospheric pahs entering into karst system through fissures and or fractures on the other hand under the interaction of bared karst rocks with air and water significant oxygen isotopic exchange will take place between runoff water and the strata resulting in the enrichment of 18o in the recharged water hence the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values for these high pahs karst groundwater slightly shift from meteoric water line without an intense evaporation process 2 87sr 86sr the 87sr 86sr value in groundwater mainly depends on the composition of sr isotopes of the aquifers due to that the fractionation of strontium sr isotope is not significant in low temperature geochemical process of groundwater wang et al 2006 frost et al 2015 thus sr isotope is widely used in understanding the water rock interaction processes and tracing karst water recharge sources in this study variations of sr and pahs concentrations with 87sr 86sr were discussed to further determine the pollution path of pahs in liulin karst water system surface waters mostly have higher 87sr 86sr values of 0 712 0 725 and lower to moderate high sr contents 0 156 mg l 0 688 mg l in the study area fig 8 most of the karst waters have a lower to moderate high 87sr 86sr values with relatively higher sr contents than surface waters previous studies have shown that the average 87sr 86sr value of land based silicate is 0 720 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 while the value of 87sr 86sr of limestone and dolomite is about 0 707 and 0 711 respectively laffoon et al 2012 gaillardet et al 2014 according to the 87sr 86sr and sr concentration scatter map fig 8 the karst waters in the study area can be divided into two subgroups in group i karst waters are located near the karst water surface water mixing line illustrated the potential effect of river water leakage in this group most of the karst waters show low pahs contents suggesting that river water leakage is not the main pathway for karst water pahs pollution karst waters in group ii normally stay away from the karst water surface water mixing line with moderate high 87sr 86sr ratios ca 0 7135 and high pahs concentration this is consistent with the hypothesis above that under the influence of surface runoff a large amount of atmospheric sourced pahs by dry and wet deposition may enter the aquifers through the karst fissures in brief based on the hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes investigation it is demonstrated that surface runoff infiltration is the main pathway of pahs pollution in karst water in the study area fig 9 river water leakage may partly contribute to the pahs contamination in some karst and pore waters 5 conclusions this research investigated the concentration distribution sources and pollution paths of pahs in karst water in liulin karst water system northern china it is generally assumed that the deterioration of karst groundwater quality in northern china is mainly caused by the river leakage recharging through our research we found that although the organic contamination in groundwater specifically for pahs pollution will certainly be affected by surface water leakage but it s not the main pollution path in this study hydrochemistry environmental isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr and characteristic ratios were employed together to identify the pollution paths of pahs in karst water the main conclusions are 1 the total concentration of pahs ranged from 39 25 ng l to 16 830 ng l in groundwater with nap as the predominant component and the value increased gradually along the flow path on the whole the highest pahs concentrations in karst water were mainly observed in the coal mining areas and the discharge areas 2 the pahs mainly coming from the locally incomplete combustion of wood fossil fuels and coal based on the fla fla pyr inp inp bghip and baa chr ratios the hydrochemistry Œ¥d and Œ¥18o isotopes and 87sr 86sr value suggested that the pahs in karst water mainly come from the infiltration of runoff water in the bared karst areas small partials from the river water leakage to our knowledge our work is the first effort to using hydrochemistry stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr to analyze the pahs behavior in karst water it provides a new technical method to trace the sources and identify the pollution paths of organic contamination in a karst water system in addition it is necessary to further strengthen the monitoring and investigation in karst area for better understanding the characteristics of organic pollution

1414,karst water with constituting major sources for water supply worldwide is vulnerable and prone to be polluted in this study it is reported that karst water polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs pollution is caused by the infiltration of surface runoff in the bared carbonate areas which is of universal significance for the protection of groundwater resources in karst region hydro geochemistry stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr and characteristic ratio method were conducted together to illustrate the concentration distribution sources and pollution path of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater in the liulin karst water system of northern china the results showed that total concentration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ranged from 39 25 to 16 830 ng l in groundwater with naphthalene being the dominant component and the median value increased gradually along the flow path the highest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentrations in karst water were mainly observed in the coal mining and the discharge areas based on the characteristic ratios the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the study area mainly come from local incomplete combustion of woods fossil fuels coal and liquid fuels the slight shift of Œ¥d and Œ¥18o and moderate 87sr 86sr ratios suggest that the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in karst water is mainly polluted by surface runoff during rain events in the bared karst region the leakage of river water may partly contribute to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in some karst water which normally located close to the

pahs in groundwater in discharge area were 15 273 ng l 7047 ng l and 2104 ng l respectively it can be seen that the median content of pahs in groundwater shows an increasing trend along the flow path the contents of pahs in surface water varied greatly from 59 8 ng l to 127 696 ng l with the mean value of 21 164 ng l the contents of 16 pahs components in the fracture water fw pore water pw karst water kw and surface water sw were statistically analyzed fig 2 it is observed that naphthalene nap was the dominant pahs in the water body in the study area with higher contents in most of karst water average value of 3981 ng l other pahs in karst water were between 0 7 ng l 34 9 ng l among them the contents of fluorene flu phenanthrene phe and benzo b fluoranthene bbf were moderate high 19 2 ng l 34 9 ng l while anthracene ant chrysene chr indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene inp dibenzo a h anthracene dia benzo ghi perylene bghip contents were low 3 ng l pore waters were characterized by moderately higher contents of flu phe bbf and benzo k fluoranthene bkf 15 3 ng l 36 4 ng l and lower values of acenaphthylene acy ant inp dia bghip 3 ng l the average content of nap in fissure groundwater was 1727 ng l and other pahs ranged between 2 2 ng l and 50 2 ng l with the lowest contents of pahs found in ant inp and dia 5 ng l the highest contents of nap were observed in surface water with the average value of 20 944 ng l and the contents of acenaphthene ace flu phe ant and fluoranthene fla were higher than 40 ng l 4 2 spatial distribution of pahs 4 2 1 distribution in surface water the pahs concentrations were relatively high in sanchuan river and its three main tributariers beichuan river dongchuan river and nanchuan river table s1 fig 3 higher contents of pahs were observed in the upstream of beichuan river and dongchuan river where population are concentrated with the fast urbanization emission of the vehicles and petrol stations could yield pahs pollution to air soil and the river larsen and baker 2003 wang et al 2017 wei et al 2015 therefore urbanization related to anthropogenic activities is the main factor for pahs pollution in these areas the content of pahs in nanchuan river was the lowest and showed a gradual increase trend from upstream to downstream further indicating the potential impact of big towns urbanization on river water pahs pollution 4 2 2 distribution in groundwater the variations of pahs concentration along the groundwater flow path from mafang town to the liulin spring groups were drawn to illustrate the spatial distribution of pahs in karst water fig 4 in the northern recharge area the water bearing stratum is basically metamorphic rock two fracture water samples in mafang and fangshan town were used for representation along the flow path karst groundwater pahs rose sharply when flowing through the coal mining area dawu town and the town area with heavy population liuling town this indicated that the pahs in karst water were likely to come from the local contamination such as coal combustion or traffic gas emission the outcrop strata are mainly ordovician and quaternary covered by clastic rocks and coal seams around dawu town where a large number of coal mining industries bloom it is well known that coal mining and the incomplete combustion of coke and coal will produce pahs rich contaminants lee et al 2005 liu et al 2009 huang et al 2014 buha markovi et al 2020 hence it is reasonable to infer that the abnormally high content of pahs in karst water is related to the local coalmines in the area when the karst water is blocked by the impermeable rocks at the discharge area and eventually turns into a group of karst springs in sanchuan river the groundwater depth is getting shallower due to the increase of population and improvement of social development in the big towns in the discharge area groundwater is easy to be polluted by vehicle emissions fuel combustion and increasing petroleum stations etc therefore urbanization is another major factor responsible for the pollution of pahs in karst water in the area 4 3 source analysis of pahs the sources of pahs are mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels grass woods and the discharge of crude oil related material guo et al 2007 hu et al 2013 ozaki et al 2020 to distinguish the possible sources among them the characteristic ratio method has been proved to be an effective way olivella et al 2006 tan et al 2011 as isomer compounds often have similar thermodynamic distribution coefficients and dynamic mass transfer coefficients the content ratios of individual pahs components like fla pyr pyrene and benzo a anthracene baa chr are widely used kannan et al 2005 jiao et al 2012 the identification standards of the relationship between the ratios and the sources are given in fig 5 yunker et al 2002 to identify the sources of pahs in the liulin karst water system inp inp bghip and baa baa chr versus fla fla pyr scatter map were plotted in fig 5 the fla fla pyr ratio of karst water is mostly greater than 0 5 in the study area indicating that the pahs is sourcing from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels meanwhile the inp inp bghip ratio of karst water is between 0 2 and 0 5 which suggest that karst water may receive pahs from mixed sources combustion and petroleum the ratio of baa chr is generally used as an indicator to judge the atmospheric transportation distance of pahs a small baa chr ratio indicates that pahs are migrated over long distances to contaminated sites wang et al 2012 wiriya et al 2013 conversely a larger baa chr ratio indicates a greater proportion of pahs from local sources as response to the less volatile advantage of baa it can be seen from the plot baa baa chr versus fla fla pyr that the content of non volatile baa in karst groundwater is higher than that of chr baa baa chr 0 5 illustrating that the pahs mainly come from the local pollution sources 4 4 pollution path identification 4 4 1 hydrogeochemistry scatter diagrams of pahs concentration with ph do hco3 ca2 no3 and cl are shown in fig 6 studies have shown that under neutral conditions limestone has the largest adsorption capacity for phe shao et al 2014b which means a lower pahs concentration is expectable in karst water with ph of 6 5 7 5 however karst water with higher pahs concentration has the ph values around 7 5 fig 6a indicating that ph may not be the most pivotal factors for the distribution of pahs in karst water the relationship between pahs concentration versus hco3 and ca2 contents fig 6b and c give us clues that the dissolution precipitation of carbonate may play an important role in the mobilization of pahs in karst water it is noticed that bicarbonate and calcium contents are positively related with the pahs concentration at lower hco3 and ca2 values as we all know that the increased hco3 and ca2 concentration stands for the strengthening of karstification and dissolution of calcite dolomite batch adsorption experiment conducted by shao et al 2014b show that the dissolution of limestone leads to the elevation of phe concentration in aqueous solution it is possible that the dissolution of carbonates causes the reduction of the sorption sites releasing more pahs into karst water the decrease of pahs concentration with the further increase of hco3 and ca2 contents may be due to the secondary precipitation of calcite and enhanced adsorption ability it is also found that higher pahs concentration mostly present in karst water samples with higher values of dissolved oxygen do fig 6d this further confirmed that the pahs in groundwater mainly come from the input of outdoor environment groundwater with higher pahs concentration normally has a moderate cl concentration fig 6f generally low chloride concentration exist in carbonate aquifers the elevated cl concentration supports the hypothesis that the pahs in groundwater is caused by the input of external pollutants according to the field investigation the overall concentration of nitrate in karst water is lower than that of fissure water and quaternary groundwater karst waters with a higher pahs concentration show low to moderate nitrate contents the lack of nitrate in carbonate aquifers suggests that it is derived from outside however karst waters with higher pahs concentration are not found in the samples with higher nitrate concentration fig 6e this indicates that agricultural activities considered as the major pollution sources of nitrate in the area are not the main factor for the pahs contamination in karst water several quaternary groundwater are characterized by higher no3 and pahs concentration suggesting the possible pahs pollution of shallow quaternary groundwater by agricultural activities such as irrigation or straw combustion etc 4 4 2 environmental stable isotopes 1 Œ¥d and Œ¥18o stable isotopes oxygen and hydrogen have been widely applied as a natural tracer for providing valuable information on sources pathways and water exchange in groundwater systems clark and fritz 1997 gao et al 2010 binder et al 2019 the relationship between Œ¥18o and Œ¥d in the liulin karst system was illustrated in fig 7 along with the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥d 8Œ¥18o 10 craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl Œ¥d 6 42Œ¥18o 4 66 deng et al 2012 the pahs concentrations of karst water pore water fracture water and surface water were illustrated by the size of the symbols the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d of surface and groundwater in the liulin karst water system mostly fall on or close to the local atmospheric precipitation line indicating that the groundwater and surface water in the study area are mainly supplied by precipitation part of the surface and groundwater are affected by evaporation shifting to the right of the precipitation line the surface water with high pahs content lie near to the evaporation line reflecting the local pollution sources it is also suggested that the leakage of surface water to karst water occurs in the area as basing on the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d scatter map several karst water samples fall into the group of surface water samples suggesting that the leakage of surface water to karst water occurs in the area however river water leakage does not significantly lead to the elevation of pahs concentration in karst water based on the low pahs contents in these samples lower pahs contents were also observed in karst water samples located near the rainfall line indicating the direct input of pahs by rain infiltration into karst aquifers is limited it is interesting to note that karst waters with higher pahs contents are mainly positioned below the surface water evaporation line and keep a distance from the precipitation line the most possible explanation for this deviation is that these karst waters are recharged by the runoff water formed during the rain events under the effect of surface runoff large areas of bared karst stratum in liulin provide convenience for bulk atmospheric pahs entering into karst system through fissures and or fractures on the other hand under the interaction of bared karst rocks with air and water significant oxygen isotopic exchange will take place between runoff water and the strata resulting in the enrichment of 18o in the recharged water hence the Œ¥18o and Œ¥d values for these high pahs karst groundwater slightly shift from meteoric water line without an intense evaporation process 2 87sr 86sr the 87sr 86sr value in groundwater mainly depends on the composition of sr isotopes of the aquifers due to that the fractionation of strontium sr isotope is not significant in low temperature geochemical process of groundwater wang et al 2006 frost et al 2015 thus sr isotope is widely used in understanding the water rock interaction processes and tracing karst water recharge sources in this study variations of sr and pahs concentrations with 87sr 86sr were discussed to further determine the pollution path of pahs in liulin karst water system surface waters mostly have higher 87sr 86sr values of 0 712 0 725 and lower to moderate high sr contents 0 156 mg l 0 688 mg l in the study area fig 8 most of the karst waters have a lower to moderate high 87sr 86sr values with relatively higher sr contents than surface waters previous studies have shown that the average 87sr 86sr value of land based silicate is 0 720 goldstein and jacobsen 1988 while the value of 87sr 86sr of limestone and dolomite is about 0 707 and 0 711 respectively laffoon et al 2012 gaillardet et al 2014 according to the 87sr 86sr and sr concentration scatter map fig 8 the karst waters in the study area can be divided into two subgroups in group i karst waters are located near the karst water surface water mixing line illustrated the potential effect of river water leakage in this group most of the karst waters show low pahs contents suggesting that river water leakage is not the main pathway for karst water pahs pollution karst waters in group ii normally stay away from the karst water surface water mixing line with moderate high 87sr 86sr ratios ca 0 7135 and high pahs concentration this is consistent with the hypothesis above that under the influence of surface runoff a large amount of atmospheric sourced pahs by dry and wet deposition may enter the aquifers through the karst fissures in brief based on the hydrogeochemistry and stable isotopes investigation it is demonstrated that surface runoff infiltration is the main pathway of pahs pollution in karst water in the study area fig 9 river water leakage may partly contribute to the pahs contamination in some karst and pore waters 5 conclusions this research investigated the concentration distribution sources and pollution paths of pahs in karst water in liulin karst water system northern china it is generally assumed that the deterioration of karst groundwater quality in northern china is mainly caused by the river leakage recharging through our research we found that although the organic contamination in groundwater specifically for pahs pollution will certainly be affected by surface water leakage but it s not the main pollution path in this study hydrochemistry environmental isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr and characteristic ratios were employed together to identify the pollution paths of pahs in karst water the main conclusions are 1 the total concentration of pahs ranged from 39 25 ng l to 16 830 ng l in groundwater with nap as the predominant component and the value increased gradually along the flow path on the whole the highest pahs concentrations in karst water were mainly observed in the coal mining areas and the discharge areas 2 the pahs mainly coming from the locally incomplete combustion of wood fossil fuels and coal based on the fla fla pyr inp inp bghip and baa chr ratios the hydrochemistry Œ¥d and Œ¥18o isotopes and 87sr 86sr value suggested that the pahs in karst water mainly come from the infiltration of runoff water in the bared karst areas small partials from the river water leakage to our knowledge our work is the first effort to using hydrochemistry stable isotopes Œ¥d Œ¥18o and 87sr 86sr to analyze the pahs behavior in karst water it provides a new technical method to trace the sources and identify the pollution paths of organic contamination in a karst water system in addition it is necessary to further strengthen the monitoring and investigation in karst area for better understanding the characteristics of organic pollution
