5965,land surface processes considerably influence the global weather and climate patterns which makes its quantification significant to scientists hydrologists as well as policymakers alike considering the lack of available in situ measurement retrieval of the land surface fluxes mostly relies on remotely sensed satellite retrieval and through simulations from land surface models lsms hence it is essential to quantify the uncertainties present in the output of these land surface models which are mainly due to errors in forcing data model parameters and model structure precipitation is one of the key input forcing data used in lsms with the advancement of remote sensing techniques multiple sources of precipitation products are made available to the user community this study examines the effect of precipitation uncertainty in lsm simulated soil moisture for this study four precipitation products are used namely tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt v7 global data assimilation system gdas climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations chirps and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep these data products are used as meteorological forcing in noah 3 6 lsm for the simulation of soil moisture the uncertainty inherent in the precipitation products are examined using two approaches a by evaluating the precipitation products against the gridded india meteorological department imd precipitation dataset and b by using the precipitation products for simulating soil moisture outputs these were validated over the indian subcontinent using validation data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture and central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn dataset for the years 2010 to 2012 the study utilizes various graphical as well as quantitative evaluation methods to determine the best performing precipitation product our study indicates that the simulated soil moisture forced with gdas and mswep precipitation product performed consistently superior among all the other simulation outputs over india keywords noah land surface model soil moisture simulation precipitation uncertainty 1 introduction land surface states play a crucial role in understanding the complex land atmosphere interactions which affect climate recently the predictability of these land surface states and related key variables like soil moisture have generated increased scientific focus mainly as soil properties like soil moisture and temperature strongly influence the atmospheric boundary layer sud et al 1988 beljaars et al 1996 fischer et al 2007 having significant influence on various land atmosphere exchanges regional and global weather prediction betts et al 1996 chen and dudhia 2001 entekhabi et al 1996 hipps and swiatek 1994 patil et al 2011 sahoo et al 2008 sridhar et al 2002 it is also considered as one of the most influential parameters for accurate flood warning systems based on rainfall thresholds martina et al 2005 carpenter et al 1999 the predictability of antecedent soil moisture can strongly influence the regional weather forecasting scenario which heavily relies on the initial and boundary conditions of the land surface koster and suarez 1992 papadopoulos et al 2008 land surface models lsms forced with in situ or satellite based data are presently the primary tools for the estimation of land surface parameters which are used to initialize weather and regional climate models serpetzoglou 2010 the unavailability of direct observations to quantify heterogeneous variables like soil moisture makes the lsm simulations to be more prominent in hydrology along with the widespread acceptance of lsm simulations it has also been realized that they suffer from several uncertainties gupta and nearing 2014 serpetzoglou 2010 su et al 2010 maggioni et al 2012 dumedah and walker 2014 nearing et al 2016 the lsm uncertainty can stem from atmospheric forcing data model parameters and model physics decharme and douville 2006 nair and indu 2016 nair and indu 2017 nair and indu 2018 studies evaluating uncertainty from lsm simulations argue that precipitation plays a significant role in the overall uncertainty of these models gottschalck et al 2005 peters lidard et al 2008 zhou 2012 satellite based precipitation is inherent with errors of complex natures at high spatiotemporal scales hossain and anagnostou 2005a and when propagated through lsm they can influence the nonlinear land atmosphere interaction processes by affecting the soil moisture prediction recently satellite based precipitation products have been under scrutiny for their potential as meteorological forcing in lsms as well as many scientific investigations and applications hong et al 2006 artan et al 2007 shrestha et al 2008 su et al 2008 pan et al 2010 su et al 2011 wu et al 2012 precipitation uncertainty analyses often involve either simple error source description or complex techniques of quantification indu and kumar 2015 ganesh et al 2019 either way a detailed estimation of precipitation forcing uncertainty is a complex problem requiring statistical information huffman et al 1997 hossain and anagnostou 2005a conducted one of the first studies on the effect of precipitation and modeling uncertainties in predicting lsm soil moisture they conducted ensemble based techniques to characterize the error that propagated in satellite rainfall estimates their results concluded that the contribution of precipitation error was between 20 and 60 of the total uncertainty in soil moisture prediction gottschalck et al 2005 compared the effect of forcing gldas simulations using precipitation estimates from satellite model and ground based sources they concluded that the gldas land surface states are affected by precipitation estimates from different sources serpetzoglou 2010 have studied the error propagation of two sbr products trmm and cmorph in simulating soil moisture using community land model clm 3 5 in the oklahoma state they found that the contribution of rainfall forcing error can be lower when the model s efficiency skill is relatively low most of these studies have been conducted primarily over the continental united states maggioni et al 2012 have investigated soil moisture prediction uncertainty associated solely with the rainfall forcing data they have also studied the effect of precipitation forcing error using nasa catchment land surface model clsm over the oklahoma region maggioni et al 2013 this work is presented from the perspective of investigating the suitability of various precipitation products as lsm input forcing and examines the error propagation over the indian sub continent the study focuses on four different precipitation datasets a satellite only based product trmm two multi source precipitation products chirps and mswep and a modeled precipitation product gdas each having a different level of uncertainty within them this study aims to compute the simulated soil moisture utilizing noah lsm 3 6 by using these precipitation datasets as meteorological input for the lsm and the results are compared with validation datasets over the indian subcontinent the remainder of this paper is organized as

configuration for soil temperature and moisture as compared to two layers in its predecessor these models rely on richard s equation to compute soil moisture in the unsaturated zone furthermore the model is coupled to a diurnally dependent penman potential evaporation approach mahrt and ek 1984 and primitive canopy model of pan and mahrt 1987 the unified version of noah lsm has been implemented

soil moisture data used in order to evaluate the soil moisture output from noah 3 6 lsm two soil moisture datasets have been used as a reference one is the quasi global gridded dataset from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci and next is the point based database at the tibetan plateau i e the central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn 2 4 1 european space agency climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture the esa cci soil moisture dataset was first released in 2012 by the european space agency under the program of climate change initiative dorigo et al 2017 its dataset is available from 1958 to 2015 the esa cci soil moisture project was initialized in order to satisfy soil monitoring needs to support climate research which normally requires consistent decadal datasets for 30 years or more since individual satellite missions fail to achieve this criterion the esa cci mission merges several single sensor soil moisture products to provide a dataset at greater and comprehensive spatial and temporal scales various level 2 active and passive satellite products are rescaled and merged into a combined active plus passive product based on their level of uncertainty it uses a weighted merging scheme based on the signal to noise ratio of the input dataset the various active and passive sensors used by the esa cci includes european remote sensing ers 1 2 ers 2 bartalis and scipal 2005 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr gloersen and barath 1977 special sensor microwave imager ssm i hollinger et al 1987 trmm microwave imager tmi kummerow et al 1998 windsat gaiser et al 2004 advanced scatterometer ascat naeimi et al 2009 advanced microwave scanning radiometer for earth observing satellite eos amsr e kawanishi et al 2003 amsr2 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2012 the dataset is provided in daily timescale at 0 25 degree resolution which is sensitive to surface soil moisture soil depth 2 cm to 5 cm many studies have been performed using esa cci soil moisture as a reference dataset to validate outputs from various models ghosh et al 2016 mao et al 2017 mishra et al 2014 parr et al 2015 spennemann et al 2015 szczypta et al 2014 in the present study the esa cci version 4 2 daily dataset of 0 25 0 25 grid size has been used as a reference dataset for the performance evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs throughout the study region it has been made available for download for the website http www esa soilmoisture cci org node 145 2 4 2 central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn the ctp smtmn network lies in the central tibetan plateau and has 58 in situ stations yang et al 2013 the sensors used in these stations have been calibrated considering the soil texture and soil organic carbon content the stations are scattered in three spatial scales of 0 1 0 3 and 1 degree resolution and for four soil depths ranging from 0 to 5 10 20 and 40 cm for validation only first layer 0 5 is considered from the four layers in order to represent the surface moisture the data of soil moisture and soil temperature is provided by data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences and is made available from the site http dam itpcas ac cn rs q data having an accuracy of 1 c and 3 by volumetric water content respectively the ctp smtmn daily soil moisture dataset has been used as a reference dataset for the validation of simulated soil moisture outputs at the tibetan plateau from noah 3 6 lsm using the aforementioned precipitation products as input forcing 2 5 experimental setup the present study relies on version 3 6 of offline noah lsm to access the impact of precipitation uncertainty on model simulations over the indian subcontinent as shown in fig 1 in order to initialize the offline lsm a multi year spin up loop approach is adopted following nair and indu 2016 2018 2019 during the spin up process the model adjusts its energy and water balance states from the uniform random initial conditions to an equilibrium state yang et al 1995 depending on the models spin up time can be from only a few hours for a mesoscale weather numerical model up to a couple of years for a land surface model regarding soil moisture yang uddstrom and duncan 2011 the spin up for this study was performed for the year 2008 to 2010 and the loop was continued until the deviation of soil moisture values between the last two runs was less than 5 in order to meet this criterion the model was run in 7 loops i e a total of 21 years during this process the spatially varying model initial condition for surface water and energy condition is set the initial condition of an lsm depends upon its physics koster and milly 1997 since the model climatology is not exactly similar to the natural behavior of the earth the initial conditions are not true states rodell et al 2004 therefore during the spinup run the initial states are generated with stable lsm simulations from a forcing dataset in our study we generate this initial condition by using gdas forcing for the spinup of 21 years the initialized noah model is then used for a simulation experiment from 2008 to 2012 with all the input data tables 1 and 2 for the noah lsm the multiple simulation scenarios have been tailored to evaluate the variation in lsm estimates due to precipitation uncertainty for four different precipitation products as shown in the methodology flowchart fig 2 in this method the first simulation is performed using imd precipitation as forcing the states from these simulations are considered as a reference for evaluation further the model was run separately using four different precipitation products namely gdas tmpa 3b42rt v7 hereafter will be refered as trmm chirps and mswep as input forcing and keeping all the other input parameters and variables the same the results from first two years 2008 2009 are not used for analysis in order to attain a stable model and forcing climatology for the individual precipitation forcing products with this simulation setup precipitation is the only factor responsible for the variation in lsm simulated soil moisture the point to be noted here is that the ref simulation is performed only for india as imd precipitation is available for india only hence in addition to using ref for validation of simulations we use esa cci soil moisture as a reference to evaluate the complete domain it is to be noted that the initial spinup is performed only using gdas precipitation forcing as for each scenario the other near surface atmospheric forcing i e air temperature specific humidity incident radiations wind etc except rainfall stems from gdas therefore the initial states from gdas spinup run 21 years represents the optimum boundary condition for all runs in order to address changes in the climatology of different precipitation forcing the initial two years 2008 2009 are used to attain a stable condition as the analysis is carried on the surface soil moisture the two years of spinup is more reliable for a stable surface soil condition nair and indu 2016 rodell et al 2004 it should be noted that the three years of validation 2010 to 2012 has been thoughtfully selected by considering the overlap between precipitation products and validation dataset ismn data over tibet is available from 2010 to 2012 in the public domain the relatively shorter validation period 5 years has been efficiently used for precipitation uncertainty related studies khan and maggioni 2019 dinku et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 maggioni et al 2011 hossain and anagnostou 2005b 2 6 performance analysis variation in precipitation has an immediate and direct impact on surface soil moisture which is represented by the first 10 cm layer of noah lsm nair and indu 2019 the deeper layers are also affected from precipitation but it has a longer lag time as compared with the surface layer therefore for our study the surface soil moisture is only considered for further evaluation as discussed in the previous section 2 4 1 the esa cci soil moisture is estimated from low frequency passive microwave observations hence these products are sensitive to the surface layer depth 2 cm to 5 cm however for validation we have not changed the depth of esa soil moisture because of the following factors a the soil moisture estimates from noah model has minimal impact on changing its first layer to 5 cm from 10 cm nair and indu 2019 b as the products are used for intercomparison variation in depths will be reflected in all measurements therefore only the surface soil moisture from products are evaluated without any conversion for validation various performance metrics including bias root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient as well as several categorical metrics based on contingency table table 3 has been utilized for the study to analyze the performance of the four precipitation products and the simulated soil moisture outputs the performance indices used in the present study are summarized in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of precipitation products over india the precipitation products are first validated using imd precipitation as reference fig 3 depicts the rmse of precipitation products with respect to imd the precipitation from trmm fig 3 b indicates the highest rmse amongst the four products the mswep has the best overall pattern with low rmse over the majority of the regions fig 3b which is followed by gdas fig 3 a which performs best over the western ghats with the lowest rmse in terms of correlation with the imd precipitation gdas fig 4 a shows the best overall performance with high correlation in the majority of the regions which is followed by mswep and chirps the trmm precipitation shows low correlation with respect to imd precipitation fig 4b table 5 summarizes the spatial average of rmse and correlation from this it is evident that mswep has the lowest rmse while gdas has the highest correlation over the study region during the study period figs 5 7 show the spatial plot of various performance metrics for gdas trmm chirps and mswep precipitation products against the imd reference precipitation the plots depict results for the monsoon period i e june july august and september for the years of 2010 2011 and 2012 plots a d g j of fig 5 shows the bias with respect to the imd precipitation the spatial plots show gdas as having a relatively high bias compared to other products especially over the northern side of maharashtra and madhya pradesh the data products were found to be overestimating the precipitation throughout the study area except for the topmost regions of northern india as well as southern india the mswep data was found to be underestimated in most of the regions plots b e h k of fig 5 show the pod and plots c f i l show the vhi distribution over the study area with respect to the imd precipitation here the best performance is shown by gdas and worst by trmm plots a d g j of the fig 6 show the spatial distribution of far and plots b e h k show the vfar over the monsoon period of 2010 2012 for the four products against the imd precipitation dataset the gdas precipitation product was seen to perform superior to the other products over india in reference to various performance indices plots c f i l of fig 7 show the spatial distribution of categorical miss for the four products against imd precipitation here the mswep product was observed to perform poorly especially over the northern part of india as well as the mid southern regions the poor performance by all the products over the northern and north western region of india can be attributed to the low number of rain gauge stations available as compared to other regions in the imd dataset the result also matches with the study by prakash et al 2016 which also showed poor performance by tmpa 3b42rt over the southern peninsular region as well as the northwestern region plots a d g j of fig 7 show the vmi distribution over the study area with respect to the imd precipitation similar to categorical miss the trmm precipitation is observed to show the worst performance with gdas product displaying the best plots b e h k and c f i l of fig 7 show the spatial distribution of csi and vcsi over the study region for the four selected precipitation products respectively the gdas precipitation product was observed to consistently depict superior performance than the chirps mswep and tmpa 3b42rt funk et al 2015 stated that chirps dataset was found to have higher correlation and less bias as compared to trmm when validated over africa usa and also semi globally similarly beck et al 2016 compared mswep precipitation against four different precipitation datasets including tmpa 3b42 and found that mswep gave the highest correlation and least rmse the results from the present study are consistent with these existing studies beck et al 2017 funk et al 2015 which report a comparatively better performance by mswep and chirps product than the tmpa 3b42v7 dataset 3 2 evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs the soil moisture outputs have been simulated for three years i e 2010 2012 over the study region using four different meteorological forcing datasets namely gdas tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep the results are validated using two different products such as the soil moisture from the ref simulation and using esa cci soil moisture the ref is used to validate only the soil moisture over india owing to the availability of imd precipitation over the indian mainland only while for the second set of validation esa cci is used for the complete study domain for validation the esa cci soil moisture has been utilized based on existing studies which have considered esa cci soil moisture as a reference dataset it is known that esa cci has been scaled to the global land data assimilation system gldas model using cdf matching technique rodell et al 2004 however since the forcing data for gldas for esa cci v4 2 is different from the products accessed in this study the results are expected to be unbiased the analysis has been conducted separately for the three years and for the indian summer monsoonal period i e june july august and september 3 2 1 validation of simulated soil moisture products with imd based ref simulation relative bias represents the bias in simulated soil moisture with respect to reference soil moisture from ref simulation in percentage in order to understand the effect of precipitation uncertainty on soil moisture we compare the relative bias in precipitation and soil moisture during jjas in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 depicts the spatial variability in relative bias for precipitation and soil moisture from gdas and mswep simulations it is clearly seen that during 2010 and 2012 mswep has a low relative bias in precipitation which has resulted in low soil moisture relative bias similarly chirps fig 9 has a high wet bias in the years 2010 and 2012 which has been reflected in wet moisture while trmm fig 9 has a dry bias with respect to imd leading to dry soil moisture states this analysis shows that the overall dry bias in trmm over the majority of the indian region leads to dry soil moisture states while chirps has a wet bias in the majority of the region leading to wet moisture states mswep and gdas have a low bias in terms of precipitation resulting in low soil moisture bias with respect to ref simulations however the point to be noted is the high negative bias in the southeastern coast of tamil nadu by all products this can be attributed to the fact that since this region receives heavy rainfall during the winter rainfall season nair and indu 2017 the monsoon precipitation is being underestimated by all precipitation products it can be observed from these results that approximately a 20 relative bias in precipitation lead to a 8 bias in soil moisture the relative bias between products is further evaluated by classifying soil moisture and precipitation into 8 bins details are provided in table 6 fig 10 shows the density of pixels corresponding to respective soil moisture and precipitation bins it is observed that the majority of the pixels have a relative bias in precipitation between bins 3 5 which results in a high density of pixels having soil moisture between 3 and 4 this indicates that a reliable precipitation product plays a key role in the prediction skill of lsm further to evaluate the performance of products over the entire study domain the simulations are compared with esa cci over the entire study domain 3 2 2 yearly spatial plot of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture fig 11 shows the pixel wise distribution of soil moisture bias over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 the figure depicts the least bias for the gdas data for all the three years the use of tmpa 3b42rt data has resulted in a very high bias especially over the tibetan regions as compared with outputs from other products which depict the limitation of satellite based products over highly snow covered areas the southeastern part of india was observed with high bias during all the simulations overall gdas based output shows the least bias followed by chirps and then mswep data sets the results were prominent especially over the arid and semi arid areas of central and northern india around the borders of madhya pradesh rajasthan and gujarat over the western ghat region gdas is showing slight overestimation whereas all the other products were observed to be underestimating fig 12 shows the pixel wise distribution of soil moisture rmse over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 overall results show that the simulation using gdas precipitation product clearly outperforms all other simulations in all three years the trmm based simulation seem to show the least performance with very high rmse over the northern region of the study area fig 13 depicts the pixel wise distribution of simulated soil moisture correlation coefficient over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 the trmm based simulation displays the least correlation over the tibetan region the semi arid and desert areas of rajasthan and gujarat simulation using gdas precipitation product is consistently depicting superior performance throughout the study region 3 2 3 seasonal spatial plot of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture fig 14 shows the spatial distribution of simulated soil moisture bias over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for the jjas months 2010 2012 it can be seen that the simulation using gdas precipitation product resulted in the least bias in the simulated soil moisture output identical to what could be observed in the yearly evaluation however an extremely high bias was observed for trmm in the yearly simulation output this shows that trmm highly overestimates during the dry periods the tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep based lsm simulation depicts underestimation of soil moisture over the tibetan and western ghats region and overestimation mainly around the eastern ghats gujarat and rajasthan fig 15 shows the spatial distribution of rmse over the indian subcontinent for the jjas months 2010 to 2012 the performance of gdas based simulation seems to be best over the northern and central regions of india with an increased rmse over the southern regions for trmm chirps and mswep the rmse was found to be especially high over northern india and jammu and kashmir overall gdas based simulation was found superior to all other precipitation based outputs the spatial distribution of correlation coefficient over the indian subcontinent for the jjas months 2010 to 2012 have been depicted in fig 16 similar to the plots showing bias and rmse the simulation based on gdas precipitation products is seen to perform in a superior manner the correlation of trmm over the tibetan region is lower than the other products the simulation using chirps and trmm resulted in a significantly lower correlation coefficient over the southernmost part of india as compared to gdas and mswep based soil moisture simulation 3 2 4 time series plot of simulated soil moisture bias from the spatial plots of performance metrics it was observed that there were differences in the performances between yearly and monsoon plots the time series plots shown in fig 17 provides the daily variation of bias for the simulated soil moisture obtained by using gdas trmm chirps and mswep when compared with the reference esa cci soil moisture for the period of 2010 2012 over the entire study region it represents the daily spatial average of the study region it can be seen from fig 17 that trmm is overestimating especially during the post monsoon seasons the mswep based simulation was observed to underestimate during the pre monsoon periods and overestimate during the monsoon and post monsoon months the output from gdas based simulation seemed to slightly underestimate during the pre monsoon and overestimate during the monsoon and post monsoon in all three years 3 2 5 yearly quantitative assessment of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture table 7 displays the overall yearly averaged bias rmse and correlation coefficient of the simulated soil moisture using gdas tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep for the study period of 2010 2012 against the reference esa cci soil moisture from table 7 the bias of gdas based simulation is seen to be the least for 2010 and 2011 with a slight overestimation highest bias is shown by the simulation from trmm the rmse values for gdas based output are the least for all three years followed by mswep and tmpa 3b42rt respectively similarly the correlation coefficient values show gdas as performing the best in terms of overall spatial indices the correlation coefficient for mswep ranges from 0 83 to 0 85 whereas that of tmpa 3b42rt was ranging from 0 58 to 0 80 overall results show that the soil moisture simulation using gdas and mswep precipitation products as input forcing gives the best performance over the indian subcontinent when verified with the esa cci soil moisture dataset among the four cases tmpa 3b42rt which is a purely satellite based precipitation product seems to be performing poorly when used as lsm input forcing from the performance evaluation of precipitation products used in the study as shown in section 3 1 gdas and mswep products have the best overall performance and trmm showed poor performance from the spatial plots of bias rmse and correlation it could be observed that the greatest variation in performance was over the tibetan region mid southern region and around western ghat region of india hence to further validate the results obtained above the soil moisture outputs were compared with the in situ soil moisture dataset available at the tibetan region provided by data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences 3 2 6 evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs against ctp smtmn soil moisture the simulated soil moisture datasets have also been validated over the tibetan plateau region using the in situ soil moisture dataset form the ctp smtmn fig 18 shows the 58 total stations installed for the ctp smtmn overlapping the noah lsm simulation grid used in the present study the 58 ctp smtmn stations have been spread out in three spatial scales i e 0 1 0 3 and 1 as the lsm simulation grid size is 0 25 0 25 a single lsm grid has been taken for comparison covering the region where the 0 1 ctp smtmn stations are spread and have been named grid 1 for further analysis the red box shows the grid 1 in fig 18 the soil moisture values from all the stations lying within the grid 1 has been averaged daily and compared with the different simulated soil moisture outputs for that particular grid from noah lsm simulation using gdas trmm chirps and mswep precipitation products as input forcing to compare the performance of the simulated soil moisture in various scales the next grid has been chosen as the average of 4 lsm simulation grids totaling to a grid size of 0 5 0 5 as depicted by the orange box in fig 18 and named as grid 2 for the further manuscript those 4 grids were particularly chosen as they contained homogeneously spread stations within it as compared to other possible grid combinations as the overall stations are spread over 1 degree resolution the next grid size could have been 1 1 i e by averaging 16 lsm grid outputs however doing so would result in having 4 lsm grids without any in situ station within the grid hence the next grid size has been chosen as 0 75 0 75 by averaging 9 lsm grids and named as grid 3 for further studies performance evaluation has been done for grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 for a temporal scale of yearly and seasonal pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon for the study period of 2010 2012 fig 19 shows the daily simulated soil moisture and its corresponding bias against the ctp smtmn dataset for the year 2010 2012 for grid 1 plots a and b of fig 19 shows the evaluation for the year 2010 as the ctp smtmn dataset is only available from august 2010 the performance evaluation for 2010 has been conducted only since august 2010 it can be seen that all the simulated soil moisture outputs are slightly underestimating from mid pre monsoon to monsoon whereas they are overestimating during mid to late post monsoon period of 2010 and 2011 unlike 2010 and 2011 all simulated outputs were observed to be underestimating the soil moisture during the pre monsoon period as depicted in plots e and f of fig 19 the trmm dataset was found to highly overestimate during the non monsoon period plots a and b of figs 20 and 21 shows results of the comparative evaluation performed for the year 2010 of grid 2 and grid 3 respectively this result has high coherence with the pattern followed by grid1 where all the cases were observed to be underestimating during monsoon and overestimating during non monsoon periods similar results can be observed for plots c and d of figs 20 and 21 respectively for the year 2011 during the monsoon periods gdas based simulation output showed the least amount of underestimation plots e and f of figs 20 and 21 show a comparison for the year 2012 similar to that of grid 1 the simulated outputs are observed to be underestimated during the pre monsoon and during the mid to late monsoon and early post monsoon however the trmm based simulation was observed to overestimate almost throughout the year the gdas based simulation showed the least bias during the pre monsoon the yearly performance evaluation using various performance metrics for grid1 grid 2 and grid 3 from 2010 to 2012 are presented in table 8 table 8 gives the bias rmse and correlation coefficient for the years from 2010 to 2012 respectively for the three grids under consideration from the bias values it can be observed that gdas based simulation has the least bias in 6 out of 9 cases the results from chirps was seen to have the lowest bias for two cases for grid 1 the highest bias was shown by the trmm the rmse value is least for mswep in 7 out of 9 cases with gdas being best for the rest of the cases the results from gdas resulted in a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 84 to 0 94 the results from 3b42rt v7 were showing the least correlation this can be attributed to its high overestimation during the non monsoon periods further a seasonal quantitative assessment is performed in order to understand seasonal changes in sm the performance evaluation has been performed from august of 2010 for the pre monsoon monsoon and monsoon periods individually results for the pre monsoon period as depicted in table 9 show that the gdas based simulation outperforms the other three products with low bias and the highest correlation coefficient ranging from 0 93 to 0 96 simulation based on trmm was observed to depict the highest bias rmse and least correlation coefficient among all the other cases for the pre monsoon period table 10 shows results for the performance evaluation conducted for june july august and september months monsoon respectively for the years 2010 2012 it can be seen that in the monsoon season trmm is also performing well with the least bias and rmse in 6 out of 9 cases and 5 out of 9 cases respectively table 11 shows the bias rmse and correlation coefficient evaluated for october november and december months post monsoon for the years 2010 2012 in the post monsoon case the superior performance was shown by mswep based simulation over the tibetan region with least bias rmse and highest correlation coefficient in 5 out of 9 cases the results based on gdas also shows superior performance with a low rmse and high correlation coefficient in the remaining 4 out of 9 cases from the yearly comparison it is seen that the best performance is shown by mswep followed closely by gdas based simulation output however in the monsoon period trmm seems to be performing better however these results are only based on a small area over the tibetan plateau and may not be an accurate representation for the whole indian subcontinent especially since the tibetan plateau also known as the third pole of the world has significantly different geography elevation range and climatology as compared to other parts of the indian subcontinent hence if a study is based on the tibetan region with a focus mainly on the monsoon period trmm product is seen to provide the best performance for the simulated soil moisture output however it also has very high overestimation during the non monsoon period on the other hand gdas and mswep based lsm simulation is seen to perform reasonably well consistently throughout the year all over the indian subcontinent when evaluated with the esa cci soil moisture with gdas performing better than mswep in most cases hence for studies covering a larger aerial extent than the tibetan region gdas based precipitation product seems to be the most promising precipitation product to be used as meteorological input forcing in noah 3 6 lsm simulation 4 conclusions the uncertainty in four different precipitation products was evaluated over the indian subcontinent along with the evaluation of simulated soil moisture using these products as precipitation forcing in the model run the selected precipitation datasets were first evaluated against the gridded imd dataset for the monsoon period june to september of the years 2010 to 2012 the simulated soil moisture from different precipitation products are first validated with respect to land surface model lsm estimates with imd precipitation forcing called as ref this validation was performed by computing the relative bias between simulation from precipitation products and ref simulation results from this analysis indicate that precipitation plays a key role in the accuracy of the model simulated soil moisture estimates the overall analysis of the results indicates that gdas and mswep precipitation products perform better as lsm forcing over india among the four products considered here particularly the gdas precipitation has good skill over the hilly terrain in the western ghats further the chirps product seemed to outperform trmm which relates to the previous findings by beck et al 2016 and funk et al 2015 evaluation against esa cci depicted consistent superior performance by gdas based simulation with correlation coefficient ranging from 0 94 to 0 95 and poor performance by trmm based simulation with correlation coefficient 0 58 0 79 yearly evaluation against ctp smtmn depicted superior performance by mswep based soil moisture with correlation coefficient 0 91 0 96 and least performance by trmm on a seasonal scale gdas based simulation outputs show superior performance over the other precipitation based simulation during pre monsoon period depicting least bias and rmse in most cases and highest correlation coefficient values ranging from 0 91 to 0 96 over the monsoon period the trmm was found to depict the least bias and rmse the results are consistent with their high overestimation the trmm based simulation was showing the least underestimation with low bias and rmse as compared to other simulated outputs in the post monsoon period mswep based simulation outperforms the others in 5 out of 9 cases and gdas based simulation outperforming in the remaining 4 out of 9 cases overall results are indicative that trmm based output depicts the least performance due to high overestimation of soil moisture during the non rainy periods the model based gdas precipitation product was observed to consistently show superior performance over the study region both in the direct evaluation of precipitation against imd dataset as well as the simulated soil moisture evaluated against the esa cci soil moisture while trmm based output seem to perform poorly the study shows how a model based gdas precipitation outperforms multi sourced chirps and mswep precipitation as well as the satellite based trmm precipitation dataset results from this study will help end users choose the most appropriate precipitation product for conducting lsm related studies

5965,land surface processes considerably influence the global weather and climate patterns which makes its quantification significant to scientists hydrologists as well as policymakers alike considering the lack of available in situ measurement retrieval of the land surface fluxes mostly relies on remotely sensed satellite retrieval and through simulations from land surface models lsms hence it is essential to quantify the uncertainties present in the output of these land surface models which are mainly due to errors in forcing data model parameters and model structure precipitation is one of the key input forcing data used in lsms with the advancement of remote sensing techniques multiple sources of precipitation products are made available to the user community this study examines the effect of precipitation uncertainty in lsm simulated soil moisture for this study four precipitation products are used namely tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa 3b42rt v7 global data assimilation system gdas climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations chirps and multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep these data products are used as meteorological forcing in noah 3 6 lsm for the simulation of soil moisture the uncertainty inherent in the precipitation products are examined using two approaches a by evaluating the precipitation products against the gridded india meteorological department imd precipitation dataset and b by using the precipitation products for simulating soil moisture outputs these were validated over the indian subcontinent using validation data from the european space agency climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture and central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn dataset for the years 2010 to 2012 the study utilizes various graphical as well as quantitative evaluation methods to determine the best performing precipitation product our study indicates that the simulated soil moisture forced with gdas and mswep precipitation product performed consistently superior among all the other simulation outputs over india keywords noah land surface model soil moisture simulation precipitation uncertainty 1 introduction land surface states play a crucial role in understanding the complex land atmosphere interactions which affect climate recently the predictability of these land surface states and related key variables like soil moisture have generated increased scientific focus mainly as soil properties like soil moisture and temperature strongly influence the atmospheric boundary layer sud et al 1988 beljaars et al 1996 fischer et al 2007 having significant influence on various land atmosphere exchanges regional and global weather prediction betts et al 1996 chen and dudhia 2001 entekhabi et al 1996 hipps and swiatek 1994 patil et al 2011 sahoo et al 2008 sridhar et al 2002 it is also considered as one of the most influential parameters for accurate flood warning systems based on rainfall thresholds martina et al 2005 carpenter et al 1999 the predictability of antecedent soil moisture can strongly influence the regional weather forecasting scenario which heavily relies on the initial and boundary conditions of the land surface koster and suarez 1992 papadopoulos et al 2008 land surface models lsms forced with in situ or satellite based data are presently the primary tools for the estimation of land surface parameters which are used to initialize weather and regional climate models serpetzoglou 2010 the unavailability of direct observations to quantify heterogeneous variables like soil moisture makes the lsm simulations to be more prominent in hydrology along with the widespread acceptance of lsm simulations it has also been realized that they suffer from several uncertainties gupta and nearing 2014 serpetzoglou 2010 su et al 2010 maggioni et al 2012 dumedah and walker 2014 nearing et al 2016 the lsm uncertainty can stem from atmospheric forcing data model parameters and model physics decharme and douville 2006 nair and indu 2016 nair and indu 2017 nair and indu 2018 studies evaluating uncertainty from lsm simulations argue that precipitation plays a significant role in the overall uncertainty of these models gottschalck et al 2005 peters lidard et al 2008 zhou 2012 satellite based precipitation is inherent with errors of complex natures at high spatiotemporal scales hossain and anagnostou 2005a and when propagated through lsm they can influence the nonlinear land atmosphere interaction processes by affecting the soil moisture prediction recently satellite based precipitation products have been under scrutiny for their potential as meteorological forcing in lsms as well as many scientific investigations and applications hong et al 2006 artan et al 2007 shrestha et al 2008 su et al 2008 pan et al 2010 su et al 2011 wu et al 2012 precipitation uncertainty analyses often involve either simple error source description or complex techniques of quantification indu and kumar 2015 ganesh et al 2019 either way a detailed estimation of precipitation forcing uncertainty is a complex problem requiring statistical information huffman et al 1997 hossain and anagnostou 2005a conducted one of the first studies on the effect of precipitation and modeling uncertainties in predicting lsm soil moisture they conducted ensemble based techniques to characterize the error that propagated in satellite rainfall estimates their results concluded that the contribution of precipitation error was between 20 and 60 of the total uncertainty in soil moisture prediction gottschalck et al 2005 compared the effect of forcing gldas simulations using precipitation estimates from satellite model and ground based sources they concluded that the gldas land surface states are affected by precipitation estimates from different sources serpetzoglou 2010 have studied the error propagation of two sbr products trmm and cmorph in simulating soil moisture using community land model clm 3 5 in the oklahoma state they found that the contribution of rainfall forcing error can be lower when the model s efficiency skill is relatively low most of these studies have been conducted primarily over the continental united states maggioni et al 2012 have investigated soil moisture prediction uncertainty associated solely with the rainfall forcing data they have also studied the effect of precipitation forcing error using nasa catchment land surface model clsm over the oklahoma region maggioni et al 2013 this work is presented from the perspective of investigating the suitability of various precipitation products as lsm input forcing and examines the error propagation over the indian sub continent the study focuses on four different precipitation datasets a satellite only based product trmm two multi source precipitation products chirps and mswep and a modeled precipitation product gdas each having a different level of uncertainty within them this study aims to compute the simulated soil moisture utilizing noah lsm 3 6 by using these precipitation datasets as meteorological input for the lsm and the results are compared with validation datasets over the indian subcontinent the remainder of this paper is organized as follows details of the noah 3 6 lsm the data used in the study as well as the methodology of the study are described in section 2 the results and discussions are explained in section 3 summary and

soil moisture data used in order to evaluate the soil moisture output from noah 3 6 lsm two soil moisture datasets have been used as a reference one is the quasi global gridded dataset from european space agency climate change initiative esa cci and next is the point based database at the tibetan plateau i e the central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn 2 4 1 european space agency climate change initiative esa cci soil moisture the esa cci soil moisture dataset was first released in 2012 by the european space agency under the program of climate change initiative dorigo et al 2017 its dataset is available from 1958 to 2015 the esa cci soil moisture project was initialized in order to satisfy soil monitoring needs to support climate research which normally requires consistent decadal datasets for 30 years or more since individual satellite missions fail to achieve this criterion the esa cci mission merges several single sensor soil moisture products to provide a dataset at greater and comprehensive spatial and temporal scales various level 2 active and passive satellite products are rescaled and merged into a combined active plus passive product based on their level of uncertainty it uses a weighted merging scheme based on the signal to noise ratio of the input dataset the various active and passive sensors used by the esa cci includes european remote sensing ers 1 2 ers 2 bartalis and scipal 2005 scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr gloersen and barath 1977 special sensor microwave imager ssm i hollinger et al

amsr e kawanishi et al 2003 amsr2 and soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2012 the dataset is provided in daily timescale at 0 25 degree resolution which is sensitive to surface soil moisture soil depth 2 cm to 5 cm many studies have been performed using esa cci soil moisture as a reference dataset to validate outputs from various models ghosh et al 2016 mao et al 2017 mishra et al 2014 parr et al 2015 spennemann et al 2015 szczypta et al 2014 in the present study the esa cci version 4 2 daily dataset of 0 25 0 25 grid size has been used as a reference dataset for the performance evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs throughout the study region it has been made available for download for the website http www esa soilmoisture cci org node 145 2 4 2 central tibetan plateau soil moisture and temperature monitoring network ctp smtmn the ctp smtmn network lies in the central tibetan plateau and has 58 in situ stations yang et al 2013 the sensors used in these stations have been calibrated considering the soil texture and soil organic carbon content the stations are scattered in three spatial scales of 0 1 0 3 and 1 degree resolution and for four soil depths ranging from 0 to 5 10 20 and 40 cm for validation only first layer 0 5 is considered from the four layers in order to represent the surface moisture the data of soil moisture and soil temperature is provided by data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences and is made available from the site http dam itpcas ac cn rs q data having an accuracy of 1 c and 3 by volumetric water content respectively the ctp smtmn daily soil moisture dataset has been used as a reference dataset for the validation of simulated soil moisture outputs at the tibetan plateau from noah 3 6 lsm using the aforementioned precipitation products as input forcing 2 5 experimental setup the present study relies on version 3 6 of offline noah lsm to access the impact of precipitation uncertainty on model simulations over the indian subcontinent as shown in fig 1 in order to initialize the offline lsm a multi year spin up loop approach is adopted following nair and indu 2016 2018 2019 during the spin up process the model adjusts its energy and water balance states from the uniform random initial conditions to an equilibrium state yang et al 1995 depending on the models spin up time can be from only a few hours for a mesoscale weather numerical model up to a couple of years for a land surface model regarding soil moisture yang uddstrom and duncan 2011 the spin up for this study was performed for the year 2008 to 2010 and the loop was continued until the deviation of soil moisture values between the last two runs was less than 5 in order to meet this criterion the model was run in 7 loops i e a total of 21 years during this process the spatially varying model initial condition for surface water and energy condition is set the initial condition of an lsm depends upon its physics koster and milly 1997 since the model climatology is not exactly similar to the natural behavior of the earth the initial conditions are not true states rodell et al 2004 therefore during the spinup run the initial states are generated with stable lsm simulations from a forcing dataset in our study we generate this initial condition by using gdas forcing for the spinup of 21 years the initialized noah model is then used for a simulation experiment from 2008 to 2012 with all the input data tables 1 and 2 for the noah lsm the multiple simulation scenarios have been tailored to evaluate the variation in lsm estimates due to precipitation uncertainty for four different precipitation products as shown in the methodology flowchart fig 2 in this method the first simulation is performed using imd precipitation as forcing the states from these simulations are considered as a reference for evaluation further the model was run separately using four different precipitation products namely gdas tmpa 3b42rt v7 hereafter will be refered as trmm chirps and mswep as input forcing and keeping all the other input parameters and variables the same the results from first two years 2008 2009 are not used for analysis in order to attain a stable model and forcing climatology for the individual precipitation forcing products with this simulation setup precipitation is the only factor responsible for the variation in lsm simulated soil moisture the point to be noted here is that the ref simulation is performed only for india as imd precipitation is available for india only hence in addition to using ref for validation of simulations we use esa cci soil moisture as a reference to evaluate the complete domain it is to be noted that the initial spinup is performed only using gdas precipitation forcing as for each scenario the other near surface atmospheric forcing i e air temperature specific humidity incident radiations wind etc except rainfall stems from gdas therefore the initial states from gdas spinup run 21 years represents the optimum boundary condition for all runs in order to address changes in the climatology of different precipitation forcing the initial two years 2008 2009 are used to attain a stable condition as the analysis is carried on the surface soil moisture the two years of spinup is more reliable for a stable surface soil condition nair and indu 2016 rodell et al 2004 it should be noted that the three years of validation 2010 to 2012 has been thoughtfully selected by considering the overlap between precipitation products and validation dataset ismn data over tibet is available from 2010 to 2012 in the public domain the relatively shorter validation period 5 years has been efficiently used for precipitation uncertainty related studies khan and maggioni 2019 dinku et al 2018 thiemig et al 2012 maggioni et al 2011 hossain and anagnostou 2005b 2 6 performance analysis variation in precipitation has an immediate and direct impact on surface soil moisture which is represented by the first 10 cm layer of noah lsm nair and indu 2019 the deeper layers are also affected from precipitation but it has a longer lag time as compared with the surface layer therefore for our study the surface soil moisture is only considered for further evaluation as discussed in the previous section 2 4 1 the esa cci soil moisture is estimated from low frequency passive microwave observations hence these products are sensitive to the surface layer depth 2 cm to 5 cm however for validation we have not changed the depth of esa soil moisture because of the following factors a the soil moisture estimates from noah model has minimal impact on changing its first layer to 5 cm from 10 cm nair and indu 2019 b as the products are used for intercomparison variation in depths will be reflected in all measurements therefore only the surface soil moisture from products are evaluated without any conversion for validation various performance metrics including bias root mean square error rmse correlation coefficient as well as several categorical metrics based on contingency table table 3 has been utilized for the study to analyze the performance of the four precipitation products and the simulated soil moisture outputs the performance indices used in the present study are summarized in table 4 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of precipitation products over india the precipitation products are first validated using imd precipitation as reference fig 3 depicts the rmse of precipitation products with respect to imd the precipitation from trmm fig 3 b indicates the highest rmse amongst the four products the mswep has the best overall pattern with low rmse over the majority of the regions fig 3b which is followed by gdas fig 3 a which performs best over the western ghats with the lowest rmse in terms of correlation with the imd precipitation gdas fig 4 a shows the best overall performance with high correlation in the majority of the regions which is followed by mswep and chirps the trmm precipitation shows low correlation with respect to imd precipitation fig 4b table 5 summarizes the spatial average of rmse and correlation from this it is evident that mswep has the lowest rmse while gdas has the highest correlation over the study region during the study period figs 5 7 show the spatial plot of various performance metrics for gdas trmm chirps and mswep precipitation products against the imd reference precipitation the plots depict results for the monsoon period i e june july august and september for the years of 2010 2011 and 2012 plots a d g j of fig 5 shows the bias with respect to the imd precipitation the spatial plots show gdas as having a relatively high bias compared to other products especially over the northern side of maharashtra and madhya pradesh the data products were found to be overestimating the precipitation throughout the study area except for the topmost regions of northern india as well as southern india the mswep data was found to be underestimated in most of the regions plots b e h k of fig 5 show the pod and plots c f i l show the vhi distribution over the study area with respect to the imd precipitation here the best performance is shown by gdas and worst by trmm plots a d g j of the fig 6 show the spatial distribution of far and plots b e h k show the vfar over the monsoon period of 2010 2012 for the four products against the imd precipitation dataset the gdas precipitation product was seen to perform superior to the other products over india in reference to various performance indices plots c f i l of fig 7 show the spatial distribution of categorical miss for the four products against imd precipitation here the mswep product was observed to perform poorly especially over the northern part of india as well as the mid southern regions the poor performance by all the products over the northern and north western region of india can be attributed to the low number of rain gauge stations available as compared to other regions in the imd dataset the result also matches with the study by prakash et al 2016 which also showed poor performance by tmpa 3b42rt over the southern peninsular region as well as the northwestern region plots a d g j of fig 7 show the vmi distribution over the study area with respect to the imd precipitation similar to categorical miss the trmm precipitation is observed to show the worst performance with gdas product displaying the best plots b e h k and c f i l of fig 7 show the spatial distribution of csi and vcsi over the study region for the four selected precipitation products respectively the gdas precipitation product was observed to consistently depict superior performance than the chirps mswep and tmpa 3b42rt funk et al 2015 stated that chirps dataset was found to have higher correlation and less bias as compared to trmm when validated over africa usa and also semi globally similarly beck et al 2016 compared mswep precipitation against four different precipitation datasets including tmpa 3b42 and found that mswep gave the highest correlation and least rmse the results from the present study are consistent with these existing studies beck et al 2017 funk et al 2015 which report a comparatively better performance by mswep and chirps product than the tmpa 3b42v7 dataset 3 2 evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs the soil moisture outputs have been simulated for three years i e 2010 2012 over the study region using four different meteorological forcing datasets namely gdas tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep the results are validated using two different products such as the soil moisture from the ref simulation and using esa cci soil moisture the ref is used to validate only the soil moisture over india owing to the availability of imd precipitation over the indian mainland only while for the second set of validation esa cci is used for the complete study domain for validation the esa cci soil moisture has been utilized based on existing studies which have considered esa cci soil moisture as a reference dataset it is known that esa cci has been scaled to the global land data assimilation system gldas model using cdf matching technique rodell et al 2004 however since the forcing data for gldas for esa cci v4 2 is different from the products accessed in this study the results are expected to be unbiased the analysis has been conducted separately for the three years and for the indian summer monsoonal period i e june july august and september 3 2 1 validation of simulated soil moisture products with imd based ref simulation relative bias represents the bias in simulated soil moisture with respect to reference soil moisture from ref simulation in percentage in order to understand the effect of precipitation uncertainty on soil moisture we compare the relative bias in precipitation and soil moisture during jjas in figs 8 and 9 fig 8 depicts the spatial variability in relative bias for precipitation and soil moisture from gdas and mswep simulations it is clearly seen that during 2010 and 2012 mswep has a low relative bias in precipitation which has resulted in low soil moisture relative bias similarly chirps fig 9 has a high wet bias in the years 2010 and 2012 which has been reflected in wet moisture while trmm fig 9 has a dry bias with respect to imd leading to dry soil moisture states this analysis shows that the overall dry bias in trmm over the majority of the indian region leads to dry soil moisture states while chirps has a wet bias in the majority of the region leading to wet moisture states mswep and gdas have a low bias in terms of precipitation resulting in low soil moisture bias with respect to ref simulations however the point to be noted is the high negative bias in the southeastern coast of tamil nadu by all products this can be attributed to the fact that since this region receives heavy rainfall during the winter rainfall season nair and indu 2017 the monsoon precipitation is being underestimated by all precipitation products it can be observed from these results that approximately a 20 relative bias in precipitation lead to a 8 bias in soil moisture the relative bias between products is further evaluated by classifying soil moisture and precipitation into 8 bins details are provided in table 6 fig 10 shows the density of pixels corresponding to respective soil moisture and precipitation bins it is observed that the majority of the pixels have a relative bias in precipitation between bins 3 5 which results in a high density of pixels having soil moisture between 3 and 4 this indicates that a reliable precipitation product plays a key role in the prediction skill of lsm further to evaluate the performance of products over the entire study domain the simulations are compared with esa cci over the entire study domain 3 2 2 yearly spatial plot of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture fig 11 shows the pixel wise distribution of soil moisture bias over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 the figure depicts the least bias for the gdas data for all the three years the use of tmpa 3b42rt data has resulted in a very high bias especially over the tibetan regions as compared with outputs from other products which depict the limitation of satellite based products over highly snow covered areas the southeastern part of india was observed with high bias during all the simulations overall gdas based output shows the least bias followed by chirps and then mswep data sets the results were prominent especially over the arid and semi arid areas of central and northern india around the borders of madhya pradesh rajasthan and gujarat over the western ghat region gdas is showing slight overestimation whereas all the other products were observed to be underestimating fig 12 shows the pixel wise distribution of soil moisture rmse over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 overall results show that the simulation using gdas precipitation product clearly outperforms all other simulations in all three years the trmm based simulation seem to show the least performance with very high rmse over the northern region of the study area fig 13 depicts the pixel wise distribution of simulated soil moisture correlation coefficient over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for 2010 to 2012 the trmm based simulation displays the least correlation over the tibetan region the semi arid and desert areas of rajasthan and gujarat simulation using gdas precipitation product is consistently depicting superior performance throughout the study region 3 2 3 seasonal spatial plot of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture fig 14 shows the spatial distribution of simulated soil moisture bias over the indian subcontinent using the four precipitation products for the jjas months 2010 2012 it can be seen that the simulation using gdas precipitation product resulted in the least bias in the simulated soil moisture output identical to what could be observed in the yearly evaluation however an extremely high bias was observed for trmm in the yearly simulation output this shows that trmm highly overestimates during the dry periods the tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep based lsm simulation depicts underestimation of soil moisture over the tibetan and western ghats region and overestimation mainly around the eastern ghats gujarat and rajasthan fig 15 shows the spatial distribution of rmse over the indian subcontinent for the jjas months 2010 to 2012 the performance of gdas based simulation seems to be best over the northern and central regions of india with an increased rmse over the southern regions for trmm chirps and mswep the rmse was found to be especially high over northern india and jammu and kashmir overall gdas based simulation was found superior to all other precipitation based outputs the spatial distribution of correlation coefficient over the indian subcontinent for the jjas months 2010 to 2012 have been depicted in fig 16 similar to the plots showing bias and rmse the simulation based on gdas precipitation products is seen to perform in a superior manner the correlation of trmm over the tibetan region is lower than the other products the simulation using chirps and trmm resulted in a significantly lower correlation coefficient over the southernmost part of india as compared to gdas and mswep based soil moisture simulation 3 2 4 time series plot of simulated soil moisture bias from the spatial plots of performance metrics it was observed that there were differences in the performances between yearly and monsoon plots the time series plots shown in fig 17 provides the daily variation of bias for the simulated soil moisture obtained by using gdas trmm chirps and mswep when compared with the reference esa cci soil moisture for the period of 2010 2012 over the entire study region it represents the daily spatial average of the study region it can be seen from fig 17 that trmm is overestimating especially during the post monsoon seasons the mswep based simulation was observed to underestimate during the pre monsoon periods and overestimate during the monsoon and post monsoon months the output from gdas based simulation seemed to slightly underestimate during the pre monsoon and overestimate during the monsoon and post monsoon in all three years 3 2 5 yearly quantitative assessment of simulated soil moisture against esa cci soil moisture table 7 displays the overall yearly averaged bias rmse and correlation coefficient of the simulated soil moisture using gdas tmpa 3b42rt chirps and mswep for the study period of 2010 2012 against the reference esa cci soil moisture from table 7 the bias of gdas based simulation is seen to be the least for 2010 and 2011 with a slight overestimation highest bias is shown by the simulation from trmm the rmse values for gdas based output are the least for all three years followed by mswep and tmpa 3b42rt respectively similarly the correlation coefficient values show gdas as performing the best in terms of overall spatial indices the correlation coefficient for mswep ranges from 0 83 to 0 85 whereas that of tmpa 3b42rt was ranging from 0 58 to 0 80 overall results show that the soil moisture simulation using gdas and mswep precipitation products as input forcing gives the best performance over the indian subcontinent when verified with the esa cci soil moisture dataset among the four cases tmpa 3b42rt which is a purely satellite based precipitation product seems to be performing poorly when used as lsm input forcing from the performance evaluation of precipitation products used in the study as shown in section 3 1 gdas and mswep products have the best overall performance and trmm showed poor performance from the spatial plots of bias rmse and correlation it could be observed that the greatest variation in performance was over the tibetan region mid southern region and around western ghat region of india hence to further validate the results obtained above the soil moisture outputs were compared with the in situ soil moisture dataset available at the tibetan region provided by data assimilation and modeling center for tibetan multi spheres institute of tibetan plateau research chinese academy of sciences 3 2 6 evaluation of simulated soil moisture outputs against ctp smtmn soil moisture the simulated soil moisture datasets have also been validated over the tibetan plateau region using the in situ soil moisture dataset form the ctp smtmn fig 18 shows the 58 total stations installed for the ctp smtmn overlapping the noah lsm simulation grid used in the present study the 58 ctp smtmn stations have been spread out in three spatial scales i e 0 1 0 3 and 1 as the lsm simulation grid size is 0 25 0 25 a single lsm grid has been taken for comparison covering the region where the 0 1 ctp smtmn stations are spread and have been named grid 1 for further analysis the red box shows the grid 1 in fig 18 the soil moisture values from all the stations lying within the grid 1 has been averaged daily and compared with the different simulated soil moisture outputs for that particular grid from noah lsm simulation using gdas trmm chirps and mswep precipitation products as input forcing to compare the performance of the simulated soil moisture in various scales the next grid has been chosen as the average of 4 lsm simulation grids totaling to a grid size of 0 5 0 5 as depicted by the orange box in fig 18 and named as grid 2 for the further manuscript those 4 grids were particularly chosen as they contained homogeneously spread stations within it as compared to other possible grid combinations as the overall stations are spread over 1 degree resolution the next grid size could have been 1 1 i e by averaging 16 lsm grid outputs however doing so would result in having 4 lsm grids without any in situ station within the grid hence the next grid size has been chosen as 0 75 0 75 by averaging 9 lsm grids and named as grid 3 for further studies performance evaluation has been done for grid 1 grid 2 and grid 3 for a temporal scale of yearly and seasonal pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon for the study period of 2010 2012 fig 19 shows the daily simulated soil moisture and its corresponding bias against the ctp smtmn dataset for the year 2010 2012 for grid 1 plots a and b of fig 19 shows the evaluation for the year 2010 as the ctp smtmn dataset is only available from august 2010 the performance evaluation for 2010 has been conducted only since august 2010 it can be seen that all the simulated soil moisture outputs are slightly underestimating from mid pre monsoon to monsoon whereas they are overestimating during mid to late post monsoon period of 2010 and 2011 unlike 2010 and 2011 all simulated outputs were observed to be underestimating the soil moisture during the pre monsoon period as depicted in plots e and f of fig 19 the trmm dataset was found to highly overestimate during the non monsoon period plots a and b of figs 20 and 21 shows results of the comparative evaluation performed for the year 2010 of grid 2 and grid 3 respectively this result has high coherence with the pattern followed by grid1 where all the cases were observed to be underestimating during monsoon and overestimating during non monsoon periods similar results can be observed for plots c and d of figs 20 and 21 respectively for the year 2011 during the monsoon periods gdas based simulation output showed the least amount of underestimation plots e and f of figs 20 and 21 show a comparison for the year 2012 similar to that of grid 1 the simulated outputs are observed to be underestimated during the pre monsoon and during the mid to late monsoon and early post monsoon however the trmm based simulation was observed to overestimate almost throughout the year the gdas based simulation showed the least bias during the pre monsoon the yearly performance evaluation using various performance metrics for grid1 grid 2 and grid 3 from 2010 to 2012 are presented in table 8 table 8 gives the bias rmse and correlation coefficient for the years from 2010 to 2012 respectively for the three grids under consideration from the bias values it can be observed that gdas based simulation has the least bias in 6 out of 9 cases the results from chirps was seen to have the lowest bias for two cases for grid 1 the highest bias was shown by the trmm the rmse value is least for mswep in 7 out of 9 cases with gdas being best for the rest of the cases the results from gdas resulted in a correlation coefficient ranging from 0 84 to 0 94 the results from 3b42rt v7 were showing the least correlation this can be attributed to its high overestimation during the non monsoon periods further a seasonal quantitative assessment is performed in order to understand seasonal changes in sm the performance evaluation has been performed from august of 2010 for the pre monsoon monsoon and monsoon periods individually results for the pre monsoon period as depicted in table 9 show that the gdas based simulation outperforms the other three products with low bias and the highest correlation coefficient ranging from 0 93 to 0 96 simulation based on trmm was observed to depict the highest bias rmse and least correlation coefficient among all the other cases for the pre monsoon period table 10 shows results for the performance evaluation conducted for june july august and september months monsoon respectively for the years 2010 2012 it can be seen that in the monsoon season trmm is also performing well with the least bias and rmse in 6 out of 9 cases and 5 out of 9 cases respectively table 11 shows the bias rmse and correlation coefficient evaluated for october november and december months post monsoon for the years 2010 2012 in the post monsoon case the superior performance was shown by mswep based simulation over the tibetan region with least bias rmse and highest correlation coefficient in 5 out of 9 cases the results based on gdas also shows superior performance with a low rmse and high correlation coefficient in the remaining 4 out of 9 cases from the yearly comparison it is seen that the best performance is shown by mswep followed closely by gdas based simulation output however in the monsoon period trmm seems to be performing better however these results are only based on a small area over the tibetan plateau and may not be an accurate representation for the whole indian subcontinent especially since the tibetan plateau also known as the third pole of the world has significantly different geography elevation range and climatology as compared to other parts of the indian subcontinent hence if a study is based on the tibetan region with a focus mainly on the monsoon period trmm product is seen to provide the best performance for the simulated soil moisture output however it also has very high overestimation during the non monsoon period on the other hand gdas and mswep based lsm simulation is seen to perform reasonably well consistently throughout the year all over the indian subcontinent when evaluated with the esa cci soil moisture with gdas performing better than mswep in most cases hence for studies covering a larger aerial extent than the tibetan region gdas based precipitation product seems to be the most promising precipitation product to be used as meteorological input forcing in noah 3 6 lsm simulation 4 conclusions the uncertainty in four different precipitation products was evaluated over the indian subcontinent along with the evaluation of simulated soil moisture using these products as precipitation forcing in the model run the selected precipitation datasets were first evaluated against the gridded imd dataset for the monsoon period june to september of the years 2010 to 2012 the simulated soil moisture from different precipitation products are first validated with respect to land surface model lsm estimates with imd precipitation forcing called as ref this validation was performed by computing the relative bias between simulation from precipitation products and ref simulation results from this analysis indicate that precipitation plays a key role in the accuracy of the model simulated soil moisture estimates the overall analysis of the results indicates that gdas and mswep precipitation products perform better as lsm forcing over india among the four products considered here particularly the gdas precipitation has good skill over the hilly terrain in the western ghats further the chirps product seemed to outperform trmm which relates to the previous findings by beck et al 2016 and funk et al 2015 evaluation against esa cci depicted consistent superior performance by gdas based simulation with correlation coefficient ranging from 0 94 to 0 95 and poor performance by trmm based simulation with correlation coefficient 0 58 0 79 yearly evaluation against ctp smtmn depicted superior performance by mswep based soil moisture with correlation coefficient 0 91 0 96 and least performance by trmm on a seasonal scale gdas based simulation outputs show superior performance over the other precipitation based simulation during pre monsoon period depicting least bias and rmse in most cases and highest correlation coefficient values ranging from 0 91 to 0 96 over the monsoon period the trmm was found to depict the least bias and rmse the results are consistent with their high overestimation the trmm based simulation was showing the least underestimation with low bias and rmse as compared to other simulated outputs in the post monsoon period mswep based simulation outperforms the others in 5 out of 9 cases and gdas based simulation outperforming in the remaining 4 out of 9 cases overall results are indicative that trmm based output depicts the least performance due to high overestimation of soil moisture during the non rainy periods the model based gdas precipitation product was observed to consistently show superior performance over the study region both in the direct evaluation of precipitation against imd dataset as well as the simulated soil moisture evaluated against the esa cci soil moisture while trmm based output seem to perform poorly the study shows how a model based gdas precipitation outperforms multi sourced chirps and mswep precipitation as well as the satellite based trmm precipitation dataset results from this study will help end users choose the most appropriate precipitation product for conducting lsm related studies over the indian subcontinent however it is not a comprehensive study as there are many more precipitation products which may also be similarly evaluated using a variety of fine and coarse resolutions

5966,river sediment flux the most critical element of land ocean interaction is undergoing significant changes due to climate variability and anthropogenic activities thus identifying the driving forces and their contributions to the variation in sediment load is of great significance for sustainable management of soil and water resources however the dynamics behind these changes are not well understood and the quantification of drivers of sediment load change remains scarce in this study we investigated the changes in hydrometeorological variables and quantitatively separated drivers of sediment load change in the yangtze river yzr basin china during 1956 2015 the mann kendall test and sequential cluster method were employed to examine the trends and abrupt changes in water discharge and sediment load results showed that the mean annual precipitation for most sub basins and water discharge at most stations exhibited no apparent downward trend while annual temperature showed a significant upward trend for most sub basins sediment load decreased significantly at most stations with breakpoints occurring around 1968 and in the early 2000s the whole study period was split into three sub periods 1956 1968 1969 2002 and 2003 2015 to quantify the change in sediment load as indicated by water sediment relationships at 12 stations the slope of the double mass curve showed a considerable decreasing trend during the period 2003 2015 a decomposition method based on sediment identity factor analysis was applied to quantify the impact of driving forces on the variation in sediment load it was found that a decrease in suspended sediment concentration accounted for approximately 100 125 of the basin wide reduction in sediment load in the yzr basin construction of large reservoirs played a dominant role in sharp decline in sediment load across the basin which was responsible for about 157 mt yr 1 and 384 mt yr 1 of sedimentation for the period 1969 2002 and 2003 2015 respectively soil conservation projects played the secondary role in reducing sediment load which led to an average decrease of 234 mt yr 1 in the entire basin during 1989 2015 hence more attention should be paid to changes in sediment load resulting from increasing human activities in the future keyword sediment load sediment identity factor reservoir construction human activities yangtze river basin 1 introduction sediment transport from rivers is a pivotal component of a river system which exerts a far reaching influence on the fluvial geomorphology coastal ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycle walling 2006 syvitski and milliman 2007 milliman and farnsworth 2011 yang et al 2014 du et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 dai et al 2018 it has been estimated that terrestrial rivers supply 20 gt yr 1 of suspended sediment to the oceans syvitski et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2011 wang et al 2011 however the riverine sediment flux to the ocean is increasingly influenced by accelerating climate change particularly intensive anthropogenic activities which have been increasing in recent decades including reservoir construction soil and water conservation measures swcm land use change water diversion and sand mining syvitski et al 2005 liquete et al 2009 milliman and farnsworth 2011 naik and jay 2011 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2011 allison et al 2012 dai et al 2018 thus most rivers around the world have exhibited a significantly decreasing trend in sediment flux which collectively have resulted in erosion of deltas and degradation of estuarian ecosystems kirwan and megoniga 2013 giosan et al 2014 yang et al 2014 du et al 2016 for example the nile wiegel 1996 the colorado carriquiry and sanchez 1999 and the ebro rivers guillén and palanques 1997 have lost almost 100 of their sediment flux after the construction of many large reservoirs the dramatic decrease in riverine suspended sediment load has attracted increasing attention over the past few decades walling and fang 2003 yang et al 2006a dai et al 2009 syvitski et al 2009 wang et al 2011 dai et al 2016 meanwhile there has long been a goal to assess how the variation of riverine sediment discharge into the sea is affected by natural and anthropogenic drivers therefore it is critical to identify and quantify the driving factors of sediment yield change in rivers for developing strategic plans of sustainable river basin management recent studies have exhibited a growing interest in separating driving forces behind hydrological variables at different spatial scales but most studies have focused on the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff changes and few studies have quantified the drivers of sediment load variations although several studies have recently been reported on quantifying climatic and anthropogenic impacts on sediment load variations using empirical statistical approaches dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the multiple factors underlying sediment flux variation in rivers have not yet been fully identified our understanding of the interconnections and mechanisms of interactions between sediment discharge variability and natural and anthropogenic drivers still remains a challenge thus there is a need for the detection of the potential driving factors and their contribution to the variability of sediment load in order to thoroughly understand the sediment transport behavior the yangtze river yzr is the longest river in asia and the fifth in terms of water discharge and the fourth in terms of sediment load in the world the yzr basin is the most important region with its crucial position in the social economic development of china it is also a suitable basin to illustrate the response of sediment load reduction to changing climate and intensifying anthropogenic activities dai and lu 2014 yang et al 2015 in recent decades particularly since the early 2000s sediment load from the yzr has witnessed a dramatic decline after the construction of the three gorges dam tgd the mean annual sediment load at datong in the downstream of the yzr was 4 27 108 t yr 1 during the period 1956 2002 but it decreased to 1 39 108 t yr 1 between 2003 and 2015 only 32 6 of the level from 1956 to 2002 these changes in sediment load may give rise to a range of impacts on the river system as well as on estuarine ecosystems many studies have been conducted to estimate recent changes of sediment load as a function of climate variability and various human activities in the yzr yang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 dai et al 2016 but few have systematically quantified the relative contribution of driving factors to the reduction in sediment load across the entire yzr basin this may limit our capacity to better understand the change in sediment discharge in response to multiple factors on a basin wide scale in this study we employed a new quantitative assessment method of sediment identity factor to quantify the impacts of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration on sediment load across the yzr basin this work also incorporates newly updated hydrometeorological series between 1956 and 2015 to obtain new findings therefore the main objectives of this study are to i discern variations in annual temperature precipitation water discharge and sediment load ii quantify the drivers of sediment load reduction and iii explore the underlying mechanisms between driving forces and declining sediment load our study provides new insights into the mechanisms that dominate the dynamic responses of sediment load variation to multiple drivers 2 study area originating from the tibetan plateau the yzr flows across 19 provinces of china and extends 6397 km eastward to the east china sea fig 1 the elevation ranges from 6600 m above sea level in the headwaters to 5 m above sea level at the outlet it is situated between 90 33 and 122 25 e and 24 30 and 35 45 n covering a basin area of 1 8 106 km2

humid regions with a typical subtropical monsoon climate precipitation within the year is highly variable and more than 70 of it falls in the wet season from june to september the annual average temperature ranges between 12 6 and 28 0 c and annual average precipitation is about 476 mm it is geographically divided into the upper middle and lower reaches the upper reach of the yzr is typically characterized by mountains and hills extending 4504 km from the headwaters to yichang the middle reach extends 955 km between yichang and hukou which is dominated by the meandering river system the lower reach is located in the vast fluvial flood plains extending 938 km from hukou to the river mouth there are seven major sub basins in the yzr basin fig 1a and table 1 including the jinsha river jsr min river mr jialing river jlr wu river wr han river hr dongting lake dl and poyang lake pl sub basins the mean annual water discharge and sediment load across the yzr basin from 1956 to 2015 were 920 km3 yr 1 and 480 mt yr 1 respectively the sediment regime in the basin has been strongly regulated as a result of anthropogenic activities including reservoir construction soil conservation projects and sand mining to utilize water resources for various purposes more than 51 000 reservoirs of various sizes have been constructed across the basin including about 282 large 0 1 km3 and 1543 medium sized 0 01 0 1 km3 reservoirs with the total storage capacity of 288 km3 and 42 km3 respectively fig 1b and table 2 show the basic information of 27 controlling reservoirs 2 km3 which are

sediment identity factor analysis approach is simple and practical and can be applied to quantify the contributions of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration to variation in sediment load river sediment load s can be regarded as a product of three driving factors wang et al 2015 2017a 8 s p r p s r p r s where p is precipitation r is runoff r is water yield capacity ratio of runoff to precipitation the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff s is sediment load and s is suspended sediment concentration ratio of annual sediment load to water discharge based on eq 8 the following differential equation can be expressed as 9 ds d t s d p r s d t prs dp d t p dr d t r ds d t s the proportional rate of change of a quantity x t can be defined as 10 r x x 1 d x d t thus the relative contribution due to the proportional rates of change of precipitation runoff and sediment concentration can be expressed as 11 r s r p r r r s here linear regression method was used to calculate the proportional rates of change of p r and s the relative contribution of each factor to the change in sediment load was estimated according to the ratio of its proportional change rate to the proportional change rate of s 4 results 4 1 trends analysis fig 2 shows the mk trend z value and the interpolated trend magnitude β in annual temperature and precipitation at 196 meteorological stations across the yzr basin for the period 1956 2015 the annual mean temperature exhibited positive trends for 188 of 196 96 stations of which 146 74 stations showed significant upward trends at 95 and higher confidence level fig 2a significant increasing trends were found almost basin wide except for the jlr and wr sub basins the magnitude of the trend in temperature varied from 0 12 to 1 16 c per decade with an average warming rate of 0 16 c per decade in the entire basin fig 2a for the mean annual precipitation 99 51 stations 94 48 stations and 3 1 stations showed positive negative and no trends respectively the 5 stations with statistically significant upward trends at 95 confidence level were mostly observed in the jsr and the lower yzr and 8 stations with significant downward trends were detected in the mr and wr fig 2b the magnitude of the trend in precipitation varied between 7 and 4 1 mm yr 1 over the past six decades with an average rate of 0 2 mm yr 1 fig 2b in general significant warming trend and mild precipitation trend were found in this study in line with prior studies zhang et al 2006 chen et al 2014 tian et al 2016 the changes in water discharge and sediment load time series at 12 stations in the yzr basin from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 3 there was no significant variation in water discharge over the past six decades in the mainstream of the yzr but it showed an increasing trend from the upper reach to the middle lower reach of the river fig 3b f in contrast the sediment load at all stations except for hukou declined sharply after 1968 fig 3 moreover the original pattern that sediment load of yichang in the upstream was larger than that of hankou and datong in the downstream has been reversed since 2003 fig 3d f in other words the spatial pattern of sediment load in the yzr basin has been disrupted due to the strong disturbance by anthropogenic activities yang et al 2011 2018 fig 4 shows the trends in water discharge and sediment load at 12 stations based on the mk test and sen s slope estimator annual water discharge revealed the downward trends at most stations except for pingshan hukou hankou and datong but the declining trends were not statistically significant except for chenglingji and gaochang fig 4a the decreasing rate of annual water discharge ranged from 1 31 km3 yr 1 at chenglingji to 0 04 km3 yr 1 at wulong meanwhile the sediment load series at all stations except for hukou witnessed significant decreasing trends at 99 confidence level since 1956 with average reduction rates ranging from 9 44 mt yr 1 at yichang to 0 55 mt yr 1 at wulong fig 4b 4 2 breakpoint detection the abrupt changes in mean annual water discharge and sediment load in the yzr basin during 1956 2015 are shown in table 3 no significant change points were found in the time series of water discharge at 99 significance level for most stations for annual sediment load the change points were detected at significance level of 99 for all stations except for huangzhuang most of them occurring in the period of 1968 1969 and 2001 2002 table 3 it is worth noting that the occurrence of change point corresponds to large scale human activities in the yzr basin such as reservoir construction and soil and water conservation measures which have led to a sharp reduction of sediment flux to the ocean fig 3 based on the results of breakpoint identification and other factors such as comparability of results and process simplification the study period of 1956 2015 for all sub basins can be split into three sub periods 1956 1968 p1 1969 2002 p2 and 2003 2015 p3 table 3 shows the difference in water discharge or sediment load during p1 p2 and p1 p3 the change rate of annual water discharge ranged from 15 14 beibei to 24 19 hukou for the period between p1 and p2 and from 26 03 chenglingji to 17 95 hukou for the period between p1 and p3 by contrast annual sediment load exhibited more dramatic variation than that in water discharge with average change rates of 34 75 during p2 and 65 51 during p3 respectively compared with p1 the greatest decrease in sediment load was found at huangzhuang from the hr and the average rates of decrease during p2 and p3 were 183 38 and 94 4 respectively 4 3 variation of water sediment relationships the double mass curve dmc is a plot of the cumulative values of the two variables in the same rectangular coordinate for a concurrent period the dmc has been widely used to detect the consistency of hydrometeorological data gao et al 2017 theoretically the dmc is a straight line if the proportionality of the two variables is constant however a significant change in the slope of the dmc may indicate that the original relationship between the two variables is affected by anthropogenic disturbances the dmc of the annual water discharge and sediment load at 12 stations are plotted in fig 5 it could be found that the dmc during p1 was almost coincident indicating that water sediment relationship did not distinctly change during the period however the slope of the dmc exhibited obvious variations during p2 and p3 which indicated the impact of human activities on sediment discharge at different levels specifically the slope of the linear regression lines decreased for all stations except for pingshan and wulong during p2 compared to that in p1 as shown in fig 5j the largest decline in the slope of the dmc was found at huangzhuang between p1 and p2 the slope of the dmc decreased significantly from 2 19 in p1 to 0 39 in p2 indicating a notable downward shift in response to the operation of the djk reservoir in 1967 fig 5j for the period p3 the dmc for all stations except for hukou moved further downward with respect to the period of p2 due to impoundment of the tgd in 2003 the slope of the dmc at yichang experienced the largest decrease among all stations from 1 12 during p2 to 0 09 during p3 fig 5d at hukou the junction of the pl with the yzr the slope of the dmc increased by 33 5 due to increasing sediment concentration caused by illegal sand mining activities along the pl since 2001 fig 5l in general results indicated that the sediment load decreased sharply for a given water discharge during p3 due to gradually increasing human activities in other words river sediment discharge along the yzr basin has remained low since 2003 due to sharply reduced sediment concentration even at high streamflow events 4 4 attribution of sediment load change fig 6 presents the proportional change rate of sediment identity factors and their relative contributions to the decline in sediment load along the yzr basin above datong as shown in fig 6 the relative reduction rate of s in the basin was 2 06 yr 1 1 11 yr 1 and 2 69 yr 1 during the period p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively fig 6a results suggested that s was a dominant driving factor for sediment load reduction accounting for 102 125 and 100 of the total s basin wide decrease during these three periods respectively fig 6b table 4 and fig 7 show the temporal dynamics of sediment identity factors and their impacts on decline in sediment load for the seven sub basins similarly s also played a dominant role in leading to the decline in s in all sub basins except for the pl during three different periods specifically during the period between p1 and p3 proportional change rate of s exhibited a negative trend in 6 out of 7 sub basins table 4 resulting from a mean decline in p 0 02 yr 1 r 0 15 yr 1 and s 2 16 yr 1 the relative contribution to the variation in sediment load within the seven sub basins from p r and s were 8 20 and 72 on average during p1 and p3 respectively fig 8 a between p1 and p2 s had a mean change rate of 2 12 yr 1 with a range of 6 85 0 43 yr 1 across the seven sub basins approximately 1 6 and 107 of this decrease being attributable to a mean decrease in p r and s respectively fig 8b during p2 and p3 the mean proportional change rate of s was 2 67 yr 1 with a range of 4 58 0 13 yr 1 among the seven sub basins about 4 of this decline being subject to change in p 17 with respect to a decrease in r and the remaining 79 of the reduction in response to a mean decline in s fig 8c as a whole the impact of s greatly exceeded that of p and r on variations in observed sediment load across the yzr basin these findings highlight the dominant role of human activities implicitly integrated in variations in s and r in the decrease in sediment load however individual contributions of the three driving factors to alteration in sediment load appear to be heterogeneous in both time and space taking the jsr for example precipitation contributed only 9 and 8 of variation in sediment load for the period p1 p3 and p2 p3 respectively while it accounted for 35 of total decrease in sediment load during p1 p2 fig 8 in addition the largest negative change rate of s among the seven sub basins was found in the hr with the mean annual decline of 5 85 6 85 and 4 85 for the period p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively table 4 in short s is the decisive driver for the precipitous decline of sediment load in the mainstream of the yzr and the main sub basins while the contribution of p and r to sediment reduction is weak and even made a slight negative contribution in some periods 5 discussion 5 1 driving forces 5 1 1 climate change accelerated climate change is expected to alter mean temperature and precipitation patterns which in turn will affect soil erosion and sediment yield in the river basin pruski and nearing 2002 syvitski and milliman 2007 zhu et al 2008 lu et al 2013 vanmaercke et al 2014 yang et al 2015 li and fang 2016 the yzr basin has witnessed a significant increasing trend in the mean annual temperature over the past 60 years in the context of global warming fig 2a while no significant trend in annual precipitation could be detected in the same period fig 2b a warming trend across the yzr basin may increase runoff and soil erosion owing to increased snowmelt and residue decomposition rate in the source region however rising temperature may offset the positive effect in response to increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture li and fang 2016 chen et al 2014 found that there was a poor correlation between temperature and runoff despite a significant increase in temperature across the yzr basin therefore precipitation may be the major climatic driving factor of variation in sediment discharge a close correlation between precipitation change and sediment flux has been observed throughout the world in the past decades such as in the columbia river naik and jay 2011 magdalena river restrepo and escobar 2018 the thames river bussi et al 2016 the mekong river shrestha et al 2018 the yellow river miao et al 2011 and the pearl river wu et al 2012 etc table 5 shows a correlation between annual sediment load and precipitation for the seven sub basins results showed that sediment load at most sub basins was well related to precipitation during 1956 1968 however the correlation was less significant for the period of 2003 2015 which indicated that sediment regime has been significantly altered due to the combined effects of precipitation soil conservation practices reservoir construction and land use change furthermore it is worth noting that the impact of precipitation on sediment load variation was not expected to be fully explained by the correlation between the two variables for example a significant correlation p 0 01 was found in the hr during different periods while relative contribution of precipitation to reduction in sediment load was only 0 8 2 2 and 0 6 during p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively fig 8 it may be a spatio temporally nonlinear response of sediment yield to the changed precipitation that is because the effect of precipitation on sediment yield through underlying surface factors varies regionally in other words different types of land use and land cover show different responses of sediment transport for a given amount of annual precipitation the relative contribution of precipitation to the variability of sediment load varied from 8 51 to 47 6 for the seven sub basins in this study which was basically consistent with previous studies yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 overall precipitation is not the key factor of the decline in sediment load across the yzr basin during the last decades which has highlighted paramount role of anthropogenic disturbances in the change of sediment dynamics in the basin in addition previous studies have documented that sediment flux variability in river was closely related to the el niño southern oscillation enso events tote et al 2011 wang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 morera et al 2017 generally enso is strongly correlated with the sea surface temperature sst in the equatorial pacific ocean which is usually used as an indicator of enso a positive sst anomaly is responsible for drought events in the river basin by altering the intensity and spatial distribution of precipitation and may lead to the decrease in runoff and sediment flux to the ocean wang et al 2011 2017b liu et al 2017 as reported by ahmadi et al 2019 hydrological drought can reduce sediment erosion and sediment transport capacity which often results in increased sedimentation in rivers the correlation between variability in water discharge and sediment load at datong and enso indicator is shown in fig 9 there were 18 enso events during 1956 2015 characterized by sustained positive sst anomalies including seven weak seven medium and four strong events fig 9a obviously the years with particularly low water and sediment discharge were closely correlated with medium and strong enso events fig 9 for example the enso event in 1994 corresponded to the minimum sediment discharge at datong during 1956 1994 in addition the enso event in 2006 coincided with the worst drought in the yzr basin in the previous 59 years resulting in the second lowest sediment flux to the ocean during 1956 2015 5 1 2 reservoir construction it is widely acknowledged that reservoir construction is regarded as the main driver of the reduction in sediment flux to the sea worldwide syvitski et al 2005 yang et al 2006b kondolf et al 2014 gao et al 2015 lu et al 2015 it has been estimated that approximately 30 of the global riverine suspended sediment yield is trapped behind reservoirs vörösmarty et al 2003 syvitski and milliman 2007 the storage capacity of the reservoirs in the yzr basin has witnessed a rapid increase trend since the 1950s in the late 1950s the total storage capacity in the basin was only 12 km3 while it gradually rose up to 120 km3 by the end of the late 1980s and surged to more than 360 km3 by 2015 fig 10a in response to this dramatic increase in storage capacity sediment budget of the yzr basin has been significantly altered due to the cumulative sediment trapping by multiple reservoirs especially large reservoirs fig 11 the most striking human intervention in the yzr basin may be the closure of the tgd in 2003 which intercepted more than 80 of the inflow suspended sediment load due to its large capacity of sediment trapping yang et al 2014 consequently the annual suspended sediment load at yichang hankou and datong in 2003 declined by about 80 1 59 0 and 51 7 respectively compared to that in 1956 2002 therefore knowledge of sediment trapping in reservoirs is indispensable to better understand the impact of reservoir on the decrease of sediment load in the yzr basin we applied the empirical method originally developed by brune 1953 and then improved by vörösmarty et al 2003 to estimate the sediment trapping efficiency te and sedimentation rates in reservoirs firstly reservoirs were divided into different groups according to their spatial topological relationships in the sub basins yang and lu 2014 then the amount of sediment accumulated in reservoirs for each group sj can be calculated in terms of its inflowing sediment yield syj and tej the detailed equations are as follows 12 t e j 1 0 05 δ τ j 13 δ τ j i 1 m v i q j 14 s j s y j t e j where δ τ j is the residence time for each group vi is storage of reservoir i km3 qj is the mean annual water discharge at mouth of each group km3 yr 1 j is the number of groups and m is the number of reservoirs in each group considering storage volume loss due to sediment trapping by upstream reservoirs we calculated a new te for the following year through an iterative algorithm kondolf et al 2014 results showed that the estimated te varied greatly among the 244 selected large reservoirs ranging between 15 5 and 98 0 te of the twenty six controlling reservoirs ranged from 73 5 to 96 8 table 2 which indicated that the controlling reservoirs can collectively play a significant role in basin wide sediment interception the closure of each controlling reservoir is accompanied by a dramatic decline in sediment load which indicates the significant sediment starvation effect in the downstream channels as shown in fig 11 the mean annual sediment trapping by large reservoirs in the yzr basin was approximately 18 mt yr 1 from 1956 to 1968 157 mt yr 1 from 1969 to 2002 and 384 mt yr 1 from 2003 to 2015 respectively it showed that sediment deposition rate has increased rapidly and large reservoirs will continue to play a crucial role in the reduction of sediment load annual sedimentation rate of the tgd was estimated to be 136 mt yr 1 which accounted for nearly 20 of the total annual sedimentation in basin wide large reservoirs the estimated sedimentation rate based on the empirical detention equation is basically consistent with observed estimated sedimentation rate from changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 gao et al 2015 reported the annual sediment intercepted by all reservoirs and small ponds in the yzr basin was 453 mt yr 1 among which large and medium sized reservoirs contributed 354 mt yr 1 fig 12 shows the reduction of sediment concentration with an increase of the total storage capacity for the seven sub basins overall the significant increase in storage capacity and the consequent sharp decrease in sediment concentration occurred in the jsr mr jlr and wr during 2003 2015 while this phenomenon was observed in the hr dl and pl for the period of 1969 2002 specifically the jsr china s largest region for hydropower generation exhibited distinct stepwise increase in total storage capacity in the past six decades fig 12a accordingly about 72 mt yr 1 of sediment was trapped in large reservoirs during 2003 2015 fig 11 when the cumulative reservoir storage capacity was more than 5 times larger than that during 1956 2002 subsequently the decline in sediment concentration at pingshan occurred in the late 1990s but became more dramatic after 2003 in detail the et reservoir see table 2 for definitions of reservoir abbreviations was accomplished in 1998 with an estimated 23 mt yr 1 of reservoir sedimentation rate and an obvious decrease in suspended sediment concentration was then found at pingshan in 1999 fig 12a after 2012 three mega reservoirs i e the jp 1 xjb and xld were constructed successively and the mean annual sediment concentration at pingshan dropped by 99 3 from 1 624 kg m3 in 1956 2012 to 0 013 kg m3 in 2013 2015 fig 12a in the coming decades the jsr s sediment concentration is likely to be further reduced when some mega reservoirs are in their full operation such as wudongde baihetan and longpan reservoirs the mr is the largest tributary of the upper yzr in terms of water discharge from 2003 to 2015 the total storage capacity of the mr increased nearly four times fig 10b and the corresponding reservoir sedimentation rate was estimated at approximately 28 mt yr 1 fig 11 compared to that of 1956 2002 following the impoundment of the pbg reservoir in 2009 combined with the impact of a series of reservoirs such as gongzui tongjiezi and zipingpu annual sediment concentration at gaochang has been effectively reduced fig 12b the jlr is the important source of sediment in the upper yzr during 2003 2015 the cumulative storage capacity of large reservoirs within the jlr increased to 14 5 km3 fig 10b resulting in about 92 0 mt yr 1 of sediment being trapped by these reservoirs fig 11 following the closure of the bzs and tzk reservoirs in 1996 and 2013 respectively the mean sediment concentration at beibei declined sharply to 0 2 kg m3 in 1997 and further to 0 19 kg m3 in 2015 fig 12c however an abnormal peak in sediment concentration at beibei was observed in 1998 which may be caused by the great flood in that year similarly numerous large reservoirs were constructed in the wr since the 2000s accounting for the majority of the existing cumulative storage capacity fig 12d the two largest reservoirs are hjd and gpt within the wr which began their operation in 2004 and 2009 respectively the mean annual sediment accumulated in the large reservoirs of the wr increased from 9 mt yr 1 in 1969 2002 to 17 mt yr 1 in 2003 2015 fig 11 as a consequence the mean annual sediment concentration recorded at wulong decreased to 0 13 kg m3 after the operation of the hjd reservoir and further decreased to 0 06 kg m3 after the operation of the gpt reservoir leading to a cumulative decline in sediment concentration of more than 90 fig 12d the hr is the longest tributary of the yzr currently the ratio of storage capacity to annual water discharge in the hr exceeds 90 implying that it is the most regulated one among the seven sub basins the cumulative storage capacity of the hr increased dramatically by about 6 times after the djk reservoir impounded in 1967 fig 12e the water storage capacity of the reservoir increased substantially again after the djk reservoir had been heightened from 162 to 176 6 m in 2013 the djk reservoir the second largest reservoir in the yzr basin has a storage capacity of 29 05 km3 with the estimated annual sedimentation rate of 48 mt yr 1 on average as a consequence sediment concentration at huangzhuang dropped sharply to 0 37 kg m3 during 1969 2002 and further to 0 13 kg m3 during 2003 2015 fig 12e indicating that reservoir construction has played a dominant role in the reduction of sediment concentration since then by contrast for the dl especially the pl there is not a high correlation between its total storage capacity and mean annual sediment concentration due to the unique hydrological settings of the two lakes fig 12f and g the dl and pl are located at the junction of the yzr and basin wide tributaries fig 1 specifically water and sediment entering the dl come from the yzr via three inlets located in yichang chenglingji reach and four rivers xiang zi yuan and li and the dl delivers water and sediment to the yzr via chenglingji by comparison the inflow of the pl depends on five rivers gan fu xin rao and xiu and its outflow into the yzr is situated at hukou fig 1 thus sediment regime of the two lakes is closely related to their tributaries and the yzr the cumulative storage capacity of large reservoirs in the dl increased from 6 4 km3 during 1956 1968 to 16 3 km3 during 1969 2002 and then to 30 4 km3 during 2003 2015 fig 10b consequently the large reservoirs of the dl had trapped 5 mt yr 1 16 mt yr 1 and 32 mt yr 1 of sediment during these three periods respectively fig 11 in contrast fig 12g showed a much weaker correlation between cumulative storage capacity and output sediment concentration from the pl in three different periods after the zl and wa reservoirs were constructed in 1975 and 1990 respectively the total storage capacity of reservoirs in the pl increased sharply thereafter fig 12g although the output sediment concentration of the pl decreased obviously in the short term thereafter a significant increase in annual sediment concentration has been observed at hukou after 2003 in response to intense erosion and illegal sand mining within the pl fig 12g since the regulation of the tgd in 2003 the sediment budget entering the dl and pl decreased sharply owing to the significant decline in sediment source and the enlarged elevation difference between the yzr and the two lakes accordingly the dl and pl have transformed from long term accretionary state before 2003 to the erosional state thereafter which may be the reason for the increasing contribution of sediment load from the two lakes to the lower reach of the yzr dai et al 2018 thus the increasing trend in sediment concentration from dl and pl after 2003 may be partly attributed to the closure of the tgd in general the year when sediment load in the mainstream and tributaries of the yzr dropped precipitously was closely related to the operation time of the controlling reservoirs thus reservoir construction is undoubtedly the key driver resulting in decreasing riverine sediment downstream of the reservoir which in turn can erode downstream channels and alter the original sediment transport regime owing to release of sediment starved water lu et al 2015 tian et al 2019 previous studies suggested that reservoir construction could explain about 88 the total decrease in sediment load within the basin dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 however it was found that the estimated annual sedimentation behind the reservoir from the seven sub basins is not entirely consistent with the decrease in sediment load at the outlet of the sub basins this discrepancy may reflect the influences of other drivers on sediment load variation such as erosion of downstream reach and soil conservation measures in the upper yzr wu et al 2012 yang and lu 2014 lu et al 2015 5 1 3 soil and water conservation measures soil erosion is a challenging environmental concern throughout the world that has resulted in the deterioration of soil properties and fluvial sedimentation lal 2003 li and fang 2016 garcia ruiz et al 2017 thus soil management efforts have been considered critical for addressing the great challenges montgomery 2007 maetens et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 soil and water conservation practices include biological vegetation and agricultural measures and engineering measures which can improve vegetative cover and soil characteristics and increase water storage capacity and soil infiltration capacity walling 1999 this may curb the loss of water and sediment resulting in lower sediment yield in the basin maetens et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 studies reported that forest coverage in the yzr basin was over 60 in the past zhang 1998 however due to massive deforestation during the great leap forward and the cultural revolution in china the average forest coverage of the yzr basin decreased from 22 in the early 1950s to 10 in the mid 1980s zhang 1998 as a result the area of soil erosion in the basin increased by nearly 54 and annual sediment yield increased by approximately 50 during the period shi 1999 therefore intense soil erosion was likely to be responsible for the increasing trend in sediment load between the 1950s and the 1980s in the yzr basin fig 3 to resolve the problem of soil and water loss in the basin the chinese government implemented soil and water conservation projects in the upper yzr in the late 1980s including four regions that suffered serious soil erosion namely the lower jsr and bijie district in guizhou province the middle lower jlr the southern region of gansu and shaanxi provinces and the three gorges reservoir region after the 1998 flood of the yzr the large scale ecological restoration projects particularly the grain for green project were launched in 1999 since then soil conservation projects have been gradually extended to the middle yzr basin such as the djk reservoir region the dl and pl the southern part of dabie mountains covering 14 provinces municipalities directly under the central government as noted by changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 the area of soil erosion in the yzr basin has been reduced to 384 600 km2 in 2015 accounting for 21 4 of the total area of the basin as a consequence the average rate of sediment reduction by soil conservation projects was 60 mt yr 1 in the yzr basin since the late 1980 chu et al 2009 we applied the dmc method to estimate the effect soil conservation techniques implemented in 1989 on the decline in sediment load annual precipitation and sediment load time series was divided into two sub periods 1956 1988 the reference period and 1989 2015 the changing period the linear relationship between cumulative precipitation and cumulative sediment load in reference period were established the cumulative sediment load in the changing period can then be predicted by using the linear regression equation determined in the reference period the difference between the observed and predicted cumulative sediment loads in the same period can be regarded as the total variation of sediment load caused by soil conservation measures in the changing period results indicated that soil and water conservation measures were responsible for 22 6 of the decline in sediment load in the yzr basin from 1989 to 2015 resulting in a mean decrease of 234 mt yr 1 among the seven main sub basins the contribution rate of soil conservation projects to the reduction of sediment load ranged between 5 4 and 39 8 resulting in an average decline from 1 3 mtyr 1 to 53 mt yr 1 therefore soil and water conservation measures have probably played the second most important role in the decrease in sediment load in the yzr basin since the late 1980s dai et al 2008 estimated that soil conservation measures contributed approximately 15 of the decline in sediment flux along the yzr basin yang et al 2015 reported that approximately 6 of the decline in sediment load at datong could be ascribed to soil and water conservation measures between 1956 and 1968 and 2003 2012 furthermore we foresee that soil and water conservation projects will play a more important role in sediment reduction in the yzr basin 5 1 4 sand mining sand mining activities affect aquatic ecosystems riverbed topography and sediment budget kondolf 1997 hossain et al 2004 wu et al 2007 lai et al 2014 duan et al 2019 extensive riverbed sand mining in the yzr is deemed to be responsible for the substantial decrease in sediment flux to the ocean chen et al 2006 dai and lu 2014 with the rapid urbanization and growth in the construction industry the demand for sand has increased rapidly in the yzr basin since the 1980s the amount of annual sand mining from the middle lower yzr increased to nearly 40 mt yr 1 in the 1980s and reached 80 mt yr 1 in the early 2000s chen et al 2006 wang et al 2007 it was documented that the total amount of sand mining reduced to 41 5 mt in 2015 due to the implementation of regulation on the administration of sand excavation in the yzr changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 however illegal sand dredging activities are still rampant along the yzr owing to huge commercial profits and inadequate government regulation thus the actual amount of sand mining from the middle and lower yzr would be likely to exceed 41 5 mt yr 1 it is worth noting that a large amount of illegal sand dredging vessels swarmed to the pl after the restricted limitation of sand mining on the mainstream of the yzr was implemented in 2001 wu et al 2007 de leeuw et al 2010 it was estimated that the annual volume of sediment extraction from the pl was approximately 236 mt yr 1 in 2005 2006 de leeuw et al 2010 resulting in the increased outflow of the lake and a sediment budget deficit for both the lake and the lower yzr lai et al 2014 as a result the slope of the dmc at hukou showed a significant upward trend around 2003 fig 5l mainly caused by intensive sand mining in the pl in general extensive sand mining has reduced sediment flux to the sea since the 1980s nevertheless compared with reservoir construction and soil preservation sand mining is likely to be a minor driving force of the decline in sediment discharge yang et al 2015 dai et al 2016 5 2 comparison of the results with other studies previous studies have examined the impacts of climate change and human activities on sediment reduction in the yzr basin based on empirical statistics such as the linear regression and the dmc method many studies indicated that the substantial decline in sediment discharge in the basin in recent decades can be attributed to anthropogenic influences such as large scale reservoir construction and soil and water conservation projects dai et al 2008 estimated that dam construction and soil and water conservation measures accounted for 88 and 15 5 of the total decrease in sediment flux from the yzr to the sea during 1956 2002 respectively similarly yang et al 2015 reported that the contribution of reservoir construction and soil conservation to sediment discharge reduction in the yzr were 88 and 6 for the period of 1950 2012 respectively zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that 86 89 of the decrease in sediment load in the mainstream of the yzr during 1956 2013 could be attributed to human activities while 71 102 of the decline in sediment load for the seven sub basins was ascribed to anthropogenic impacts in the present study we applied the sediment identity factor approach to quantify the effects of three variables on sediment load change fig 6 the r of a river is an index reflecting the integrated results of climatic conditions and underlying surface which is documented in the combined effects of climate variability and human activities sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 chen et al 2014 buendia et al 2016 the s is generally considered to be closely related to soil erosion sediment transport and land use change which is strongly controlled by anthropogenic activities vanmaercke et al 2014 wang et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 when only considering the influence of the s on the sediment load reduction anthropogenic impacts can explain about 100 125 of the decline in sediment load across the yzr basin in this study fig 6b which was slightly different from that in the findings of mentioned studies dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 these slight discrepancies may be due to different choices of approaches data series and the baseline period used it should be noted that the dominant driving force for sediment load reduction across the yzr basin in recent decades is similar to that of the pearl river basin zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2012 but different from that of the yellow river basin wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 as reported by wang et al 2015 the decrease of r caused by large scale ecological rehabilitation program accounted for 58 of the sediment reduction in the yellow river basin 5 3 uncertainty of quantitative assessment the uncertainty of attribution analysis for sediment reduction is subject to the following aspects first the contributions of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration to variations in sediment load were identified based on the assumption that they are independent variables however there may be an inter correlation among the three sediment identity factors zhao et al 2018 therefore it s difficult to accurately separate the relative contribution of individual factors second the selection of sub periods may lead to the uncertainty of attribution of hydrological change wang 2014 zhang et al 2018 to compare the driving force and relative contribution rate of sediment load variability in seven sub basins of the yzr the same sub periods were used for all sub basins in this study nevertheless there is a great spatial heterogeneity in climate the underlying surface and the intensity of human activities in the basin third abrupt point identification and selection of study period are crucial to separate the individual effects of different drivers on sediment load change but change points in hydrological data obtained by different methods may exhibit large differences dey and mishra 2017 furthermore due to the randomness in hydrologic regime multiple change points may be found even using the same method also clear abrupt points are not always detected due to the complex interaction of multiple driving forces thus it is a challenge to identify a reasonable abrupt point in hydrometeorological data finally suspended sediment processes in rivers are recognized to be highly nonlinear bracken et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 which could give rise to great uncertainty for attribution analysis of sediment load variations generally suspended sediment load is a continuous process of erosion transport and accumulation which is often characterized by a changing sediment regime across spatial and temporal scale in rivers vercruysse et al 2017 thus the three sediment identification factors p r and s used in this study are not always sufficient to interpret the changes in suspended sediment transport the sediment transport dynamics should be fully considered in future studies 5 4 implications and consequences of decrease in sediment supply from the yzr impacts of decrease in sediment flux from rivers into the ocean have attracted special attention in recent years these impacts included intensive channel scouring in the middle lower reach notable delta erosion and coastal ecosystems degradation owing to sediment starvation and the changes of sediment transport capability kondolf 1997 milliman 1997 syvitski et al 2009 yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 the decrease in sediment load in the upstream due to damming and soil conservation may be partially offset by an increase in the downstream channel erosion trimble 1999 gao et al 2015 vanmaercke et al 2015 dai et al 2018 as shown in fig 13 the middle reach of the yzr has exhibited notable riverbed scouring and bank erosion since the operation of the tgd as a result the intensive riverbed erosion has been observed downstream of the dam and has rapidly extended to hukou of the middle yzr eventually resulting in the new morphological equilibrium over the next decades dai et al 2018 lai et al 2017 li et al 2018 xia et al 2017 compared to the pre tgd period of 1957 2002 the downstream jingjiang reach between zhicheng and chenglingji saw an increase in the erosion intensity by several times during the post tgd period 2003 2015 fig 13 as a consequence the upstream of the yzr has been replaced by the middle lower reach of the river as the dominant sediment source since the closure of the tgd accounting for approximately 70 of the total sediment flux into the ocean gao et al 2015 dai et al 2018 simultaneously accelerated channel erosion will further increase the difference in elevation between the yzr and adjacent lakes resulting in the weakening of the interconnection of the river lake system consequently sediment discharge from the mainstream of the yzr to dl and pl has decreased notably since 2003 so far the dl and pl have transferred from continuous deposition before 2003 to slight deposition or erosion thereafter which are likely to contribute about 20 of sediment supply to the estuary dai et al 2018 it can therefore be expected that the altered erosion siltation pattern and river lake relationship in the middle lower yzr basin may lead to increased risk of flood and drought disasters and fluvial ecosystems safety guo et al 2012 2018 dai et al 2018 meanwhile the delta is also vulnerable to the significant reduction in sediment delivery to the sea blum and roberts 2009 giosan et al 2014 like many other mega deltas the yzr has recently experienced increased coastal erosion and shoreline recession in response to the dramatically reduced sediment supply to the delta although there has been no overwhelming erosion in the yangtze subaqueous delta it has experienced a conversion from net accretion to net erosion since 2003 yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 guo et al 2018 thus the accelerating degradation of the yangtze deltas is likely to increase the risk of rising sea levels frequent storms estuarine flooding and shrinking coastal wetlands in recent years anthropogenic interventions have become main factors for the reduction in sediment discharge in the context of global change there is reason to believe that sediment flux from the yzr to the sea will likely continue to decline in the foreseeable future owing to the full operation of mega reservoirs in the upper yzr as well as ongoing soil and water conservation measures gao et al 2015 predicted that future sediment trapping by reservoirs will be more than 589 mt yr 1 after the closure of cascade reservoirs in the jsr and sediment flux to the sea will further decrease to 100 mt yr 1 in addition erosion capacity in the middle lower reach of the yzr is likely to decline inevitably over time and riverine sediment budget entering the ocean may be reduced to 90 mt yr 1 in the future hu et al 2009 therefore more attention should be paid to future risks to cope with the substantial reduction of sediment flux to the sea 6 conclusions this study examined the spatio temporal changes of hydrometeorological variables including temperature precipitation water discharge and sediment load across the yzr basin during 1956 2015 drivers and their quantitative contributions to the sediment load decline were estimated using the sediment identity approach the major findings of this paper are as follows during 1956 2015 annual temperature displayed a significant increase trend for all sub basins except for the jlr and wr precipitation however exhibited no significant decreasing trend for four out of the seven sub basins meanwhile annual water discharge showed no significant decrease at most stations whereas a significant downward trend in sediment load was observed throughout the basin significant abrupt change in sediment load occurred around 1968 and in the early 2000s at most stations which might result from the operation of controlling reservoirs in the basin the series of annual sediment load were divided into the reference period and changing period via breakpoints compared with the reference period p1 annual sediment load at datong decreased by 24 7 and 73 3 during p2 and p3 respectively consequently water sediment relationships across the basin have been significantly modified since 2003 characterized by the slope decline in the dmc sediment concentration was a predominant driving factor of decline in sediment load in the yzr basin accounting for approximately 100 125 of the decrease in sediment load results revealed that the construction of large reservoirs played a dominant role in the reduction of sediment load within the basin over the last six decades which was responsible for about 157 mt yr 1 and 384 mt yr 1 of reservoir sedimentation during p2 and p3 respectively soil conservation measures represented a secondary driver for reduced sediment load which resulted in a mean decline of 234 mt yr 1 in the entire basin during 1989 2015 it can be expected that sediment discharge from the yzr to the sea may further decrease substantially in the coming decades findings from this study can

5966,river sediment flux the most critical element of land ocean interaction is undergoing significant changes due to climate variability and anthropogenic activities thus identifying the driving forces and their contributions to the variation in sediment load is of great significance for sustainable management of soil and water resources however the dynamics behind these changes are not well understood and the quantification of drivers of sediment load change remains scarce in this study we investigated the changes in hydrometeorological variables and quantitatively separated drivers of sediment load change in the yangtze river yzr basin china during 1956 2015 the mann kendall test and sequential cluster method were employed to examine the trends and abrupt changes in water discharge and sediment load results showed that the mean annual precipitation for most sub basins and water discharge at most stations exhibited no apparent downward trend while annual temperature showed a significant upward trend for most sub basins sediment load decreased significantly at most stations with breakpoints occurring around 1968 and in the early 2000s the whole study period was split into three sub periods 1956 1968 1969 2002 and 2003 2015 to quantify the change in sediment load as indicated by water sediment relationships at 12 stations the slope of the double mass curve showed a considerable decreasing trend during the period 2003 2015 a decomposition method based on sediment identity factor analysis was applied to quantify the impact of driving forces on the variation in sediment load it was found that a decrease in suspended sediment concentration accounted for approximately 100 125 of the basin wide reduction in sediment load in the yzr basin construction of large reservoirs played a dominant role in sharp decline in sediment load across the basin which was responsible for about 157 mt yr 1 and 384 mt yr 1 of sedimentation for the period 1969 2002 and 2003 2015 respectively soil conservation projects played the secondary role in reducing sediment load which led to an average decrease of 234 mt yr 1 in the entire basin during 1989 2015 hence more attention should be paid to changes in sediment load resulting from increasing human activities in the future keyword sediment load sediment identity factor reservoir construction human activities yangtze river basin 1 introduction sediment transport from rivers is a pivotal component of a river system which exerts a far reaching influence on the fluvial geomorphology coastal ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycle walling 2006 syvitski and milliman 2007 milliman and farnsworth 2011 yang et al 2014 du et al 2016 vercruysse et al 2017 dai et al 2018 it has been estimated that terrestrial rivers supply 20 gt yr 1 of suspended sediment to the oceans syvitski et al 2005 milliman and farnsworth 2011 wang et al 2011 however the riverine sediment flux to the ocean is increasingly influenced by accelerating climate change particularly intensive anthropogenic activities which have been increasing in recent decades including reservoir construction soil and water conservation measures swcm land use change water diversion and sand mining syvitski et al 2005 liquete et al 2009 milliman and farnsworth 2011 naik and jay 2011 wang et al 2011 yang et al 2011 allison et al 2012 dai et al 2018 thus most rivers around the world have exhibited a significantly decreasing trend in sediment flux which collectively have resulted in erosion of deltas and degradation of estuarian ecosystems kirwan and megoniga 2013 giosan et al 2014 yang et al 2014 du et al 2016 for example the nile wiegel 1996 the colorado carriquiry and sanchez 1999 and the ebro rivers guillén and palanques 1997 have lost almost 100 of their sediment flux after the construction of many large reservoirs the dramatic decrease in riverine suspended sediment load has attracted increasing attention over the past few decades walling and fang 2003 yang et al 2006a dai et al 2009 syvitski et al 2009 wang et al 2011 dai et al 2016 meanwhile there has long been a goal to assess how the variation of riverine sediment discharge into the sea is affected by natural and anthropogenic drivers therefore it is critical to identify and quantify the driving factors of sediment yield change in rivers for developing strategic plans of sustainable river basin management recent studies have exhibited a growing interest in separating driving forces behind hydrological variables at different spatial scales but most studies have focused on the contribution of climate change and human activities to runoff changes and few studies have quantified the drivers of sediment load variations although several studies have recently been reported on quantifying climatic and anthropogenic impacts on sediment load variations using empirical statistical approaches dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 the multiple factors underlying sediment flux variation in rivers have not yet been fully identified our understanding of the interconnections and mechanisms of interactions between sediment discharge variability and natural and anthropogenic drivers still remains a challenge thus there is a need for the detection of the potential driving factors and their contribution to the variability of sediment load in order to thoroughly understand the sediment transport behavior the yangtze river yzr is the longest river in asia and the fifth in terms of water discharge and the fourth in terms of sediment load in the world the yzr basin is the most important region with its crucial position in the social economic development of china it is also a suitable basin to illustrate the response of sediment load reduction to changing climate and intensifying anthropogenic activities dai and lu 2014 yang et al 2015 in recent decades particularly since the early 2000s sediment load from the yzr has witnessed a dramatic decline after the construction of the three gorges dam tgd the mean annual sediment load at datong in the downstream of the yzr was 4 27 108 t yr 1 during the period 1956 2002 but it decreased to 1 39 108 t yr 1 between 2003 and 2015 only 32 6 of the level from 1956 to 2002 these changes in sediment load may give rise to a range of impacts on the river system as well as on estuarine ecosystems many studies have been conducted to estimate recent changes of sediment load as a function of climate variability and various human activities in the yzr yang et al 2002 zhang et al 2006 dai et al 2016 but few have systematically quantified the relative contribution of driving factors to the reduction in sediment load across the entire yzr basin this may limit our capacity to better understand the change in sediment discharge in response to multiple factors on a basin wide scale in this study we employed a new quantitative assessment method of sediment identity factor to quantify the impacts of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration on sediment load across the yzr basin this work also incorporates newly updated hydrometeorological series between 1956 and 2015 to obtain new findings therefore the main objectives of this study are to i discern variations in annual temperature precipitation water discharge and sediment load ii quantify the drivers of sediment load reduction and iii explore the underlying mechanisms between driving forces and declining sediment load our study provides new insights into the mechanisms that dominate the dynamic responses of sediment load variation to multiple drivers 2 study area originating from the tibetan plateau the yzr flows across 19 provinces of china and extends 6397 km eastward to the east china sea fig 1 the elevation ranges from 6600 m above sea level in the headwaters to 5 m above sea level at the outlet it is situated between 90 33 and 122 25 e and 24 30 and 35 45 n covering a basin area of 1 8 106 km2 with 18 8 of the total area of china the basin sustains about 33 of the chinese population and provides more than 35 of china s gdp most areas of the yzr basin are located within the semi humid and humid regions with a typical subtropical monsoon climate precipitation within the year is highly variable and more than 70 of it falls in the wet season from june to september the annual average temperature ranges between 12 6 and 28 0 c and annual average precipitation is about 476 mm it is geographically divided into the upper middle and lower reaches the upper reach of the yzr is typically characterized by mountains and hills extending 4504 km from the headwaters to yichang the middle reach extends 955 km between yichang and hukou which is dominated by the meandering river system the lower reach is located in the vast fluvial flood plains extending 938 km from hukou to the river mouth there are seven major sub basins in the yzr basin fig 1a and table 1 including the jinsha river jsr min river mr jialing river jlr wu river wr han river hr dongting lake dl and poyang lake pl sub basins the mean annual water discharge and sediment load across the yzr basin from 1956 to 2015 were 920 km3 yr 1 and 480 mt yr 1 respectively the sediment regime in the basin has been strongly regulated as a result of anthropogenic activities including reservoir construction soil conservation projects and sand mining to utilize water resources for various purposes more than 51 000 reservoirs of various sizes have been constructed across the basin including about 282 large 0 1 km3 and 1543 medium sized 0 01 0 1 km3 reservoirs with the total storage capacity of 288 km3 and 42 km3 respectively fig 1b and table 2 show the basic information of 27 controlling reservoirs 2 km3 which are scattered along the mainstream and tributaries of the yzr 3 data and methods 3 1 data daily meteorological data from 196 national meteorological observatory stations in the yzr basin for the period of 1956 2015 were obtained from the national meteorological information center of china meteorological administration http www cma gov cn these meteorological data include daily precipitation daily mean maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunshine hour and wind speed the missing values were interpolated using the data at nearby stations by the linear regression method in this study spatially averaged meteorological data were calculated by thiessen polygon method using arcgis software the spatial distribution of meteorological stations is shown in fig 2 mean monthly water

sediment identity factor analysis approach is simple and practical and can be applied to quantify the contributions of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration to variation in sediment load river sediment load s can be regarded as a product of three driving factors wang et al 2015 2017a 8 s p r p s r p r s where p is precipitation r is runoff r is water yield capacity ratio of runoff to precipitation the proportion of rainfall that becomes runoff s is sediment load and s is suspended sediment concentration ratio of annual sediment load to water discharge based on eq 8 the following differential equation can be expressed as 9 ds d t s d p r s d t prs dp d t p dr d t r ds d t s the proportional rate of change of a quantity x t can be defined as 10 r x x 1 d x d t thus the relative contribution due to the proportional rates of change of precipitation runoff and sediment concentration can be expressed as 11 r s r p r r r s here linear regression method was used to calculate the proportional rates of change of p r and s the relative contribution of each factor to the change in sediment load was estimated according to the ratio of its proportional change rate to the proportional change rate of s 4 results 4 1 trends analysis fig 2 shows the mk trend z value and the interpolated trend magnitude β in annual temperature and precipitation at 196 meteorological stations across the yzr basin for the period 1956 2015 the annual mean temperature exhibited positive trends for 188 of 196 96 stations of which 146 74 stations showed significant upward trends at 95 and higher confidence level fig 2a significant increasing trends were found almost basin wide except for the jlr and wr sub basins the magnitude of the trend in temperature varied from 0 12 to 1 16 c per decade with an average warming rate of 0 16 c per decade in the entire basin fig 2a for the mean annual precipitation 99 51 stations 94 48 stations and 3 1 stations showed positive negative and no trends respectively the 5 stations with statistically significant upward trends at 95 confidence level were mostly observed in the jsr and the lower yzr and 8 stations with significant downward trends were detected in the mr and wr fig 2b the magnitude of the trend in precipitation varied between 7 and 4 1 mm yr 1 over the past six decades with an average rate of 0 2 mm yr 1 fig 2b in general significant warming trend and mild precipitation trend were found in this study in line with prior studies zhang et al 2006 chen et al 2014 tian et al 2016 the changes in water discharge and sediment load time series at 12 stations in the yzr basin from 1956 to 2015 are shown in fig 3 there was no significant variation in water discharge over the past six decades in the mainstream of the yzr but it showed an increasing trend from the upper reach to the middle lower reach of the river fig 3b f in contrast the sediment load at all stations except for hukou declined sharply after 1968 fig 3 moreover the original pattern that sediment load of yichang in the upstream was larger than that of hankou and datong in the downstream has been reversed since 2003 fig 3d f in other words the spatial pattern of sediment load in the yzr basin has been disrupted due to the strong disturbance by anthropogenic activities yang et al 2011 2018 fig 4 shows the trends in water discharge and sediment load at 12 stations based on the mk test and sen s slope estimator annual water discharge revealed the downward trends at most stations except for pingshan hukou hankou and datong but the declining trends were not statistically significant except for chenglingji and gaochang fig 4a the decreasing rate of annual water discharge ranged from 1 31 km3 yr 1 at chenglingji to 0 04 km3 yr 1 at wulong meanwhile the sediment load series at all stations except for hukou witnessed significant decreasing trends at 99 confidence level since 1956 with average reduction rates ranging from 9 44 mt yr 1 at yichang to 0 55 mt yr 1 at wulong fig 4b 4 2 breakpoint detection the abrupt changes in mean annual water discharge and sediment load in the yzr basin during 1956 2015 are shown in table 3 no significant change points were found in the time series of water discharge at 99 significance level for most stations for annual sediment load the change points were detected at significance level of 99 for all stations except for huangzhuang most of them occurring in the period of 1968 1969 and 2001 2002 table 3 it is worth noting that the occurrence of change point corresponds to large scale human activities in the yzr basin such as reservoir construction and soil and water conservation measures which have led to a sharp reduction of sediment flux to the ocean fig 3 based on the results of breakpoint identification and other factors such as comparability of results and process simplification the study period of 1956 2015 for all sub basins can be split into three sub periods 1956 1968 p1 1969 2002 p2 and 2003 2015 p3 table 3 shows the difference in water discharge or sediment load during p1 p2 and p1 p3 the change rate of annual water discharge ranged from 15 14 beibei to 24 19 hukou for the period between p1 and p2 and from 26 03 chenglingji to 17 95 hukou for the period between p1 and p3 by contrast annual sediment load exhibited more dramatic variation than that in water discharge with average change rates of 34 75 during p2 and 65 51 during p3 respectively compared with p1 the greatest decrease in sediment load was found at huangzhuang from the hr and the average rates of decrease during p2 and p3 were 183 38 and 94 4 respectively 4 3 variation of water sediment relationships the double mass curve dmc is a plot of the cumulative values of the two variables in the same rectangular coordinate for a concurrent period the dmc has been widely used to detect the consistency of hydrometeorological data gao et al 2017 theoretically the dmc is a straight line if the proportionality of the two variables is constant however a significant change in the slope of the dmc may indicate that the original relationship between the two variables is affected by anthropogenic disturbances the dmc of the annual water discharge and sediment load at 12 stations are plotted in fig 5 it could be found that the dmc during p1 was almost coincident indicating that water sediment relationship did not distinctly change during the period however the slope of the dmc exhibited obvious variations during p2 and p3 which indicated the impact of human activities on sediment discharge at different levels specifically the slope of the linear regression lines decreased for all stations except for pingshan and wulong during p2 compared to that in p1 as shown in fig 5j the largest decline in the slope of the dmc was found at huangzhuang between p1 and p2 the slope of the dmc decreased significantly from 2 19 in p1 to 0 39 in p2 indicating a notable downward shift in response to the operation of the djk reservoir in 1967 fig 5j for the period p3 the dmc for all stations except for hukou moved further downward with respect to the period of p2 due to impoundment of the tgd in 2003 the slope of the dmc at yichang experienced the largest decrease among all stations from 1 12 during p2 to 0 09 during p3 fig 5d at hukou the junction of the pl with the yzr the slope of the dmc increased by 33 5 due to increasing sediment concentration caused by illegal sand mining activities along the pl since 2001 fig 5l in general results indicated that the sediment load decreased sharply for a given water discharge during p3 due to gradually increasing human activities in other words river sediment discharge along the yzr basin has remained low since 2003 due to sharply reduced sediment concentration even at high streamflow events 4 4 attribution of sediment load change fig 6 presents the proportional change rate of sediment identity factors and their relative contributions to the decline in sediment load along the yzr basin above datong as shown in fig 6 the relative reduction rate of s in the basin was 2 06 yr 1 1 11 yr 1 and 2 69 yr 1 during the period p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively fig 6a results suggested that s was a dominant driving factor for sediment load reduction accounting for 102 125 and 100 of the total s basin wide decrease during these three periods respectively fig 6b table 4 and fig 7 show the temporal dynamics of sediment identity factors and their impacts on decline in sediment load for the seven sub basins similarly s also played a dominant role in leading to the decline in s in all sub basins except for the pl during three different periods specifically during the period between p1 and p3 proportional change rate of s exhibited a negative trend in 6 out of 7 sub basins table 4 resulting from a mean decline in p 0 02 yr 1 r 0 15 yr 1 and s 2 16 yr 1 the relative contribution to the variation in sediment load within the seven sub basins from p r and s were 8 20 and 72 on average during p1 and p3 respectively fig 8 a between p1 and p2 s had a mean change rate of 2 12 yr 1 with a range of 6 85 0 43 yr 1 across the seven sub basins approximately 1 6 and 107 of this decrease being attributable to a mean decrease in p r and s respectively fig 8b during p2 and p3 the mean proportional change rate of s was 2 67 yr 1 with a range of 4 58 0 13 yr 1 among the seven sub basins about 4 of this decline being subject to change in p 17 with respect to a decrease in r and the remaining 79 of the reduction in response to a mean decline in s fig 8c as a whole the impact of s greatly exceeded that of p and r on variations in observed sediment load across the yzr basin these findings highlight the dominant role of human activities implicitly integrated in variations in s and r in the decrease in sediment load however individual contributions of the three driving factors to alteration in sediment load appear to be heterogeneous in both time and space taking the jsr for example precipitation contributed only 9 and 8 of variation in sediment load for the period p1 p3 and p2 p3 respectively while it accounted for 35 of total decrease in sediment load during p1 p2 fig 8 in addition the largest negative change rate of s among the seven sub basins was found in the hr with the mean annual decline of 5 85 6 85 and 4 85 for the period p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively table 4 in short s is the decisive driver for the precipitous decline of sediment load in the mainstream of the yzr and the main sub basins while the contribution of p and r to sediment reduction is weak and even made a slight negative contribution in some periods 5 discussion 5 1 driving forces 5 1 1 climate change accelerated climate change is expected to alter mean temperature and precipitation patterns which in turn will affect soil erosion and sediment yield in the river basin pruski and nearing 2002 syvitski and milliman 2007 zhu et al 2008 lu et al 2013 vanmaercke et al 2014 yang et al 2015 li and fang 2016 the yzr basin has witnessed a significant increasing trend in the mean annual temperature over the past 60 years in the context of global warming fig 2a while no significant trend in annual precipitation could be detected in the same period fig 2b a warming trend across the yzr basin may increase runoff and soil erosion owing to increased snowmelt and residue decomposition rate in the source region however rising temperature may offset the positive effect in response to increased evapotranspiration and decreased soil moisture li and fang 2016 chen et al 2014 found that there was a poor correlation between temperature and runoff despite a significant increase in temperature across the yzr basin therefore precipitation may be the major climatic driving factor of variation in sediment discharge a close correlation between precipitation change and sediment flux has been observed throughout the world in the past decades such as in the columbia river naik and jay 2011 magdalena river restrepo and escobar 2018 the thames river bussi et al 2016 the mekong river shrestha et al 2018 the yellow river miao et al 2011 and the pearl river wu et al 2012 etc table 5 shows a correlation between annual sediment load and precipitation for the seven sub basins results showed that sediment load at most sub basins was well related to precipitation during 1956 1968 however the correlation was less significant for the period of 2003 2015 which indicated that sediment regime has been significantly altered due to the combined effects of precipitation soil conservation practices reservoir construction and land use change furthermore it is worth noting that the impact of precipitation on sediment load variation was not expected to be fully explained by the correlation between the two variables for example a significant correlation p 0 01 was found in the hr during different periods while relative contribution of precipitation to reduction in sediment load was only 0 8 2 2 and 0 6 during p1 p3 p1 p2 and p2 p3 respectively fig 8 it may be a spatio temporally nonlinear response of sediment yield to the changed precipitation that is because the effect of precipitation on sediment yield through underlying surface factors varies regionally in other words different types of land use and land cover show different responses of sediment transport for a given amount of annual precipitation the relative contribution of precipitation to the variability of sediment load varied from 8 51 to 47 6 for the seven sub basins in this study which was basically consistent with previous studies yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 overall precipitation is not the key factor of the decline in sediment load across the yzr basin during the last decades which has highlighted paramount role of anthropogenic disturbances in the change of sediment dynamics in the basin in addition previous studies have documented that sediment flux variability in river was closely related to the el niño southern oscillation enso events tote et al 2011 wang et al 2011 liu et al 2017 morera et al 2017 generally enso is strongly correlated with the sea surface temperature sst in the equatorial pacific ocean which is usually used as an indicator of enso a positive sst anomaly is responsible for drought events in the river basin by altering the intensity and spatial distribution of precipitation and may lead to the decrease in runoff and sediment flux to the ocean wang et al 2011 2017b liu et al 2017 as reported by ahmadi et al 2019 hydrological drought can reduce sediment erosion and sediment transport capacity which often results in increased sedimentation in rivers the correlation between variability in water discharge and sediment load at datong and enso indicator is shown in fig 9 there were 18 enso events during 1956 2015 characterized by sustained positive sst anomalies including seven weak seven medium and four strong events fig 9a obviously the years with particularly low water and sediment discharge were closely correlated with medium and strong enso events fig 9 for example the enso event in 1994 corresponded to the minimum sediment discharge at datong during 1956 1994 in addition the enso event in 2006 coincided with the worst drought in the yzr basin in the previous 59 years resulting in the second lowest sediment flux to the ocean during 1956 2015 5 1 2 reservoir construction it is widely acknowledged that reservoir construction is regarded as the main driver of the reduction in sediment flux to the sea worldwide syvitski et al 2005 yang et al 2006b kondolf et al 2014 gao et al 2015 lu et al 2015 it has been estimated that approximately 30 of the global riverine suspended sediment yield is trapped behind reservoirs vörösmarty et al 2003 syvitski and milliman 2007 the storage capacity of the reservoirs in the yzr basin has witnessed a rapid increase trend since the 1950s in the late 1950s the total storage capacity in the basin was only 12 km3 while it gradually rose up to 120 km3 by the end of the late 1980s and surged to more than 360 km3 by 2015 fig 10a in response to this dramatic increase in storage capacity sediment budget of the yzr basin has been significantly altered due to the cumulative sediment trapping by multiple reservoirs especially large reservoirs fig 11 the most striking human intervention in the yzr basin may be the closure of the tgd in 2003 which intercepted more than 80 of the inflow suspended sediment load due to its large capacity of sediment trapping yang et al 2014 consequently the annual suspended sediment load at yichang hankou and datong in 2003 declined by about 80 1 59 0 and 51 7 respectively compared to that in 1956 2002 therefore knowledge of sediment trapping in reservoirs is indispensable to better understand the impact of reservoir on the decrease of sediment load in the yzr basin we applied the empirical method originally developed by brune 1953 and then improved by vörösmarty et al 2003 to estimate the sediment trapping efficiency te and sedimentation rates in reservoirs firstly reservoirs were divided into different groups according to their spatial topological relationships in the sub basins yang and lu 2014 then the amount of sediment accumulated in reservoirs for each group sj can be calculated in terms of its inflowing sediment yield syj and tej the detailed equations are as follows 12 t e j 1 0 05 δ τ j 13 δ τ j i 1 m v i q j 14 s j s y j t e j where δ τ j is the residence time for each group vi is storage of reservoir i km3 qj is the mean annual water discharge at mouth of each group km3 yr 1 j is the number of groups and m is the number of reservoirs in each group considering storage volume loss due to sediment trapping by upstream reservoirs we calculated a new te for the following year through an iterative algorithm kondolf et al 2014 results showed that the estimated te varied greatly among the 244 selected large reservoirs ranging between 15 5 and 98 0 te of the twenty six controlling reservoirs ranged from 73 5 to 96 8 table 2 which indicated that the controlling reservoirs can collectively play a significant role in basin wide sediment interception the closure of each controlling reservoir is accompanied by a dramatic decline in sediment load which indicates the significant sediment starvation effect in the downstream channels as shown in fig 11 the mean annual sediment trapping by large reservoirs in the yzr basin was approximately 18 mt yr 1 from 1956 to 1968 157 mt yr 1 from 1969 to 2002 and 384 mt yr 1 from 2003 to 2015 respectively it showed that sediment deposition rate has increased rapidly and large reservoirs will continue to play a crucial role in the reduction of sediment load annual sedimentation rate of the tgd was estimated to be 136 mt yr 1 which accounted for nearly 20 of the total annual sedimentation in basin wide large reservoirs the estimated sedimentation rate based on the empirical detention equation is basically consistent with observed estimated sedimentation rate from changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 gao et al 2015 reported the annual sediment intercepted by all reservoirs and small ponds in the yzr basin was 453 mt yr 1 among which large and medium sized reservoirs contributed 354 mt yr 1 fig 12 shows the reduction of sediment concentration with an increase of the total storage capacity for the seven sub basins overall the significant increase in storage capacity and the consequent sharp decrease in sediment concentration occurred in the jsr mr jlr and wr during 2003 2015 while this phenomenon was observed in the hr dl and pl for the period of 1969 2002 specifically the jsr china s largest region for hydropower generation exhibited distinct stepwise increase in total storage capacity in the past six decades fig 12a accordingly about 72 mt yr 1 of sediment was trapped in large reservoirs during 2003 2015 fig 11 when the cumulative reservoir storage capacity was more than 5 times larger than that during 1956 2002 subsequently the decline in sediment concentration at pingshan occurred in the late 1990s but became more dramatic after 2003 in detail the et reservoir see table 2 for definitions of reservoir abbreviations was accomplished in 1998 with an estimated 23 mt yr 1 of reservoir sedimentation rate and an obvious decrease in suspended sediment concentration was then found at pingshan in 1999 fig 12a after 2012 three mega reservoirs i e the jp 1 xjb and xld were constructed successively and the mean annual sediment concentration at pingshan dropped by 99 3 from 1 624 kg m3 in 1956 2012 to 0 013 kg m3 in 2013 2015 fig 12a in the coming decades the jsr s sediment concentration is likely to be further reduced when some mega reservoirs are in their full operation such as wudongde baihetan and longpan reservoirs the mr is the largest tributary of the upper yzr in terms of water discharge from 2003 to 2015 the total storage capacity of the mr increased nearly four times fig 10b and the corresponding reservoir sedimentation rate was estimated at approximately 28 mt yr 1 fig 11 compared to that of 1956 2002 following the impoundment of the pbg reservoir in 2009 combined with the impact of a series of reservoirs such as gongzui tongjiezi and zipingpu annual sediment concentration at gaochang has been effectively reduced fig 12b the jlr is the important source of sediment in the upper yzr during 2003 2015 the cumulative storage capacity of large reservoirs within the jlr increased to 14 5 km3 fig 10b resulting in about 92 0 mt yr 1 of sediment being trapped by these reservoirs fig 11 following the closure of the bzs and tzk reservoirs in 1996 and 2013 respectively the mean sediment concentration at beibei declined sharply to 0 2 kg m3 in 1997 and further to 0 19 kg m3 in 2015 fig 12c however an abnormal peak in sediment concentration at beibei was observed in 1998 which may be caused by the great flood in that year similarly numerous large reservoirs were constructed in the wr since the 2000s accounting for the majority of the existing cumulative storage capacity fig 12d the two largest reservoirs are hjd and gpt within the wr which began their operation in 2004 and 2009 respectively the mean annual sediment accumulated in the large reservoirs of the wr increased from 9 mt yr 1 in 1969 2002 to 17 mt yr 1 in 2003 2015 fig 11 as a consequence the mean annual sediment concentration recorded at wulong decreased to 0 13 kg m3 after the operation of the hjd reservoir and further decreased to 0 06 kg m3 after the operation of the gpt reservoir leading to a cumulative decline in sediment concentration of more than 90 fig 12d the hr is the longest tributary of the yzr currently the ratio of storage capacity to annual water discharge in the hr exceeds 90 implying that it is the most regulated one among the seven sub basins the cumulative storage capacity of the hr increased dramatically by about 6 times after the djk reservoir impounded in 1967 fig 12e the water storage capacity of the reservoir increased substantially again after the djk reservoir had been heightened from 162 to 176 6 m in 2013 the djk reservoir the second largest reservoir in the yzr basin has a storage capacity of 29 05 km3 with the estimated annual sedimentation rate of 48 mt yr 1 on average as a consequence sediment concentration at huangzhuang dropped sharply to 0 37 kg m3 during 1969 2002 and further to 0 13 kg m3 during 2003 2015 fig 12e indicating that reservoir construction has played a dominant role in the reduction of sediment concentration since then by contrast for the dl especially the pl there is not a high correlation between its total storage capacity and mean annual sediment concentration due to the unique hydrological settings of the two lakes fig 12f and g the dl and pl are located at the junction of the yzr and basin wide tributaries fig 1 specifically water and sediment entering the dl come from the yzr via three inlets located in yichang chenglingji reach and four rivers xiang zi yuan and li and the dl delivers water and sediment to the yzr via chenglingji by comparison the inflow of the pl depends on five rivers gan fu xin rao and xiu and its outflow into the yzr is situated at hukou fig 1 thus sediment regime of the two lakes is closely related to their tributaries and the yzr the cumulative storage capacity of large reservoirs in the dl increased from 6 4 km3 during 1956 1968 to 16 3 km3 during 1969 2002 and then to 30 4 km3 during 2003 2015 fig 10b consequently the large reservoirs of the dl had trapped 5 mt yr 1 16 mt yr 1 and 32 mt yr 1 of sediment during these three periods respectively fig 11 in contrast fig 12g showed a much weaker correlation between cumulative storage capacity and output sediment concentration from the pl in three different periods after the zl and wa reservoirs were constructed in 1975 and 1990 respectively the total storage capacity of reservoirs in the pl increased sharply thereafter fig 12g although the output sediment concentration of the pl decreased obviously in the short term thereafter a significant increase in annual sediment concentration has been observed at hukou after 2003 in response to intense erosion and illegal sand mining within the pl fig 12g since the regulation of the tgd in 2003 the sediment budget entering the dl and pl decreased sharply owing to the significant decline in sediment source and the enlarged elevation difference between the yzr and the two lakes accordingly the dl and pl have transformed from long term accretionary state before 2003 to the erosional state thereafter which may be the reason for the increasing contribution of sediment load from the two lakes to the lower reach of the yzr dai et al 2018 thus the increasing trend in sediment concentration from dl and pl after 2003 may be partly attributed to the closure of the tgd in general the year when sediment load in the mainstream and tributaries of the yzr dropped precipitously was closely related to the operation time of the controlling reservoirs thus reservoir construction is undoubtedly the key driver resulting in decreasing riverine sediment downstream of the reservoir which in turn can erode downstream channels and alter the original sediment transport regime owing to release of sediment starved water lu et al 2015 tian et al 2019 previous studies suggested that reservoir construction could explain about 88 the total decrease in sediment load within the basin dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 however it was found that the estimated annual sedimentation behind the reservoir from the seven sub basins is not entirely consistent with the decrease in sediment load at the outlet of the sub basins this discrepancy may reflect the influences of other drivers on sediment load variation such as erosion of downstream reach and soil conservation measures in the upper yzr wu et al 2012 yang and lu 2014 lu et al 2015 5 1 3 soil and water conservation measures soil erosion is a challenging environmental concern throughout the world that has resulted in the deterioration of soil properties and fluvial sedimentation lal 2003 li and fang 2016 garcia ruiz et al 2017 thus soil management efforts have been considered critical for addressing the great challenges montgomery 2007 maetens et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 soil and water conservation practices include biological vegetation and agricultural measures and engineering measures which can improve vegetative cover and soil characteristics and increase water storage capacity and soil infiltration capacity walling 1999 this may curb the loss of water and sediment resulting in lower sediment yield in the basin maetens et al 2012 prosdocimi et al 2016 studies reported that forest coverage in the yzr basin was over 60 in the past zhang 1998 however due to massive deforestation during the great leap forward and the cultural revolution in china the average forest coverage of the yzr basin decreased from 22 in the early 1950s to 10 in the mid 1980s zhang 1998 as a result the area of soil erosion in the basin increased by nearly 54 and annual sediment yield increased by approximately 50 during the period shi 1999 therefore intense soil erosion was likely to be responsible for the increasing trend in sediment load between the 1950s and the 1980s in the yzr basin fig 3 to resolve the problem of soil and water loss in the basin the chinese government implemented soil and water conservation projects in the upper yzr in the late 1980s including four regions that suffered serious soil erosion namely the lower jsr and bijie district in guizhou province the middle lower jlr the southern region of gansu and shaanxi provinces and the three gorges reservoir region after the 1998 flood of the yzr the large scale ecological restoration projects particularly the grain for green project were launched in 1999 since then soil conservation projects have been gradually extended to the middle yzr basin such as the djk reservoir region the dl and pl the southern part of dabie mountains covering 14 provinces municipalities directly under the central government as noted by changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 the area of soil erosion in the yzr basin has been reduced to 384 600 km2 in 2015 accounting for 21 4 of the total area of the basin as a consequence the average rate of sediment reduction by soil conservation projects was 60 mt yr 1 in the yzr basin since the late 1980 chu et al 2009 we applied the dmc method to estimate the effect soil conservation techniques implemented in 1989 on the decline in sediment load annual precipitation and sediment load time series was divided into two sub periods 1956 1988 the reference period and 1989 2015 the changing period the linear relationship between cumulative precipitation and cumulative sediment load in reference period were established the cumulative sediment load in the changing period can then be predicted by using the linear regression equation determined in the reference period the difference between the observed and predicted cumulative sediment loads in the same period can be regarded as the total variation of sediment load caused by soil conservation measures in the changing period results indicated that soil and water conservation measures were responsible for 22 6 of the decline in sediment load in the yzr basin from 1989 to 2015 resulting in a mean decrease of 234 mt yr 1 among the seven main sub basins the contribution rate of soil conservation projects to the reduction of sediment load ranged between 5 4 and 39 8 resulting in an average decline from 1 3 mtyr 1 to 53 mt yr 1 therefore soil and water conservation measures have probably played the second most important role in the decrease in sediment load in the yzr basin since the late 1980s dai et al 2008 estimated that soil conservation measures contributed approximately 15 of the decline in sediment flux along the yzr basin yang et al 2015 reported that approximately 6 of the decline in sediment load at datong could be ascribed to soil and water conservation measures between 1956 and 1968 and 2003 2012 furthermore we foresee that soil and water conservation projects will play a more important role in sediment reduction in the yzr basin 5 1 4 sand mining sand mining activities affect aquatic ecosystems riverbed topography and sediment budget kondolf 1997 hossain et al 2004 wu et al 2007 lai et al 2014 duan et al 2019 extensive riverbed sand mining in the yzr is deemed to be responsible for the substantial decrease in sediment flux to the ocean chen et al 2006 dai and lu 2014 with the rapid urbanization and growth in the construction industry the demand for sand has increased rapidly in the yzr basin since the 1980s the amount of annual sand mining from the middle lower yzr increased to nearly 40 mt yr 1 in the 1980s and reached 80 mt yr 1 in the early 2000s chen et al 2006 wang et al 2007 it was documented that the total amount of sand mining reduced to 41 5 mt in 2015 due to the implementation of regulation on the administration of sand excavation in the yzr changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2015 however illegal sand dredging activities are still rampant along the yzr owing to huge commercial profits and inadequate government regulation thus the actual amount of sand mining from the middle and lower yzr would be likely to exceed 41 5 mt yr 1 it is worth noting that a large amount of illegal sand dredging vessels swarmed to the pl after the restricted limitation of sand mining on the mainstream of the yzr was implemented in 2001 wu et al 2007 de leeuw et al 2010 it was estimated that the annual volume of sediment extraction from the pl was approximately 236 mt yr 1 in 2005 2006 de leeuw et al 2010 resulting in the increased outflow of the lake and a sediment budget deficit for both the lake and the lower yzr lai et al 2014 as a result the slope of the dmc at hukou showed a significant upward trend around 2003 fig 5l mainly caused by intensive sand mining in the pl in general extensive sand mining has reduced sediment flux to the sea since the 1980s nevertheless compared with reservoir construction and soil preservation sand mining is likely to be a minor driving force of the decline in sediment discharge yang et al 2015 dai et al 2016 5 2 comparison of the results with other studies previous studies have examined the impacts of climate change and human activities on sediment reduction in the yzr basin based on empirical statistics such as the linear regression and the dmc method many studies indicated that the substantial decline in sediment discharge in the basin in recent decades can be attributed to anthropogenic influences such as large scale reservoir construction and soil and water conservation projects dai et al 2008 estimated that dam construction and soil and water conservation measures accounted for 88 and 15 5 of the total decrease in sediment flux from the yzr to the sea during 1956 2002 respectively similarly yang et al 2015 reported that the contribution of reservoir construction and soil conservation to sediment discharge reduction in the yzr were 88 and 6 for the period of 1950 2012 respectively zhao et al 2017 demonstrated that 86 89 of the decrease in sediment load in the mainstream of the yzr during 1956 2013 could be attributed to human activities while 71 102 of the decline in sediment load for the seven sub basins was ascribed to anthropogenic impacts in the present study we applied the sediment identity factor approach to quantify the effects of three variables on sediment load change fig 6 the r of a river is an index reflecting the integrated results of climatic conditions and underlying surface which is documented in the combined effects of climate variability and human activities sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 chen et al 2014 buendia et al 2016 the s is generally considered to be closely related to soil erosion sediment transport and land use change which is strongly controlled by anthropogenic activities vanmaercke et al 2014 wang et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 when only considering the influence of the s on the sediment load reduction anthropogenic impacts can explain about 100 125 of the decline in sediment load across the yzr basin in this study fig 6b which was slightly different from that in the findings of mentioned studies dai et al 2008 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 these slight discrepancies may be due to different choices of approaches data series and the baseline period used it should be noted that the dominant driving force for sediment load reduction across the yzr basin in recent decades is similar to that of the pearl river basin zhang et al 2008 wu et al 2012 but different from that of the yellow river basin wang et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 as reported by wang et al 2015 the decrease of r caused by large scale ecological rehabilitation program accounted for 58 of the sediment reduction in the yellow river basin 5 3 uncertainty of quantitative assessment the uncertainty of attribution analysis for sediment reduction is subject to the following aspects first the contributions of precipitation water yield capacity and sediment concentration to variations in sediment load were identified based on the assumption that they are independent variables however there may be an inter correlation among the three sediment identity factors zhao et al 2018 therefore it s difficult to accurately separate the relative contribution of individual factors second the selection of sub periods may lead to the uncertainty of attribution of hydrological change wang 2014 zhang et al 2018 to compare the driving force and relative contribution rate of sediment load variability in seven sub basins of the yzr the same sub periods were used for all sub basins in this study nevertheless there is a great spatial heterogeneity in climate the underlying surface and the intensity of human activities in the basin third abrupt point identification and selection of study period are crucial to separate the individual effects of different drivers on sediment load change but change points in hydrological data obtained by different methods may exhibit large differences dey and mishra 2017 furthermore due to the randomness in hydrologic regime multiple change points may be found even using the same method also clear abrupt points are not always detected due to the complex interaction of multiple driving forces thus it is a challenge to identify a reasonable abrupt point in hydrometeorological data finally suspended sediment processes in rivers are recognized to be highly nonlinear bracken et al 2015 vercruysse et al 2017 which could give rise to great uncertainty for attribution analysis of sediment load variations generally suspended sediment load is a continuous process of erosion transport and accumulation which is often characterized by a changing sediment regime across spatial and temporal scale in rivers vercruysse et al 2017 thus the three sediment identification factors p r and s used in this study are not always sufficient to interpret the changes in suspended sediment transport the sediment transport dynamics should be fully considered in future studies 5 4 implications and consequences of decrease in sediment supply from the yzr impacts of decrease in sediment flux from rivers into the ocean have attracted special attention in recent years these impacts included intensive channel scouring in the middle lower reach notable delta erosion and coastal ecosystems degradation owing to sediment starvation and the changes of sediment transport capability kondolf 1997 milliman 1997 syvitski et al 2009 yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 the decrease in sediment load in the upstream due to damming and soil conservation may be partially offset by an increase in the downstream channel erosion trimble 1999 gao et al 2015 vanmaercke et al 2015 dai et al 2018 as shown in fig 13 the middle reach of the yzr has exhibited notable riverbed scouring and bank erosion since the operation of the tgd as a result the intensive riverbed erosion has been observed downstream of the dam and has rapidly extended to hukou of the middle yzr eventually resulting in the new morphological equilibrium over the next decades dai et al 2018 lai et al 2017 li et al 2018 xia et al 2017 compared to the pre tgd period of 1957 2002 the downstream jingjiang reach between zhicheng and chenglingji saw an increase in the erosion intensity by several times during the post tgd period 2003 2015 fig 13 as a consequence the upstream of the yzr has been replaced by the middle lower reach of the river as the dominant sediment source since the closure of the tgd accounting for approximately 70 of the total sediment flux into the ocean gao et al 2015 dai et al 2018 simultaneously accelerated channel erosion will further increase the difference in elevation between the yzr and adjacent lakes resulting in the weakening of the interconnection of the river lake system consequently sediment discharge from the mainstream of the yzr to dl and pl has decreased notably since 2003 so far the dl and pl have transferred from continuous deposition before 2003 to slight deposition or erosion thereafter which are likely to contribute about 20 of sediment supply to the estuary dai et al 2018 it can therefore be expected that the altered erosion siltation pattern and river lake relationship in the middle lower yzr basin may lead to increased risk of flood and drought disasters and fluvial ecosystems safety guo et al 2012 2018 dai et al 2018 meanwhile the delta is also vulnerable to the significant reduction in sediment delivery to the sea blum and roberts 2009 giosan et al 2014 like many other mega deltas the yzr has recently experienced increased coastal erosion and shoreline recession in response to the dramatically reduced sediment supply to the delta although there has been no overwhelming erosion in the yangtze subaqueous delta it has experienced a conversion from net accretion to net erosion since 2003 yang et al 2011 dai et al 2018 guo et al 2018 thus the accelerating degradation of the yangtze deltas is likely to increase the risk of rising sea levels frequent storms estuarine flooding and shrinking coastal wetlands in recent years anthropogenic interventions have become main factors for the reduction in sediment discharge in the context of global change there is reason to believe that sediment flux from the yzr to the sea will likely continue to decline in the foreseeable future owing to the full operation of mega reservoirs in the upper yzr as well as ongoing soil and water conservation measures gao et al 2015 predicted that future sediment trapping by reservoirs will be more than 589 mt yr 1 after the closure of cascade reservoirs in the jsr and sediment flux to the sea will further decrease to 100 mt yr 1 in addition erosion capacity in the middle lower reach of the yzr is likely to decline inevitably over time and riverine sediment budget entering the ocean may be reduced to 90 mt yr 1 in the future hu et al 2009 therefore more attention should be paid to future risks to cope with the substantial reduction of sediment flux to the sea 6 conclusions this study examined the spatio temporal changes of hydrometeorological variables including temperature precipitation water discharge and sediment load across the yzr basin during 1956 2015 drivers and their quantitative contributions to the sediment load decline were estimated using the sediment identity approach the major findings of this paper are as follows during 1956 2015 annual temperature displayed a significant increase trend for all sub basins except for the jlr and wr precipitation however exhibited no significant decreasing trend for four out of the seven sub basins meanwhile annual water discharge showed no significant decrease at most stations whereas a significant downward trend in sediment load was observed throughout the basin significant abrupt change in sediment load occurred around 1968 and in the early 2000s at most stations which might result from the operation of controlling reservoirs in the basin the series of annual sediment load were divided into the reference period and changing period via breakpoints compared with the reference period p1 annual sediment load at datong decreased by 24 7 and 73 3 during p2 and p3 respectively consequently water sediment relationships across the basin have been significantly modified since 2003 characterized by the slope decline in the dmc sediment concentration was a predominant driving factor of decline in sediment load in the yzr basin accounting for approximately 100 125 of the decrease in sediment load results revealed that the construction of large reservoirs played a dominant role in the reduction of sediment load within the basin over the last six decades which was responsible for about 157 mt yr 1 and 384 mt yr 1 of reservoir sedimentation during p2 and p3 respectively soil conservation measures represented a secondary driver for reduced sediment load which resulted in a mean decline of 234 mt yr 1 in the entire basin during 1989 2015 it can be expected that sediment discharge from the yzr to the sea may further decrease substantially in the coming decades findings from this study can

5967,a variational approach for optimized drop size distribution dsd retrieval attenuation correction and rainfall estimation from polarimetric radar measurements horizontal reflectivity factor z h differential reflectivity z d r and differential phase shift φ d p is proposed in this study the spatial continuity of rain is guaranteed by introducing the radial b spine filter and azimuthal kalman filter which helps to mitigate the impact of the random errors in z d r and φ d p the approach is evaluated using a simulated experiment and two real cases observed by a mobile c band and an operational s band polarimetric radar in south china the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed variational approach can correct attenuation more accurately than the conventional method using assumed linear relationships between specific attenuation and specific differential phase the rainfalls derived from the dsd estimates based on this proposed approach agree well with the rain gauge measurements it is also shown that the proposed method has a better performance than the existing variational retrieval and the composite estimator keywords optimization raindrop size distribution retrieval rainfall estimation 1 introduction polarimetric radar data e g the horizontal reflectivity factor z h the differential reflectivity z d r and the specific differential phase shift k d p can provide the bulk information of precipitation microphysics within a wide spatial coverage in high temporal resolution retrieving raindrop size distributions dsds from polarimetric radar data provides us with a good way to study rain microphysics in addition rainfall rate can also be calculated from the retrieved dsds quantitative precipitation estimation qpe based on dsd retrieval should be less affected by storm to storm dsd variability than that using fixed form rainfall estimators brandes et al 2003 making it a promising way for flood surveillance using polarimetric radars various methods of retrieving dsds from polarimetric radar data have been proposed recent years brandes et al 2004a bringi et al 2002 cao et al 2010 cao et al 2013 gorgucci et al 2002 seliga and bringi 1976 williams et al 2014 zhang et al 2001 since a dsd contains many unknowns a model should be assumed to reduce the number of unknowns while retaining the main physical properties of dsds the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 and its derivatives are usually utilized to connect the rain properties and the polarimetric radar variables prvs for examples seliga and bringi 1976 retrieved the number concentration parameter n 0 and the drop median volume diameter d 0 using the exponential distribution from z h and z d r this study received wide attention from the radar meteorology community and paved the way for dsd retrieval zhang et al 2001 proposed to constrain the gamma distribution using a statistical relation between the shape μ and slope λ parameters dsds and the rain microphysics variables could be solved from z h and z d r using this constrained gamma dsd model this method was then extended in many studies brandes et al 2004b cao et al 2008 similarly kalogiros et al 2013 proposed to reduce the unknowns in the normalized gamma distribution using the statistical μ d 0 relationships in the parameterization of microphysical variables using the radar variables when quantitatively using radar data e g in dsd retrieval it is essential to consider attenuation and differential attenuation z h and z d r can be negatively biased after the radar beam propagates through a heavy precipitation core with respect to those are not attenuated especially at c band and higher frequencies for example for c band radars in east china the rainfall with k d p being 5 deg km 1 rainfall approximately being 100 mm hr 1 can cause about 0 5 db attenuation in z h and 0 09 db differential attenuation in z d r per kilometer huang et al 2017 even at s band z h and z d r can also be significantly affected in cases of extremely heavy rain smyth and illingworth 1998 to mitigate the impact of attenuation and differential attenuation the common way is to estimate and correct them before the quantitative application many attenuation estimation and correction approaches have been proposed bringi et al 1990 proposed that the specific attenuation a h and the specific differential attenuation a d p can be estimated from k d p using linear relationships carey et al 2000 and gu et al 2011 pointed out the ratio of a h to k d p α and the ratio of a d p to k d p β are impacted by dsd properties they used different coefficients for different rain regions according to the mean raindrop sizes which partially counteracts the uncertainty caused by dsd variabilities testud et al 2000 applied the so called zphi algorithm to the correction of z h which has been successfully applied to various kinds of radar data anagnostou et al 2008 marzano et al 2007 the accuracy of the zphi method is decided by the coefficient α adopted to calculate the path integrated attenuation pia h from the differential phase shift φ d p if α is obtained from climatic dsd observations or from simulated dsds it may not be optimal for a specific radar beam due to dsd variabilities bringi et al 2001 extended the zphi method using an α optimized by minimizing the difference between the simulated and measured φ d p while φ d p measurements of polarimetric radars can help to improve attenuation estimation and correction the afore mentioned methods have not utilized all the available information of prd kalogiros et al 2014 also proposed an algorithm called self consistent with optimal parameterization scop which corrects attenuation iteratively by using a h and a d p optimally paramterized by z h z d r and k d p kalogiros et al 2013 however the error in the k d p calcuation using range derivative filter may propagate to the attenuation correction in their study huang et al 2017 following the idea of optimization hogan 2007 hereafter h07 proposed a one dimensional variational method in which the attenuation and differential attenuation are estimated and corrected together with rainfall retrieval and hail reflectivity fraction estimation this approach has been successfully applied to some precipitation events and proves to have satisfactory performance in qpe and attenuation correction chang et al 2014 chang et al 2016 figueras i ventura et al 2010 huang et al 2018 the state variable optimized in the approach of h07 is the coefficient a in a z h r relationship which is not a physical property of rainfall in addition the dsd model assumed in the forward operator may not be able to characterize the dsd properties of a specific region cao et al 2013 extended the idea of optimization to a 2 dimensional variational approach for dsd retrieval from measured reflectivity z h m measured differential reflectivity z d r m and retrieved k d p of a plan position indicator ppi scan this approach was verified using data collected by the x and c band radars nevertheless k d p is not a directly measured variable and its error distribution depends on the estimating procedure giangrande et al 2013 hubbert and bringi 1995 hubbert et al 1993 maesaka et al 2012 the deviation of k d p error distribution from gaussian distribution would bias the variational result bröcker 2018 in addition the state variables optimized in their cost function i e λ and n 0 are also not physical properties of rainfall which may limit the accuracy of the method in this study the basic idea of the variational approach of h07 is extended to derive the optimized dsds and the corresponding physical variables mass weighted mean diameter d m liquid water content w total number concentration n t rainfall rate r and etc from the measured z h m z d r m and φ d p this approach is presented with details and tested with c band and s band polarimetric radar data collected in south china the rest of the study is organized as follows section 2 gives the background and the description of the approach section 3 describes the construction and results of a simulated experiment results for applying the approach to the real polarimetric radar measurements are presented in section 4 conclusions and discussions are given in section 5 2 material and methods to obtain the dsds corresponding to the polarimetric radar measurements at a radar beam we first assume a dsd series at the radar gates a cost function is constructed by considering the difference between the polarimetric radar variables predicted from the assumed dsds and real measurements the spatial continuity and the statistical state of precipitation can also be added to the cost function the dsd series can be iteratively refined by minimizing the cost function the dsd series is considered optimized when the minimization converges rodgers 2000 in the following subsections we elaborate on the formulas and procedures of the variational retrieval to facilitate the mathematical expressions the polarimetric radar measurements including z h m z d r m and φ d p at a n range gate ray are denoted in the vector form as follows y z h m z h 1 m z h 2 m z h n m t y z d r m z d r 1 m z d r 2 m z d r n m t 1 y φ dp φ dp 1 φ dp 2 φ dp n t where z h i m z d r i m and φ d p i denote the polarimetric radar measurements at the i th range gate note that calibration of the measurements and removal of non meteorological echoes are essential before the retrieval while the rain attenuation effect is explicitly included in our forward operator 2 1 state variable and forward operator considering the attenuation effect the polarimetric radar measurements at the radar gates can be expressed as 2 z h j m z h j pia h j z h j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 a h k 3 z dr j m z dr j pia dp j z dr j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 a dp k 4 φ dp j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 k dp k where δ r is the range resolution of the radar beam the backscattering differential phase δ h v is not included in the calculation of φ d p for the reason which we will discuss later z h z d r k d p a h a d p and δ h v can be calculated from dsds according to the scattering theorem brandes 2000 cao et al 2012 in which the scattering amplitudes used are obtained using the t matrix method mishchenko and travis 1994 and the raindrop axis ratio is derived from the equivolume diameter of the raindrops d using the same relation used in brandes et al 2002 pia h j and pia d p j are the path integrated attenuation and differential attenuation at j th range gate respectively the random errors of the measurements are omitted in 2 4 and the backscattering phase is not considered in this forward operator either considering the self consistent relationships of prv scarchilli et al 1996 vivekanandan et al 2003 and the attenuation effects and random errors in prvs it is not easy to get accurate results of three parameters n 0 μ and λ of gamma distribution from prvs z h z d r and φ d p huang et al 2019b thus a statistical μ λ relationship is used for the constraint of the gamma model in our variational scheme zhang et al 2001 the μ λ relationship can be expressed in the form of second order polynomial 5 μ p 1 λ 2 p 2 λ p 3 where p 1 p 2 and p 3 should be determined from climatic dsd observations cao et al 2008 because the accuracy of the forward operator depends on how accurately the adopted dsd model can characterize the natural variabilities in the dsds then the constrained gamma distribution is expressed as 6 n d n 0 d p 1 λ 2 p 2 λ p 3 exp λ d d min d d max since the dsd parameters n 0 and λ in 6 do not have specific physical meaning we choose d m as the state variable instead of λ d m is the ratio of the fourth moment of dsd to the third moment 7 d m d min d max d 4 n d d d d min d max d 3 n d d d if the constrained gamma dsd 6 is assumed d m is a function of λ to solve for the dsd parameters one more variable is required the first option is to include one more parameter e g w as the state variable however as we know an increased number of state variables or measurements leads to increased computational cost thus in our scheme z h m is used together with d m for the calculation of dsds we denote the d m values at the radar range gates using the vector form 8 x d m 1 d m 2 d m n t the observation vector is then expressed as y y z d r m y φ d p where the semicolon means the vertical merging of vectors and matrices the prediction of the observation vector y from d m and z h starts from the first gate of the beam where pia h is 0 db and z h equals to z h m according to 2 according to the scattering theorem and 7 the parameters n 0 and λ as well as n d can be solved from d m and z h using the assumed dsd model 6 then the prvs z d r k d p a h and a d p can be calculated from n d cao et al 2012 z d r m and φ d p measurements at the current range gate as well as the pia h at the next range are predicted according to 2 4 the z h values at the next range gates can be corrected using z h j z h j m pia h j then the prediction at the next range gate continues until the end of the ray in which the attenuation in z h m is corrected gate by gate the above procedures predicting observation vector y from x is the forward operator h x note that in the consideration of the computational cost z h m is treated similar to a state variable instead of being included in y the random errors in z h m are pre processed using a moving average filter before the prediction in our study the window sizes of the filters are about 2 km to further save computational costs and to accelerate the iterative optimization the calculation of prvs from d m and z h is simplified using lookup tables constructed in advance when the constrained gamma distribution is assumed d m z d r and the ratios of k d p a h and a d p to z h z h 10 0 1 z h only depend on the parameter λ then z d r k d p z h a h z h and a d p z h are parameterized in terms of d m and are stored in the lookup tables when calculating the prvs z d r k d p z h a h z h and a d p z h can be determined from d m using the pre constructed tables then k d p a h and a d p are known for a given z h since the scattering property of raindrops changes with temperature we have constructed the lookup tables every 2 c from 0 to 30 c in real applications to calculate prvs at a radar gate we select the lookup tables according to the temperature at the radar gate obtained from the interpolation of the nearest sounding measurements fig 1 shows the examples of the lookup tables for s band with frequency being about 2 89 ghz radars in south china at 20 c the lookup tables are on the basis of the gamma distribution constrained by μ 0 01510 λ 2 1 033 λ 2 042 the relationship is regressed using the method of sorting and averaging based on two parameters satp cao et al 2008 from two year summertime dsd observations measured by a 2 d video disdrometer 2dvd in guangdong province the descriptions and position of the disdrometer can be found in huang et al 2018 in fig 1 the relationships based on the constrained gamma distribution the black solid lines correspond well with the samples from the dsd observations the shadings although there is some uncertainty that will be discussed in the last section for comparison the relationships based on the gamma distribution constrained by a fixed μ 0 exponential distribution and a fixed μ 3 are also shown the comparison shows the gamma distribution constrained by the μ λ relationship outperforms the other two dsd models for the characterization of the dsd properties in south china which is similar to the results in huang et al 2019a 2 2 cost function and optimization for an optimization problem the cost function is usually composed of two parts i e the difference between h x and y and the difference between x and the corresponding a priori the random errors in z d r m and φ d p are assumed to be gaussian distributed bringi and chandrasekar 2001 doviak and zrnić 1993 thus the cost function is defined as follows 9 j 1 2 x x b t b 1 1 2 δ y t o 1 δ y where x b and b are the a priori vector and the corresponding error matrix of d m which we will elaborate on later δ y is the innovation vector defined as the difference between the observation vector y and the predicted observation δ y y h x o is the observational error covariance matrix corresponding to the observation vector y 10 o o z dr m z z o φ dp where z represents a zero matrix o z d r m and o φ d p are the error covariance matrix for z d r m and φ d p measurements respectively usually random errors in radar measurements are considered to be independent from gate to gate so that the error covariance matrices o z d r m o φ d p and o are diagonal in the variational analysis of data assimilation the a priori and the corresponding error covariance are usually obtained from the climatic statistics of the state variables rodgers 2000 using the climatic information to constrain the state variable is similar to introducing a smoothing filter to the retrieval when the measurement errors grow larger the d m and dsd estimates get more information from the a priori and the effect of the inaccurate measurements are mitigated however in the extreme rainfall cases the microphysics of the precipitation may show a large difference from the climatic statistics in the retrieval the microphysical information revealed by the measurements will be partially weakened by the a priori which may affect the accuracy of the retrieval in addition the variational analysis requires that the error of the a priori should be gaussian distributed otherwise the contribution of the a priori to the state variable may be biased bröcker 2018 rodgers 2000 however d m is not exactly gaussian distributed in the climatic observations or even in one case wen et al 2016a with these considerations we set x b to be equal to the median of the d m values from the climatic dsd observations but the error used in b is the variance of the d m enlarged by a factor of 25 to weaken its constraint specifically the elements in x b and the diagonal elements in b are set to 2 8 mm and 100 mm2 in our retrieval in south china since the forward operator is nonlinear and the elements in vector x should be within the certainty bounds to ensure the physical validity of d m the cost function is minimized using an algorithm of bounded nonlinear optimization here the algorithm is named the lbfgs b limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno algorithm for bound constrained large scale nonlinear optimization algorithm byrd et al 1995 sun and yuan 2006 in every step of the minimization the lbfgs b algorithm requires the value of the cost function and its gradient in terms of the state vector x the gradient of 9 in terms of x is formulated as follows 11 g x b 1 x x b h t o 1 h x y where h represents the jacobian matrix containing the partial derivatives of the forward operator i e h with respect to the state variables the detailed procedures for the derivation of h can be found in appendix a after the nonlinear minimization we can obtain the parameters n 0 μ and λ and n d from optimized d m and the attenuation corrected z h using the assumed dsd model 6 as we referred earlier then all the other radar variables can be calculated from the optimized dsd using the pre calculated scattering amplitudes cao et al 2012 the physical variables w n t r and etc can be also derived from the optimized dsd accordingly cao et al 2012 in the calculation of r terminal velocities of raindrops are parameterized using their diameter following the relationship reported in brandes et al 2002 2 3 consideration of the natural continuity of precipitation in the forward operator the φ d p curve is the integral of k d p derived from the vector x and the reflectivity measurements thus it only provides very weak constraints on the estimates on a particular gate the random errors in z d r m will directly feed back to the optimized dsds if no additional smoothing constraints are used in the variational framework fortunately the microphysical properties of the natural precipitation are generally continuous to ensure the smoothness of the dsds the cubic basis splines b splines filter is employed in the radial direction a low resolution state vector furness 2005 h07 defined as x x 1 x 2 x m is introduced to represent the major variation of d m then d m values at the range gates high resolution are obtained from the low resolution state vector using the b splines filter 12 x w x where the n m matrix w contains the pre calculated weights of b splines the matrix w is essentially an interpolation operator which eliminates the high frequency variation in x the smoothness is mainly controlled by a factor c c n m the details about this can be found in the appendix of h07 as in h07 a method similar to the kalman filter is used to ensure the azimuthal continuity this strategy is achieved by two steps i e the forward pass and the backward pass for a scan with k rays the optimization starts from the first ray ray 1 and continues to the last ray denoted as ray k in the forward pass the optimized d m vector at ray j 1 is denoted as x j 1 w x j 1 and its error covariance is denoted as s j 1 which we will elaborate on later with the spline filter and kalman filter included in the forward pass the cost function and the corresponding gradient can be written as 13 j 1 2 w x x b t b 1 w x x b 1 2 y h x t o 1 y h x 1 2 w x x j 1 t s j 1 d j 1 j 1 w x x j 1 and 14 g x w t b 1 w x x b w t h t o 1 h w x y w t s j 1 d j 1 j 1 w x x j 1 where diagonal d j 1 j is included to represent the errors caused by the decorrelation between rays j 1 and j for the statistical optimized x j the error covariance matrix s j is the inverse of the hessian matrix high resolution at the converged stage the forward operator is quasi linear near x j so the hessian matrix can be written as 15 a h t r 1 h b 1 s j 1 d j 1 j 1 note that only the diagonal elements in the inverse of a are kept in the s j for simplicity in the following backward pass the optimization starts from the last ray and continues to the first ray at ray j the solution x j 1 from the backward pass and the solution x j 1 from the forward pass are used as the constraints the formulas are similar to 13 and 14 the values of the entries in d k j are set to be proportional to the separation distance of the centers of range gates between ray k and ray j in this step the chosen constant of proportionality should make the smoothing in azimuth and range comparable after optimization 3 validation with an idealized experiment 3 1 design of the experiment in order to validate the performance of attenuation correction of the variational approach the polarimetric measurements at c band are simulated based on the dsds observed by the same 2dvd used in section 2 first we choose a time series of dsd observations obtained from the precipitation event occurred on june 28 2016 z h and z d r are simulated from the dsd observations using the scattering amplitudes calculated from the t matrix algorithm cao et al 2012 mishchenko and travis 1994 the wavelength of the simulation is set to 5 33 cm which equals to that of the c band radar used in the real cases in section 4 the high frequency fluctuations in the simulated z h and z d r data are mostly caused by the microscale variability of precipitation systems they are removed using a moving average filter huang et al 2017 the smoothed data series are then linearly interpolated and treated as a ray of radar data the simulated radar ray has a radial resolution of 75 m the interpolation is mainly conducted to ensure that the scale of the simulated storm is approximately 10 km following the idea of huang et al 2017 we then retrieve the dsds from the simulated z h and z d r data of the ray using the gamma model constrained by the μ λ relationship shown in section 2 brandes et al 2003 the other polarimetric variables including k d p a h and a d p are simulated from the dsds using the scattering amplitudes pre calculated using the t matrix algorithm these polarimetric variables without attenuation and measurement errors contained are treated as intrinsic values and will be used as references for validation of the variational algorithm in order to simulate the polarimetric measurements we further calculate the attenuated z h and z d r as well as φ d p using 2 4 then simulated measurements z h m z d r m and φ d p are obtained by including random errors with standard deviations equal to 1 db 0 2 db and 2 5 deg respectively bringi and chandrasekar 2001 to make the experiment more realistic δ h v values are also calculated from the simulated dsds and added to the simulated φ d p measurements the range profiles of the simulated polarimetric measurements as well as the intrinsic values are shown in fig 2 the whole range of the data is about 60 km the most intense part is located between 30 and 40 km where the highest k d p exceeds 4 deg km 1 the corresponding rainfall rate exceeds 100 mm hr 1 after propagating through the rain core z h m and z d r m are significantly attenuated and φ d p rapidly increases the simulated total pia h and pia d p are approximately 6 db and 0 9 db respectively note that the impact of the dsd variabilities is not fully considered in the simulation and the main purpose of the experiment is to test the performance of attenuation correction of the variational approach in the retrieval procedures the length of the state vector x is set to 40 considering the spatial correlation of d m in both the convective and the stratiform systems bringi et al 2015 the azimuthal smoothing is not performed the standard deviation of the random errors in z d r m and φ d p are set to 0 2 db and 2 5 deg respectively the random errors in z h m are processed using a 9 gate moving average filter before used in the estimation for comparison the conventional retrieval using the constrained gamma model is also performed zhang et al 2001 before the retrieval the attenuation and differential attenuation are linearly corrected using parameters regressed from the climatic dsd observations α 0 0917 and β 0 0231 bringi et al 1990 3 2 results in fig 3 the polarimetric radar variables z h z d r k d p and φ d p calculated from the estimated dsds are compared with the intrinsic values the results of the variational approach dash red lines generally correspond well with the intrinsic values solid blue lines the attenuation and differential attenuation are successfully corrected see fig 3a and b the random measurement errors 0 2 db in z d r m and 2 5 deg in φ d p are generally mitigated using the radial b spline filter three statistical indices including the correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and relative bias rb whose definition can be found in appendix b are utilized to quantify the performance as shown in table 1 the cc values between the polarimetric radar variables and the corresponding intrinsic values are very close to 1 0 and the rmse and rb values are low the minor inconsistency between the retrieved and the intrinsic range profiles is mainly attributed to the residual low frequency part of the random errors by contrast the performance of the results from the conventional retrieval is generally worse the estimated z h z d r and φ d p clearly deviate from the intrinsic values especially behind the rain core this is mainly because the statistical parameters α and β are too large for the simulated ray the uncertainties in the attenuation correction propagate to the retrieval and the calculated polarimetric variables in fig 3a and b the difference between the calculated z h z d r values cyan solid lines and the intrinsic values the blue solid lines becomes evident behind the rain core the cc value for z d r obtained from the conventional retrieval significantly decreases to 0 70 table 1 the rmse and rb values for z h z d r and φ d p are also higher than those in the variational retrieval especially for z d r the difference for k d p in fig 3d is not very significant because the positive biases in z h partially offset the effects of the positive biases in z d r however in some other cases the biases of z h and z d r may cause large k d p biases the comparison of the derived microphysical parameters d m n t and w and the rainfall rate is shown in fig 4 similar to the results in fig 3 the overall performance of the variational approach is good except for the minor errors due to the residual of the random measurement errors the cc values between the derived parameters d m n t w and r and their intrinsic values are close to 1 and the rmse and rb values are generally low table 1 in the conventional retrieval the d m values fig 4a are positively biased behind the heavy rain core due to the biases in the attenuation corrected z d r cyan solid line in fig 3b there are also nonnegligible errors in n t w and r which will deteriorate further rain microphysics studies and qpe fluctuations in d m and n t from the conventional retrieval are also larger than those from the variational approach this suggests the moving average filters for the processes of z d r and φ d p are not as good as the radial b spline filter in the variational approach the same conclusion can also be drawn from the statistical indices shown in table 1 the cc rmse and rb values for the parameters d m n t w and r derived using the conventional approach are generally lower higher than those derived from the variational approach 4 validation with real cases 4 1 verification using c band polarimetric data in the summer of 2017 the nanjing university c band polarimetric radar nju c pol is deployed to the northwest of the 2dvd site on may 23 24 2017 a precipitation system passed over the 2dvd site and the radar site in this event the variational approach is applied to the data collected by nju c pol to evaluate its performance the main parameters of nju c pol and the quality control procedures before the retrieval can be found in huang et al 2017 a ppi image 2 4 deg elevation of the radar data observed by nju c pol at 23 31 may 23 is shown in fig 5 this system causes widespread precipitation with convective echoes embedded when the radar beam passes through heavy rainfall region to the southeast of the radar site z h fig 5a and z d r fig 5b are attenuated and φ d p fig 5e increases significantly at the far side of the region of heavy rainfall z d r becomes negative the maximum value of φ d p measurements exceeds 180 deg according to fig 5 we know that z h and z d r measurements can barely quantify the properties of precipitation and the attenuation part must be corrected for quantitative applications after the retrieval using the proposed variational approach the polarimetric radar variables for rain including z h z d r and k d p are calculated from the retrieved dsds using the scattering amplitudes calculated for nju c pol cao et al 2012 note that the errors of z d r and φ d p are assumed to be equal to 0 2 db and 2 0 deg after quality control based on fig 5b and d we can find the attenuation in z h and the differential attenuation in z d r are optimized within the retrieval the negative z d r values disappear z h and z d r are continuous in radial and azimuthal directions in the calculated k d p fig 5f the large values correspond to the regions characterized by a rapid increase in φ d p the calculated k d p is also consistent with z h and z d r vivekanandan et al 2003 the microphysical parameters and rainfall rate are also calculated from the optimized dsds as shown in fig 6 the estimated d m fig 6a has the same pattern as the calculated z d r as expected generally the convective echoes with larger z h fig 5b have larger raindrop size and larger w however the convective and the stratiform echoes can also have comparable total number concentrations n t fig 6c even when the z h values are different for the precipitation with similar z h the dsds as well as mean drop size can also show diversity to examine the performance of the proposed variational approach the dsds estimated from the data of nju c pol are compared against those measured by the 2dvd in this event the event totally lasts for more than 9 h as shown in fig 5a the 2dvd site is about 40 km to the southeast of nju c pol for the radar scan at the elevation of 2 4 deg the vertical distance between the 2dvd site and the radar volume above is about 1800 m as shown in fig 7 the time series of z h and z d r calculated from dsds estimated using the variational approach above the 2dvd site black dots are shown together with those calculated from the 2dvd measurements black lines for comparison we also show the z h and z d r measurements gray squares in which the attenuation is corrected using linear relationships α 0 0917 β 0 0231 the precipitation above the 2dvd site contains both stratiform and convective echoes generally both the black dots and the gray squares are closely aligned with the black lines though the radar measurements have a lower temporal resolution about 7 min than the 2dvd 1 min sometimes mismatches also exist for example at about 01 10 may 24 both the black dots and the gray squares show differences from the black line in fig 7a the mismatches are mainly attributed to the difference between the sampling volumes of these two different instruments the vertical microphysical evolution of precipitation and the measurement errors of the instruments in z d r obtained by the conventional attenuation correction algorithm the negative values exist due to the random errors in z d r measurements and the uncertainty in β generally the results from the variational approach match better than those from the conventional approaches as shown by the statistical indices in table 2 the cc values for z h and z d r obtained by the variational approach are high 0 95 for z h and 0 87 for z d r and those obtained by the linear correction are lower 0 93 for z h and 0 81 for z d r the rmse values are also lower for the results of the variational approach in addition the positive value of rb 29 4 for z d r obtained by the linear attenuation correction indicates β is too large for this event in order to show the performance of dsd retrieval the retrieved microphysical parameters d m w and n t and rainfall rates from the variational approach are compared with those from the disdrometer measurements within the same period in fig 8 the conventional dsd retrieval using the constrained gamma model is also applied on z h and z d r measurements with attenuation corrected using linear relationships gray squares in fig 7 generally the retrieved microphysical parameters and rainfall rates coincide well with the measurements in fig 8a the d m obtained from the variational approach is consistent with disdrometer measurements most of the time in contrast the result based on the conventional retrieval shows more fluctuations which is attributed to more fluctuations in z d r corresponding to the lower cc value 0 67 and larger rmse value 0 25 compared to the results of the variational approach table 2 the positive bias in z d r values corrected using the linear relationships also results in the positive biases in d m rb 10 2 in addition when z d r measurements are negative no valid solution exists for conventional retrieval however it is not a problem for the variational approach for n t both approaches show a bit underestimation it is mainly because the moment orders of n t and z h have a large difference and it is difficult to estimate n t from z h brandes et al 2004b for the estimation of w and r the main advantage of the variational approach over the convectional approach is its ability to obtain reasonable solutions when z d r is negative in the meantime the higher cc lower rmse and lower rb values for the physical variables d m n t w and r obtained by the variational approach indicate its better performance compared to the conventional retrieval table 2 note that in this comparison the 2dvd site is not very far away from the radar site and the attenuation does not get very large when the attenuation gets larger if the rain is heavier or the variational approach is applied on x band radar data the advantage of the variational dsd retrieval may be more evident 4 2 application for qpe using s band polarimetric data on may 27 28 2016 a precipitation system passed over guangdong province which caused severe rainfall in cities the largest accumulated rainfall exceeded 230 mm from 00 00 utc may 27 to 12 00 utc may 29 the observations of guangzhou s pol in this event are used to examine the performance of the variational approach for qpe the details of guangzhou s pol and the procedures for the calibration and nonprecipitating echo removal can be found in huang et al 2018 the errors in z d r and φ d p are also assumed to be equal to 0 2 db and 2 0 deg in the retrieval the ppi images of the polarimetric measurements and the corresponding rainfall rate estimates of the variational approach at 21 30 utc may 27 are shown in fig 9 a linear weather system lies to the east of the radar site moving from the southwest towards the northeast the convective precipitation with z h above 40 dbz mainly has z d r reaching up to 2 db which is generally larger than that of stratiform precipitation when the radar beam propagates through the precipitation φ d p increases with the largest values in the south part over 60 deg in the meantime r values calculated from the optimized dsds are consistent with the measurements large r values are mainly located at the regions where z h values are large and φ d p values increase rapidly to quantitatively assess the qpe performance the rainfall rate calculated from the optimized dsds above the gauge sites are accumulated and compared against the measurements of rain gauges before the comparison the data of rain gauges are also quality controlled using a method of speckle filtering as in huang et al 2018 to make the assessment more objective two additional qpe algorithms are introduced for comparison the first one is the variational method proposed by h07 with the same configuration as in huang et al 2018 in conventional qpe combining the rainfall estimators e g r z h r z h z d r and r k d p according to their error distributions is a promising way to improve the accuracy of qpe bringi et al 2011 thus a composite rainfall estimator based on r z h r z h z d r and r k d p relationships is selected as the other algorithm for comparison in which the rule for composition is based on the ranges of r z h z d r and k d p in the study we use the same composition rule as that used in bringi et al 2011 furthermore to mitigate the impact of dsd variability on the composite estimator the r z h r z h z d r and r k d p relationships are tuned for south china using the dsd dataset huang et al 2018 as follows 16 r z h 0 0752 z h 0 598 17 r z h z dr 3 894 10 3 z h 0 990 z dr 3 935 18 r k dp 51 132 k dp 0 785 where z h and z d r are in the linear scale for the composite rainfall estimator k d p is estimated using an adaptive least square fitting method huang et al 2017 the comparisons of the radar derived hourly accumulated rainfalls ars and the rain gauge measurements are shown in fig 10 compared to the gauge measurements the hourly ars estimated by the variational approach show a high cc 0 95 a low rmse 1 52 mm and a low rb 3 4 suggesting the high accuracy of the qpe using the proposed variational approach in this event the hourly rainfall estimates of the variational approach proposed by h07 have a slightly lower cc 0 91 and a larger rmse 1 90 mm in addition a more significant overestimation 24 4 exists especially when the rainfall is light 10 mm the overestimation is mainly because the dsd model used in h07 the gamma distribution with μ 3 cannot well characterize the dsd properties in this event see fig 1 for the composite estimator tuned for south china fig 10c the results also exhibit a comparable cc 0 96 and rmse 1 50 mm with the variational approach proposed in this study however it shows a nonnegligible underestimation r b 22 2 a possible reason is that the microphysical properties of this event do not agree well with the statistics obtained by the dsd dataset for the whole summer the composite rainfall estimator and the coefficients for attenuation correction obtained from the dsd dataset suffer from dsd variability in a specific event and may cause underestimation or overestimation in contrast the rainfall rate and attenuation are estimated from retrieved dsds in the proposed variational approach which makes qpe less sensitive to dsd variabilities in rainfall cases in the comparisons of the total rainfall accumulated for the whole event fig 11 the performance of the three approaches is generally consistent with that indicated by fig 10 according to the rain gauge measurements most extreme rainfall occurs to the south and east of the radar site overestimation and underestimation exist in the total ars based on the variational approach at some gauge sites the result obtained by the proposed variational approach is generally satisfactory especially at the sites with heavy rainfall greater than 100 mm compared to the result in fig 11a the overestimation at some regions near the radar site gets more significant in the results based on the approach of h07 this may be attributed to its inappropriate dsd model in contrast evident underestimation exists in the estimates of the composite estimator at most gauge sites 5 conclusion and discussion in this study a variational approach for optimized dsd retrieval and rainfall estimation from polarimetric radar measurements z h z d r and φ d p is proposed the attenuation effect of rain is included in the forward operator the spatial continuity of rain is guaranteed by introducing the radial b spine filter and azimuthal kalman filter when the difference between the measured and predicted polarimetric variables is minimized considering all the above effects the dsds are considered to be optimized how z d r and φ d p measurements provide information to the optimized dsds is weighted by their errors the detailed derivations of the formulas for the proposed variational approach are shown in appendix a in this idealized experiment the variational approach is validated and compared with the conventional method while the dsd variabilities are not considered the comparison shows the ability of the variational approach to get optimized attenuation and dsds the variational approach is also applied to the observations of nju c pol on may 23 24 2017 the polarimetric variables and the microphysical parameters calculated from the dsd estimates of the variational approach agree well with the 2dvd measurements showing high cc low rmse and low rb values the variational dsd retrieval approach outperforms the conventional retrieval using linearly attenuation corrected z h z d r and the constrained gamma model in the event qpe using the variational approach is evaluated using observations of guangzhou spol compared against the gauge measurements the hourly accumulated rainfalls show a very high cc 0 95 a low rmse 1 52 mm and a low relative bias 3 4 in the event in contrast significant overestimation underestimation exists in the hourly accumulated rainfalls based on the approach proposed by h07 the composite estimator bringi et al 2011 the comparison of total accumulated rainfalls in this event also demonstrates a similar result the variational dsd retrieval approach is extended from the approach of h07 we use the microphysical variable d m as the state variable instead of the coefficient a in h07 which lacks explicit physical meaning in addition the dsd model used in the approach of h07 may not be able to characterize the dsd properties well in south china these may be the reason why its qpe results are worse than the results of our proposed approach the forward operator used in this study is based on the gamma distribution constrained by the statistical μ λ relationship tuned for south china even so there is some uncertainty in this constrained gamma distribution fig 1 whose impact to the retrieval varies case by case and is out of the scope of the current study besides rainfall rate our proposed approach also provides other physical properties of rainfall d m w n t and etc which are not considered in the original version of the approach of h07 the variational approach proves to be a promising way to correct the attenuation and obtain optimized dsd and rainfall simultaneously the main object to propose this variational framework for optimized estimation of rainfall rate and other microphysical parameters is to mitigate the uncertainty caused by attenuation hail and random measurement errors on the retrieval from this perspective the variational framework is applicable for dsd retrieval and qpe not only for south china but also for other places with the regional variabilities of the forward operator radial b spline filter and azimuthal kalman filter being considered an important feature of the variational approach is that the attenuation effect is included in the forward operator the a h and a d p estimates are compatible with the dsd estimates which is different from the conventional attenuation correction algorithms using the assumed relationships between attenuation differential attenuation and k d p bringi et al 1990 for the conventional algorithms the coefficients α and β are usually determined from climatic dsd observations the same α and β values are usually utilized for a volume scan carey et al 2000 gu et al 2011 it may cause errors in a h and a d p at each range gate and then propagate to dsd retrieval in the proposed variational approach the connection of attenuation to dsd makes the estimation globally optimized and may probably reduce the error propagation although it is not mentioned in the main text hail fraction is also included as a state variable refer to appendix a it is mainly used to mitigate errors in dsd estimates when hail exists in this condition the useful information on rain is mainly masked by hail and the useful information for the rain is mainly introduced by the a priori and the surrounding range gates due to the inclusion of radial and azimuthal filters in this study however the estimates of the hail fraction are not fully examined due to the lack of in situ measurements of hail the accuracy of quantitative retrieval of hail will be left for future studies as we mentioned earlier the backscattering differential phase is not considered in the forward operator in this study it is mainly because δ h v is usually not large compared to the measurement errors of φ d p for c and s band radars except for large raindrops and melting hail in addition the impact of δ h v can be mitigated by the information provided by z h and z d r since one advantage of the variational algorithm is that all available information can be combined for the retrieval in some cases of melting hail δ h v can be large and affect the retrieval however the hail regions may have a more severe impact since the effect of δ h v can already be partially mitigated by the combination of z h and z d r no extra constraints have been introduced for backscattering differential phase and higher priority has been given to the processing of hail regions however in the future a forward operator in which δ h v is accurately formulated in terms of rain dsd melting fraction and hail fraction may help to improve the retrieval for x band radars δ h v values can be larger especially in the cases of melting hail this can cause more uncertainty when applying the variational algorithm to x band radar data and more concern should be put on the

appendix a the details about the forward operators and the derivation of the jacobian matrix h used in the proposed variational approach are elaborated on in this appendix to make the description more comprehensive the retrieval is performed with hail considered for range gates where hailstones exist reflectivity factor values at both horizontal and vertical channels increase and z d r measurement shift towards 0 db this will contaminate the dsd retrieval similar to h07 we adopt a two step strategy to deal with this i e an identification pass and a retrieval pass refer to h07 for more details

conventionally hail is assumed to produce negligible attenuation thus a h z h h a i l is set to a constant 0 db km 1mm 6m3 in this study the polarimetric measurement z d r j m is a combination of the

5967,a variational approach for optimized drop size distribution dsd retrieval attenuation correction and rainfall estimation from polarimetric radar measurements horizontal reflectivity factor z h differential reflectivity z d r and differential phase shift φ d p is proposed in this study the spatial continuity of rain is guaranteed by introducing the radial b spine filter and azimuthal kalman filter which helps to mitigate the impact of the random errors in z d r and φ d p the approach is evaluated using a simulated experiment and two real cases observed by a mobile c band and an operational s band polarimetric radar in south china the comparative results demonstrate that the proposed variational approach can correct attenuation more accurately than the conventional method using assumed linear relationships between specific attenuation and specific differential phase the rainfalls derived from the dsd estimates based on this proposed approach agree well with the rain gauge measurements it is also shown that the proposed method has a better performance than the existing variational retrieval and the composite estimator keywords optimization raindrop size distribution retrieval rainfall estimation 1 introduction polarimetric radar data e g the horizontal reflectivity factor z h the differential reflectivity z d r and the specific differential phase shift k d p can provide the bulk information of precipitation microphysics within a wide spatial coverage in high temporal resolution retrieving raindrop size distributions dsds from polarimetric radar data provides us with a good way to study rain microphysics in addition rainfall rate can also be calculated from the retrieved dsds quantitative precipitation estimation qpe based on dsd retrieval should be less affected by storm to storm dsd variability than that using fixed form rainfall estimators brandes et al 2003 making it a promising way for flood surveillance using polarimetric radars various methods of retrieving dsds from polarimetric radar data have been proposed recent years brandes et al 2004a bringi et al 2002 cao et al 2010 cao et al 2013 gorgucci et al 2002 seliga and bringi 1976 williams et al 2014 zhang et al 2001 since a dsd contains many unknowns a model should be assumed to reduce the number of unknowns while retaining the main physical properties of dsds the gamma distribution proposed by ulbrich 1983 and its derivatives are usually utilized to connect the rain properties and the polarimetric radar variables prvs for examples seliga and bringi 1976 retrieved the number concentration parameter n 0 and the drop median volume diameter d 0 using the exponential distribution from z h and z d r this study received wide attention from the radar meteorology community and paved the way for dsd retrieval zhang et al 2001 proposed to constrain the gamma distribution using a statistical relation between the shape μ and slope λ parameters dsds and the rain microphysics variables could be solved from z h and z d r using this constrained gamma dsd model this method was then extended in many studies brandes et al 2004b cao et al 2008 similarly kalogiros et al 2013 proposed to reduce the unknowns in the normalized gamma distribution using the statistical μ d 0 relationships in the parameterization of microphysical variables using the radar variables when quantitatively using radar data e g in dsd retrieval it is essential to consider attenuation and differential attenuation z h and z d r can be negatively biased after the radar beam propagates through a heavy precipitation core with respect to those are not attenuated especially at c band and higher frequencies for example for c band radars in east china the rainfall with k d p being 5 deg km 1 rainfall approximately being 100 mm hr 1 can cause about 0 5 db attenuation in z h and 0 09 db differential attenuation in z d r per kilometer huang et al 2017 even at s band z h and z d r can also be significantly affected in cases of extremely heavy rain smyth and illingworth 1998 to mitigate the impact of attenuation and differential attenuation the common way is to estimate and correct them before the quantitative application many attenuation estimation and correction approaches have been proposed bringi et al 1990 proposed that the specific attenuation a h and the specific differential attenuation a d p can be estimated from k d p using linear relationships carey et al 2000 and gu et al 2011 pointed out the ratio of a h to k d p α and the ratio of a d p to k d p β are impacted by dsd properties they used different coefficients for different rain regions according to the mean raindrop sizes which partially counteracts the uncertainty caused by dsd variabilities testud et al 2000 applied the so called zphi algorithm to the correction of z h which has been successfully applied to various kinds of radar data anagnostou et al 2008 marzano et al 2007 the accuracy of the zphi method is decided by the coefficient α adopted to calculate the path integrated attenuation pia h from the differential phase shift φ d p if α is obtained from climatic dsd observations or from simulated dsds it may not be optimal for a specific radar beam due to dsd variabilities bringi et al 2001 extended the zphi method using an α optimized by minimizing the difference between the simulated and measured φ d p while φ d p measurements of polarimetric radars can help to improve attenuation estimation and correction the afore mentioned methods have not utilized all the available information of prd kalogiros et al 2014 also proposed an algorithm called self consistent with optimal parameterization scop which corrects attenuation iteratively by using a h and a d p optimally paramterized by z h z d r and k d p kalogiros et al 2013 however the error in the k d p calcuation using range derivative filter may propagate to the attenuation correction in their study huang et al 2017 following the idea of optimization hogan 2007 hereafter h07 proposed a one dimensional variational method in which the attenuation and differential attenuation are estimated and corrected together with rainfall retrieval and hail reflectivity fraction estimation this approach has been successfully applied to some precipitation events and proves to have satisfactory performance in qpe and attenuation correction chang et al 2014 chang et al 2016 figueras i ventura et al 2010 huang et al 2018 the state variable optimized in the approach of h07 is the coefficient a in a z h r relationship which is not a physical property of rainfall in addition the dsd model assumed in the forward operator may not be able to characterize the dsd properties of a specific region cao et al 2013 extended the idea of optimization to a 2 dimensional variational approach for dsd retrieval from measured reflectivity z h m measured differential reflectivity z d r m and retrieved k d p of a plan position indicator ppi scan this approach was verified using data collected by the x and c band radars nevertheless k d p is not a directly measured variable and its error distribution depends on the estimating procedure giangrande et al 2013 hubbert and bringi 1995 hubbert et al 1993 maesaka et al 2012 the deviation of k d p error distribution from gaussian distribution would bias the variational result bröcker 2018 in addition the state variables optimized in their cost function i e λ and n 0 are also not physical properties of rainfall which may limit the accuracy of the method in this study the basic idea of the variational approach of h07 is extended to derive the optimized dsds and the corresponding physical variables mass weighted mean diameter d m liquid water content w total number concentration n t rainfall rate r and etc from the measured z h m z d r m and φ d p this approach is presented with details and tested

describes the construction and results of a simulated experiment results for applying the approach to the real polarimetric radar measurements are presented in section 4 conclusions and discussions are given in section 5 2 material and methods to obtain the dsds corresponding to the polarimetric radar measurements at a radar beam we first assume a dsd series at the radar gates a cost function is constructed by considering the difference between the polarimetric radar variables predicted from the assumed dsds and real measurements the spatial continuity and the statistical state of precipitation can also be added to the cost function the dsd series can be iteratively refined by minimizing the cost function the dsd series is considered optimized when the minimization converges rodgers 2000 in the following subsections we elaborate on the formulas and procedures of the variational retrieval to facilitate the mathematical expressions the polarimetric radar measurements including z h m z d r m and φ d p at a n range gate ray are denoted in the vector form as follows y z h m z h 1 m z h 2 m z h n m t y z d r m z d r 1 m z d r 2 m z d r n m t 1 y φ dp φ dp 1 φ dp 2 φ dp n t where z h i m z d r i m and φ d p i denote the polarimetric radar measurements at the i th range gate note that calibration of the measurements and removal of non meteorological echoes are essential before the retrieval while the rain attenuation effect is explicitly included in our forward operator 2 1 state variable and forward operator considering the attenuation effect the polarimetric radar measurements at the radar gates can be expressed as 2 z h j m z h j pia h j z h j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 a h k 3 z dr j m z dr j pia dp j z dr j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 a dp k 4 φ dp j 2 δ r k 1 j 1 k dp k where δ r is the range resolution of the radar beam the backscattering differential phase δ h v is not included in the calculation of φ d p for the reason which we will discuss later z h z d r k d p a h a d p and δ h v can be calculated from dsds according to the scattering theorem brandes 2000 cao et al 2012 in which the scattering amplitudes used are obtained using the t matrix method mishchenko and travis 1994 and the raindrop axis ratio is derived from the equivolume diameter of the raindrops d using the same relation used in brandes et al 2002 pia h j and pia d p j are the path integrated attenuation and differential attenuation at j th range gate respectively the random errors of the measurements are omitted in 2 4 and the backscattering phase is not considered in this forward operator either considering the self consistent relationships of prv scarchilli et al 1996 vivekanandan et al 2003 and the attenuation effects and random errors in prvs it is not easy to get accurate results of three parameters n 0 μ and λ of gamma distribution from prvs z h z d r and φ d p huang et al 2019b thus a statistical μ λ relationship is used for the constraint of the gamma model in our variational scheme zhang et al 2001 the μ λ relationship can be expressed in the form of second order polynomial 5 μ p 1 λ 2 p 2 λ p 3 where p 1 p 2 and p 3 should be determined from climatic dsd observations cao et al 2008 because the accuracy of the forward operator depends on how accurately the adopted dsd model can characterize the natural variabilities in the dsds then the constrained gamma distribution is expressed as 6 n d n 0 d p 1 λ 2 p 2 λ p 3 exp λ d d min d d max since the dsd parameters n 0 and λ in 6 do not have specific physical meaning we choose d m as the state variable instead of λ d m is the ratio of the fourth moment of dsd to the third moment 7 d m d min d max d 4 n d d d d min d max d 3 n d d d if the constrained gamma dsd 6 is assumed d m is a function of λ to solve for the dsd parameters one more variable is required the first option is to include one more parameter e g w as the state variable however as we know an increased number of state variables or measurements leads to increased computational cost thus in our scheme z h m is used together with d m for the calculation of dsds we denote the d m values at the radar range gates using the vector form 8 x d m 1 d m 2 d m n t the observation vector is then expressed as y y z d r m y φ d p where the semicolon means the vertical merging of vectors and matrices the prediction of the observation vector y from d m and z h starts from the first gate of the beam where pia h is 0 db and z h equals to z h m according to 2 according to the scattering theorem and 7 the parameters n 0 and λ as well as n d can be solved from d m and z h using the assumed dsd model 6 then the prvs z d r k d p a h and a d p can be calculated from n d cao et al 2012 z d r m and φ d p measurements at the current range gate as well as the pia h at the next range are predicted according to 2 4 the z h values at the next range gates can be corrected using z h j z h j m pia h j then the prediction at the next range gate continues until the end of the ray in which the attenuation in z h m is corrected gate by gate the above procedures predicting observation vector y from x is the forward operator h x note that in the consideration of the computational cost z h m is treated similar to a state variable instead of being included in y the random errors in z h m are pre processed using a moving average filter before the prediction in our study the window sizes of the filters are about 2 km to further save computational costs and to accelerate the iterative optimization the calculation of prvs from d m and z h is simplified using lookup tables constructed in advance when the constrained gamma distribution is assumed d m z d r and the ratios of k d p a h and a d p to z h z h 10 0 1 z h only depend on the parameter λ then z d r k d p z h a h z h and a d p z h are parameterized in terms of d m and are stored in the lookup tables when calculating the prvs z d r k d p z h a h z h and a d p z h can be determined from d m using the pre constructed tables then k d p a h and a d p are known for a given z h since the scattering property of raindrops changes with temperature we have constructed the lookup tables every 2 c from 0 to 30 c in real applications to calculate prvs at a radar gate we select the lookup tables according to the temperature at the radar gate obtained from the interpolation of the nearest sounding measurements fig 1 shows the examples of the lookup tables for s band with frequency being about 2 89 ghz radars in south china at 20 c the lookup tables are on the basis of the gamma distribution constrained by μ 0 01510 λ 2 1 033 λ 2 042 the relationship is regressed using the method of sorting and averaging based on two parameters satp cao et al 2008 from two year summertime dsd observations measured by a 2 d video disdrometer 2dvd in guangdong province the descriptions and position of the disdrometer can be found in huang et al 2018 in fig 1 the relationships based on the constrained gamma distribution the black solid lines correspond well with the samples from the dsd observations the shadings although there is some uncertainty that will be discussed in the last section for comparison the relationships based on the gamma distribution constrained by a fixed μ 0 exponential distribution and a fixed μ 3 are also shown the comparison shows the gamma distribution constrained by the μ λ relationship outperforms the other two dsd models for the characterization of the dsd properties in south china which is similar to the results in huang et al 2019a 2 2 cost function and optimization for an optimization problem the cost function is usually composed of two parts i e the difference between h x and y and the difference between x and the corresponding a priori the random errors in z d r m and φ d p are assumed to be gaussian distributed bringi and chandrasekar 2001 doviak and zrnić 1993 thus the cost function is defined as follows 9 j 1 2 x x b t b 1 1 2 δ y t o 1 δ y where x b and b are the a priori vector and the corresponding error matrix of d m which we will elaborate on later δ y is the innovation vector defined as the difference between the observation vector y and the predicted observation δ y y h x o is the observational error covariance matrix corresponding to the observation vector y 10 o o z dr m z z o φ dp where z represents a zero matrix o z d r m and o φ d p are the error covariance matrix for z d r m and φ d p measurements respectively usually random errors in radar measurements are considered to be independent from gate to gate so that the error covariance matrices o z d r m o φ d p and o are diagonal in the variational analysis of data assimilation the a priori and the corresponding error covariance are usually obtained from the climatic statistics of the state variables rodgers 2000 using the climatic information to constrain the state variable is similar to introducing a smoothing filter to the retrieval when the measurement errors grow larger the d m and dsd estimates get more information from the a priori and the effect of the inaccurate measurements are mitigated however in the extreme rainfall cases the microphysics of the precipitation may show a large difference from the climatic statistics in the retrieval the microphysical information revealed by the measurements will be partially weakened by the a priori which may affect the accuracy of the retrieval in addition the variational analysis requires that the error of the a priori should be gaussian distributed otherwise the contribution of the a priori to the state variable may be biased bröcker 2018 rodgers 2000 however d m is not exactly gaussian distributed in the climatic observations or even in one case wen et al 2016a with these considerations we set x b to be equal to the median of the d m values from the climatic dsd observations but the error used in b is the variance of the d m enlarged by a factor of 25 to weaken its constraint specifically the elements in x b and the diagonal elements in b are set to 2 8 mm and 100 mm2 in our retrieval in south china since the forward operator is nonlinear and the elements in vector x should be within the certainty bounds to ensure the physical validity of d m the cost function is minimized using an algorithm of bounded nonlinear optimization here the algorithm is named the lbfgs b limited memory broyden fletcher goldfarb shanno algorithm for bound constrained large scale nonlinear optimization algorithm byrd et al 1995 sun and yuan 2006 in every step of the minimization the lbfgs b algorithm requires the value of the cost function and its gradient in terms of the state vector x the gradient of 9 in terms of x is formulated as follows 11 g x b 1 x x b h t o 1 h x y where h represents the jacobian matrix containing the partial derivatives of the forward operator i e h with respect to the state variables the detailed procedures for the derivation of h can be found in appendix a after the nonlinear minimization we can obtain the parameters n 0 μ and λ and n d from optimized d m and the attenuation corrected z h using the assumed dsd model 6 as we referred earlier then all the other radar variables can be calculated from the optimized dsd using the pre calculated scattering amplitudes cao et al 2012 the physical variables w n t r and etc can be also derived from the optimized dsd accordingly cao et al 2012 in the calculation of r terminal velocities of raindrops are parameterized using their diameter following the relationship reported in brandes et al 2002 2 3 consideration of the natural continuity of precipitation in the forward operator the φ d p curve is the integral of k d p derived from the vector x and the reflectivity measurements thus it only provides very weak constraints on the estimates on a particular gate the random errors in z d r m will directly feed back to the optimized dsds if no additional smoothing constraints are used in the variational framework fortunately the microphysical properties of the natural precipitation are generally continuous to ensure the smoothness of the dsds the cubic basis splines b splines filter is employed in the radial direction a low resolution state vector furness 2005 h07 defined as x x 1 x 2 x m is introduced to represent the major variation of d m then d m values at the range gates high resolution are obtained from the low resolution state vector using the b splines filter 12 x w x where the n m matrix w contains the pre calculated weights of b splines the matrix w is essentially an interpolation operator which eliminates the high frequency variation in x the smoothness is mainly controlled by a factor c c n m the details about this can be found in the appendix of h07 as in h07 a method similar to the kalman filter is used to ensure the azimuthal continuity this strategy is achieved by two steps i e the forward pass and the backward pass for a scan with k rays the optimization starts from the first ray ray 1 and continues to the last ray denoted as ray k in the forward pass the optimized d m vector at ray j 1 is denoted as x j 1 w x j 1 and its error covariance is denoted as s j 1 which we will elaborate on later with the spline filter and kalman filter included in the forward pass the cost function and the corresponding gradient can be written as 13 j 1 2 w x x b t b 1 w x x b 1 2 y h x t o 1 y h x 1 2 w x x j 1 t s j 1 d j 1 j 1 w x x j 1 and 14 g x w t b 1 w x x b w t h t o 1 h w x y w t s j 1 d j 1 j 1 w x x j 1 where diagonal d j 1 j is included to represent the errors caused by the decorrelation between rays j 1 and j for the statistical optimized x j the error covariance matrix s j is the inverse of the hessian matrix high resolution at the converged stage the forward operator is quasi linear near x j so the hessian matrix can be written as 15 a h t r 1 h b 1 s j 1 d j 1 j 1 note that only the diagonal elements in the inverse of a are kept in the s j for simplicity in the following backward pass the optimization starts from the last ray and continues to the first ray at ray j the solution x j 1 from the backward pass and the solution x j 1 from the forward pass are used as the constraints the formulas are similar to 13 and 14 the values of the entries in d k j are set to be proportional to the separation distance of the centers of range gates between ray k and ray j in this step the chosen constant of proportionality should make the smoothing in azimuth and range comparable after optimization 3 validation with an idealized experiment 3 1 design of the experiment in order to validate the performance of attenuation correction of the variational approach the polarimetric measurements at c band are simulated based on the dsds observed by the same 2dvd used in section 2 first we choose a time series of dsd observations obtained from the precipitation event occurred on june 28 2016 z h and z d r are simulated from the dsd observations using the scattering amplitudes calculated from the t matrix algorithm cao et al 2012 mishchenko and travis 1994 the wavelength of the simulation is set to 5 33 cm which equals to that of the c band radar used in the real cases in section 4 the high frequency fluctuations in the simulated z h and z d r data are mostly caused by the microscale variability of precipitation systems they are removed using a moving average filter huang et al 2017 the smoothed data series are then linearly interpolated and treated as a ray of radar data the simulated radar ray has a radial resolution of 75 m the interpolation is mainly conducted to ensure that the scale of the simulated storm is approximately 10 km following the idea of huang et al 2017 we then retrieve the dsds from the simulated z h and z d r data of the ray using the gamma model constrained by the μ λ relationship shown in section 2 brandes et al 2003 the other polarimetric variables including k d p a h and a d p are simulated from the dsds using the scattering amplitudes pre calculated using the t matrix algorithm these polarimetric variables without attenuation and measurement errors contained are treated as intrinsic values and will be used as references for validation of the variational algorithm in order to simulate the polarimetric measurements we further calculate the attenuated z h and z d r as well as φ d p using 2 4 then simulated measurements z h m z d r m and φ d p are obtained by including random errors with standard deviations equal to 1 db 0 2 db and 2 5 deg respectively bringi and chandrasekar 2001 to make the experiment more realistic δ h v values are also calculated from the simulated dsds and added to the simulated φ d p measurements the range profiles of the simulated polarimetric measurements as well as the intrinsic values are shown in fig 2 the whole range of the data is about 60 km the most intense part is located between 30 and 40 km where the highest k d p exceeds 4 deg km 1 the corresponding rainfall rate exceeds 100 mm hr 1 after propagating through the rain core z h m and z d r m are significantly attenuated and φ d p rapidly increases the simulated total pia h and pia d p are approximately 6 db and 0 9 db respectively note that the impact of the dsd variabilities is not fully considered in the simulation and the main purpose of the experiment is to test the performance of attenuation correction of the variational approach in the retrieval procedures the length of the state vector x is set to 40 considering the spatial correlation of d m in both the convective and the stratiform systems bringi et al 2015 the azimuthal smoothing is not performed the standard deviation of the random errors in z d r m and φ d p are set to 0 2 db and 2 5 deg respectively the random errors in z h m are processed using a 9 gate moving average filter before used in the estimation for comparison the conventional retrieval using the constrained gamma model is also performed zhang et al 2001 before the retrieval the attenuation and differential attenuation are linearly corrected using parameters regressed from the climatic dsd observations α 0 0917 and β 0 0231 bringi et al 1990 3 2 results in fig 3 the polarimetric radar variables z h z d r k d p and φ d p calculated from the estimated dsds are compared with the intrinsic values the results of the variational approach dash red lines generally correspond well with the intrinsic values solid blue lines the attenuation and differential attenuation are successfully corrected see fig 3a and b the random measurement errors 0 2 db in z d r m and 2 5 deg in φ d p are generally mitigated using the radial b spline filter three statistical indices including the correlation coefficient cc root mean squared error rmse and relative bias rb whose definition can be found in appendix b are utilized to quantify the performance as shown in table 1 the cc values between the polarimetric radar variables and the corresponding intrinsic values are very close to 1 0 and the rmse and rb values are low the minor inconsistency between the retrieved and the intrinsic range profiles is mainly attributed to the residual low frequency part of the random errors by contrast the performance of the results from the conventional retrieval is generally worse the estimated z h z d r and φ d p clearly deviate from the intrinsic values especially behind the rain core this is mainly because the statistical parameters α and β are too large for the simulated ray the uncertainties in the attenuation correction propagate to the retrieval and the calculated polarimetric variables in fig 3a and b the difference between the calculated z h z d r values cyan solid lines and the intrinsic values the blue solid lines becomes evident behind the rain core the cc value for z d r obtained from the conventional retrieval significantly decreases to 0 70 table 1 the rmse and rb values for z h z d r and φ d p are also higher than those in the variational retrieval especially for z d r the difference for k d p in fig 3d is not very significant because the positive biases in z h partially offset the effects of the positive biases in z d r however in some other cases the biases of z h and z d r may cause large k d p biases the comparison of the derived microphysical parameters d m n t and w and the rainfall rate is shown in fig 4 similar to the results in fig 3 the overall performance of the variational approach is good except for the minor errors due to the residual of the random measurement errors the cc values between the derived parameters d m n t w and r and their intrinsic values are close to 1 and the rmse and rb values are generally low table 1 in the conventional retrieval the d m values fig 4a are positively biased behind the heavy rain core due to the biases in the attenuation corrected z d r cyan solid line in fig 3b there are also nonnegligible errors in n t w and r which will deteriorate further rain microphysics studies and qpe fluctuations in d m and n t from the conventional retrieval are also larger than those from the variational approach this suggests the moving average filters for the processes of z d r and φ d p are not as good as the radial b spline filter in the variational approach the same conclusion can also be drawn from the statistical indices shown in table 1 the cc rmse and rb values for the parameters d m n t w and r derived using the conventional approach are generally lower higher than those derived from the variational approach 4 validation with real cases 4 1 verification using c band polarimetric data in the summer of 2017 the nanjing university c band polarimetric radar nju c pol is deployed to the northwest of the 2dvd site on may 23 24 2017 a precipitation system passed over the 2dvd site and the radar site in this event the variational approach is applied to the data collected by nju c pol to evaluate its performance the main parameters of nju c pol and the quality control procedures before the retrieval can be found in huang et al 2017 a ppi image 2 4 deg elevation of the radar data observed by nju c pol at 23 31 may 23 is shown in fig 5 this system causes widespread precipitation with convective echoes embedded when the radar beam passes through heavy rainfall region to the southeast of the radar site z h fig 5a and z d r fig 5b are attenuated and φ d p fig 5e increases significantly at the far side of the region of heavy rainfall z d r becomes negative the maximum value of φ d p measurements exceeds 180 deg according to fig 5 we know that z h and z d r measurements can barely quantify the properties of precipitation and the attenuation part must be corrected for quantitative applications after the retrieval using the proposed variational approach the polarimetric radar variables for rain including z h z d r and k d p are calculated from the retrieved dsds using the scattering amplitudes calculated for nju c pol cao et al 2012 note that the errors of z d r and φ d p are assumed to be equal to 0 2 db and 2 0 deg after quality control based on fig 5b and d we can find the attenuation in z h and the differential attenuation in z d r are optimized within the retrieval the negative z d r values disappear z h and z d r are continuous in radial and azimuthal directions in the calculated k d p fig 5f the large values correspond to the regions characterized by a rapid increase in φ d p the calculated k d p is also consistent with z h and z d r vivekanandan et al 2003 the microphysical parameters and rainfall rate are also calculated from the optimized dsds as shown in fig 6 the estimated d m fig 6a has the same pattern as the calculated z d r as expected generally the convective echoes with larger z h fig 5b have larger raindrop size and larger w however the convective and the stratiform echoes can also have comparable total number concentrations n t fig 6c even when the z h values are different for the precipitation with similar z h the dsds as well as mean drop size can also show diversity to examine the performance of the proposed variational approach the dsds estimated from the data of nju c pol are compared against those measured by the 2dvd in this event the event totally lasts for more than 9 h as shown in fig 5a the 2dvd site is about 40 km to the southeast of nju c pol for the radar scan at the elevation of 2 4 deg the vertical distance between the 2dvd site and the radar volume above is about 1800 m as shown in fig 7 the time series of z h and z d r calculated from dsds estimated using the variational approach above the 2dvd site black dots are shown together with those calculated from the 2dvd measurements black lines for comparison we also show the z h and z d r measurements gray squares in which the attenuation is corrected using linear relationships α 0 0917 β 0 0231 the precipitation above the 2dvd site contains both stratiform and convective echoes generally both the black dots and the gray squares are closely aligned with the black lines though the radar measurements have a lower temporal resolution about 7 min than the 2dvd 1 min sometimes mismatches also exist for example at about 01 10 may 24 both the black dots and the gray squares show differences from the black line in fig 7a the mismatches are mainly attributed to the difference between the sampling volumes of these two different instruments the vertical microphysical evolution of precipitation and the measurement errors of the instruments in z d r obtained by the conventional attenuation correction algorithm the negative values exist due to the random errors in z d r measurements and the uncertainty in β generally the results from the variational approach match better than those from the conventional approaches as shown by the statistical indices in table 2 the cc values for z h and z d r obtained by the variational approach are high 0 95 for z h and 0 87 for z d r and those obtained by the linear correction are lower 0 93 for z h and 0 81 for z d r the rmse values are also lower for the results of the variational approach in addition the positive value of rb 29 4 for z d r obtained by the linear attenuation correction indicates β is too large for this event in order to show the performance of dsd retrieval the retrieved microphysical parameters d m w and n t and rainfall rates from the variational approach are compared with those from the disdrometer measurements within the same period in fig 8 the conventional dsd retrieval using the constrained gamma model is also applied on z h and z d r measurements with attenuation corrected using linear relationships gray squares in fig 7 generally the retrieved microphysical parameters and rainfall rates coincide well with the measurements in fig 8a the d m obtained from the variational approach is consistent with disdrometer measurements most of the time in contrast the result based on the conventional retrieval shows more fluctuations which is attributed to more fluctuations in z d r corresponding to the lower cc value 0 67 and larger rmse value 0 25 compared to the results of the variational approach table 2 the positive bias in z d r values corrected using the linear relationships also results in the positive biases in d m rb 10 2 in addition when z d r measurements are negative no valid solution exists for conventional retrieval however it is not a problem for the variational approach for n t both approaches show a bit underestimation it is mainly because the moment orders of n t and z h have a large difference and it is difficult to estimate n t from z h brandes et al 2004b for the estimation of w and r the main advantage of the variational approach over the convectional approach is its ability to obtain reasonable solutions when z d r is negative in the meantime the higher cc lower rmse and lower rb values for the physical variables d m n t w and r obtained by the variational approach indicate its better performance compared to the conventional retrieval table 2 note that in this comparison the 2dvd site is not very far away from the radar site and the attenuation does not get very large when the attenuation gets larger if the rain is heavier or the variational approach is applied on x band radar data the advantage of the variational dsd retrieval may be more evident 4 2 application for qpe using s band polarimetric data on may 27 28 2016 a precipitation system passed over guangdong province which caused severe rainfall in cities the largest accumulated rainfall exceeded 230 mm from 00 00 utc may 27 to 12 00 utc may 29 the observations of guangzhou s pol in this event are used to examine the performance of the variational approach for qpe the details of guangzhou s pol and the procedures for the calibration and nonprecipitating echo removal can be found in huang et al 2018 the errors in z d r and φ d p are also assumed to be equal to 0 2 db and 2 0 deg in the retrieval the ppi images of the polarimetric measurements and the corresponding rainfall rate estimates of the variational approach at 21 30 utc may 27 are shown in fig 9 a linear weather system lies to the east of the radar site moving from the southwest towards the northeast the convective precipitation with z h above 40 dbz mainly has z d r reaching up to 2 db which is generally larger than that of stratiform precipitation when the radar beam propagates through the precipitation φ d p increases with the largest values in the south part over 60 deg in the meantime r values calculated from the optimized dsds are consistent with the measurements large r values are mainly located at the regions where z h values are large and φ d p values increase rapidly to quantitatively assess the qpe performance the rainfall rate calculated from the optimized dsds above the gauge sites are accumulated and compared against the measurements of rain gauges before the comparison the data of rain gauges are also quality controlled using a method of speckle filtering as in huang et al 2018 to make the assessment more objective two additional qpe algorithms are introduced for comparison the first one is the variational method proposed by h07 with the same configuration as in huang et al 2018 in conventional qpe combining the rainfall estimators e g r z h r z h z d r and r k d p according to their error distributions is a promising way to improve the accuracy of qpe bringi et al 2011 thus a composite rainfall estimator based on r z h r z h z d r and r k d p relationships is selected as the other algorithm for comparison in which the rule for composition is based on the ranges of r z h z d r and k d p in the study we use the same composition rule as that used in bringi et al 2011 furthermore to mitigate the impact of dsd variability on the composite estimator the r z h r z h z d r and r k d p relationships are tuned for south china using the dsd dataset huang et al 2018 as follows 16 r z h 0 0752 z h 0 598 17 r z h z dr 3 894 10 3 z h 0 990 z dr 3 935 18 r k dp 51 132 k dp 0 785 where z h and z d r are in the linear scale for the composite rainfall estimator k d p is estimated using an adaptive least square fitting method huang et al 2017 the comparisons of the radar derived hourly accumulated rainfalls ars and the rain gauge measurements are shown in fig 10 compared to the gauge measurements the hourly ars estimated by the variational approach show a high cc 0 95 a low rmse 1 52 mm and a low rb 3 4 suggesting the high accuracy of the qpe using the proposed variational approach in this event the hourly rainfall estimates of the variational approach proposed by h07 have a slightly lower cc 0 91 and a larger rmse 1 90 mm in addition a more significant overestimation 24 4 exists especially when the rainfall is light 10 mm the overestimation is mainly because the dsd model used in h07 the gamma distribution with μ 3 cannot well characterize the dsd properties in this event see fig 1 for the composite estimator tuned for south china fig 10c the results also exhibit a comparable cc 0 96 and rmse 1 50 mm with the variational approach proposed in this study however it shows a nonnegligible underestimation r b 22 2 a possible reason is that the microphysical properties of this event do not agree well with the statistics obtained by the dsd dataset for the whole summer the composite rainfall estimator and the coefficients for attenuation correction obtained from the dsd dataset suffer from dsd variability in a specific event and may cause underestimation or overestimation in contrast the rainfall rate and attenuation are estimated from retrieved dsds in the proposed variational approach which makes qpe less sensitive to dsd variabilities in rainfall cases in the comparisons of the total rainfall accumulated for the whole event fig 11 the performance of the three approaches is generally consistent with that indicated by fig 10 according to the rain gauge measurements most extreme rainfall occurs to the south and east of the radar site overestimation and underestimation exist in the total ars based on the variational approach at some gauge sites the result obtained by the proposed variational approach is generally satisfactory especially at the sites with heavy rainfall greater than 100 mm compared to the result in fig 11a the overestimation at some regions near the radar site gets more significant in the results based on the approach of h07 this may be attributed to its inappropriate dsd model in contrast evident underestimation exists in the estimates of the composite estimator at most gauge sites 5 conclusion and discussion in this study a variational approach for optimized dsd retrieval and rainfall estimation from polarimetric radar measurements z h z d r and φ d p is proposed the attenuation effect of rain is included in the forward operator the spatial continuity of rain is guaranteed by introducing the radial b spine filter and azimuthal kalman filter when the difference between the measured and predicted polarimetric variables is minimized considering all the above effects the dsds are considered to be optimized how z d r and φ d p measurements provide information to the optimized dsds is weighted by their errors the detailed derivations of the formulas for the proposed variational approach are shown in appendix a in this idealized experiment the variational approach is validated and compared with the conventional method while the dsd variabilities are not considered the comparison shows the ability of the variational approach to get optimized attenuation and dsds the variational approach is also applied to the observations of nju c pol on may 23 24 2017 the polarimetric variables and the microphysical parameters calculated from the dsd estimates of the variational approach agree well with the 2dvd measurements showing high cc low rmse and low rb values the variational dsd retrieval approach outperforms the conventional retrieval using linearly attenuation corrected z h z d r and the constrained gamma model in the event qpe using the variational approach is evaluated using observations of guangzhou spol compared against the gauge measurements the hourly accumulated rainfalls show a very high cc 0 95 a low rmse 1 52 mm and a low relative bias 3 4 in the event in contrast significant overestimation underestimation exists in the hourly accumulated rainfalls based on the approach proposed by h07 the composite estimator bringi et al 2011 the comparison of total accumulated rainfalls in this event also demonstrates a similar result the variational dsd retrieval approach is extended from the approach of h07 we use the microphysical variable d m as the state variable instead of the coefficient a in h07 which lacks explicit physical meaning in addition the dsd model used in the approach of h07 may not be able to characterize the dsd properties well in south china these may be the reason why its qpe results are worse than the results of our proposed approach the forward operator used in this study is based on the gamma distribution constrained by the statistical μ λ relationship tuned for south china even so there is some uncertainty in this constrained gamma distribution fig 1 whose impact to the retrieval varies case by case and is out of the scope of the current study besides rainfall rate our proposed approach also provides other physical properties of rainfall d m w n t and etc which are not considered in the original version of the approach of h07 the variational approach proves to be a promising way to correct the attenuation and obtain optimized dsd and rainfall simultaneously the main object to propose this variational framework for optimized estimation of rainfall rate and other microphysical parameters is to mitigate the uncertainty caused by attenuation hail and random measurement errors on the retrieval from this perspective the variational framework is applicable for dsd retrieval and qpe not only for south china but also for other places with the regional variabilities of the forward operator radial b spline filter and azimuthal kalman filter being considered an important feature of the variational approach is that the attenuation effect is included in the forward operator the a h and a d p estimates are compatible with the dsd estimates which is different from the conventional attenuation correction algorithms using the assumed relationships between attenuation differential attenuation and k d p bringi et al 1990 for the conventional algorithms the coefficients α and β are usually determined from climatic dsd observations the same α and β values are usually utilized for a volume scan carey et al 2000 gu et al 2011 it may cause errors in a h and a d p at each range gate and then propagate to dsd retrieval in the proposed variational approach the connection of attenuation to dsd makes the estimation globally optimized and may probably reduce the error propagation although it is not mentioned in the main text hail fraction is also included as a state variable refer to appendix a it is mainly used to mitigate errors in dsd estimates when hail exists in this condition the useful information on rain is mainly masked by hail and the useful information for the rain is mainly introduced by the a priori and the surrounding range gates due to the inclusion of radial and azimuthal filters in this study however the estimates of the hail fraction are not fully examined due to the lack of in situ measurements of hail the accuracy of quantitative retrieval of hail will be left for future studies as we mentioned earlier the backscattering differential phase is not considered in the forward operator in this study it is mainly because δ h v is usually not large compared to the measurement errors of φ d p for c and s band radars except for large raindrops and melting hail in addition the impact of δ h v can be mitigated by the information provided by z h and z d r since one advantage of the variational algorithm is that all available information can be combined for the retrieval in some cases of melting hail δ h v can be large and affect the retrieval however the hail regions may have a more severe impact since the effect of δ h v can already be partially mitigated by the combination of z h and z d r no extra constraints have been introduced for backscattering differential phase and higher priority has been given to the processing of hail regions however in the future a forward operator in which δ h v is accurately formulated in terms of rain dsd melting fraction and hail fraction may help to improve the retrieval for x band radars δ h v values can be larger especially in the cases of melting hail this can cause more uncertainty when applying the variational algorithm to x band radar data and more concern should be put on the

appendix a the details about the forward operators and the derivation of the jacobian matrix h used in the proposed variational approach are elaborated on in this appendix to make the description more comprehensive the retrieval is performed with hail considered for range gates where hailstones exist reflectivity factor values at both horizontal and vertical channels increase and z d r measurement shift towards 0 db this will contaminate the dsd retrieval similar to h07 we adopt a two step strategy to deal with this i e an identification pass and a retrieval pass refer to h07 for more details in the retrieval pass the state variable in the retrieval is modified to x x 1 x 2 x m f 1 f 2 f l where f i represents the hail fraction at the hail gates when predicting the polarimetric variables

conventionally hail is assumed to produce negligible attenuation thus a h z h h a i l is set to a constant 0 db km 1mm 6m3 in this study the polarimetric measurement z d r j m is a combination of the

variables in this study h is defined as the partial derivative of the forward operator h with respective to the state variables it is defined at the radar range gates instead of for the low resolution

5968,we present a continent scale exploration of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows at 2482 u s geological survey streamgages across the conterminous united states over the past 100 75 and 50 years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 we used basin characteristics to identify subsets of study basins representative of reference basins with streamflow relatively free from human effects n 259 and predominantly agricultural basins n 78 regulated basins n 220 and urban basins n 121 trend significance was computed using the mann kendall test considering short and long term persistence lag one autocorrelation tests of detrended 7 day low streamflows for all gage classes show that time series independence is not an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins among all study gages upward trends wetter conditions in 7 day low streamflows outnumbered downward trends drier conditions approximately 2 1 for the 75 and 100 year trend periods 50 year trends indicated roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases increases in 7 day low streamflow were consistently observed for all time periods throughout much of the northeastern quadrant of the conterminous u s including western new england and the mid atlantic the southeastern great lakes basin northern ohio river basin and the upper mississippi river and eastern missouri river basins decreases in 7 day low streamflow were consistently observed for all time periods at many gages in the southeastern u s and in the northwestern u s in much of idaho and northwestern washington overall we observed greater percentages of statistically significant trends at gages with human induced influences than at reference gages low flow trends at agricultural gages were regionally consistent with trends at reference gages regulated basins had many statistically significant upward trends for all three time periods tested which may be attributed in part to substantial increases in dam related storage prior to 1970 urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows urban gages also had the greatest percentage of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages highlighting that urban development can increase or decrease low streamflows depending on the basin specific development keywords low streamflow trends climate hydrology 1 introduction low streamflow is a seasonal phenomenon that occurs every year and defines the lowest driest parts of a continuous streamflow hydrograph smakhtin 2001 the median annual daily streamflow provides a conservative upper bound below which streamflows may be considered low while flows exceeded 70 99 percent of the time are widely used as design flows smakhtin 2001 annual mean n day low streamflows the lowest average flows that occur for a consecutive n day period are often used to define low streamflow indices for water resources management smakhtin 2001 for example the 7 day low flow with a 10 year recurrence interval is a design flow for water quality based effluent limitation to protect aquatic life from chronic effects u s environmental protection agency 1986 2018 seasonal low streamflow the flow that occurs in the absence of precipitation comprises storage discharge from surface water lakes wetlands glaciers dam impoundments and groundwater from riparian aquifers smakhtin 2001 brutsaert 2008 relative contributions to low streamflow from these sources vary by climate hydrogeologic setting and human activities smakhtin 2001 for example in some parts of the united states groundwater discharge may contribute up to 90 percent of a stream s annual flow barlow and leake 2012 maintaining minimum streamflows during seasonal low streamflow conditions mediates water quality including temperature and dissolved oxygen and provides volume for effluent dilution rolls et al 2012 low streamflow has great ecological importance as it defines the lowest extent of in stream habitat poff and zimmerman 2010 and affects biota composition and distribution and species trophic structure poff and zimmerman 2010 rolls et al 2012 1 1 climate and human induced influences on low streamflows climate and human induced influences are primary drivers of hydrologic systems and because they have changed over time it is useful to assess trends of hydrologic variables identifying and accounting for trends in observations can improve estimates of current and future low streamflow statistics which play a crucial role in many water management and regulatory actions such as setting permit levels for wastewater discharge and water withdrawals and informing operating policies for low streamflow releases from dams assessing trends can provide insight into and awareness of the many natural and human related factors affecting low streamflows e g u s environmental protection agency 2016 previous studies of trends in observed annual n day e g 7 day low streamflows seasonal or annual minimum flows and or base flow related metrics have tended to focus on climate related changes by using only streamflow data from basins considered to be relatively free from human influence sometimes referred to as reference basins these studies have been done at the scale of the continental united states u s douglas et al 2000 mccabe and wolock 2002 groisman et al 2004 lins and slack 2005 mccabe and wolock 2014 ahn and palmer 2015 or for a region within the u s e g zhu and day 2005 in pennsylvania small et al 2006 in the eastern u s hodgkins and dudley 2011 in new england and kormos et al 2016 luce and holden 2009 and sawaske and fryeberg 2014 in the pacific northwest three studies have examined trends in low streamflows across the u s using both reference and non reference gages ficklin et al 2018 ceylan and lall 2017 rice et al 2015 ceylan and lall 2017 and rice et al 2015 observed more significant trends in low streamflows since about 1940 among non reference gages relative to reference gages ficklin et al 2018 examined 1981 2015 trends for a range of streamflow metrics in the u s and canada and found generally strong correspondence between streamflow trends at reference gages with trends at non reference gages they also observed weaker correspondence between those two systems for extreme low flows 1st percentile trends results of all three studies point to the importance of human induced effects on low streamflows none of those studies isolated trend results in the context of specific human impacts such as agriculture dams or urbanization 1 2 scope of this study this study is unique from previous examinations of low streamflow trends in its continent scale exploration of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows over the past 100 75 and 50 years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 and its comparison of those trends among reference basins and basins affected by agriculture dams and urbanization we classified basins into reference agricultural regulated and urban end members basins not meeting criteria for those classifications were considered to be mixed basin types we examined trend results among these basin classes to determine whether we observed a greater number of significant trends in 7 day low streamflows among agricultural regulated and urban gages relative to reference gages and determine whether trends differed among the non reference gage classes given the often substantial groundwater contribution to low streamflows we expected that year to year magnitude of low streamflow may exhibit lag one autocorrelation similar to that observed with groundwater storage e g hodgkins et al 2017 significant lag one autocorrelation indicates the presence of short and or long term persistence of some kind and trend tests that do not account for persistence may overestimate the statistical significance of the trends cohn and lins 2005 we therefore examined lag one autocorrelation in annual 7 day low streamflows to test whether the assumption of independence is valid we computed trend significance using methods that account for the time series structure of the data including independence short term persistence and long term persistence 2 data and methods 2 1 streamflow data u s geological survey usgs streamflow gages considered for this study were selected from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii database falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 the gages ii database comprises hundreds of basin specific characteristics for 9322 basins throughout the u s including climatic hydrologic topographic land cover and use and geologic attributes daily streamflow data from climatic year 1916 beginning april 1 1915 through climatic year 2015 ending march 31 2015 were downloaded from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2016 using the r package dataretrieval hirsch and decicco 2015 r core team 2018 downloaded data were subject to length and completeness criteria study gages were required to have complete data a daily value for every day of the year for at least 8 out of every 10 years for each decade e g 1990 1999 in the time periods tested except for the end periods of 1916 1919 1941 1949 and 1966 1969 which were required to have 3 of 4 7 of 9 and 3 of 4 years respectively seven gages with negative streamflows tidal influence were omitted the above selection criteria resulted in 2482 study gages for the 1966 2015 period 1408 for 1941 2015 and 203 for 1916 2015 fig 1 2 2 classification of basin alteration study gages were subset into one of four classifications 1 reference hydroclimatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 lins 2012 2 agricultural 3 regulated and 4 urban high and low thresholds of basin characteristics were used to define the classifications table 1 among non reference gages the high thresholds generally represented the highest quartile value among study gages and low thresholds represented the lowest half among study gages for example study gages were classified agricultural if they did not belong to the hcdn 2009 network had 20 percent cultivated crops a normalized dam storage of less than 60 days and developed land of less than 6 percent table 1 note that due to the strict classification scheme 73 percent of the study gages n 1804 did not meet the criteria for any one of these four classifications study basin characteristics and classifications are in dudley et al 2018 dam storage data gages ii attribute stor nid 2009 in megaliters per square kilometer from the gages ii database falcone 2011 were used to quantify historical changes in storage the gages ii dam storage data provide snapshots of dam storage by decade from 1940 to 1990 changes in crop agricultural land use land use code 43 and developed urban land use land use codes 21 27 were computed using land use data from the u s conterminous wall to wall anthropogenic land use trends 1974 2012 nwalt database falcone 2015 the nwalt database provides five 60 meter geospatial rasters showing anthropogenic land use for the years 1974 1982 1992 2002 and 2012 2 3 low streamflow statistics trend testing and correlation methods annual time series of 7 day low streamflows were computed as the lowest annual value on the basis of 7 day moving averages mean annual streamflows also were computed for use as a basis of comparison in the section 4 magnitude of trends were computed using the sen slope sen 1968 also known as the theil sen estimator which is computed as the median of all possible pairwise slopes in each temporal data set helsel and hirsch 2002 the sen slope represents a monotonic trend result and we acknowledge significant monotonic trends may be due to step changes change points also some changes may be best represented as non monotonic trends we limit the scope of work to the analysis and reporting of sen slope for the purpose of reporting overall changes for the time periods tested we computed the statistical significance of trends using the mann kendall test p 0 05 significance of trends over time are sensitive to assumptions of whether the time series data are independent have short term persistence or have long term persistence cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 kumar et al 2009 hodgkins and dudley 2011 sagarika et al 2014 by definition the autocorrelation in short term persistence decays rapidly exponentially as a function of the time lag the decay is slower for long term persistence processes exhibiting long term persistence yield observations that tend to cluster in time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 examples of such processes include solar forcing volcanic activity aquifer storage storage in ice and large scale variations in linked atmospheric oceanic processes koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 not accounting for persistence may overstate the statistical significance of observed trends if present cohn and lins 2005 r code for our general mann kendall test that accounts for short and long term persistence in the time series data is provided in dudley et al 2018 trend significance is reported for three different null hypotheses of the serial structure of the time series data independence inde short term persistence ar1 and long term persistence ltp hamed and rao 1998 hamed 2008 while the three versions of the mann kendall test all use the same test statistics the ar1 version inflates the variance computed under an assumption of independence by a factor related to the lag one autocorrelation coefficient and the ltp version inflates the variance on the basis of the hurst coefficient hodgkins et al 2019 all trend directions are reported regardless of significance because they can nevertheless be informative in context with many other similar trend results on a regional basis 3 results 3 1 trends in 7 day low streamflows for all streamgages broad geographic similarities were observed in the distribution of trends in 7 day low streamflows across the three

3b in contrast when we consider the 50 year period 1966 2015 the proportion of urban gages with significant upward trends greatly exceeded the proportion for reference gages fig 3c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of time series dependence on trend results while the presence of long term persistence is difficult to identify without having very long records generally 100 years vogel et al 1998 khaliq et al 2009 we can use lag one autocorrelation tests to identify the presence of persistence both short term and long term persistence induce lag one autocorrelation therefore a significant lag one autocorrelation result only indicates the presence of persistence of some kind lag one autocorrelation tests to evaluate persistence were done with pearson s r using detrended 7 day low streamflows the number of gages with significant p 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in detrended 7 day low streamflows was much greater than might arise by chance 117 of 203 gages for 1916 2015 652 of 1408 gages for 1941 2015 and 776 of 2462 gages for 1966 2015 with average pearson s correlation coefficients r of 0 44 0 40 and 0 42 respectively for comparison the upper 95th percentile of the distribution of r for an independent time series is approximately 0 20 for a 100 year series 0 22 for a 75 year series and 0 28 for a 50 year series percentages of significant lag one autocorrelation were lowest among reference and urban gages and highest among regulated and agricultural gages fig 5 it is not surprising that autocorrelation was most prevalent among regulated gages as dams may provide storage not only between seasons but also between years evidence of autocorrelation in annual 7 day low streamflows among all basin classes including the reference class considered to be relatively free from human influence suggests data independence may not be an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins we include the reporting of trend significance for the independence inde assumption insofar as it is instructive to illustrate the relative percentages of significant trends in context of the short term ari and long term ltp assumptions for example fig 3 the greatest number of significant trends were detected under the independence assumption fewer significant trends were detected under the short term persistence ar1 assumption and fewer still were detected under the long term persistence ltp assumption 4 2 temporal and regional cohesion of trends there were more upward than downward trends in low streamflows over time among study gages for the two longer time periods 100 and 75 years increases outnumbered decreases approximately 2 1 figs 2 and 3 in contrast there were roughly equal numbers of upward and downward trends among study gages during the 50 year period the large decrease in the number of significant positive trends between the more recent period 1966 2015 and the longer time periods suggests lower low flow conditions were likely present at many gages prior to 1966 gages with trends toward increases during the 100 and 75 year periods and decreases during the 50 year period shown as black points in fig 6 these findings are consistent with findings from previous studies mccabe and wolock 2002 studied temporal and spatial changes in annual minimum median and maximum streamflows at 400 streamgages in the conterminous u s for the period 1941 1999 they observed that the mid 1950s was a very dry period of time in the conterminous u s whereas conditions were generally wetter than average after about 1970 groisman et al 2004 also identified the 1930s and 1950s to be particularly dry decades in the monthly precipitation record nationwide followed by relatively wet decades from 1970 1999 mccabe and wolock 2002 characterized observed increases in annual minimum and median daily streamflows at eastern gages as an abrupt change in streamflow around 1970 rather than a gradual trend sadri et al 2016 tested for step changes among trends in 7 day low flows in the eastern u s and found most step changes counting both upward and downward steps occurred during 1960 89 with the 1970s having the highest decadal count of gages with step changes the low flow trends computed by this study are consistent with those observations as upward trends throughout the northeastern quadrant of the u s had greater percentages of significant trends for the 1941 2015 period anchored in the dry 1950s than the 1966 2015 period which begins close to the time period when the change to wetter conditions had occurred trends in 7 day low streamflows indicated 641 gages with increases for all time periods tested gage total computed on the basis of trend direction regardless of significance fig 6 increases were consistently observed for all time periods tested throughout much of the northeastern quadrant of the conterminous u s including western new england and the mid atlantic approximately north of the southern border of pennsylvania the southeastern great lakes basin northern ohio river basin and the upper mississippi river and eastern missouri river basins similar trends were observed over 1940 1999 in most of these areas by lins and slack 2005 who tested for trends in a range of flow quantiles from annual minimums to maximums across the u s easterling et al 2017 documented greater amounts of annual precipitation 1981 2015 average compared to the 1901 1960 average in the same regions mccabe and wolock 2002 noted their observed step increases in annual streamflow statistics around 1970 were coincident with precipitation increases in the eastern u s seasonally the northeastern quadrant of the u s has seen relatively widespread increases in mean annual precipitation in the spring summer and fall easterling et al 2017 bartels et al 2019 studied trends in the number of days with precipitation at 167 stations for the conterminous u s and documented increases in precipitation days particularly concentrated in the northeast great lakes and midwestern united states for the period 1951 2015 huang et al 2017 have also observed a 6 8 increase in annual total precipitation at 116 ghcn stations from 1901 to 2014 in the northeastern u s trends in 7 day low streamflows indicated 380 gages with decreases for all time periods tested fig 6 we found decreases for all time periods in the southeastern u s and in the northwestern u s throughout much of idaho and northwestern washington kormos et al 2016 also observed that low streamflows declined from 1948 to 2013 at a majority of 42 streamgages tested on mountain streams in washington oregon idaho and western montana using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for air temperature kormos et al 2016 attributed changes in low streamflows primarily to changes in precipitation totals and secondarily to air temperature leppi et al 2012 studied 1950 2008 trends in mean august flows measured at 153 snowmelt dominated streams in the central rocky mountains a region overlapping with and east of the region studied by kormos et al 2016 they observed significant declines in stream discharge at their 65 non regulated streams with much smaller declines at their 88 regulated streams and attributed the trends at non regulated streams to changes in air temperature and its role in the accumulation and melt of mountain snowpack leppi et al 2012 pederson et al 2011 in the southeastern u s patterson et al 2012 observed regional decreases in precipitation and streamflow during 1970 2005 the consistent decreases in low flows that we observed in the southeastern u s across all three time periods fig 6 was likely a result of decreases that have occurred in precipitation throughout the southeastern u s easterling et al 2017 observed decreases particularly to have occurred during the spring and summer seasons kam and sheffield 2016 observed spatial distribution of trends in 7 day low flows 1962 2011 across the eastern u s from south carolina to maine that are consistent with results from our study they observed increases in the northeastern u s and decreases in the southeastern u s they attributed the increases in the northeast to trends in precipitation and the decreases in the southeast to increases in potential evapotranspiration and effects of water management a study of trends in low flow magnitudes and timing across the eastern u s by sadri et al 2016 also observed a general pattern of increasing low streamflows in the northeast and decreasing low streamflows in the southeast over a common time period 1951 2005 when we examined trend results in the context of drainage basin sizes we found percentages of upward and downward trends and percentages of significance among results to be largely consistent across all basin size classes for 1966 2015 fig 7 this analysis was based on segregation of basins into small 600 km2 medium 600 3000 km2 and large 3000 km2 drainage area size classes which divided our set of study basins n 2482 roughly into thirds 4 3 relation of low streamflow changes to mean annual streamflow agriculture dams and urbanization 4 3 1 relation between low and mean flow changes for reference basins we compared trends in 7 day low flows to trends in annual mean streamflow to determine how consistent these low flow trends are relative to mean streamflow mccabe and wolock 2014 observed that annual and seasonal minimum mean and maximum daily streamflows measured at basins relatively free from human influence reference basins shared similar temporal variability for example during periods when annual mean streamflow was higher or lower than the long term average they observed annual minimum and maximum streamflows likewise were similarly higher or lower than the long term average they found that more than two thirds 68 percent of the correlations between seasonal mean flows and seasonal minimum flows were 0 7 observed trends in mean annual streamflows for the 100 75 and 50 year periods fig 8 generally exhibited similar spatial cohesion as those observed for 7 day low streamflows fig 2 for many regions though with many fewer statistically significant trends given the expected similarity between trends in mean annual streamflow and trends in 7 day low streamflows for near natural basins see previous paragraph one might hypothesize that differences can be attributed in part to human influences we evaluate this hypothesis in the following sections for regulated agricultural and urban basins 4 3 2 regulated basins despite the diversity of purposes for dams their operations commonly decrease natural streamflow variability typically attenuating the magnitude of high flows and augmenting low flows poff et al 2006 2007 differences between trends in 7 day low and mean annual flows are particularly notable throughout the western u s compare figs 2 and 8 where most of the regulated gages in this study are located fig 4c a comparison of 7 day low and mean annual streamflow trends among gage classes figs 3 and 9 show substantial differences among regulated gages for all three time periods few significant increases in mean annual streamflow were observed at regulated sites while many significant increases were observed for 7 day low flows for all time periods fig 10 a comparison of trend magnitudes in 7 day low flows to those of mean annual flows at regulated basins fig 10 shows many cases where annual flows decreased but 7 day low flows increased there also is clustering along the zero axis where annual flows decreased but little to no change was observed in 7 day low flows low flow trend magnitudes and mean annual trend magnitudes exhibited the lowest correlation at the regulated gages fig 10 sadri et al 2016 observed that the majority of the sites they identified with step changes and upward trends in low streamflows in the eastern u s were regulated asarian and walker 2016 examined trends in the magnitude of 7 day 30 day and 90 day low flows 1953 2012 in northwest california and southwest oregon at gages that spanned a wide range of human influences they found dam related storage of winter and spring runoff and augmentation of summer water supplies exerted a strong influence on observed trends in streamflow and precipitation adjusted streamflow while about half of the unregulated gages they tested showed significant declines and very few increases 44 48 percent of regulated gages showed increases and only 7 15 percent showed decreases asarian and walker 2016 ficklin et al 2018 suggested that the weaker correspondence of trends in the low 1 percentile streamflows they observed between reference and human impacted basins was due to water management which reduced climate driven streamflow variability among low streamflows hodgkins et al 2007 documented the magnitude of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows 1955 2004 in the great lakes basin they observed larger trends at 2 of 4 regulated basins compared to the other 27 basins considered relatively free from human influence and attributed those increases in low streamflows to changes in regulation practices and addition of storage over time the other 2 regulated basins exhibited small trends toward lower annual 7 day low streamflows conversely kam and sheffield 2016 posited that precipitation driven downward trends in 7 day low streamflows observed over north and south carolina 1982 2011 were likely exacerbated by regulation using the short term persistence ar1 data independence assumption the percentage of significant increases in 7 day low flows among regulated gages for all time periods was much greater than at reference gages and the percentage of significant decreases also was greater than reference gages except for the 50 year period significant trends in low flows at regulated gages fig 4c are not spatially consistent with observed changes in precipitation in the western u s easterling et al 2017 significant trends observed at regulated gages may be attributed to changes in dam related storage in those basins over time among regulated gages from 1940 to 1990 decadal measures of dam related storage per unit drainage area falcone 2011 increased from 1940 through 1970 fig 11 while dam related storage continued to increase after 1970 most storage was built out by about 1970 this 1940 1970 growth in dam related storage could explain in part the relatively high percentage of significant downward trends in mean annual flows observed over the 100 year 1916 2015 period fig 9a such changes may be a consequence of the increase in evaporative losses after the dam is constructed and increased consumptive use of water that may be facilitated by having the reservoir available to provide the reliable supply to sustain larger consumptive uses significant trends at regulated gages also may be attributed to changes in regulation rules and targets for maintenance of minimum flows over time however it was beyond the scope of this study to catalog changes in historical regulation rules for all regulated basins 4 3 3 agricultural basins in contrast with the regulated gages a comparison of 7 day low and mean annual streamflow trends among agricultural gages figs 3 and 9 showed agreement in overall percentages of increases and decreases low flow trend magnitudes correlated with mean annual flow trend magnitudes similarly as that for reference gages fig 10 significant downward trends in 7 day low flows in the west and southeast u s and upward trends in the upper mississippi and great lakes regions fig 4 are spatially consistent with observed changes in summer precipitation in those respective regions easterling et al 2017 the percentage of significant ar1 increases and decreases among agricultural gages was greater than at reference gages for both 75 and 50 year time periods the percentage of significant increases among agricultural gages was much greater than at reference gages for the 75 year period crop land use among agricultural gages n 78 changed little from 1974 to 2012 falcone 2015 nearly three quarters 73 percent of agricultural basins had increases in crop land use but overall changes at these basins were relatively small with a mean increase in percent crop land use of 2 3 percent zhang and schilling 2006 observed trends toward increasing streamflow in the mississippi river basin 1940 2003 that they attributed to increased precipitation mediated by land use change and agricultural practices they observed that increases in streamflow were mainly manifested in the base flow component of total streamflow attributed to increased infiltration of precipitation due to soil conservation practices such as terraces conservation tillage and contour cropping and the conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops that decreased evapotranspiration zhang and schilling 2006 juracek and eng 2017 also attributed increases in low streamflows defined as less than the 10th percentile streamflow from 1980 to 2015 at basins in central and eastern kansas in part to agricultural land management practices related to soil conservation a study of streamflow trends in the great lakes basin by hodgkins et al 2007 documented the magnitudes of increases in annual 7 day low streamflows 1955 2004 were generally larger at basins with greater amounts of agricultural land use they observed that increases in 7 day low streamflow among basins with the highest amount of agricultural land use were 50 percent higher than increases at basins with the lowest amount suggesting changing agricultural practices over time e g irrigation contour plowing erosion control etc have led to an increase in the lowest flows of the year 4 3 4 urban basins urban gages showed somewhat greater percentages of decreases in 7 day low flows when compared to mean annual flows figs 3 and 9 in general the percentages of significant increases observed among both 7 day low flows and mean annual flows were about the same while there were greater percentages of significant decreases among low flows low flow trend magnitudes correlated most strongly with mean annual flow trend magnitudes at urban gages among all gage classes and showed a similar relation as the agricultural and reference gages fig 10 for the 50 year period urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows figs 3 8 and 10 urban settings where increased impervious area results in more rapid storm runoff and higher high flows could result in higher mean annual flows while less water is available in storage for low flows the percentage of significant ar1 increases and decreases among urban gages was greater than at reference gages for both 75 and 50 year time periods the percentage of significant decreases among urban gages was nearly double that of reference gages for the 50 year period and was greater than the percentage at any other gage class fig 3 developed land use among urban gages n 121 increased in nearly all basins from 1974 to 2012 falcone 2015 one basin saw no change but the rest saw increases with a mean increase of 8 8 percent of drainage basin area in the eastern u s where most of the urban gages are located significant decreases in 7 day low flows in the southeast u s and increases elsewhere are generally consistent with observed changes in summer precipitation easterling et al 2017 though there were exceptions while significant trends at urban gages may be primarily driven by changes in precipitation the specific basin by basin features of an urbanized landscape play important mediating roles resulting in the greatest percentages of significant decreases in low flows compared to other gage classes as well as the greatest percentages of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages the effects of urbanization on streamflow are complex many factors associated with urbanization can conceivably increase or decrease low streamflows price 2011 while it is generally acknowledged that urban development in a basin expands drainage networks and increases impervious area which in turn increases surface runoff and reduces subsurface flow and groundwater recharge paul and meyer 2001 studies also indicate that a variety of other features of an urban landscape increase streamflow directly or enhance groundwater recharge leading to increased base flow such as urban irrigation return flow or deep percolation of urban irrigation water water transfers into the urban watershed leaky water infrastructure effluent discharge storm water detention ponds and decreased evapotranspiration in paved or roofed areas allaire et al 2015 eng et al 2013 hibbs and sharp 2012 wang and cai 2010 garcia fresca and sharp 2005 hirsch et al 1990 garcia fresca and sharp 2005 observed that groundwater recharge commonly increased in urban basins and brandes et al 2005 found no evidence of decreasing base flows in response to low to moderate density land development in urbanizing basins in the delaware river basin hodgkins et al 2007 observed the 1955 2004 increase in annual 7 day low streamflow change at the one urban basin examined in their great lakes basin study was greater than increases at all of the basins relatively free of human influences they suggested the increase may have been driven in part by water imported into the basin from the great lakes 5 conclusions this study enhances the growing body of literature on trends in low flows across the conterminous u s by comparing observed trends at near natural reference streamgages to trends observed at agricultural regulated and urban end member gages we sought to determine whether greater percentages of significant trends in 7 day low streamflows were observed among agricultural regulated and urban gages relative to reference gages and to quantify how trends differed among the non reference gage classes regulated gages had significant upward trends in low flows at much greater percentages than reference gages and where there were downward trends for the 75 and 100 year periods the percentage of significance also was greater than reference gages in general low flow trends at regulated gages in the western u s were not spatially consistent with observed trends at reference gages and precipitation changes substantial increases in dam related storage prior to 1970 explain in part many of the significant upward trends in low flows observed at regulated gages after 1940 assuming operating rules most commonly decrease natural streamflow variability and augment low flows likewise the 1940 1970 growth in dam related storage could explain the relatively high percentage of significant downward trends in mean annual flows observed for the 100 year period tested in contrast to the low flow trends observed at regulated gages trends at agricultural gages spatially corresponded with observed trends at reference gages and precipitation changes where trends were observed the percentage of significance among agricultural gages was greater than at reference gages available land use data indicated the amount of crop land use among agricultural gages changed little from 1974 to 2012 significant trends at agricultural gages may be primarily driven by regional changes in precipitation and mediated by changes in agricultural land and water management practices similar to the low flow trends observed at agricultural gages as a group trends at urban gages broadly corresponded with observed regional trends at reference gages and precipitation changes though there were exceptions urban gages had significant trends at percentages greater than at reference gages urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows as well as the greatest percentages of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages while significant trends at urban gages may be driven by changes in precipitation our trend results confirm that basin specific urban landscape features play important and complex mediating roles in low streamflow urbanization and urban landscape features increased and decreased low flows at different basins resulting in changes that were more frequently statistically significant than for reference basins we examined the presence of natural persistence in low flow time series with lag one autocorrelation tests of detrended annual 7 day low streamflows for all gage classes evidence of significant autocorrelation at percentages much greater than expected due to chance for all gage classes shows that data independence is not an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins percentages of significant lag one autocorrelation were lowest among reference gages and highest among regulated and agricultural gages these results provide insight into regional climate related trends in low streamflows and changes driven in part by human activities on the landscape many basins influenced by agricultural practices flow regulation and urban infrastructure had greater percentages of significant trends in low streamflows than reference basins that are relatively free of human influence accurate assessments of low flow statistics are important to the management of water supply ecological conditions in streams and protection of water quality resource managers and regulators are challenged to make permits for withdrawals and discharges relevant not only for the present but the near future as well having a better understanding of how flows have changed in the past can help resource managers think about how flows may change in the future the results presented here can be particularly useful if supplemented by regional attribution studies and compared to model hindcasts using the actual history of climate and landscape changes such extensions of this work will enable evaluation of the use of those models for the important task of predicting future low

5968,we present a continent scale exploration of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows at 2482 u s geological survey streamgages across the conterminous united states over the past 100 75 and 50 years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 we used basin characteristics to identify subsets of study basins representative of reference basins with streamflow relatively free from human effects n 259 and predominantly agricultural basins n 78 regulated basins n 220 and urban basins n 121 trend significance was computed using the mann kendall test considering short and long term persistence lag one autocorrelation tests of detrended 7 day low streamflows for all gage classes show that time series independence is not an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins among all study gages upward trends wetter conditions in 7 day low streamflows outnumbered downward trends drier conditions approximately 2 1 for the 75 and 100 year trend periods 50 year trends indicated roughly equal numbers of increases and decreases increases in 7 day low streamflow were consistently observed for all time periods throughout much of the northeastern quadrant of the conterminous u s including western new england and the mid atlantic the southeastern great lakes basin northern ohio river basin and the upper mississippi river and eastern missouri river basins decreases in 7 day low streamflow were consistently observed for all time periods at many gages in the southeastern u s and in the northwestern u s in much of idaho and northwestern washington overall we observed greater percentages of statistically significant trends at gages with human induced influences than at reference gages low flow trends at agricultural gages were regionally consistent with trends at reference gages regulated basins had many statistically significant upward trends for all three time periods tested which may be attributed in part to substantial increases in dam related storage prior to 1970 urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows urban gages also had the greatest percentage of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages highlighting that urban development can increase or decrease low streamflows depending on the basin specific development keywords low streamflow trends climate hydrology 1 introduction low streamflow is a seasonal phenomenon that occurs every year and defines the lowest driest parts of a continuous streamflow hydrograph smakhtin 2001 the median annual daily streamflow provides a conservative upper bound below which streamflows may be considered low while flows exceeded 70 99 percent of the time are widely used as design flows smakhtin 2001 annual mean n day low streamflows the lowest average flows that occur for a consecutive n day period are often used to define low streamflow indices for water resources management smakhtin 2001 for example the 7 day low flow with a 10 year recurrence interval is a design flow for water quality based effluent limitation to protect aquatic life from chronic effects u s environmental protection agency 1986 2018 seasonal low streamflow the flow that occurs in the absence of precipitation comprises storage discharge from surface water lakes wetlands glaciers dam impoundments and groundwater from riparian aquifers smakhtin 2001 brutsaert 2008 relative contributions to low streamflow from these sources vary by climate hydrogeologic setting and human activities smakhtin 2001 for example in some parts of the united states groundwater discharge may contribute up to 90 percent of a stream s annual flow barlow and leake 2012 maintaining minimum streamflows during seasonal low streamflow conditions mediates water quality including temperature and dissolved oxygen and provides volume for effluent dilution rolls et al 2012 low streamflow has great ecological importance as it defines the lowest extent of in stream habitat poff and zimmerman 2010 and affects biota composition and distribution and species trophic structure poff and zimmerman 2010 rolls et al 2012 1 1 climate and human induced influences on low streamflows climate and human induced influences are primary drivers of hydrologic systems and because they have changed over time it is useful to assess trends of hydrologic variables identifying and accounting for trends in observations can improve estimates of current and future low streamflow statistics which play a crucial role in many water management and regulatory actions such as setting permit levels for wastewater discharge and water withdrawals and informing operating policies for low streamflow releases from dams assessing trends can provide insight into and awareness of the many natural and human related factors affecting low streamflows e g u s environmental protection agency 2016 previous studies of trends in observed annual n day e g 7 day low streamflows seasonal or annual minimum flows and or base flow related metrics have tended to focus on climate related changes by using only streamflow data from basins considered to be relatively free from human influence sometimes referred to as reference basins these studies have been done at the scale of the continental united states u s douglas et al 2000 mccabe and wolock 2002 groisman et al 2004 lins and slack 2005 mccabe and wolock 2014 ahn and palmer 2015 or for a region within the u s e g zhu and day 2005 in pennsylvania small et al 2006 in the eastern u s hodgkins and dudley 2011 in new england and kormos et al 2016 luce and holden 2009 and sawaske and fryeberg 2014 in the pacific northwest three studies have examined trends in low streamflows across the u s using both reference and non reference gages ficklin et al 2018 ceylan and lall 2017 rice et al 2015 ceylan and lall 2017 and rice et al 2015 observed more significant trends in low streamflows since about 1940 among non reference gages relative to reference gages ficklin et al 2018 examined 1981 2015 trends for a range of streamflow metrics in the u s and canada and found generally strong correspondence between streamflow trends at reference gages with trends at non reference gages they also observed weaker correspondence between those two systems for extreme low flows 1st percentile trends results of all three studies point to the importance of human induced effects on low streamflows none of those studies isolated trend results in the context of specific human impacts such as agriculture dams or urbanization 1 2 scope of this study this study is unique from previous examinations of low streamflow trends in its continent scale exploration of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows over the past 100 75 and 50 years 1916 2015 1941 2015 and 1966 2015 and its comparison of those trends among reference basins and basins affected by agriculture dams and urbanization we classified basins into reference agricultural regulated and urban end members basins not meeting criteria for those classifications were considered to be mixed basin types we examined trend results among these basin classes to determine whether we observed a greater number of significant trends in 7 day low streamflows among agricultural regulated and urban gages relative to reference gages and determine whether trends differed among the non reference gage classes given the often substantial groundwater contribution to low streamflows we expected that year to year magnitude of low streamflow may exhibit lag one autocorrelation similar to that observed with groundwater storage e g hodgkins et al 2017 significant lag one autocorrelation indicates the presence of short and or long term persistence of some kind and trend tests that do not account for persistence may overestimate the statistical significance of the trends cohn and lins 2005 we therefore examined lag one autocorrelation in annual 7 day low streamflows to test whether the assumption of independence is valid we computed trend significance using methods that account for the time series structure of the data including independence short term persistence and long term persistence 2 data and methods 2 1 streamflow data u s geological survey usgs streamflow gages considered for this study were selected from the geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii database falcone 2011 falcone et al 2010 the gages ii database comprises hundreds of basin specific characteristics for 9322 basins throughout the u s including climatic hydrologic topographic land cover and use and geologic attributes daily streamflow data from climatic year 1916 beginning april 1 1915 through climatic year 2015 ending march 31 2015 were downloaded from the usgs national water information system nwis u s geological survey 2016 using the r package dataretrieval hirsch and decicco 2015 r core team 2018 downloaded data were subject to length and completeness criteria study gages were required to have complete data a daily value for every day of the year for at least 8 out of every 10 years for each decade e g 1990 1999 in the time periods tested except for the end periods of 1916 1919 1941 1949 and 1966 1969 which were required to have 3 of 4 7 of 9 and 3 of 4 years respectively seven gages with negative streamflows tidal influence were omitted the above selection criteria resulted in 2482 study gages for the 1966 2015 period 1408 for 1941 2015 and 203 for 1916 2015 fig 1 2 2 classification of basin alteration study gages were subset into one of four classifications 1 reference hydroclimatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 lins 2012 2 agricultural 3 regulated and 4 urban high and low thresholds of basin characteristics were used to define the classifications table 1 among non reference gages the high thresholds generally represented the highest quartile value among study gages and low thresholds represented the lowest half among study gages for example study gages were classified agricultural if they did not belong to the hcdn 2009 network had 20 percent cultivated crops a normalized dam storage of less than 60 days and developed land of less than 6 percent table 1 note that due to the strict

anthropogenic land use for the years 1974 1982 1992 2002 and 2012 2 3 low streamflow statistics trend testing and correlation methods annual time series of 7 day low streamflows were computed as the lowest annual value on the basis of 7 day moving averages mean annual streamflows also were computed for use as a basis of comparison in the section 4 magnitude of trends were computed using the sen slope sen 1968 also known as the theil sen estimator which is computed as the median of all possible pairwise slopes in each temporal data set helsel and hirsch 2002 the sen slope represents a monotonic trend result and we acknowledge significant monotonic trends may be due to step changes change points also some changes may be best represented as non monotonic trends we limit the scope of work to the analysis and reporting of sen slope for the purpose of reporting overall changes for the time periods tested we computed the statistical significance of trends using the mann kendall test p 0 05 significance of trends over time are sensitive to assumptions of whether the time series data are independent have short term persistence or have long term persistence cohn and lins 2005 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 hamed 2008 khaliq et al 2009 kumar et al 2009 hodgkins and dudley 2011 sagarika et al 2014 by definition the autocorrelation in short term persistence decays rapidly exponentially as a function of the time lag the decay is slower for long term persistence processes exhibiting long term persistence yield observations that tend to cluster in time koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 examples of such processes include solar forcing volcanic activity aquifer storage storage in ice and large scale variations in linked atmospheric oceanic processes koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 not accounting for persistence may overstate the statistical significance of observed trends if present cohn and lins 2005 r code for our general mann kendall test that accounts for short and long term persistence in the time series data is provided in dudley et al 2018 trend significance is reported for three different null hypotheses of the serial structure of the time series data independence inde short term persistence ar1 and long term persistence ltp hamed and rao 1998 hamed 2008 while the three versions of the mann kendall test all use the same test statistics the ar1 version inflates the variance computed under an assumption of independence by a factor related to the lag one autocorrelation coefficient and the ltp version inflates the variance on the basis of the hurst coefficient hodgkins et al 2019 all trend directions are reported regardless of significance because they can nevertheless be informative in context with many other similar trend results on a regional basis 3 results 3 1 trends in 7 day low streamflows for all streamgages broad geographic similarities were observed in the distribution of trends in 7 day low streamflows across the three time periods fig 2 in general increases were observed in the western coastal mountains and interior mountains of california upper colorado river eastern missouri river upper and lower mississippi river and ohio river basins great lakes basin northern mid atlantic and new england supplemental fig 1 increases for the 50 year period in the upper mississippi river and ohio river basins and mid atlantic and new england regions were less pronounced fewer numbers of significant trends and mixed with greater numbers of downward trends than for the 100 and 75 year time periods fig 2 downward trends in the southern mid atlantic and south atlantic gulf were evident in the 50 and 75 year periods fig 2 they become more pronounced greater number of significant trends for the 50 year time period fig 2 trend results slopes and significance at each streamgage are available online in the data release by dudley et al 2018 3 2 trends at reference streamgages seven day low streamflow trend results by gage classification fig 3 supplemental table 1 generally indicate more upward trends than downward trends across the three time periods except for the reference gages few reference gages met the 100 year data length and completeness criteria n 10 supplemental fig 2 of those few none had significant trends in annual 7 day low streamflow reference gages had the smallest percentages of significant trends over the 75 year period compared to the other gage classes fig 3 supplemental fig 3 nearly all significant increases over the 75 year period were in the northeast and nearly all downward trends were in the northwest few reference gages in the southeast met the 75 year data length and completeness criteria and those that did indicated downward trends over time fifty year trends at reference basins predominantly indicated downward trends in low flows over time in the southeastern and western u s fig 4 there were few 50 year trends toward higher 7 day low streamflows some significant upward trends were observed in the northeast and rocky mountains 3 3 trends at agricultural streamgages fewer than 10 agricultural gages met the 100 year data length and completeness criteria supplemental fig 2 upward trends in annual 7 day low streamflows over the 75 year period outnumbered downward trends among agricultural gages nearly three to one fig 3 supplemental fig 3 for this period significant increases were observed in and near the upper mississippi and some significant decreases were observed in the lower mississippi and south atlantic gulf fifty year trends also predominantly indicated higher 7 day low streamflows over time in and near the upper mississippi river basin fig 4 and while most of the trends were geographically consistent with those observed for the 75 year period there were many fewer statistically significant trends fig 3 3 4 trends at regulated streamgages upward trends in 7 day low streamflows at regulated gages outnumbered downward trends for all three time periods tested fig 3 trend results among regulated basins were less regionally coherent and more geographically mixed supplemental figs 2 and 3 and fig 4 which is likely a reflection of the diversity of regional climate and operational purposes of dams e g hydroelectricity flood control drinking water irrigation navigation poff and hart 2002 3 5 trends at urban streamgages a large majority of gages meeting criteria for classification as urban were in the eastern u s with the rest located near the west coast fig 4d in general across time periods the geographic distributions of trends at urban gages were similar to those for the reference gages where they can be seen to overlap fig 4 supplemental figs 2 and 3 the ratio of significant upward trends and downward trends in 7 day low flows at urban gages 15 2 percent up 6 5 percent down ar1 assumption was similar to the ratio observed for reference gages 13 0 4 3 percent for the 75 year period fig 3b in contrast when we consider the 50 year period 1966 2015 the proportion of urban gages with significant upward trends greatly exceeded the proportion for reference gages fig 3c 4 discussion 4 1 effects of time series dependence on trend results while the presence of long term persistence is difficult to identify without having very long records generally 100 years vogel et al 1998 khaliq et al 2009 we can use lag one autocorrelation tests to identify the presence of persistence both short term and long term persistence induce lag one autocorrelation therefore a significant lag one autocorrelation result only indicates the presence of persistence of some kind lag one autocorrelation tests to evaluate persistence were done with pearson s r using detrended 7 day low streamflows the number of gages with significant p 0 05 lag one autocorrelation in detrended 7 day low streamflows was much greater than might arise by chance 117 of 203 gages for 1916 2015 652 of 1408 gages for 1941 2015 and 776 of 2462 gages for 1966 2015 with average pearson s correlation coefficients r of 0 44 0 40 and 0 42 respectively for comparison the upper 95th percentile of the distribution of r for an independent time series is approximately 0 20 for a 100 year series 0 22 for a 75 year series and 0 28 for a 50 year series percentages of significant lag one autocorrelation were lowest among reference and urban gages and highest among regulated and agricultural gages fig 5 it is not surprising that autocorrelation was most prevalent among regulated gages as dams may provide storage not only between seasons but also between years evidence of autocorrelation in annual 7 day low streamflows among all basin classes including the reference class considered to be relatively free from human influence suggests data independence may not be an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins we include the reporting of trend significance for the independence inde assumption insofar as it is instructive to illustrate the relative percentages of significant trends in context of the short term ari and long term ltp assumptions for example fig 3 the greatest number of significant trends were detected under the independence assumption fewer significant trends were detected under the short term persistence ar1 assumption and fewer still were detected under the long term persistence ltp assumption 4 2 temporal and regional cohesion of trends there were more upward than downward trends in low streamflows over time among study gages for the two longer time periods 100 and 75 years increases outnumbered decreases approximately 2 1 figs 2 and 3 in contrast there were roughly equal numbers of upward and downward trends among study gages during the 50 year period the large decrease in the number of significant positive trends between the more recent period 1966 2015 and the longer time periods suggests lower low flow conditions were likely present at many gages prior to 1966 gages with trends toward increases during the 100 and 75 year periods and decreases during the 50 year period shown as black points in fig 6 these findings are consistent with findings from previous studies mccabe and wolock 2002 studied temporal and spatial changes in annual minimum median and maximum streamflows at 400 streamgages in the conterminous u s for the period 1941 1999 they observed that the mid 1950s was a very dry period of time in the conterminous u s whereas conditions were generally wetter than average after about 1970 groisman et al 2004 also identified the 1930s and 1950s to be particularly dry decades in the monthly precipitation record nationwide followed by relatively wet decades from 1970 1999 mccabe and wolock 2002 characterized observed increases in annual minimum and median daily streamflows at eastern gages as an abrupt change in streamflow around 1970 rather than a gradual trend sadri et al 2016 tested for step changes among trends in 7 day low flows in the eastern u s and found most step changes counting both upward and downward steps occurred during 1960 89 with the 1970s having the highest decadal count of gages with step changes the low flow trends computed by this study are consistent with those observations as upward trends throughout the northeastern quadrant of the u s had greater percentages of significant trends for the 1941 2015 period anchored in the dry 1950s than the 1966 2015 period which begins close to the time period when the change to wetter conditions had occurred trends in 7 day low streamflows indicated 641 gages with increases for all time periods tested gage total computed on the basis of trend direction regardless of significance fig 6 increases were consistently observed for all time periods tested throughout much of the northeastern quadrant of the conterminous u s including western new england and the mid atlantic approximately north of the southern border of pennsylvania the southeastern great lakes basin northern ohio river basin and the upper mississippi river and eastern missouri river basins similar trends were observed over 1940 1999 in most of these areas by lins and slack 2005 who tested for trends in a range of flow quantiles from annual minimums to maximums across the u s easterling et al 2017 documented greater amounts of annual precipitation 1981 2015 average compared to the 1901 1960 average in the same regions mccabe and wolock 2002 noted their observed step increases in annual streamflow statistics around 1970 were coincident with precipitation increases in the eastern u s seasonally the northeastern quadrant of the u s has seen relatively widespread increases in mean annual precipitation in the spring summer and fall easterling et al 2017 bartels et al 2019 studied trends in the number of days with precipitation at 167 stations for the conterminous u s and documented increases in precipitation days particularly concentrated in the northeast great lakes and midwestern united states for the period 1951 2015 huang et al 2017 have also observed a 6 8 increase in annual total precipitation at 116 ghcn stations from 1901 to 2014 in the northeastern u s trends in 7 day low streamflows indicated 380 gages with decreases for all time periods tested fig 6 we found decreases for all time periods in the southeastern u s and in the northwestern u s throughout much of idaho and northwestern washington kormos et al 2016 also observed that low streamflows declined from 1948 to 2013 at a majority of 42 streamgages tested on mountain streams in washington oregon idaho and western montana using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for air temperature kormos et al 2016 attributed changes in low streamflows primarily to changes in precipitation totals and secondarily to air temperature leppi et al 2012 studied 1950 2008 trends in mean august flows measured at 153 snowmelt dominated streams in the central rocky mountains a region overlapping with and east of the region studied by kormos et al 2016 they observed significant declines in stream discharge at their 65 non regulated streams with much smaller declines at their 88 regulated streams and attributed the trends at non regulated streams to changes in air temperature and its role in the accumulation and melt of mountain snowpack leppi et al 2012 pederson et al 2011 in the southeastern u s patterson et al 2012 observed regional decreases in precipitation and streamflow during 1970 2005 the consistent decreases in low flows that we observed in the southeastern u s across all three time periods fig 6 was likely a result of decreases that have occurred in precipitation throughout the southeastern u s easterling et al 2017 observed decreases particularly to have occurred during the spring and summer seasons kam and sheffield 2016 observed spatial distribution of trends in 7 day low flows 1962 2011 across the eastern u s from south carolina to maine that are consistent with results from our study they observed increases in the northeastern u s and decreases in the southeastern u s they attributed the increases in the northeast to trends in precipitation and the decreases in the southeast to increases in potential evapotranspiration and effects of water management a study of trends in low flow magnitudes and timing across the eastern u s by sadri et al 2016 also observed a general pattern of increasing low streamflows in the northeast and decreasing low streamflows in the southeast over a common time period 1951 2005 when we examined trend results in the context of drainage basin sizes we found percentages of upward and downward trends and percentages of significance among results to be largely consistent across all basin size classes for 1966 2015 fig 7 this analysis was based on segregation of basins into small 600 km2 medium 600 3000 km2 and large 3000 km2 drainage area size classes which divided our set of study basins n 2482 roughly into thirds 4 3 relation of low streamflow changes to mean annual streamflow agriculture dams and urbanization 4 3 1 relation between low and mean flow changes for reference basins we compared trends in 7 day low flows to trends in annual mean streamflow to determine how consistent these low flow trends are relative to mean streamflow mccabe and wolock 2014 observed that annual and seasonal minimum mean and maximum daily streamflows measured at basins relatively free from human influence reference basins shared similar temporal variability for example during periods when annual mean streamflow was higher or lower than the long term average they observed annual minimum and maximum streamflows likewise were similarly higher or lower than the long term average they found that more than two thirds 68 percent of the correlations between seasonal mean flows and seasonal minimum flows were 0 7 observed trends in mean annual streamflows for the 100 75 and 50 year periods fig 8 generally exhibited similar spatial cohesion as those observed for 7 day low streamflows fig 2 for many regions though with many fewer statistically significant trends given the expected similarity between trends in mean annual streamflow and trends in 7 day low streamflows for near natural basins see previous paragraph one might hypothesize that differences can be attributed in part to human influences we evaluate this hypothesis in the following sections for regulated agricultural and urban basins 4 3 2 regulated basins despite the diversity of purposes for dams their operations commonly decrease natural streamflow variability typically attenuating the magnitude of high flows and augmenting low flows poff et al 2006 2007 differences between trends in 7 day low and mean annual flows are particularly notable throughout the western u s compare figs 2 and 8 where most of the regulated gages in this study are located fig 4c a comparison of 7 day low and mean annual streamflow trends among gage classes figs 3 and 9 show substantial differences among regulated gages for all three time periods few significant increases in mean annual streamflow were observed at regulated sites while many significant increases were observed for 7 day low flows for all time periods fig 10 a comparison of trend magnitudes in 7 day low flows to those of mean annual flows at regulated basins fig 10 shows many cases where annual flows decreased but 7 day low flows increased there also is clustering along the zero axis where annual flows decreased but little to no change was observed in 7 day low flows low flow trend magnitudes and mean annual trend magnitudes exhibited the lowest correlation at the regulated gages fig 10 sadri et al 2016 observed that the majority of the sites they identified with step changes and upward trends in low streamflows in the eastern u s were regulated asarian and walker 2016 examined trends in the magnitude of 7 day 30 day and 90 day low flows 1953 2012 in northwest california and southwest oregon at gages that spanned a wide range of human influences they found dam related storage of winter and spring runoff and augmentation of summer water supplies exerted a strong influence on observed trends in streamflow and precipitation adjusted streamflow while about half of the unregulated gages they tested showed significant declines and very few increases 44 48 percent of regulated gages showed increases and only 7 15 percent showed decreases asarian and walker 2016 ficklin et al 2018 suggested that the weaker correspondence of trends in the low 1 percentile streamflows they observed between reference and human impacted basins was due to water management which reduced climate driven streamflow variability among low streamflows hodgkins et al 2007 documented the magnitude of trends in annual 7 day low streamflows 1955 2004 in the great lakes basin they observed larger trends at 2 of 4 regulated basins compared to the other 27 basins considered relatively free from human influence and attributed those increases in low streamflows to changes in regulation practices and addition of storage over time the other 2 regulated basins exhibited small trends toward lower annual 7 day low streamflows conversely kam and sheffield 2016 posited that precipitation driven downward trends in 7 day low streamflows observed over north and south carolina 1982 2011 were likely exacerbated by regulation using the short term persistence ar1 data independence assumption the percentage of significant increases in 7 day low flows among regulated gages for all time periods was much greater than at reference gages and the percentage of significant decreases also was greater than reference gages except for the 50 year period significant trends in low flows at regulated gages fig 4c are not spatially consistent with observed changes in precipitation in the western u s easterling et al 2017 significant trends observed at regulated gages may be attributed to changes in dam related storage in those basins over time among regulated gages from 1940 to 1990 decadal measures of dam related storage per unit drainage area falcone 2011 increased from 1940 through 1970 fig 11 while dam related storage continued to increase after 1970 most storage was built out by about 1970 this 1940 1970 growth in dam related storage could explain in part the relatively high percentage of significant downward trends in mean annual flows observed over the 100 year 1916 2015 period fig 9a such changes may be a consequence of the increase in evaporative losses after the dam is constructed and increased consumptive use of water that may be facilitated by having the reservoir available to provide the reliable supply to sustain larger consumptive uses significant trends at regulated gages also may be attributed to changes in regulation rules and targets for maintenance of minimum flows over time however it was beyond the scope of this study to catalog changes in historical regulation rules for all regulated basins 4 3 3 agricultural basins in contrast with the regulated gages a comparison of 7 day low and mean annual streamflow trends among agricultural gages figs 3 and 9 showed agreement in overall percentages of increases and decreases low flow trend magnitudes correlated with mean annual flow trend magnitudes similarly as that for reference gages fig 10 significant downward trends in 7 day low flows in the west and southeast u s and upward trends in the upper mississippi and great lakes regions fig 4 are spatially consistent with observed changes in summer precipitation in those respective regions easterling et al 2017 the percentage of significant ar1 increases and decreases among agricultural gages was greater than at reference gages for both 75 and 50 year time periods the percentage of significant increases among agricultural gages was much greater than at reference gages for the 75 year period crop land use among agricultural gages n 78 changed little from 1974 to 2012 falcone 2015 nearly three quarters 73 percent of agricultural basins had increases in crop land use but overall changes at these basins were relatively small with a mean increase in percent crop land use of 2 3 percent zhang and schilling 2006 observed trends toward increasing streamflow in the mississippi river basin 1940 2003 that they attributed to increased precipitation mediated by land use change and agricultural practices they observed that increases in streamflow were mainly manifested in the base flow component of total streamflow attributed to increased infiltration of precipitation due to soil conservation practices such as terraces conservation tillage and contour cropping and the conversion of perennial vegetation to seasonal row crops that decreased evapotranspiration zhang and schilling 2006 juracek and eng 2017 also attributed increases in low streamflows defined as less than the 10th percentile streamflow from 1980 to 2015 at basins in central and eastern kansas in part to agricultural land management practices related to soil conservation a study of streamflow trends in the great lakes basin by hodgkins et al 2007 documented the magnitudes of increases in annual 7 day low streamflows 1955 2004 were generally larger at basins with greater amounts of agricultural land use they observed that increases in 7 day low streamflow among basins with the highest amount of agricultural land use were 50 percent higher than increases at basins with the lowest amount suggesting changing agricultural practices over time e g irrigation contour plowing erosion control etc have led to an increase in the lowest flows of the year 4 3 4 urban basins urban gages showed somewhat greater percentages of decreases in 7 day low flows when compared to mean annual flows figs 3 and 9 in general the percentages of significant increases observed among both 7 day low flows and mean annual flows were about the same while there were greater percentages of significant decreases among low flows low flow trend magnitudes correlated most strongly with mean annual flow trend magnitudes at urban gages among all gage classes and showed a similar relation as the agricultural and reference gages fig 10 for the 50 year period urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows figs 3 8 and 10 urban settings where increased impervious area results in more rapid storm runoff and higher high flows could result in higher mean annual flows while less water is available in storage for low flows the percentage of significant ar1 increases and decreases among urban gages was greater than at reference gages for both 75 and 50 year time periods the percentage of significant decreases among urban gages was nearly double that of reference gages for the 50 year period and was greater than the percentage at any other gage class fig 3 developed land use among urban gages n 121 increased in nearly all basins from 1974 to 2012 falcone 2015 one basin saw no change but the rest saw increases with a mean increase of 8 8 percent of drainage basin area in the eastern u s where most of the urban gages are located significant decreases in 7 day low flows in the southeast u s and increases elsewhere are generally consistent with observed changes in summer precipitation easterling et al 2017 though there were exceptions while significant trends at urban gages may be primarily driven by changes in precipitation the specific basin by basin features of an urbanized landscape play important mediating roles resulting in the greatest percentages of significant decreases in low flows compared to other gage classes as well as the greatest percentages of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages the effects of urbanization on streamflow are complex many factors associated with urbanization can conceivably increase or decrease low streamflows price 2011 while it is generally acknowledged that urban development in a basin expands drainage networks and increases impervious area which in turn increases surface runoff and reduces subsurface flow and groundwater recharge paul and meyer 2001 studies also indicate that a variety of other features of an urban landscape increase streamflow directly or enhance groundwater recharge leading to increased base flow such as urban irrigation return flow or deep percolation of urban irrigation water water transfers into the urban watershed leaky water infrastructure effluent discharge storm water detention ponds and decreased evapotranspiration in paved or roofed areas allaire et al 2015 eng et al 2013 hibbs and sharp 2012 wang and cai 2010 garcia fresca and sharp 2005 hirsch et al 1990 garcia fresca and sharp 2005 observed that groundwater recharge commonly increased in urban basins and brandes et al 2005 found no evidence of decreasing base flows in response to low to moderate density land development in urbanizing basins in the delaware river basin hodgkins et al 2007 observed the 1955 2004 increase in annual 7 day low streamflow change at the one urban basin examined in their great lakes basin study was greater than increases at all of the basins relatively free of human influences they suggested the increase may have been driven in part by water imported into the basin from the great lakes 5 conclusions this study enhances the growing body of literature on trends in low flows across the conterminous u s by comparing observed trends at near natural reference streamgages to trends observed at agricultural regulated and urban end member gages we sought to determine whether greater percentages of significant trends in 7 day low streamflows were observed among agricultural regulated and urban gages relative to reference gages and to quantify how trends differed among the non reference gage classes regulated gages had significant upward trends in low flows at much greater percentages than reference gages and where there were downward trends for the 75 and 100 year periods the percentage of significance also was greater than reference gages in general low flow trends at regulated gages in the western u s were not spatially consistent with observed trends at reference gages and precipitation changes substantial increases in dam related storage prior to 1970 explain in part many of the significant upward trends in low flows observed at regulated gages after 1940 assuming operating rules most commonly decrease natural streamflow variability and augment low flows likewise the 1940 1970 growth in dam related storage could explain the relatively high percentage of significant downward trends in mean annual flows observed for the 100 year period tested in contrast to the low flow trends observed at regulated gages trends at agricultural gages spatially corresponded with observed trends at reference gages and precipitation changes where trends were observed the percentage of significance among agricultural gages was greater than at reference gages available land use data indicated the amount of crop land use among agricultural gages changed little from 1974 to 2012 significant trends at agricultural gages may be primarily driven by regional changes in precipitation and mediated by changes in agricultural land and water management practices similar to the low flow trends observed at agricultural gages as a group trends at urban gages broadly corresponded with observed regional trends at reference gages and precipitation changes though there were exceptions urban gages had significant trends at percentages greater than at reference gages urban gages had the greatest percentage of significant decreases in 7 day low flows compared to all other gage classes even though most urban gages saw upward trends in mean annual flows as well as the greatest percentages of significant increases in low flows second only to regulated gages while significant trends at urban gages may be driven by changes in precipitation our trend results confirm that basin specific urban landscape features play important and complex mediating roles in low streamflow urbanization and urban landscape features increased and decreased low flows at different basins resulting in changes that were more frequently statistically significant than for reference basins we examined the presence of natural persistence in low flow time series with lag one autocorrelation tests of detrended annual 7 day low streamflows for all gage classes evidence of significant autocorrelation at percentages much greater than expected due to chance for all gage classes shows that data independence is not an appropriate assumption for annual low streamflow data at many basins percentages of significant lag one autocorrelation were lowest among reference gages and highest among regulated and agricultural gages these results provide insight into regional climate related trends in low streamflows and changes driven in part by human activities on the landscape many basins influenced by agricultural practices flow regulation and urban infrastructure had greater percentages of significant trends in low streamflows than reference basins that are relatively free of human influence accurate assessments of low flow statistics are important to the management of water supply ecological conditions in streams and protection of water quality resource managers and regulators are challenged to make permits for withdrawals and discharges relevant not only for the present but the near future as well having a better understanding of how flows have changed in the past can help resource managers think about how flows may change in the future the results presented here can be particularly useful if supplemented by regional attribution studies and compared to model hindcasts using the actual history of climate and landscape changes such extensions of this work will enable evaluation of the use of those models for the important task of predicting future low

5969,surrogate models are often adopted to substitute computationally intensive groundwater simulation models for aquifer management due to their high effectiveness and computing efficiency however solutions of using only one surrogate model are prone to large prediction uncertainty this study compares individual surrogate models and an ensemble surrogate model in an optimal groundwater remediation design problem three machine learning based surrogate models response surface regression model artificial neural network and support vector machine were developed to replace a high fidelity solute transport model for predicting saltwater intrusion and assisting saltwater scavenging design an optimal latin hypercube design was employed to generate training and testing datasets set pair analysis was employed to construct a more reliable ensemble surrogate and to address prediction uncertainty arising from individual surrogate models bayesian set pair weights were derived by utilizing full information from both training and testing data and improved typical set pair weights the individual and ensemble surrogate models were applied to the salinization remediation problem in the baton rouge area southeast louisiana the optimal remediation design includes two conflicting objectives minimizing total groundwater extraction from a horizontal scavenger well while maximizing chloride concentration difference to the mcl maximum contamination level at monitoring locations nsga ii non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii was employed to solve the nonlinear optimization model and obtain pareto optimal pumping schedules the optimal pumping schedules from ensemble surrogate models and individual surrogate models were verified by the solute transport model the study found that bayesian set pair analysis builds robust ensemble surrogates and accounts for model prediction uncertainty the ensemble surrogate assisted optimization model provides stable and reliable

introduction saltwater intrusion to coastal or inland freshwater aquifers has been a serious threat to water resources around the world barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 freshwater injection and saltwater scavenging to form hydraulic barriers are common measures to mitigate saltwater intrusion problems lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 sreekanth and datta 2010 yin and tsai 2018 especially optimization models are essential in the design process to find optimal solutions such as location and pumping rate of injection and scavenger wells keir et al 2019 yang et al 2017 besides high fidelity groundwater simulation models are crucial to obtain reliable solutions in the optimization models because real world aquifer systems are highly heterogenous and complex real world groundwater management is multiobjective in nature which involves conflicting objectives mani et al 2016 zatarain salazar et al 2017 population based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms deb et al 2002 zitzler 1999 are proven to obtain nondominated trade off solutions among different objectives but requires massive simulation model runs highly complex groundwater models rigorously accommodate detailed properties of the real world gosses et al 2018 sreekanth and datta 2011 however they tend to be computationally intensive and even prohibit to be used in optimization and uncertainty analysis rajabi and ketabchi 2017 one potential approach to substantially reducing computational burden is to substitute computationally expensive simulation models with properly trained and validated surrogate models razavi et al 2012 in recent years surrogate models are appealing to optimization models because surrogate models can represent expensive groundwater models in large scale nonlinear optimization problems and achieve high computational efficiency asher et al 2015 song et al 2018 increasingly more popular surrogate modeling approaches in water resources have been reported in the literature bazargan et al 2015 presented a polynomial chaos proxy model to emulate flow response within subsurface reservoir for uncertainty quantification a statistical model was developed using the bagging multivariate adaptive regression splines method to substitute a modflow model chen et al 2017 andrade et al 2016 used an alternative artificial neural network to estimate disinfectant concentrations for optimal water distribution system design other surrogate methods such as radial basis functions support vector machines and space time kriging ruybal et al 2019 varouchakis et al 2019 have been adopted for water resources optimization sensitivity analysis or forecasting bhosekar and ierapetritou 2018 nourani et al 2017 yu et al 2006 while the surrogate models are widely used no one is universally superior in all cases previous researches were generally based on a standalone surrogate model and rarely made efforts to improve approximation accuracy of surrogate models sufficiently through ensemble modeling chen et al 2017 ataie ashtiani et al 2013a b since a surrogate model is generally applied for approximating the input and output relationship of the original numerical simulation model the key issue is the performance of the surrogate model hou et al 2017 in some cases the performance of a standalone surrogate model is not stable because outputs with large residuals errors may be obtained in the feasible domain of input space especially in the optimization process the existence of such samples with large residuals may increase the risk of obtaining a misleading optimum sreekanth and datta 2011 there is a limit that using surrogates cannot guarantee the same optimum as using the original models christelis and mantoglou 2016 besides predictive uncertainty from surrogate models may influence the feasibility of solutions obtained from the simulation optimization framework hence it is necessary to assemble various surrogate modeling approaches and thereby avoid inferior optimization solutions from using only one surrogate model sreekanth and datta 2011 the present study proposes robust machine learning based ensemble surrogate modeling method combined with advanced sampling design to predict saltwater intrusion in a deep aquifer the surrogate models are the machine learning models including response surface regression models artificial neural networks and support vector machines many available methods can be used to account for model prediction uncertainty through a weighted average ensemble of metamodels xing et al 2019 presented an ensemble surrogate model through an adaptive metropolis markov chain monte carlo method to identify groundwater contaminant sources ouyang et al 2017 constructed ensemble surrogates using a gaussian process for an optimal groundwater remediation design set pair analysis spa is proposed as a new approach to build an ensemble surrogate model by utilizing unique features of individual models the spa is an efficient method that analyzes the internal uncertainty relationship of a system using a connection degree zhao and xuan 1996 and its effectiveness on prediction and assessment has been confirmed in many fields hou et al 2017 kumar and garg 2018 men and liu 2018 roy and datta 2018 zeng and huang 2018 but rarely applied to the groundwater area moreover previous studies only rely on testing data to assign set pair weights to individual models and ignore prior information from training data bayes rule provides a robust way to overcome this issue by considering a prior basis and complete data information when calculating model weights bayes theorem has been widely applied to account for model uncertainty chitsazan et al 2015 li and tsai 2009 liu and merwade 2018 liu and merwade 2019 min and hense 2006 but has not been used to address prediction uncertainty of surrogate models in conjunction with set pair analysis to the best knowledge of the authors bayesian set pair analysis is firstly proposed in this study to develop more reliable ensemble groundwater surrogate models for saltwater scavenging design by calculating a bayesian set pair weight for each machine learning model in this work the main objective is to develop machine learning based ensemble groundwater surrogate models to predict saltwater intrusion in an optimal remediation design for the multi aquifer system in the baton rouge area louisiana in order to address prediction uncertainty of using machine learning models bayesian set pair analysis was used to construct ensemble surrogate models which capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates the ensemble surrogate models were then used in a bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization to derive a set of pareto optimal saltwater extraction strategies subjected to the constraints of controlling saltwater intrusion two conflicting objectives were formulated in the study the first objective was to minimize the total extraction rate from a horizontal scavenger well the second objective was to maximize the minimum difference in chloride concentration below a mcl maximum contamination level at monitoring locations the maximin problem was further transformed into a conventional maximization problem eventually the optimization model involved two conflicting objectives the ensemble surrogate assisted optimal solutions were verified through the physically based numerical simulation model and compared with the solutions obtained using only a single surrogate model in the optimization besides modeling of a horizontal scavenger well for a deep aquifer is the first time to investigate if it is an effective approach to mitigate the saltwater intrusion threat confronting the baton rouge metropolitan area the study is structured as follows i conducting experimental design to generate input output patterns from the physically based solute transport model ii developing three surrogate models including response surface regression models artificial neural networks and support vector machines iii evaluating and comparing the performance of individual surrogate models iv adopting bayesian set pair analysis to establish ensemble surrogate models v formulating a bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization model vi conducting transformation to convert the bi objective optimization model and vii applying the proposed methodology to a real world optimal saltwater scavenging design 2 saltwater intrusion and mitigation in the baton rouge multi aquifer system excessive groundwater withdrawals north of baton rouge fault fig 1 a primarily for public supply and industrial use have induced unfavorable saltwater movement northward across the baton rouge fault chitsazan and tsai 2015 tomaszewski 1996 tsai 2010 whiteman 1977 yin and tsai 2019 the source of saline water comes from salt domes south of the baton rouge fault bray and hanor 1990 pham and tsai 2017 developed a baton rouge groundwater model which covers 11 freshwater aquifers including the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the 400 foot sand down to the 2800 foot sand the study area shown in fig 1a covers 513 km2 27 km in east west 19 km in north south the groundwater model was discretized into 93 rows 137 columns 162 layers with a cell size 200 m by 200 m and varying layer thickness a total of 808 078 active computational cells fig 1b shows the complex groundwater model structure at a cross section a a in fig 1a the historical groundwater head data from the u s geological survey usgs observation wells were used to derive the time varied specified head boundary condition and calibrate the groundwater model pham and tsai 2017 using the cma es method hansen et al 2003 the study found that the most significant groundwater level decline is in the 2000 foot sand in the baton rouge industrial district since most of the recorded chloride concentrations in the 2000 foot sand are around a few hundred parts per million the density effect is relatively not significant to simulate the salinity transport in the baton rouge multi aquifer system this study developed a three dimensional solute transport model using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 by coupling with the groundwater flow model modflow 2005 the historical chloride concentrations from usgs observation wells were used for model calibration yin and tsai 2018 saltwater plume was found to migrate northward in different sands this study particularly focuses on mitigation of the saltwater intrusion issue in the 2000 foot sand where the simulated leading edge of 250 mg l chloride concentration on dec 31 2009 is shown in fig 2 considering salt source bray and hanor 1990 and chloride transport this study proposes a horizontal scavenger well fig 2 to be close to the baton rouge fault to extract saline water and protect public supply wells and industrial wells the horizontal scavenger well is proposed about at 674 8 m below land surface with a screen length of 400 m and a diameter of 0 5 m the revised multi node well mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 offers an improved capability in this study to simulate the horizontal scavenger well the chloride concentrations are simulated at six monitoring locations m1 m6 surrounding the scavenger well fig 2 running the complex groundwater flow and solute transport model takes over 16 h using the physically based simulation model to derive optimal saltwater scavenging strategies is very time consuming because of massive runs of the simulation models in optimization processes thus this study utilizes machine learning based ensemble surrogate models to predict chloride concentrations at the monitoring locations and then develops an aquifer management model for the 2000 foot sand in order to identify optimal saltwater scavenging strategies 3 methodology 3 1 dataset generation developing a surrogate model involves learning from input output datasets the inputs are the time variant extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well and outputs are the resulting chloride concentrations at monitoring locations the decision space is a multidimensional space representing the combination of groundwater extraction rates from the scavenger well at different time periods in this study the training samples and testing samples were generated independently but in the same sampling way first given a desired range an optimal latin hypercube sampling method tang 1993 was employed to generate training data and testing data of extraction rates inputs that well represent the entire decision space this efficient approach adopts a maximum minimum distance criterion i e maximizing the minimum distance between samples the approach divides the cumulative distribution of each input variable into a number of equiprobable intervals and randomly selects one sample from each subinterval secondly once groundwater extraction rates were generated the training inputs and testing inputs were respectively used in modflow 2005 to obtain flow solutions which were used in the mt3dms transport model to obtain chloride concentrations then the input output datasets were used to train and test surrogate models the datasets were generated on a parallel computing platform because the numerical simulation models are very time consuming to further improve surrogate model performance extraction rates inputs were sampled in a desired range 0 15 000 m3 d and then normalized between 0 and 1 the simulated chloride concentrations were transformed into natural logarithms as the response variables 3 2 surrogate models 3 2 1 response surface regression rsr models let c k be the predicted chloride concentration at a monitoring well k and q 1 q 2 q n be the n

ε k is the error term of the surrogate and n is the number of explanatory variables for a full form the total number of the regression coefficients is n 1 n 2 2 to train the surrogate models and select significant terms in eq 1 this study adopts backward stepwise regression draper and smith 2014 analysis which is an effective technique to do so since it supports automatic selection in cases where there are a lot of potential explanatory variables with no anterior knowledge to be used to conduct surrogate selection for all training samples at all monitoring wells eq 1 is written in the following matrix vector form 2 ln c k 1 ln c k 2 lnc k m 1 q i 1 q i 1 q j 1 q i 1 2 1 q i 2 q i 2 q j 2 q i 2 2 1 q i m q i m q j m q i m 2 β 0 k β i k β ij k β ii k ε k 1 ε k 2 ε k m where m is the number of training samples in each step of backward selection given the training samples the regression coefficients can be obtained through the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach eq 1 presents the full form of the second order polynomial rsr model as more model parameters are included in the model the bias decreases while the variance increases to get a trade off between bias and variance following the principle of parsimony this study conducted model selection based on the akaike information criterion correction aicc akaike 1979 where the models were inferred based on the data and ranked from the best to the worst the best model with the minimum aicc was selected in the present study 3 2 2 artificial neural networks anns the study adopts an artificial neural network ann to learn the underlying relationships between inputs extraction rates and outputs chloride concentrations a typical ann method is the multi layer perceptron including one input layer hidden layers and one output layer following the guidelines anmala et al 2000 morshed and kaluarachchi 1998 this study adopts an ann with one hidden layer for simplicity the mathematical formulation of the three layer feedforward ann to predict ln c k is 3 o h j f h i 1 n ω j i q i b j 4 ln c k f o j 1 h ω o j o h j b o where f h and f o are the activation functions for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively b j and b o are the biases which are used to adjust the mean value for the input layer and the hidden layer respectively n is the number of neurons in the input layer h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer o h j is the jth output at the hidden layer ω j i are the synaptic weights between neurons in the input layer and neurons in the hidden layer and ω o j are the synaptic weights between neurons in the hidden layer and neurons in the output layer in this study the number of neurons n in the input layer is the number of extraction rates the number of neurons h in the hidden layer is the same as the number of neurons in the input layer the number of neurons in the output layer is the number of chloride concentrations at the monitoring locations the learning process aims to calculate optimal weights for the synaptic connections between artificial neurons by minimizing prediction errors khalil et al 2005 given training samples the backpropagation algorithm with the levenberg marquardt method was applied to train the anns log sigmoid function in the hidden layer f h and purelin function in the output layer f o were selected as activation functions for better performance the training procedure continued until 1 a specified maximum number of epochs was met or 2 the performance gradient fell below a specified minimum gradient 3 2 3 support vector machines svms a support vector machine represents a machine learning model for classification and regression this study uses the svm as a regression method which project the inputs extraction rates into a high dimensional feature space through a nonlinear mapping vapnik 2013 by performing such a mapping the learning algorithm seeks to find a hyperplane for applying a linear regression in the svm formulation vapnik 2013 which can be described by 5 ln c k i 1 m ω i ϕ i q b 0 where the functions ϕ i q i 1 m are the feature space representations of the extraction rates q q i m is the number of support vectors that contain the information necessary to capture the hyperplane ω ω 1 ω 2 ω m are the svm weights b 0 is the bias the nonlinear mapping from q into a higher dimensional feature space ϕ q is conducted by selecting a kernel function this study applied a gaussian kernel function keerthi and lin 2003 such that the nonlinear problem was able to be converted into a linear problem b 0 ω and the corresponding m support vectors in the support vector machine were estimated by training samples 3 2 4 statistical assessment for model performance independent testing data are used to evaluate the model performance based on the criteria in eqs 6 9 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare and pearson correlation coefficient r which are expressed as follows 6 nse 1 i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i 2 i 1 n ln c k i ln c k 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i 2 8 mare 1 n i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i ln c k i 9 r i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i n ln c k ln c k i 1 n ln c k i 2 n ln c k 2 i 1 n ln c k i 2 n ln c k 2 where n is the sample size c k i is the chloride concentration at sample i from the solute transport model at monitoring location k c k i is the predicted chloride concentration at sample i from a surrogate model at monitoring location k ln c k is the mean log concentration of all samples from the solute transport model at monitoring location k and ln c k is the mean log concentration of all samples from a surrogate model at monitoring location k 3 3 ensemble surrogate models 3 3 1 model averaging the performance of a standalone surrogate model may not be stable because some samples with large errors can be obtained the existence of such samples may render pumping rates suboptimal or even infeasible asher et al 2015 in this study set pair analysis spa is introduced as an efficient method to build an ensemble model which can limit the error of each sample information from set pairs constructed using model predictions is used to calculate set pair weights however past studies only rely on the information from testing data to assign set pair weights and ignore training data as a prior basis hence to derive a more reliable surrogate model the present study adopts bayesian set pair analysis as a new method to construct weighted average ensemble surrogate models for saltwater scavenging design and to account for salinity prediction uncertainty from surrogate models 10 ln c k q s ω k s ln c k s q where c k s is the chloride concentration at monitoring location k predicted using the s th surrogate model s 1 2 3 and ω k s is the model weight for the s th surrogate model 3 3 2 set pair weights spa hou et al 2017 men and liu 2018 roy and datta 2018 zeng and huang 2018 zhao and xuan 1996 considers certainties and uncertainties from three aspects e g identity discrepancy and contradistinction suppose that set a and a relative set b construct a set pair s a b for example a ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k n is the set of n chloride concentrations at monitoring location k by inputting n samples training or testing of extraction rates to the simulation model and b ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k n is the set of chloride concentrations at monitoring location k by inputting n samples training or testing of extraction rates to a surrogate model zhao and xuan 1996 introduced a three element connection degree by classifying three characteristics between set a and set b into identity discrepancy and contradistinction as follows 11 μ i n d n i t n j where μ is the connection degree i is the number of identical characteristics where identity means set a to be identical to set b d is the number of discrepant characteristics where discrepancy means small error between set a and set b t is the number of contradictory characteristics where contradistinction means significant difference between set a and set b i d t n i is the coefficient of discrepancy varying in 1 1 and j is the coefficient of contradistinction that takes the value of 1 besides the discrepancy d can be further expanded for example feng et al 2014 introduced a four element connection degree as follows 12 μ i n d 1 n i 1 d 2 n i 2 t n j where d 1 is the number of discrepant characteristics for mild discrepancy and d 2 is the number of discrepant characteristics for severe discrepancy let b s ln c k s 1 ln c k s 2 ln c k s n be the set of chloride concentrations at monitoring location k estimated by the sth surrogate model then the associated set pair is denoted by s a b s the set pair is classified into four categories according to the absolute relative residual arr between the surrogate model prediction and the numerically simulated output identity mild discrepancy severe discrepancy and contradistinction xiao et al 2009 in this study depending on model performance features xiao et al 2009 the arr values of less than 0 05 are considered as identical arr values between 0 05 and 0 13 are regarded as mild discrepancy arr values between 0 13 and 0 20 are considered as severe discrepancy and arr values more than 0 20 are considered as contradistinction the connection degree between the s th surrogate model and the simulation model at monitoring location k can be obtained as 13 μ k s i k s n d 1 k s n i 1 d 2 k s n i 2 t k s n j typically the uncertainty component coefficients of the discrepancy degrees i 1 and i 2 are 0 5 and 0 5 respectively the uncertainty coefficient j of contradistinction is 1 the range of μ k s is 1 1 μ k s 1 means that the s th surrogate model output at monitoring location k is certain the surrogate prediction is identical to the simulated output μ k s 1 means that the s th surrogate model output at monitoring location k is uncertain the arr values of all predictions are higher than 0 2 then the set pair weight ω k s of the s th surrogate model at monitoring location k is calculated by 14 ω k s u k s s 1 3 u k s where s ω k s 1 u k s can be expressed as 15 u k s 0 5 μ k s 0 5 where the range of u k s is 0 1 3 3 3 bayesian set pair weights previous studies hou et al 2017 roy and datta 2018 only used testing samples to construct the set pair s a b s and then calculate set pair weights this study adopts bayes rule bolstad and curran 2016 to update the model weights from set pair weights to bayesian set pair weights by involving the training data as follows 16 pr g k s d pr d g k s p r g k s s 1 3 pr d g k s p r g k s where g k s represents a surrogate model s that predicts lnc at monitoring location k d is the testing data pr g k s is the prior probability of surrogate model g k s pr d g k s is the likelihood of surrogate model g k s and pr g k s d the posterior probability of surrogate model g k s which is the bayesian set pair weight the set pair weights ω k s 0 is considered as the prior probability when using training samples as a basis to construct s a b s the likelihood is calculated through u k s in eq 15 when using testing data to construct s a b s therefore the bayesian set pair weights posterior weights can be derived as 17 pr g k s d u k s ω k s 0 s 1 3 u k s ω k s 0 the total weight is unity i e s pr g k s d 1 u k s is calculated using set pairs from testing data and ω k s 0 is calculated using set pairs from training data therefore the ensemble prediction is 18 ln c k q s pr g k s d ln c k s q k the bayesian set pair weights are a good choice for building a robust ensemble model because the model weights are developed by considering data information from both training and testing samples 3 4 optimization model 3 4 1 bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization this study proposes two conflicting objectives to deal with the saltwater intrusion problem in the baton rouge area individual surrogate models and ensemble surrogate models are used to predict chloride concentrations at the six 6 monitoring locations shown in fig 2 the first objective is to minimize groundwater extraction from the horizontal scavenger well as follows 19 minimize i 1 n q i the second objective is to reduce chloride concentrations at the monitoring wells below a predefined maximum contamination level mcl as much as possible which is formulated as a maximin problem 20 maximize minimum c mcl c 1 q c mcl c 2 q c mcl c k q where c mcl is the mcl of chloride concentration and c k is the chloride concentration at monitoring well k at the end of the management period the following constraint is needed to make sure chloride concentrations at the monitoring wells below the mcl 21 c k q c mcl k the bound constraints for the extraction rates are 22 q i min q i q i max where q i min and q i max are the lower and upper limits of the extraction rate q i the chloride concentrations in eqs 20 and 21 are predicted by individual surrogate models in eqs 1 4 and 5 and by the ensemble surrogate models in eq 18 the maximin objective eq 20 is further transformed into a maximization problem by introducing an additional variable z williams 2013 maximize z subject to 24 z c mcl c k q k 3 4 2 multiobjective genetic algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 nsga ii is applied to solve the bi objective saltwater scavenging problem the algorithm randomly generates candidate solutions which are the groundwater extraction rates for different time periods within the remediation horizon all the generated candidate solutions are evaluated for feasibility and fitness the nsga ⅱ adopts the genetic algorithm operators cross over mutation and selection to evolve the candidate solutions generation by generation until termination criteria are satisfied after each generation the candidate solutions are sorted into nondominated fronts deb et al 2002 gadhvi et al 2016 based upon nondomination rank and crowding distance the solutions are progressively improved to converge to the final pareto optimal front which contains a wide set of optimal extraction strategies for the horizontal scavenger well 3 4 3 verification obtained optimal solutions of extraction rates from the nsga ii are put into the physically based solute transport model to verify if the chloride concentration constraints are met due to surrogate model uncertainty the residual in the salinity prediction i e the difference between the surrogate predicted value and the numerical simulated value can be further evaluated in the case that chloride concentration constraints are violated a flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 3 which involves two parts ensemble surrogate model development and a groundwater remediation design 4 numerical application the proposed saltwater scavenging optimization model is applied to the saltwater intrusion issue fig 2 in the 2000 foot sand this study aims to investigate the aquifer mitigation effect during a 10 year management period from 2000 to 2009 yearly extraction rates for the horizontal scavenger well are designed totally there are 10 decision variables in the optimization model corresponding to q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 q6 q7 q8 q9 and q10 the lower and upper limits of the extraction rates are 0 and 15 000 m3 d respectively using the optimal latin hypercube sampling technique on extraction rates 200 training samples of chloride concentrations at six monitoring locations were generated by the solute transport model the training sampled were used to build three different types of surrogate models rsr ann and svm and one type of ensemble surrogate model rsr ann svm for each of the six monitoring locations altogether 24 surrogate models were developed moreover 100 testing samples were independently generated to evaluate model performance all the samples were generated by running the expensive groundwater flow model and the solute transport model on a parallel computing platform the management model specified a maximum permissible chloride concentration limit of 250 mg l at the monitoring locations the multiobjective optimization algorithm nsga ii used a population size of 200 the probabilities of crossover and mutation were 0 8 and 0 02 respectively the function and constraint tolerances were set to 10 4 and 10 3 respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of bayesian set pair weights this study constructed set pairs s a b s using predictions from training data and testing data respectively to calculate three types of set pair weights shown in fig 4 the training data based set pair weights prior weights and the testing data based set pair weights were calculated by eq 14 the bayesian set pair weights posterior weights were calculated by eq 16 if the weight ranking for individual surrogate models is consistent in the training samples and testing samples e g m2 m3 and m5 the same weight ranking will show in the bayesian set pair weights otherwise the posterior weight ranking in the bayesian set pair weights will depend on prior weights eq 14 from the training data and likelihoods from the testing data the rsr model generally has highest weights except at m5 the four characteristics in eq 13 for the three surrogate models using training data and testing data at the six monitoring locations are shown in table 1 the training based and testing based connection degrees were calculated which are shown in fig 5 a value closer to 1 indicates that the surrogate model is more certain at monitoring location k while a value closer to 1 means that the surrogate model is more uncertain the figure indicates that rsr model generally outputs more certain components identity in most cases thereby produces a higher connection degree and weighs more in the ensemble model the bayesian set pair analysis presents a more reliable way to average the rsr ann and svm models since the model weights take into consideration both training data and testing data hence bayesian set pair analysis presents a good choice to build a robust ensemble model 5 2 performance assessment of surrogate models the model prediction performance based on the four statistical metrics over the training dataset and the testing dataset at the six monitoring locations is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the surrogate models have the statistical measures slightly different from each other due to predictive uncertainty after being trained all surrogate models have nse higher than 0 96 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 4 and pearson correlation coefficient high than 0 98 the testing samples show that all surrogate models have nse higher than 0 92 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 5 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 96 all surrogate models were well trained and have reliable predictive capability at the monitoring locations in more detailed comparison the rsr models perform better over the ann and svm models except at m5 where the ann model performs better than the other two models the ensemble surrogate models in figs 6 and 7 have performance closer to the rsr models at all monitoring locations compared to the training samples the ensemble surrogate models have nse higher than 0 98 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 18 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 99 compared to the testing samples the ensemble surrogate models have nse higher than 0 95 rmse less than 1 0 msre less than 0 26 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 97 overall the ensemble surrogates predict well the chloride concentrations with respect to both the training data and the testing data this study also compared model performance of using bayesian set pair weights with equal weights in the ensemble surrogates the results are shown in the supplementary material similarly the ensemble surrogates with bayesian set pair weights perform better than those with equal weights comparing three individual models with the ensemble model although a single surrogate model may sometimes slightly outperform the ensemble surrogate model the ensemble surrogate model is generally more stable and reliable as shown in fig 8 individual surrogate models may produce unexpected high errors at some predictions while the ensemble surrogate model can limit error for every prediction and behaves more stable in principle sufficient training data are essential to guarantee that surrogate models have strong prediction capability especially for pumping data beyond the training and testing datasets therefore instead of using a single surrogate model the machine learning based ensemble surrogate model will substitute the time consuming solute transport models in the aquifer remediation design 5 3 bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization 5 3 1 computational efficiency compared to the solute transport model with running time over 16 h the ensemble surrogate model took seconds for one run which makes saltwater scavenging optimization more efficient for one complete optimization the surrogate assisted optimized solutions generally took 4 to 5 h to converge to the pareto front in contrast it would take thousands of hours to obtain the optimal solutions using the solute transport model in the optimization model hence the surrogate assisted optimization constitutes an invaluable means of saving time in the saltwater intrusion mitigation design 5 3 2 pareto optimal fronts the nsga ii was applied to solving the optimization problem the optimization algorithm used 120 generations and 20 601 functions evaluations to find converged pareto optimal saltwater extraction strategies with a population size of 200 fig 9 presents the pareto fronts obtained under four models rsr model ann model svr model and the ensemble model minimizing total extraction rate and maximizing minimum chloride concentration difference to the mcl are two conflicting objectives which form convex fronts if one allows more saltwater extraction chloride concentration at monitoring wells will be lowered and more away from the mcl the pareto fronts in fig 8 provide a wide spread of solutions for decision makers the pareto solutions refer to a nondominated front of time varied saltwater extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well for a management period of 10 years on the convex pareto front any improvement in one objective requires a corresponding decline in the other objective where there exist many tradeoffs between the two conflicting objectives groundwater managers can choose a prescribed solution to implement a specific pumping pattern so as to minimize saltwater extraction and simultaneously limit aquifer salinization the pareto front obtained using the ensemble surrogate model is overall below the pareto fronts obtained using the individual surrogate models it means that to achieve the same minimum chloride concentration difference to the mcl the ensemble surrogate model would recommend to extract more saltwater than the individual surrogate models this conservative consequence comes from using the bayesian set pair analysis where the ensemble surrogate model takes into consideration all three surrogates set pairs that quantify certainties and uncertainties and all training and testing datasets bayesian set pair analysis is firstly proposed in this study to develop more reliable ensemble groundwater surrogate models for bi objective saltwater scavenging design the ensemble based approach is found to derive more reliable optimal solutions while retaining the computational advantages of employing surrogate modeling approach therefore ensemble surrogate models will be appealing to other simulation optimization groundwater management studies 5 4 validation of surrogate model solutions once optimal extraction rates were identified by the ensemble surrogate assisted optimization model solution validity was checked via the solute transport model fig 10 shows the leading edges of chloride concentration 250 mg l through the solute transport model at the end of remediation period where a b and c represent three saltwater scavenging strategies shown in fig 9 the differences in the chloride concentrations for the three optimal solutions are given in table 2 before proposed saltwater scavenging the saltwater plume migrates northward chloride concentration at usgs well eb 1028 screened at the 2000 foot sand is already above 250 mg l since 2000 and continues to increase see fig 11 with the saltwater scavenging strategies the saline plume can be retreated and prevented from moving towards the industrial district the strategy c has the most remarkable remediation effect with very large total extraction rate of 83 926 m3 day where the optimal pumping schedule q1 to q10 during the ten years 2000 2009 is 6987 8513 8896 8481 7945 5853 13 112 8777 6886 8476 m3 day the pumping schedule q1 to q10 for strategy a is 3573 5722 8431 10 121 8220 2815 11 590 7256 3498 9365 m3 day the scavenging strategies can effectively reduce chloride concentration at eb 1028 shown in fig 11 by the end of 2009 chloride concentration could be reduced to as low as 100 mg l 6 conclusions surrogate models are widely used in research to substitute complex numerical simulation models for groundwater management instead of relying on a stand alone surrogate model this study aims to propose an ensemble surrogate modeling approach for predicting saltwater intrusion process and capturing the response from a high fidelity solute transport model bayesian set pair analysis is newly presented to construct the ensemble surrogates by addressing prediction uncertainty persisting in three machine learning models first compared with a standalone surrogate model the machine learning based ensemble groundwater surrogate models have strong capability to perform accurate and stable chloride concentration predictions while retaining the advantages of achieving high computational efficiency besides bayesian set pair analysis appears to be an appealing method to build reliable ensemble

5969,surrogate models are often adopted to substitute computationally intensive groundwater simulation models for aquifer management due to their high effectiveness and computing efficiency however solutions of using only one surrogate model are prone to large prediction uncertainty this study compares individual surrogate models and an ensemble surrogate model in an optimal groundwater remediation design problem three machine learning based surrogate models response surface regression model artificial neural network and support vector machine were developed to replace a high

introduction saltwater intrusion to coastal or inland freshwater aquifers has been a serious threat to water resources around the world barlow and reichard 2010 werner et al 2013 freshwater injection and saltwater scavenging to form hydraulic barriers are common measures to mitigate saltwater intrusion problems lu et al 2017 luyun et al 2011 sreekanth and datta 2010 yin and tsai 2018 especially optimization models are essential in the design process to find optimal solutions such as location and pumping rate of injection and scavenger wells keir et al 2019 yang et al 2017 besides high fidelity groundwater simulation models are crucial to obtain reliable solutions in the optimization models because real world aquifer systems are highly heterogenous and complex real world groundwater management is multiobjective in nature which involves conflicting objectives mani et al 2016 zatarain salazar et al 2017 population based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms deb et al 2002 zitzler 1999 are proven to obtain nondominated trade off solutions among different objectives but requires massive simulation model runs highly complex groundwater models rigorously accommodate detailed properties of the real world gosses et al 2018 sreekanth and datta 2011 however they tend to be computationally intensive and even prohibit to be used in optimization and uncertainty analysis rajabi and ketabchi 2017 one potential approach to substantially reducing computational burden is to substitute computationally expensive simulation models with properly trained and validated surrogate models razavi et al 2012 in recent years surrogate models are appealing to optimization models because surrogate models can represent expensive groundwater models in large scale nonlinear optimization problems and achieve high computational efficiency asher et al 2015 song et al 2018 increasingly more popular surrogate modeling approaches in water resources have been reported in the literature bazargan et al 2015 presented a polynomial chaos proxy model to emulate flow response within subsurface reservoir for uncertainty quantification a statistical model was developed using the bagging multivariate adaptive regression splines method to substitute a modflow model chen et al 2017 andrade et al 2016 used an alternative artificial neural network to estimate disinfectant concentrations for optimal water distribution system design other surrogate methods such as radial basis functions support vector machines and space time kriging ruybal et al 2019 varouchakis et al 2019 have been adopted for water resources optimization sensitivity analysis or forecasting bhosekar and ierapetritou 2018 nourani et al 2017 yu et al 2006 while the surrogate models are widely used no one is universally superior in all cases previous researches were generally based on a standalone surrogate model and rarely made efforts to improve approximation accuracy of surrogate models sufficiently through ensemble modeling chen et al 2017 ataie ashtiani et al 2013a b since a surrogate model is generally applied for approximating the input and output relationship of the original numerical simulation model the key issue is the performance of the surrogate model hou et al 2017 in some cases the performance of a standalone surrogate model is not stable because outputs with large residuals errors may be obtained in the feasible domain of input space especially in the optimization process the existence of such samples with large residuals may increase the risk of obtaining a misleading optimum sreekanth and datta 2011 there is a limit that using surrogates cannot guarantee the same optimum as using the original models christelis and mantoglou 2016 besides predictive uncertainty from surrogate models may influence the feasibility of solutions obtained from the simulation optimization framework hence it is necessary to assemble various surrogate modeling approaches and thereby avoid inferior optimization solutions from using only one surrogate model sreekanth and datta 2011 the present study proposes robust machine learning based ensemble surrogate modeling method combined with advanced sampling design to predict saltwater intrusion in a deep aquifer the surrogate models are the machine learning models including response surface regression models artificial neural networks and support vector machines many available methods can be used to account for model prediction uncertainty through a weighted average ensemble of metamodels xing et al 2019 presented an ensemble surrogate model through an adaptive metropolis markov chain monte carlo method to identify groundwater contaminant sources ouyang et al 2017 constructed ensemble surrogates using a gaussian process for an optimal groundwater remediation design set pair analysis spa is proposed as a new approach to build an ensemble surrogate model by utilizing unique features of individual models the spa is an efficient method that analyzes the internal uncertainty relationship of a system using a connection degree zhao and xuan 1996 and its effectiveness on prediction and assessment has been confirmed in many fields hou et al 2017 kumar and garg 2018 men and liu 2018 roy and datta 2018 zeng and huang 2018 but rarely applied to the groundwater area moreover previous studies only rely on testing data to assign set pair weights to individual models and ignore prior information from training data bayes rule provides a robust way to overcome this issue by considering a prior basis and complete data information when calculating model weights bayes theorem has been widely applied to account for model uncertainty chitsazan et al 2015 li and tsai 2009 liu and merwade 2018 liu and merwade 2019 min and hense 2006 but has not been used to address prediction uncertainty of surrogate models in conjunction with set pair analysis to the best knowledge of the authors bayesian set pair analysis is firstly proposed in this study to develop more reliable ensemble groundwater surrogate models for saltwater scavenging design by calculating a bayesian set pair weight for each machine learning model in this work the main objective is to develop machine learning based ensemble groundwater surrogate models to predict saltwater intrusion in an optimal remediation design for the multi aquifer system in the baton rouge area louisiana in order to address prediction uncertainty of using machine learning models bayesian set pair analysis was used to construct ensemble surrogate models which capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates the ensemble surrogate models were then used in a bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization to derive a set of pareto optimal saltwater extraction strategies subjected to the constraints of controlling saltwater intrusion two conflicting objectives were formulated in the study the first objective was to minimize the total extraction rate from a horizontal scavenger well the second objective was to maximize the minimum difference in chloride concentration below a mcl maximum contamination level at monitoring locations the maximin problem was further transformed into a conventional maximization problem eventually the optimization model involved two conflicting objectives the ensemble surrogate assisted optimal solutions were verified through the physically based numerical simulation model and compared with the solutions obtained using only a single surrogate model in the optimization besides modeling of a horizontal scavenger well for a deep aquifer is the first time to investigate if it is an effective approach to mitigate the saltwater intrusion threat confronting the baton rouge metropolitan area the study is structured as follows i conducting experimental design to generate input output patterns from the physically based solute transport model ii developing three surrogate models including response surface regression models artificial neural networks and support vector machines iii evaluating and comparing the performance of individual surrogate models iv adopting bayesian set pair analysis to establish ensemble surrogate models v formulating a bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization model vi conducting transformation to convert the bi objective optimization model and vii applying the proposed methodology to a real world optimal saltwater scavenging design 2 saltwater intrusion and mitigation in the baton rouge multi aquifer system excessive groundwater withdrawals north of baton rouge fault fig 1 a primarily for public supply and industrial use have induced unfavorable saltwater movement northward across the baton rouge fault chitsazan and tsai 2015 tomaszewski 1996 tsai 2010 whiteman 1977 yin and tsai 2019 the source of saline water comes from salt domes south of the baton rouge fault bray and hanor 1990 pham and tsai 2017 developed a baton rouge groundwater model which covers 11 freshwater aquifers including the mississippi river alluvial aquifer mraa the 400 foot sand down to the 2800 foot sand the study area shown in fig 1a covers 513 km2 27 km in east west 19 km in north south the groundwater model was discretized into 93 rows 137 columns 162 layers with a cell size 200 m by 200 m and varying layer thickness a total of 808 078 active computational cells fig 1b shows the complex groundwater model structure at a cross section a a in fig 1a the historical groundwater head data from the u s geological survey usgs observation wells were used to derive the time varied specified head boundary condition and calibrate the groundwater model pham and tsai 2017 using the cma es method hansen et al 2003 the study found that the most significant groundwater level decline is in the 2000 foot sand in the baton rouge industrial district since most of the recorded chloride concentrations in the 2000 foot sand are around a few hundred parts per million the density effect is relatively not significant to simulate the salinity transport in the baton rouge multi aquifer system this study developed a three dimensional solute transport model using mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 by coupling with the groundwater flow model modflow 2005 the historical chloride concentrations from usgs observation wells were used for model calibration yin and tsai 2018 saltwater plume was found to migrate northward in different sands this study particularly focuses on mitigation of the saltwater intrusion issue in the 2000 foot sand where the simulated leading edge of 250 mg l chloride concentration on dec 31 2009 is shown in fig 2 considering salt source bray and hanor 1990 and chloride transport this study proposes a horizontal scavenger well fig 2 to be close to the baton rouge fault to extract saline water and protect public supply wells and industrial wells the horizontal scavenger well is proposed about at 674 8 m below land surface with a screen length of 400 m and a diameter of 0 5 m the revised multi node well mnw2 package konikow et al 2009 offers an improved capability in this study to simulate the horizontal scavenger well the chloride concentrations are simulated at six monitoring locations m1 m6 surrounding the scavenger well fig 2 running the complex groundwater flow and solute transport model takes over 16 h using the physically based simulation model to derive optimal saltwater scavenging strategies is very time consuming because of massive runs of the simulation models in optimization processes thus this study utilizes machine learning based ensemble surrogate models to predict chloride concentrations at the monitoring locations and then develops an aquifer management model for the 2000 foot sand in order to identify optimal saltwater scavenging strategies 3 methodology 3 1 dataset generation developing a surrogate model involves learning from input output datasets the inputs are the time variant extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well and outputs are the resulting chloride concentrations at monitoring locations the decision space is a multidimensional space representing the combination of groundwater extraction rates from the scavenger well at different time periods in this study the training samples and testing samples were generated independently but in the same sampling way first given a desired range an optimal latin hypercube sampling method tang 1993 was employed to generate training data and testing data of extraction rates inputs that well represent the entire decision space this efficient approach adopts a maximum minimum distance criterion i e maximizing the minimum distance between samples the approach divides the cumulative distribution of each input variable into a number of equiprobable intervals and randomly selects one sample from each subinterval secondly once groundwater extraction rates were generated the training inputs and testing inputs were respectively used in modflow 2005 to obtain flow solutions which were used in the mt3dms transport model to obtain chloride concentrations then the input output datasets were used to train and test surrogate models the datasets were generated on a parallel computing platform because the numerical simulation models are very time consuming to further improve surrogate model performance extraction rates inputs were sampled in a desired range 0 15 000 m3 d and then normalized between 0 and 1 the simulated chloride concentrations were transformed into natural logarithms as the response variables 3 2 surrogate models 3 2 1 response surface regression rsr models let c k be the predicted chloride concentration at a monitoring well k and q 1 q 2 q n be the n

ε k is the error term of the surrogate and n is the number of explanatory variables for a full form the total number of the regression coefficients is n 1 n 2 2 to train the surrogate models and select significant terms in eq 1 this study adopts backward stepwise regression draper and smith 2014 analysis which is an effective technique to do so since it supports automatic selection in cases where there are a lot of potential explanatory variables with no anterior knowledge to be used to conduct surrogate selection for all training samples at all monitoring wells eq 1 is written in the following matrix vector form 2 ln c k 1 ln c k 2 lnc k m 1 q i 1 q i 1 q j 1 q i 1 2 1 q i 2 q i 2 q j 2 q i 2 2 1 q i m q i m q j m q i m 2 β 0 k β i k β ij k β ii k ε k 1 ε k 2 ε k m where m is the number of training samples in each step of backward selection given the training samples the regression coefficients can be obtained through the maximum likelihood estimation mle approach eq 1 presents the full form of the second order polynomial rsr model as more model parameters are included in the model the bias decreases while the variance increases to get a trade off between bias and variance following the principle of parsimony this study conducted model selection based on the akaike information criterion correction aicc akaike 1979 where the models were inferred based on the data and ranked from the best to the worst the best model with the minimum aicc was selected in the present study 3 2 2 artificial neural networks anns the study adopts an artificial neural network ann to learn the underlying relationships between inputs extraction rates and outputs chloride concentrations a typical ann method is the multi layer perceptron including one input layer hidden layers and one output layer following the guidelines anmala et al 2000 morshed and kaluarachchi 1998 this study adopts an ann with one hidden layer for simplicity the mathematical formulation of the three layer feedforward ann to predict ln c k is 3 o h j f h i 1 n ω j i q i b j 4 ln c k f o j 1 h ω o j o h j b o where f h and f o are the activation functions for the hidden layer and the output layer respectively b j and b o are the biases which are used to adjust the mean value for the input layer and the hidden layer respectively n is the number of neurons in the input layer h is the number of neurons in the hidden layer o h j is the jth output at the hidden layer ω j i are the synaptic weights between neurons in the input layer and neurons in the hidden layer and ω o j are the synaptic weights between neurons in the hidden layer and neurons in the output layer in this study the number of neurons n in the input layer is the number of extraction rates the number of neurons h in the hidden layer is the same as the number of neurons in the input layer the number of neurons in the output layer is the number of chloride concentrations at the monitoring locations the learning process aims to calculate optimal weights for the synaptic connections between artificial neurons by minimizing prediction errors khalil et al 2005 given training samples the backpropagation algorithm with the levenberg marquardt method was applied to train the anns log sigmoid function in the hidden layer f h and purelin function in the output layer f o were selected as activation functions for better performance the training procedure continued until 1 a specified maximum number of epochs was met or 2 the performance gradient fell below a specified minimum gradient 3 2 3 support vector machines svms a support vector machine represents a machine learning model for classification and regression this study uses the svm as a regression method which project the inputs extraction rates into a high dimensional feature space through a nonlinear mapping vapnik 2013 by performing such a mapping the learning algorithm seeks to find a hyperplane for applying a linear regression in the svm formulation vapnik 2013 which can be described by 5 ln c k i 1 m ω i ϕ i q b 0 where the functions ϕ i q i 1 m are the feature space representations of the extraction rates q q i m is the number of support vectors that contain the information necessary to capture the hyperplane ω ω 1 ω 2 ω m are the svm weights b 0 is the bias the nonlinear mapping from q into a higher dimensional feature space ϕ q is conducted by selecting a kernel function this study applied a gaussian kernel function keerthi and lin 2003 such that the nonlinear problem was able to be converted into a linear problem b 0 ω and the corresponding m support vectors in the support vector machine were estimated by training samples 3 2 4 statistical assessment for model performance independent testing data are used to evaluate the model performance based on the criteria in eqs 6 9 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse root mean square error rmse mean absolute relative error mare and pearson correlation coefficient r which are expressed as follows 6 nse 1 i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i 2 i 1 n ln c k i ln c k 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i 2 8 mare 1 n i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i ln c k i 9 r i 1 n ln c k i ln c k i n ln c k ln c k i 1 n ln c k i 2 n ln c k 2 i 1 n ln c k i 2 n ln c k 2 where n is the sample size c k i is the chloride concentration at sample i from the solute transport model at monitoring location k c k i is the predicted chloride concentration at sample i from a surrogate model at monitoring location k ln c k is the mean log concentration of all samples from the solute transport model at monitoring location k and ln c k is the mean log concentration of all samples from a surrogate model at monitoring location k 3 3 ensemble surrogate models 3 3 1 model averaging the performance of a standalone surrogate model may not be stable because some samples with large errors can be obtained the existence of such samples may render pumping rates suboptimal or even infeasible asher et al 2015 in this study set pair analysis spa is introduced as an efficient method to build an ensemble model which can limit the error of each sample information from set pairs constructed using model predictions is used to calculate set pair weights however past studies only rely on the information from testing data to assign set pair weights and ignore training data as a prior basis hence to derive a more reliable surrogate model the present study adopts bayesian set pair analysis as a new method to construct weighted average ensemble surrogate models for saltwater scavenging design and to account for salinity prediction uncertainty from surrogate models 10 ln c k q s ω k s ln c k s q where c k s is the chloride concentration at monitoring location k predicted using the s th surrogate model s 1 2 3 and ω k s is the model weight for the s th surrogate model 3 3 2 set pair weights spa hou et al 2017 men and liu 2018 roy and datta 2018 zeng and huang 2018 zhao and xuan 1996 considers certainties and uncertainties from three aspects e g identity discrepancy and contradistinction suppose that set a and a relative set b construct a set pair s a b for example a ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k n is the set of n chloride concentrations at monitoring location k by inputting n samples training or testing of extraction rates to the simulation model and b ln c k 1 ln c k 2 ln c k n is the set of chloride concentrations at monitoring location k by inputting n samples training or testing of extraction rates to a surrogate model zhao and xuan 1996 introduced a three element connection degree by classifying three characteristics between set a and set b into identity discrepancy and contradistinction as follows 11 μ i n d n i t n j where μ is the connection degree i is the number of identical characteristics where identity means set a to be identical to set b d is the number of discrepant characteristics where discrepancy means small error between set a and set b t is the number of contradictory characteristics where contradistinction means significant difference between set a and set b i d t n i is the coefficient of discrepancy varying in 1 1 and j is the coefficient of contradistinction that takes the value of 1 besides the discrepancy d can be further expanded for example feng et al 2014 introduced a four element connection degree as follows 12 μ i n d 1 n i 1 d 2 n i 2 t n j where d 1 is the number of discrepant characteristics for mild discrepancy and d 2 is the number of discrepant characteristics for severe discrepancy let b s ln c k s 1 ln c k s 2 ln c k s n be the set of chloride concentrations at monitoring location k estimated by the sth surrogate model then the associated set pair is denoted by s a b s the set pair is classified into four categories according to the absolute relative residual arr between the surrogate model prediction and the numerically simulated output identity mild discrepancy severe discrepancy and contradistinction xiao et al 2009 in this study depending on model performance features xiao et al 2009 the arr values of less than 0 05 are considered as identical arr values between 0 05 and 0 13 are regarded as mild discrepancy arr values between 0 13 and 0 20 are considered as severe discrepancy and arr values more than 0 20 are considered as contradistinction the connection degree between the s th surrogate model and the simulation model at monitoring location k can be obtained as 13 μ k s i k s n d 1 k s n i 1 d 2 k s n i 2 t k s n j typically the uncertainty component coefficients of the discrepancy degrees i 1 and i 2 are 0 5 and 0 5 respectively the uncertainty coefficient j of contradistinction is 1 the range of μ k s is 1 1 μ k s 1 means that the s th surrogate model output at monitoring location k is certain the surrogate prediction is identical to the simulated output μ k s 1 means that the s th surrogate model output at monitoring location k is uncertain the arr values of all predictions are higher than 0 2 then the set pair weight ω k s of the s th surrogate model at monitoring location k is calculated by 14 ω k s u k s s 1 3 u k s where s ω k s 1 u k s can be expressed as 15 u k s 0 5 μ k s 0 5 where the range of u k s is 0 1 3 3 3 bayesian set pair weights previous studies hou et al 2017 roy and datta 2018 only used testing samples to construct the set pair s a b s and then calculate set pair weights this study adopts bayes rule bolstad and curran 2016 to update the model weights from set pair weights to bayesian set pair weights by involving the training data as follows 16 pr g k s d pr d g k s p r g k s s 1 3 pr d g k s p r g k s where g k s represents a surrogate model s that predicts lnc at monitoring location k d is the testing data pr g k s is the prior probability of surrogate model g k s pr d g k s is the likelihood of surrogate model g k s and pr g k s d the posterior probability of surrogate model g k s which is the bayesian set pair weight the set pair weights ω k s 0 is considered as the prior probability when using training samples as a basis to construct s a b s the likelihood is calculated through u k s in eq 15 when using testing data to construct s a b s therefore the bayesian set pair weights posterior weights can be derived as 17 pr g k s d u k s ω k s 0 s 1 3 u k s ω k s 0 the total weight is unity i e s pr g k s d 1 u k s is calculated using set pairs from testing data and ω k s 0 is calculated using set pairs from training data therefore the ensemble prediction is 18 ln c k q s pr g k s d ln c k s q k the bayesian set pair weights are a good choice for building a robust ensemble model because the model weights are developed by considering data information from both training and testing samples 3 4 optimization model 3 4 1 bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization this study proposes two conflicting objectives to deal with the saltwater intrusion problem in the baton rouge area individual surrogate models and ensemble surrogate models are used to predict chloride concentrations at the six 6 monitoring locations shown in fig 2 the first objective is to minimize groundwater extraction from the horizontal scavenger well as follows 19 minimize i 1 n q i the second objective is to reduce chloride concentrations at the monitoring wells below a predefined maximum contamination level mcl as much as possible which is formulated as a maximin problem 20 maximize minimum c mcl c 1 q c mcl c 2 q c mcl c k q where c mcl is the mcl of chloride concentration and c k is the chloride concentration at monitoring well k at the end of the management period the following constraint is needed to make sure chloride concentrations at the monitoring wells below the mcl 21 c k q c mcl k the bound constraints for the extraction rates are 22 q i min q i q i max where q i min and q i max are the lower and upper limits of the extraction rate q i the chloride concentrations in eqs 20 and 21 are predicted by individual surrogate models in eqs 1 4 and 5 and by the ensemble surrogate models in eq 18 the maximin objective eq 20 is further transformed into a maximization problem by introducing an additional variable z williams 2013 maximize z subject to 24 z c mcl c k q k 3 4 2 multiobjective genetic algorithm non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb et al 2002 nsga ii is applied to solve the bi objective saltwater scavenging problem the algorithm randomly generates candidate solutions which are the groundwater extraction rates for different time periods within the remediation horizon all the generated candidate solutions are evaluated for feasibility and fitness the nsga ⅱ adopts the genetic algorithm operators cross over mutation and selection to evolve the candidate solutions generation by generation until termination criteria are satisfied after each generation the candidate solutions are sorted into nondominated fronts deb et al 2002 gadhvi et al 2016 based upon nondomination rank and crowding distance the solutions are progressively improved to converge to the final pareto optimal front which contains a wide set of optimal extraction strategies for the horizontal scavenger well 3 4 3 verification obtained optimal solutions of extraction rates from the nsga ii are put into the physically based solute transport model to verify if the chloride concentration constraints are met due to surrogate model uncertainty the residual in the salinity prediction i e the difference between the surrogate predicted value and the numerical simulated value can be further evaluated in the case that chloride concentration constraints are violated a flowchart of the methodology is shown in fig 3 which involves two parts ensemble surrogate model development and a groundwater remediation design 4 numerical application the proposed saltwater scavenging optimization model is applied to the saltwater intrusion issue fig 2 in the 2000 foot sand this study aims to investigate the aquifer mitigation effect during a 10 year management period from 2000 to 2009 yearly extraction rates for the horizontal scavenger well are designed totally there are 10 decision variables in the optimization model corresponding to q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 q6 q7 q8 q9 and q10 the lower and upper limits of the extraction rates are 0 and 15 000 m3 d respectively using the optimal latin hypercube sampling technique on extraction rates 200 training samples of chloride concentrations at six monitoring locations were generated by the solute transport model the training sampled were used to build three different types of surrogate models rsr ann and svm and one type of ensemble surrogate model rsr ann svm for each of the six monitoring locations altogether 24 surrogate models were developed moreover 100 testing samples were independently generated to evaluate model performance all the samples were generated by running the expensive groundwater flow model and the solute transport model on a parallel computing platform the management model specified a maximum permissible chloride concentration limit of 250 mg l at the monitoring locations the multiobjective optimization algorithm nsga ii used a population size of 200 the probabilities of crossover and mutation were 0 8 and 0 02 respectively the function and constraint tolerances were set to 10 4 and 10 3 respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 analysis of bayesian set pair weights this study constructed set pairs s a b s using predictions from training data and testing data respectively to calculate three types of set pair weights shown in fig 4 the training data based set pair weights prior weights and the testing data based set pair weights were calculated by eq 14 the bayesian set pair weights posterior weights were calculated by eq 16 if the weight ranking for individual surrogate models is consistent in the training samples and testing samples e g m2 m3 and m5 the same weight ranking will show in the bayesian set pair weights otherwise the posterior weight ranking in the bayesian set pair weights will depend on prior weights eq 14 from the training data and likelihoods from the testing data the rsr model generally has highest weights except at m5 the four characteristics in eq 13 for the three surrogate models using training data and testing data at the six monitoring locations are shown in table 1 the training based and testing based connection degrees were calculated which are shown in fig 5 a value closer to 1 indicates that the surrogate model is more certain at monitoring location k while a value closer to 1 means that the surrogate model is more uncertain the figure indicates that rsr model generally outputs more certain components identity in most cases thereby produces a higher connection degree and weighs more in the ensemble model the bayesian set pair analysis presents a more reliable way to average the rsr ann and svm models since the model weights take into consideration both training data and testing data hence bayesian set pair analysis presents a good choice to build a robust ensemble model 5 2 performance assessment of surrogate models the model prediction performance based on the four statistical metrics over the training dataset and the testing dataset at the six monitoring locations is shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively the surrogate models have the statistical measures slightly different from each other due to predictive uncertainty after being trained all surrogate models have nse higher than 0 96 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 4 and pearson correlation coefficient high than 0 98 the testing samples show that all surrogate models have nse higher than 0 92 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 5 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 96 all surrogate models were well trained and have reliable predictive capability at the monitoring locations in more detailed comparison the rsr models perform better over the ann and svm models except at m5 where the ann model performs better than the other two models the ensemble surrogate models in figs 6 and 7 have performance closer to the rsr models at all monitoring locations compared to the training samples the ensemble surrogate models have nse higher than 0 98 rmse less than 1 0 mare less than 0 18 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 99 compared to the testing samples the ensemble surrogate models have nse higher than 0 95 rmse less than 1 0 msre less than 0 26 and pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0 97 overall the ensemble surrogates predict well the chloride concentrations with respect to both the training data and the testing data this study also compared model performance of using bayesian set pair weights with equal weights in the ensemble surrogates the results are shown in the supplementary material similarly the ensemble surrogates with bayesian set pair weights perform better than those with equal weights comparing three individual models with the ensemble model although a single surrogate model may sometimes slightly outperform the ensemble surrogate model the ensemble surrogate model is generally more stable and reliable as shown in fig 8 individual surrogate models may produce unexpected high errors at some predictions while the ensemble surrogate model can limit error for every prediction and behaves more stable in principle sufficient training data are essential to guarantee that surrogate models have strong prediction capability especially for pumping data beyond the training and testing datasets therefore instead of using a single surrogate model the machine learning based ensemble surrogate model will substitute the time consuming solute transport models in the aquifer remediation design 5 3 bi objective saltwater scavenging optimization 5 3 1 computational efficiency compared to the solute transport model with running time over 16 h the ensemble surrogate model took seconds for one run which makes saltwater scavenging optimization more efficient for one complete optimization the surrogate assisted optimized solutions generally took 4 to 5 h to converge to the pareto front in contrast it would take thousands of hours to obtain the optimal solutions using the solute transport model in the optimization model hence the surrogate assisted optimization constitutes an invaluable means of saving time in the saltwater intrusion mitigation design 5 3 2 pareto optimal fronts the nsga ii was applied to solving the optimization problem the optimization algorithm used 120 generations and 20 601 functions evaluations to find converged pareto optimal saltwater extraction strategies with a population size of 200 fig 9 presents the pareto fronts obtained under four models rsr model ann model svr model and the ensemble model minimizing total extraction rate and maximizing minimum chloride concentration difference to the mcl are two conflicting objectives which form convex fronts if one allows more saltwater extraction chloride concentration at monitoring wells will be lowered and more away from the mcl the pareto fronts in fig 8 provide a wide spread of solutions for decision makers the pareto solutions refer to a nondominated front of time varied saltwater extraction rates of the horizontal scavenger well for a management period of 10 years on the convex pareto front any improvement in one objective requires a corresponding decline in the other objective where there exist many tradeoffs between the two conflicting objectives groundwater managers can choose a prescribed solution to implement a specific pumping pattern so as to minimize saltwater extraction and simultaneously limit aquifer salinization the pareto front obtained using the ensemble surrogate model is overall below the pareto fronts obtained using the individual surrogate models it means that to achieve the same minimum chloride concentration difference to the mcl the ensemble surrogate model would recommend to extract more saltwater than the individual surrogate models this conservative consequence comes from using the bayesian set pair analysis where the ensemble surrogate model takes into consideration all three surrogates set pairs that quantify certainties and uncertainties and all training and testing datasets bayesian set pair analysis is firstly proposed in this study to develop more reliable ensemble groundwater surrogate models for bi objective saltwater scavenging design the ensemble based approach is found to derive more reliable optimal solutions while retaining the computational advantages of employing surrogate modeling approach therefore ensemble surrogate models will be appealing to other simulation optimization groundwater management studies 5 4 validation of surrogate model solutions once optimal extraction rates were identified by the ensemble surrogate assisted optimization model solution validity was checked via the solute transport model fig 10 shows the leading edges of chloride concentration 250 mg l through the solute transport model at the end of remediation period where a b and c represent three saltwater scavenging strategies shown in fig 9 the differences in the chloride concentrations for the three optimal solutions are given in table 2 before proposed saltwater scavenging the saltwater plume migrates northward chloride concentration at usgs well eb 1028 screened at the 2000 foot sand is already above 250 mg l since 2000 and continues to increase see fig 11 with the saltwater scavenging strategies the saline plume can be retreated and prevented from moving towards the industrial district the strategy c has the most remarkable remediation effect with very large total extraction rate of 83 926 m3 day where the optimal pumping schedule q1 to q10 during the ten years 2000 2009 is 6987 8513 8896 8481 7945 5853 13 112 8777 6886 8476 m3 day the pumping schedule q1 to q10 for strategy a is 3573 5722 8431 10 121 8220 2815 11 590 7256 3498 9365 m3 day the scavenging strategies can effectively reduce chloride concentration at eb 1028 shown in fig 11 by the end of 2009 chloride concentration could be reduced to as low as 100 mg l 6 conclusions surrogate models are widely used in research to substitute complex numerical simulation models for groundwater management instead of relying on a stand alone surrogate model this study aims to propose an ensemble surrogate modeling approach for predicting saltwater intrusion process and capturing the response from a high fidelity solute transport model bayesian set pair analysis is newly presented to construct the ensemble surrogates by addressing prediction uncertainty persisting in three machine learning models first compared with a standalone surrogate model the machine learning based ensemble groundwater surrogate models have strong capability to perform accurate and stable chloride concentration predictions while retaining the advantages of achieving high computational efficiency besides bayesian set pair analysis appears to be an appealing method to build reliable ensemble surrogate models by using the bayesian set pair weights incorporating both training and testing data while accounting for model prediction uncertainty in addition the obtained convex pareto front provides a wide spread of optimal extraction solutions for groundwater managers comparing against the solutions obtained from the single surrogate based modeling the ensemble based optimization modeling approach is found to provide more reliable and conservative pareto optimal solutions for saltwater scavenging design finally saltwater scavenging design using a horizontal scavenger well
