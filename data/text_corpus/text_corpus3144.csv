15720,water resource recovery facilities wrrf face increasingly dynamic stressors such as higher rainfall intensity and extended dry periods which can exert stress on ageing water infrastructure and processes these events can generate process stresses which lead to wastewater process failures which result in pollution events that could be identified from instrument data used for operational compliance monitoring this extraction can be performed on two levels 1 for discrete processes that generate data to monitor process control variables and 2 at the wrrf process boundary global which is mainly used for compliance both levels of data hold valuable information on the dynamic influence of environmental stressors cause and the resulting process stress or resilience effect as dynamic resilience this paper proposes a novel methodology that uses actual water company instrument data to evaluate the discrete unit processes and global wrrf boundary dynamic resilience of a wrrf in the south of the uk dynamic resilience is presented as a four stage methodology which 1 cleans wrrf data and extracts a standard operating condition 2 identifies dynamic high and low flow environmental stressor events one in five years 3 models the process stresses and resilience generated by the imposed dynamic stressor before 4 generating a contoured heat map of process related stresses or resilience as a self ordering window these methods demonstrate the possibility of visualising the dynamics of wrrf resilience dynamic stressors and process stresses resilience resulting from high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors despite some challenges experienced with self ordering window scaling the results demonstrate the possibility of identifying zones of process stress and resilience it may also be possible to expand the methods developed to incorporate storm flows and combined sewer discharges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic wrrf modelling resilience analysis process stress analysis event management contoured process heat map 1 introduction water resource recovery facilities wrrf have long operational lives often beyond the original design intent over time they become vulnerable to emerging dynamic stressors such as the effects of climate change transient populations and unforeseen events related to the modification of human behaviour seen during the global covid 19 pandemic gude and muire 2020 the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change report masson delmotte et al 2021 stated with high confidence that human activity has caused quantifiable increases in heavy precipitation and rising global temperatures extended dry periods followed by high intensity rainfall also the influence of climate scenarios has been explored by abily et al 2021 estimating that for more extreme climate scenarios rcp 4 5 to 8 5 it is unlikely that 28 of european surface water bodies swbs will achieve good ecological status due to reduced dilution recent regulatory reviews on resilience ofwat 2019 concluded that wrrf and infrastructure have suffered many years of neglect becoming vulnerable to novel emergent dynamic stressors consequently biological wastewater treatment processes have experienced process related stresses resulting in serious pollution incidents threatening the natural environment and damaging public health environment agency 2020 matthews 2021 identifying the effect of these dynamic stressors in biological wastewater treatment processes requires expert data analyses for water companies the problem is not data scarcity data typically logged at 15 min intervals but the generation of knowledge from data corominas et al 2018 also the numerous variables associated with dynamic wrrf processes means that knowledge generation from data cannot be performed empirically by plant operators process engineers or scientists as described by butler et al 2014 resilience represents the degree to which the system minimises the level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions meaning failure is defined by its magnitude while absorbing the impact of extreme events however holloway et al 2019 proposed that failure magnitude can be scaled to incorporate wastewater process dynamics allowing measurement through existing wrrf instrument data therefore dynamic resilience includes the conventional stressor cause event analogy but expands to include positive and negative magnitudes of process stresses or resilience effect rather than only exceptional events in this paper the proposed definition of dynamic resilience is the dynamic temporal variation of stressors process stresses and resilience in response to events outside of standard operating conditions this definition aligns with tepes and neumann 2020 who argued that the separate functions of engineered management of functions and ecological existence of functions presented by holling 1996 were not adequate for wastewater management instead the resilience of complex and dynamic biological wastewater treatment systems requires engineered resilience with ecological functions engineered ecology previously holloway et al 2021 proposed discrete dynamic resilience analysis ddra approaches which were limited to discrete unit processes rather than a global wrrf in wastewater management global resilience describes whole system resilience typically in networks and urban drainage zhang et al 2020 currently global resilience methods have not considered wrrf dynamic process stresses which require mechanistic and empirical considerations however diao et al 2016 did introduce the concept of stress in global systems to identify failure scenarios from activity nodes in pipe networks these methods were based on water demand with stress computed as a negative magnitude which is infeasible for complex end of pipe biological wastewater systems which treat varying volumes and characteristics of sewage therefore end of pipe unit processes should incorporate data from discrete unit processes and consider the global effluent nutrient concentrations to create a multivariate understanding of dynamic process stresses or resilience at the wrrf boundary outside of resilience studies research associated with the mechanistic modelling of activated sludge as systems follows a scenario test philosophy such as the benchmark simulation models bsm which simulate possible control strategies vrecko et al 2006 bsm assumes that standard flow values apply assumed flows 150 l per capita per day for the generation of dynamic influent variables gernaey et al 2014 p 16 rather than actual wrrf instrument data alex et al 2018 2008 moreover the bsm approach excludes resilience focussing on effluent quality and operational cost indices these indices would not be suitable for computing resilience which requires scalar indexing to capture the dynamic magnitude of event based stressors and process stresses holloway et al 2021 presently bsm studies exclude two factors 1 evidence of the dynamic stressor events present in actual wrrf data and 2 the stress or resilience occurring in biological wastewater treatment processes juan garcía et al 2017 an extension to bsm modelling practices is data driven modelling where data drives a mathematical model interest has grown in this area primarily due to the pre packaged algorithms available and the accelerated growth in reliable online instrumentation newhart et al 2019 data driven methods analyse correlations and variances between performance variables from actual instrument data dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 hybrid models have recently emerged using deep xu et al 2020 and machine learning hvala and kocijan 2020 to improve model predictions using actual instrument data however these methods have not considered dynamic resilience and are sensitive to data noise from inconsistencies and instrument calibrations grievson 2020 the same can occur for case based reasoning cbr which stores knowledge of process events and remedial actions comas et al 2006 therefore data cleaning reconstruction and validation are required to extend data driven modelling beyond scenario test philosophies and increase the possibility of robust event classification simonovic and arunkumar 2016 this paper aims to investigate whether the dynamic resilience of a wrrf to stressor events can be characterised using actual monitoring data many older wrrfs in the uk have evolved over time with modified processes and additional populations meaning baseline models are not available therefore establishing standard operating ranges from actual data may be an alternative to defining a baseline when sites operate outside the original design intent to address this a five year dataset from a wrrf in the south of the uk will be used as a case study to extract a standard operating condition soc then dynamic resilience will be investigated by applying extreme events peak and minimum flow from a five year data set to an iwa asm1 model of the wrrf finally the potential of visualising the process stress resilience response as self ordering windows sow using a colour contour heatmap will be evaluated this goes beyond typical system failure analyses to compute the significance of actual time based dynamic stressor events and sub events such as the return of storm tank contents following heavy rainfall 2 overview of the dynamic resilience strategy dynamic resilience measures differences from a soc which first requires characterising this differs from bsm methods which use a theoretical baseline model to investigate control strategies the alternative approach explored in this paper extracts a soc from actual data making it specific to a particular unit process or wrrf then variances are scaled as a process stress index psi between 0 and 1 where 0 is the soc and 1 in this case the magnitude of the most extreme event in the five year dataset the opposite indicating reserve capacity or resilience is when the psi ranges from 0 soc and 1 see table 5 in supplementary information numeric scalar indexing for process stress and resilience two simulation boundaries are used to investigate the discrete and global dynamic resilience of biological wastewater treatment processes in the context of this study dynamic resilience from discrete unit processes and global at the wrrf boundary process boundaries are used for individual unit processes ddra process control variables are used to compute the magnitude of variation from the extracted soc additionally at the wrrf boundary variations from the soc apply to the global dynamic resilience analysis gdra dynamic resilience at the wrrf process boundary to visually interpret the outputs of ddra and gdra a colour contour heat map approach has been investigated based on the use of sow these use instrument data driven mechanistic models to evaluate dynamic stressors and process stresses resilience as individual heat maps covering 48 h 3 proposed approach for evaluating global dynamic resilience both ddra and gdra start with the computation of process performance parameters such as failure probability and reliability the sow for ddra and gdra present scalar process stresses and or resilience as a contoured heat map using psi as the magnitude of process stress over 48 h these two boundaries discrete and global allow the evaluation of dynamic resilience with the concept of scale from discrete unit processes to an entire wrrf the proposed gdra and ddra approach shown in fig 1 uses historical data from the datastore to extract a twenty four hour dynamic standard operating condition soc as a diurnal profile this data drives a slave soc model which is compared to a master model and is fed by site instrument data to evaluate the magnitude of process stress or resilience event manifestation and decline were captured by the 48 h centred at 24 h event window and used to drive slave and master models the simulation outputs computed scalar matrices si psi from model simulation and were used to visualise the sow and finally descriptive parameters p f and r e l 3 1 data validation and standard operating condition extraction all wrrf instrument data was processed for data driven simulations using matlab verr2020b and simulink selected instrument data covered five years from 2015 to 2021 logged either hourly or 15 min intervals a heuristic data validation was performed according to levels 0 to 3 as presented by cugueró escofet et al 2016 interpreted from aenor une en norm 500540 as shown in table 1 outliers were removed from the possible wastewater flow range 100 and 390 l s 1 this covered erroneous values where flows fell to zero during instrument calibration and impossible conditions e g flows above the storm diversion threshold of 390 l s 1 after data cleaning linear interpolations were performed to reconstruct missing data flow data clustering to identify different operating conditions has previously been applied to a wrrf in italy finding k 7 clusters to be optimum borzooei et al 2020 using the same clustering method k means squared euclidean clustering it was possible to separate three clusters accurately low soc and high flow a possible reason for the difference in cluster number is related to climatic differences between the uk and italy a soc was created between the two conditions when only two clusters were possible high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors were identified by computing and evaluating the prominence of events positive and negative and then aligning all measured variables classification of events used a the scaled prominence of positive and negative where 0 to 1 represents high flow events 0 soc 1 high flow event and 0 to 1 the low flow event 0 soc 1 low flow event this eliminated less significant events selecting only the most significant in the five years investigated after event selection the normality of the isolated 48 h dataset was tested using the anderson darling normality test then validated against the soc using a kruskal wallis test to ensure verification of asm1 models was comparable normalised root mean squared of error nrmse eq 1 was used with the mean absolute percentage error mape eq 2 as demonstrated by wang et al 2022 when evaluating model accuracy 1 n r m s e i 1 n y p y m 2 n y m 2 m a p e 1 n i 1 n y p y m y m 100 where y p is the predicted model outcome and y m the measured variable 3 2 global and discrete dynamic resilience approach the high and low flow 48 h event window centred at 24 h was used as a timeseries to compute the ddra magnitude of variation from soc for primary sedimentation ps as and secondary sedimentation three stages were used to compute the dynamic stressor and process stress indexes s i i and p s i using s o c 1 n as a reference condition first the discrete variation occurring in the verified 48 h event window e s i 1 n was computed from the s o c 1 n according to eqs 3 and 4 then the variation y was standardised z p s 1 n according to eq 5 before rescaling eqs 6 and 7 to the required range 0 to 1 or 1 to 1 for dynamic stressor s i i n and process stress p s i i n indexing these s i i and p s i indexes now as a matrix of scalar values were then plotted as a contoured heat map or sow 3 s i i s o c t 1 s o c t n e s i t 1 e s i t n s i i 1 1 s i i 1 n s i i 2 1 s i i 2 n s i i 3 1 s i i 3 n 4 p s i s o c t 1 s o c i n e p s t 1 e p s t n p s i

sedimentation were considered stressed when the monitored parameter exceeds the soc probability of process failure in the upper tier p f u t and resilient below the soc probability of process failure in the lower tier p f l t however biological processes eq 9 experience constant stress positive and negative soc variation with an example by wang and zhang 2010 when investigating the effect of microbial stress during microbial starvation in as therefore upper and lower tier failures and their magnitude should be considered together p f u t p f l t eq 10 represents the reliability r e l of

data driven global dynamic resilience empirical and mechanistic modelling approach process related equations start with eq 11 for ps adapted from tchobanoglous et al 2014 p 391 for a differential form the r b o d t s s is ps removal efficiency with respect to time t v p s t is the volume of the ps q i n is the influent flowrate as a function of time t with a and b empirical constants for bod5 a 0 018 b 0 020 and tss a 0 0075 b 0 014 the sludge generated from the ps was assumed to be approximately 3 dry solids according to andreoli et al 2007 eq 12 from the settleable solids removal computed in eq 11 11 r b o d t s s t v p s t q i n a b v p s t q i n 12 v s l d t r b o d t s s t s s b o d q i n 0 03 13 r i j 1 n v i j ρ j 14 j t s s a t s o r q h s a r r t v h s t q h s iwa asm1 eq 13 modelling methods were adapted according to holloway et al 2021 and extended to include all processes presented by henze et al 2002 the dutch foundation of applied water research stowa protocol hulsbeek et al 2002 was modified for data driven model calibration based on the measured concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the calibration of the data driven model included validation stages resulting in a mape of 3 64 10 5 and 3 12 10 5 and nrmse of 5 44 and 8 56 for the anoxic and aerated activated sludge zones respectively this provided the required accuracy of modelled outputs to demonstrate the ddra and gdra methodology secondary sedimentation was relative to measured flow and evaluated on three parameters 1 the solids flux j 2 the surface overflow rate sor and 3 the relative retention time rrt according to eq 14 it is important to note that all secondary sedimentation parameters are time based as such there is a time delay related to the retention of ps and as which includes all recirculated flows and upstream sludge extractions 4 wrrf system description and dynamic resilience to environmental stressor results 4 1 wastewater treatment system description an operational modified ludzack ettinger mle process located in the south of the uk was selected to investigate the application of the ddra and gdra the mle system serves a largely rural population equivalent of 53 050 and experienced a significant increase in median flow from 226 to 356 l s 1 between 2015 and 2020 only complete years considered the system consists of screening and degritting followed by ps the settled flows are combined with ras and pumped to the anoxic and aerobic zones before secondary sedimentation long term instrument data 2015 to 2021 was selected from two process boundaries 1 the gdra process boundary and 2 the ddra process boundary which includes ps as and secondary sedimentation fig 2 process boundary 1 used compliance based instrument data from the periphery of the wrrf the gdra parameters monitored include influent flow l s 1 ammonium nh4 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn mg l 1 and turbidity ntu this instrument data was validated and clustered to generate a soc according to table 1 process boundary 2 is the ddra grey box investigation of dynamic resilience for each major unit process with sampling data used to estimate the bod5 and tss concentrations during events instrument data from process boundary 2 included mlss for each aeration lane ras as mlss dissolved oxygen do and temperature process boundary 2 is the level of data commonly used by operational management to perform empirical performance based interventions using control charts corominas et al 2018 4 2 discrete evaluation of dynamic resilience of wrrf against dynamic environmental stressors as shown in table 2 k means clustering accurately identified the soc as a diurnal profile using three clusters which accounted for 63 of data points low soc and high the low flow stressor was selected to reflect the highly concentrated sewage presented to wrrf during prolonged dry periods which are predicted to become more common with climate change sterk et al 2016 conversely the high flow stressor is the peak five year event that 1 fills storm tanks when the flow exceeds 390 l s 1 and 2 returns the contents of storm tanks within 24 h of the high flow event the isolated events were neither normal or log normal but were verified as having a significant difference p 0 05 from the soc table 2 high flow showed a larger divergence from the soc when comparing low and high flow dynamic environmental stressor events chi square 268 53 this indicates restrictions in the upper flow range varying to the point of storm diversion 390 l s 1 but the low flow event had a smaller range closer to the soc fig 3 shows the discrete process stress resilience response of the operational mle system to a low flow dynamic environmental stressor verified according to table 1 the low flow dynamic environmental stressor is shown on the left displaying event prominence as a negative scalar the first ddra process is ps which for tss and bod5 shows similar characterisation due to the empirical performance equations used eq 11 the ps displays resilience under low flow conditions provided sludge extraction is managed appropriately therefore the sow for tss and bod5 showed moderate to extreme resilience p s i 1 to 0 5 at low flow concentrations and moderate to neutral p s i 0 5 to 0 at the upper flow concentration quadrant this observation corresponds with table 3 where pf is 0 00 for the low flow dynamic environmental stressor event indicating that the ps is 100 reliable primary sludge generation in fig 3 is somewhat different where resilience relates to the quantity of sludge generated therefore the most resilient conditions occur when the dilution rate is highest i e the least sludge generated per m3 of wastewater treated 800 to 1000 m3 h 1 the asm1 mle data driven model generated three process stress simulations for low flow dynamic environmental stressor conditions in fig 3 the first sow is mlss second heterotrophic biomass fig 3e and third autotrophic bacteria fig 3h each sow visualises bi directional changes in bacterial populations using a stress scalar of 1 to 0 process stresses for mlss in fig 3b mainly occurred at the lowest concentration and highest flow with heterotrophic biomass showing similar characteristics although heterotrophic process stresses extended across the upper periphery of the sow autotrophic bacteria in fig 3h show the least process stress of all as sow but exhibited concentrated process stresses at the lowest flow and highest nh4 concentration this indicates that slow growing autotrophs approx 7 5 x slower than heterotrophs cannot increase microbial populations rapidly enough to reduce high nh4 concentrations it also corresponds with the failure characteristics for autotrophic bacteria in table 3 displaying a mean pf of 0 46 and 54 reliability as observed for pst in fig 3 the secondary sedimentation shows resilience and neutral stress at all flow and j ranges fig 3c approaching neutral process stress at flows 800 m3 h 1 it is also evidenced in table 3 by the pf of 0 05 and reliability increase to 95 process stresses related to sor in fig 3f are comparable to tss and bod5 for the ps varying between resilience and neutral process stresses pf 0 11 and 89 reliable the rrt of secondary sedimentation according to fig 3i shows the process with moderate resilience to the low flow dynamic environmental stressor although table 3 has a slightly higher pf at 0 15 possibly related to the neutral stresses observed at 400 m3 h 1 and rrt of 2 3 h fig 4 shows the process stress response of the operational mle system to a high flow dynamic environmental stressor verified according to table 1 the dynamic stressor event is shown on the left of fig 4 and includes event prominence as a positive scalar the sow for tss and bod5 in fig 4 display process stresses and resilience on the same plot due to bi directional data points generated at high flow conditions tss in fig 4a shows a large area of process stress above 40 mg tss l 1 across the entire flow range most concentrated at upper flow concentration psi 0 6 which is also captured in table 3 with a pf of 0 41 and 59 reliability tss shows resilience and neutral stresses occurring at the lowest flow concentration therefore the ps process is resilient and stressed during the dynamic high flow environmental stressor event the bod5 in fig 4d shows a larger resilient neutral zone approaching the centre of the flow range although this is not reflected in table 3 with a pf of 0 56 due to a higher density of data points in the upper tier the primary sludge generation in fig 4g shows a wide resilient neutral range from 1 5 to 3 5 m3 h 1 and flows up to 1250 m3 h 1 again with a highly concentrated stress zone at the highest flow concentration the asm1 mle data driven model for high flow dynamic environmental stressor conditions again generated three process stress simulations mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria as shown in fig 4 it displays the most concentrated stresses between 500 and 700 m3 h 1 and the upper range of concentrations however the concentrations of mlss heterotrophs and autotrophs show a narrow range with variations of 40 200 and 10 mg l 1 respectively highlighting the requirement for further scaling neutral process stresses occur for mlss fig 4b as a general linear decline over the narrow concentration range whereas heterotrophic bacteria fig 4e experience this at 1600 mg l 1 and autotrophic fractions fig 4h at 168 mg l 1 exhibit this from 800 m3 h 1 this suggests that although the mlss has a relatively wide operational range in relation to flow heterotrophic and autotrophic populations have a narrow neutral stress range due to the restricted range of concentrations it is also evident from case 1b in table 3 where diversion of excess flow to storm tanks reduces the impact of the high flow dynamic environmental stressor events with a mean pf of 0 37 and reliability of 63 the secondary sedimentation in fig 4 for j shows a large resilient neutral zone across the flow range up to 4 5 kg m3 h 1 with a small zone of concentrated process stress above although the process remained resilient with pf of 0 00 and 100 reliability sor in fig 4f shows a similar result but a larger concentrated stress zone propagating from the highest flow concentration reflected in the reduction of pf to 0 25 in table 3 rrt in fig 4i is generally proportional to process efficiency for physical sedimentation processes resulting in a large resilient neutral zone spanning the sow between 2 5 and 3 3 h whereas concentrated process stresses occurred at the highest flows and lowest rrt 4 4 global evaluation of dynamic resilience of wrrf against dynamic environmental stressors the gdra investigated the response of the mle process to dynamic environmental stressors over 48 h the gdra data was provided from instruments monitoring final effluent for nh4 tn and turbidity fig 5 defined as process boundary 1 in fig 2 in addition the generation of sow for each parameter and the failure characteristics were computed and presented in table 4 starting with nh4 and comparing the reaction to low a and high flow fig 5d dynamic environmental stressor events each sow shows resilient conditions with sharp peaks up to 5 mg nh4 l 1 these spikes are for the high flow dynamic environmental stressor possibly related to storm conditions explaining the four failure data points shown for case 2b in table 4 the tn sow in fig 5b for the low flow dynamic environmental stressor shows a large resilient zone below 6 mg tn l 1 and concentrated process stresses above this value corresponding with a pf of 0 37 and 63 reliability both zones show angular boundaries reflecting the data variation frequency over the limited range the high flow dynamic stressor sow for tn in fig 5a a zone of process stress that occurs above 6 mg tn l 1 is most concentrated at flows 500 m3 h 1 where the dilution effect is minimised this large area of process stress also corresponds with case 2b in table 4 showing a pf of 0 78 and 22 reliability therefore the mle suffers from decreased denitrification efficiency during high flow conditions possibly related to oxic conditions caused by sewer turbulence and dilute organic carbon entering the anoxic zones the sow for turbidity in fig 5c shows resilience across all flows and concentrations for cases 2a and 2b in table 4 this possibly relates to the restricted soc range between 10 and 25 ntu and that only one data point occurred in the upper tier as shown for case 2a in table 4 5 discussion 5 1 discrete and global dynamic resilience arising from dynamic environmental stressors the data cleaning and clustering methods extracted a robust soc from long term operational flow data 2015 to 2021 and was used to drive the slave models for ps as and secondary sedimentation the extreme high and low flow dynamic environmental stressor events were selected using prominence as the scaled magnitude of variation from the soc the normality of event data was checked using the anderson darling test and verified kruskal wallace to demonstrate statistically significant differences from the soc the soc timeseries were used to drive the slave model and the master model dynamic environmental stressor data although the methodology demonstrated the potential for event identification in continuous measurement systems some challenges were encountered one of the main limitations is parameter scaling when transforming actual data obtained during high flow stressors mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic populations had a limited concentration range therefore additional scaling is required to determine the influence of sludge age and process related boundary conditions the sow generated by ddra and gdra visualised the as response to dynamic environmental stressors for ps as and secondary sedimentation the sow populated zones of resilience and process stress of varying magnitudes with the low flow dynamic environmental stressor sow displaying mostly resilience to neutral process stress in both sedimentation processes pf 0 1 this was related to simulation outputs occurring below the soc when bod5 and tss concentrations are based on the dilution rates however both sedimentation processes exhibited the most concentrated process stress during the high flow dynamic environmental stressor these concentrated process stresses were particularly evident in the ps with a pf of 0 46 from the influence of storm flows as a process protection mechanism storm flow diversion limited influent flow to 390 l s 1 creating a disproportionate data range although the transfer of storm flows can be a dynamic environmental stressor untreated river discharge when storm tanks have reduced capacity reflecting on abily et al 2021 and the influence of wrrf on swbs future dynamic resilience studies should also consider storm flow storage however knowledge generation requires the classification of historical events and evaluation of the numerous eventualities and magnitudes as an extension the significance of cso discharge to watercourses as an alternative to adaption pathways presented by sadr et al 2020 where water companies now face possible prosecutions for pollution incidents resulting from cso discharges ofwat 2021 the as process presented a particular challenge during dynamic environmental stressor events with process stresses and resilience originating from numerous independent variables within the data driven models although previous studies have investigated asm kinetic parameter sensitivities theoretical changes do not reflect actual operational conditions for water companies learning from unit processes and wrrf data has great value where the source of operational changes is often unknown due to inadequate transactional record keeping previously identified by holloway et al 2019 despite data range visualising neutral and concentrated zones of process stress could develop a consensus for optimum wrrf operation while generating knowledge of dynamic stressor events time based changes such as temperature and nutrient carbon availability are crucial considerations when applying timely mitigations and interventions where dynamic environmental stressors disrupt bacterial growth and decay rates ramin et al 2014 a drawback of the dynamic resilience approach is that wrrf operational data can be infrequent or limited to the requirements of environmental permits newhart et al 2019 therefore the challenge for ddra and gdra is data richness quality quantity and range an example of this was soc misclassification that occurred for turbidity in gdra due to significant data variation reduced data ranges instrument reliability issues and calibration errors interestingly the sow for tn in gdra showed the greatest propensity for process stress of all gdra potentially resulting from autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial populations in the anoxic and oxic zones nitrification denitrification therefore accurate time based tn measurement is essential if n removal is a crucial treatment objective also fractionations of heterotrophs and autotrophs in the ddra sow and any correlations must be considered for model dimension reduction therefore from an applied standpoint and for gdra to be accurate the emphasis should be on improved instrument and data management to generate accurate insights to make informed decisions based on the dynamic resilience of wrrf 5 2 significance of discrete and global dynamic resilience methods this paper proposed a data driven modelling methodology extending research presented by juan garcía et al 2021 to demonstrate the dynamic resilience of wrrf in response to dynamic external environmental stressors the methodology has established a protocol for identifying and characterising dynamic soc classifying dynamic environmental stressor events then simulating and visualising process stresses or resilience however further research is required to ensure that scaling for as processes particularly in response to dynamic high flow stressors better reflects process related effects nevertheless these ddra and gdra methods could be applied alongside benchmark simulations alex et al 2018 where actual wrrf instrument data can be used to visualise the dynamics of resilience moreover it may avoid the computational demand associated with simulating numerous operational scenarios additionally a knowledge base of psi event cases similar to cbr could generate new knowledge of unknown known and known unknown events sweetapple et al 2018 however further research is required to classify the start and end of events from actual data where this research used 48 h events centred at the most significant peak magnitude a possible classification technique could involve characterising dynamic stressors from normalised parameter sensitivities demir and atçı 2021 these methods could group multivariate divergences to classify the type of dynamic stressor and then predict the resultant process stress or resilience previously research on resilience sweetapple et al 2017 has relied on the iwa operational cost and effluent quality indices to measure resilience generating possible solutions to theoretical scenarios ebrahimi et al 2017 however as regulatory requirements increase and data from instruments becomes more reliable it may be possible to extend si and psi indexes to consider actual events extracted from wrrf instrument data to evaluate the real time impact of dynamic resilience the dynamic philosophy of resilience is becoming increasingly relevant to water companies resilience task and finish group 2015 who struggle to manage process performance due to the growing severity of dynamic environmental stressors and water infrastructure deterioration overall this research has made the first step in extracting soc from actual wrrf operating beyond their original process design parameters it has also demonstrated the possibility of analysing the dynamic magnitude of process stress and resilience under the precept of dynamic resilience in turn this has generated an indexing system si and psi from actual wrrf instrument data to generate sow visualisations that communicate the dynamics of resilience 6 conclusions from the simulation of ddra and gdra completed for high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors the following conclusions and future implications can be drawn i the extraction classification and verification methodologies were sufficient to 1 generate a robust soc from long term flow data 2015 to 2021 and 2 verify statistically significant differences between dynamic environmental stressor events and the soc ii sow accuracy was dependant on three factors 1 whether the data range is sufficient to characterise the event and soc 2 the extent of data cleaning required and 3 the suitability of data for clustering methods iii limitations were encountered for as processes under high flow dynamic stressors where further scaling is required to ensure the psi scale is representative of threats to process performance iv it was possible to identify potential optimised operating conditions from the ddra in the as process with the neutral process stresses corresponding with sow for mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic v tn was most sensitive to dynamic environmental stressor events possibly related to nitrification autotrophs and heterotrophic denitrification therefore interventions should consider the numerous bacterial growth rates affecting many functional groups vi tn was most sensitive to dynamic environmental stressor events possibly related to nitrification autotrophs and heterotrophic denitrification therefore interventions should consider the numerous bacterial growth rates affecting many functional groups the simulations presented in this paper could be applied across other infrastructures present in the urban water cycle including storm flow management combined sewer discharges and process emissions also where reliable data knowledge exists dynamic stressors and process stresses could be tracked above and below ground before discharge into swbs therefore having the potential for a real time approach to managing the dynamic resilience of complex wastewater infrastructure funding this research is part of a phd project hosted by the university of portsmouth where the university of portsmouth funded

15720,water resource recovery facilities wrrf face increasingly dynamic stressors such as higher rainfall intensity and extended dry periods which can exert stress on ageing water infrastructure and processes these events can generate process stresses which lead to wastewater process failures which result in pollution events that could be identified from instrument data used for operational compliance monitoring this extraction can be performed on two levels 1 for discrete processes that generate data to monitor process control variables and 2 at the wrrf process boundary global which is mainly used for compliance both levels of data hold valuable information on the dynamic influence of environmental stressors cause and the resulting process stress or resilience effect as dynamic resilience this paper proposes a novel methodology that uses actual water company instrument data to evaluate the discrete unit processes and global wrrf boundary dynamic resilience of a wrrf in the south of the uk dynamic resilience is presented as a four stage methodology which 1 cleans wrrf data and extracts a standard operating condition 2 identifies dynamic high and low flow environmental stressor events one in five years 3 models the process stresses and resilience generated by the imposed dynamic stressor before 4 generating a contoured heat map of process related stresses or resilience as a self ordering window these methods demonstrate the possibility of visualising the dynamics of wrrf resilience dynamic stressors and process stresses resilience resulting from high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors despite some challenges experienced with self ordering window scaling the results demonstrate the possibility of identifying zones of process stress and resilience it may also be possible to expand the methods developed to incorporate storm flows and combined sewer discharges graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dynamic wrrf modelling resilience analysis process stress analysis event management contoured process heat map 1 introduction water resource recovery facilities wrrf have long operational lives often beyond the original design intent over time they become vulnerable to emerging dynamic stressors such as the effects of climate change transient populations and unforeseen events related to the modification of human behaviour seen during the global covid 19 pandemic gude and muire 2020 the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change report masson delmotte et al 2021 stated with high confidence that human activity has caused quantifiable increases in heavy precipitation and rising global temperatures extended dry periods followed by high intensity rainfall also the influence of climate scenarios has been explored by abily et al 2021 estimating that for more extreme climate scenarios rcp 4 5 to 8 5 it is unlikely that 28 of european surface water bodies swbs will achieve good ecological status due to reduced dilution recent regulatory reviews on resilience ofwat 2019 concluded that wrrf and infrastructure have suffered many years of neglect becoming vulnerable to novel emergent dynamic stressors consequently biological wastewater treatment processes have experienced process related stresses resulting in serious pollution incidents threatening the natural environment and damaging public health environment agency 2020 matthews 2021 identifying the effect of these dynamic stressors in biological wastewater treatment processes requires expert data analyses for water companies the problem is not data scarcity data typically logged at 15 min intervals but the generation of knowledge from data corominas et al 2018 also the numerous variables associated with dynamic wrrf processes means that knowledge generation from data cannot be performed empirically by plant operators process engineers or scientists as described by butler et al 2014 resilience represents the degree to which the system minimises the level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions meaning failure is defined by its magnitude while absorbing the impact of extreme events however holloway et al 2019 proposed that failure magnitude can be scaled to incorporate wastewater process dynamics allowing measurement through existing wrrf instrument data therefore dynamic resilience includes the conventional stressor cause event analogy but expands to include positive and negative magnitudes of process stresses or resilience effect rather than only exceptional events in this paper the proposed definition of dynamic resilience is the dynamic temporal variation of stressors process stresses and resilience in response to events outside of standard operating conditions this definition aligns with tepes and neumann 2020 who argued that the separate functions of engineered management of functions and ecological existence of functions presented by holling 1996 were not adequate for wastewater management instead the resilience of complex and dynamic biological wastewater treatment systems requires engineered resilience with ecological functions engineered ecology previously holloway et al 2021 proposed discrete dynamic resilience analysis ddra approaches which were limited to discrete unit processes rather than a global wrrf in wastewater management global resilience describes whole system resilience typically in networks and urban drainage zhang et al 2020 currently global resilience methods have not considered wrrf dynamic process stresses which require mechanistic and empirical considerations however diao et al 2016 did introduce the concept of stress in global systems to identify failure scenarios from activity nodes in pipe networks these methods were based on water demand with stress computed as a negative magnitude which is infeasible for complex end of pipe biological wastewater systems which treat varying volumes and characteristics of sewage therefore end of pipe unit processes should incorporate data from discrete unit processes and consider the global effluent nutrient concentrations to create a multivariate understanding of dynamic process stresses or resilience at the wrrf boundary outside of resilience studies research associated with the mechanistic modelling of activated sludge as systems follows a scenario test philosophy such as the benchmark simulation models bsm which simulate possible control strategies vrecko et al 2006 bsm assumes that standard flow values apply assumed flows 150 l per capita per day for the generation of dynamic influent variables gernaey et al 2014 p 16 rather than actual wrrf instrument data alex et al 2018 2008 moreover the bsm approach excludes resilience focussing on effluent quality and operational cost indices these indices would not be suitable for computing resilience which requires scalar indexing to capture the dynamic magnitude of event based stressors and process stresses holloway et al 2021 presently bsm studies exclude two factors 1 evidence of the dynamic stressor events present in actual wrrf data and 2 the stress or resilience occurring in biological wastewater treatment processes juan garcía et al 2017 an extension to bsm modelling practices is data driven modelling where data drives a mathematical model interest has grown in this area primarily due to the pre packaged algorithms available and the accelerated growth in reliable online instrumentation newhart et al 2019 data driven methods analyse correlations and variances between performance variables from actual instrument data dürrenmatt and gujer 2012 hybrid models have recently emerged using deep xu et al 2020 and machine learning hvala and kocijan 2020 to improve model predictions using actual instrument data however these methods have not considered dynamic resilience and are sensitive to data noise from inconsistencies and instrument calibrations grievson 2020 the same can occur for case based reasoning cbr which stores knowledge of process events and remedial actions comas et al 2006 therefore data cleaning reconstruction and validation are required to extend data driven modelling beyond scenario test philosophies and increase the possibility of robust event classification simonovic and arunkumar 2016 this paper aims to investigate whether the dynamic resilience of a wrrf to stressor events can be characterised using actual monitoring data many older wrrfs in the uk have evolved over time with modified processes and additional populations meaning baseline models are not available therefore establishing standard operating ranges from actual data may be an alternative to defining a baseline when sites operate outside the original design intent to address this a five year dataset from a wrrf in the south of the uk will be used as a case study to extract a standard operating condition soc then dynamic resilience will be investigated by applying extreme events peak and minimum flow from a five year data set to an iwa asm1 model of the wrrf finally the potential of visualising the process stress resilience response as self ordering windows sow using a colour contour heatmap will be evaluated this goes beyond typical system failure analyses to compute the significance of actual time based dynamic stressor events and sub events such as the return of storm tank contents following heavy rainfall 2 overview of the dynamic resilience strategy dynamic resilience measures differences from a soc which first requires characterising this differs from bsm methods which use a theoretical baseline model to investigate control strategies the alternative approach explored in this paper extracts a soc from actual data making it specific to a particular unit process or wrrf then variances are scaled as a process stress index psi between 0 and 1 where 0 is the soc and 1 in this case the magnitude of the most extreme event in the five year dataset the opposite indicating reserve capacity or resilience is when the psi ranges from 0 soc and 1 see table 5 in supplementary information numeric scalar indexing for process stress and resilience two simulation boundaries are used to investigate the discrete and global dynamic resilience of biological wastewater treatment processes in the context of this study dynamic resilience from discrete unit processes and global at the wrrf boundary process boundaries are used for individual unit processes ddra process control variables are used to compute the magnitude of variation from the extracted soc additionally at the wrrf boundary variations from the soc apply to the global dynamic resilience analysis gdra dynamic resilience at the wrrf process boundary to visually interpret the outputs of ddra and gdra a colour contour heat map approach has been investigated based on the use of sow these use instrument data driven mechanistic models to evaluate dynamic stressors and process stresses resilience as individual heat maps covering 48 h 3 proposed approach for evaluating global dynamic resilience both ddra and gdra start with the computation of process performance parameters such as failure probability and reliability the sow for ddra and gdra present scalar process stresses and or resilience as a contoured heat map using psi as the magnitude of process stress over 48 h these two boundaries discrete and global allow the evaluation of dynamic resilience with the concept of scale from discrete unit processes to an entire wrrf the proposed gdra and ddra approach shown in fig 1 uses historical data from the datastore to extract a twenty four hour dynamic standard operating condition soc as a diurnal profile this data drives a slave soc model which is compared to a master model and is fed by site instrument data to evaluate the magnitude of process stress or resilience event manifestation and decline were captured by the 48 h centred at 24 h event window and used to drive slave and master models the simulation outputs computed scalar matrices si psi from model simulation and were used to visualise the sow and finally descriptive parameters p f and r e l 3 1 data validation and standard operating condition extraction all wrrf instrument data was processed for data driven simulations using matlab verr2020b and simulink selected instrument data covered five years from 2015 to 2021 logged either hourly or 15 min intervals a heuristic data validation was performed according to levels 0 to 3 as presented by cugueró escofet et al 2016 interpreted from aenor une en norm 500540 as shown in table 1 outliers were removed from the possible wastewater flow range 100 and 390 l s 1 this covered erroneous values where flows fell to zero during instrument calibration and impossible conditions e g flows above the storm diversion threshold of 390 l s 1 after data cleaning linear interpolations were performed to reconstruct missing data flow data clustering to identify different operating conditions has previously been applied to a wrrf in italy finding k 7 clusters to be optimum borzooei et al 2020 using the same clustering method k means squared euclidean clustering it was possible to separate three clusters accurately low soc and high flow a possible reason for the difference in cluster number is related to climatic differences between the uk and italy a soc was created between the two conditions when only two clusters were possible high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors were identified by computing and evaluating the prominence of events positive and negative and then aligning all measured variables classification of events used a the scaled prominence of positive and negative where 0 to 1 represents high flow events 0 soc 1 high flow event and 0 to 1 the low flow event 0 soc 1 low flow event this eliminated less significant events selecting only the most significant in the five years investigated after event selection the normality of the isolated 48 h dataset was tested using the anderson darling normality test then validated against the soc using a kruskal wallis test to ensure verification of asm1 models was comparable normalised root mean squared of error nrmse eq 1 was used with the mean absolute percentage error mape eq 2 as demonstrated by wang et al 2022 when evaluating model accuracy 1 n r m s e i 1 n y p y m 2 n y m 2 m a p e 1 n i 1 n y p y m y m 100 where y p is the predicted model outcome and y m the measured variable 3 2 global and discrete dynamic resilience approach the high and low flow 48 h event window centred at 24 h was used as a timeseries to compute the ddra magnitude of variation from soc for primary sedimentation ps as and secondary sedimentation three stages were used to compute the dynamic stressor and process stress indexes s i i and p s i using s o c 1 n as a reference condition first the discrete variation occurring in the verified 48 h event window e s i 1 n was computed from the s o c 1 n according to eqs 3 and 4 then the variation y was standardised z p s 1 n according to eq 5 before rescaling eqs 6 and 7 to the required range 0 to 1 or 1 to 1 for dynamic stressor s i i n and process stress p s i i n indexing these s i i and p s i indexes now as a matrix of scalar values were then

sedimentation were considered stressed when the monitored parameter exceeds the soc probability of process failure in the upper tier p f u t and resilient below the soc probability of process failure in the lower tier p f l t however biological processes eq 9 experience constant stress positive and negative soc variation with an example by wang and zhang 2010 when investigating the effect of

data driven global dynamic resilience empirical and mechanistic modelling approach process related equations start with eq 11 for ps adapted from tchobanoglous et al 2014 p 391 for a differential form the r b o d t s s is ps removal efficiency with respect to time t v p s t is the volume of the ps q i n is the influent flowrate as a function of time t with a and b empirical constants for bod5 a 0 018 b 0 020 and tss a 0 0075 b 0 014 the sludge generated from the ps was assumed to be approximately 3 dry solids according to andreoli et al 2007 eq 12 from the settleable solids removal computed in

modelling methods were adapted according to holloway et al 2021 and extended to include all processes presented by henze et al 2002 the dutch foundation of applied water research stowa protocol hulsbeek et al 2002 was modified for data driven model calibration based on the measured concentration of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss the calibration of the data driven model included validation stages resulting in a mape of 3 64 10 5 and 3 12 10 5 and nrmse of 5 44 and 8 56 for the anoxic and aerated activated sludge zones respectively this provided the required accuracy of modelled outputs to demonstrate the ddra and gdra methodology secondary sedimentation was relative to measured flow and evaluated on three parameters 1 the solids flux j 2 the surface overflow rate sor and 3 the relative retention time rrt according to eq 14 it is important to note that all secondary sedimentation parameters are time based as such there is a time delay related to the retention of ps and as which includes all recirculated flows and upstream sludge extractions 4 wrrf system description and dynamic resilience to environmental stressor results 4 1 wastewater treatment system description an operational modified ludzack ettinger mle process located in the south of the uk was selected to investigate the application of the ddra and gdra the mle system serves a largely rural population equivalent of 53 050 and experienced a significant increase in median flow from 226 to 356 l s 1 between 2015 and 2020 only complete years considered the system consists of screening and degritting followed by ps the settled flows are combined with ras and pumped to the anoxic and aerobic zones before secondary sedimentation long term instrument data 2015 to 2021 was selected from two process boundaries 1 the gdra process boundary and 2 the ddra process boundary which includes ps as and secondary sedimentation fig 2 process boundary 1 used compliance based instrument data from the periphery of the wrrf the gdra parameters monitored include influent flow l s 1 ammonium nh4 mg l 1 total nitrogen tn mg l 1 and turbidity ntu this instrument data was validated and clustered to generate a soc according to table 1 process boundary 2 is the ddra grey box investigation of dynamic resilience for each major unit process with sampling data used to estimate the bod5 and tss concentrations during events instrument data from process boundary 2 included mlss for each aeration lane ras as mlss dissolved oxygen do and temperature process boundary 2 is the level of data commonly used by operational management to perform empirical performance based interventions using control charts corominas et al 2018 4 2 discrete evaluation of dynamic resilience of wrrf against dynamic environmental stressors as shown in table 2 k means clustering accurately identified the soc as a diurnal profile using three clusters which accounted for 63 of data points low soc and high the low flow stressor was selected to reflect the highly concentrated sewage presented to wrrf during prolonged dry periods which are predicted to become more common with climate change sterk et al 2016 conversely the high flow stressor is the peak five year event that 1 fills storm tanks when the flow exceeds 390 l s 1 and 2 returns the contents of storm tanks within 24 h of the high flow event the isolated events were neither normal or log normal but were verified as having a significant difference p 0 05 from the soc table 2 high flow showed a larger divergence from the soc when comparing low and high flow dynamic environmental stressor events chi square 268 53 this indicates restrictions in the upper flow range varying to the point of storm diversion 390 l s 1 but the low flow event had a smaller range closer to the soc fig 3 shows the discrete process stress resilience response of the operational mle system to a low flow dynamic environmental stressor verified according to table 1 the low flow dynamic environmental stressor is shown on the left displaying event prominence as a negative scalar the first ddra process is ps which for tss and bod5 shows similar characterisation due to the empirical performance equations used eq 11 the ps displays resilience under low flow conditions provided sludge extraction is managed appropriately therefore the sow for tss and bod5 showed moderate to extreme resilience p s i 1 to 0 5 at low flow concentrations and moderate to neutral p s i 0 5 to 0 at the upper flow concentration quadrant this observation corresponds with table 3 where pf is 0 00 for the low flow dynamic environmental stressor event indicating that the ps is 100 reliable primary sludge generation in fig 3 is somewhat different where resilience relates to the quantity of sludge generated therefore the most resilient conditions occur when the dilution rate is highest i e the least sludge generated per m3 of wastewater treated 800 to 1000 m3 h 1 the asm1 mle data driven model generated three process stress simulations for low flow dynamic environmental stressor conditions in fig 3 the first sow is mlss second heterotrophic biomass fig 3e and third autotrophic bacteria fig 3h each sow visualises bi directional changes in bacterial populations using a stress scalar of 1 to 0 process stresses for mlss in fig 3b mainly occurred at the lowest concentration and highest flow with heterotrophic biomass showing similar characteristics although heterotrophic process stresses extended across the upper periphery of the sow autotrophic bacteria in fig 3h show the least process stress of all as sow but exhibited concentrated process stresses at the lowest flow and highest nh4 concentration this indicates that slow growing autotrophs approx 7 5 x slower than heterotrophs cannot increase microbial populations rapidly enough to reduce high nh4 concentrations it also corresponds with the failure characteristics for autotrophic bacteria in table 3 displaying a mean pf of 0 46 and 54 reliability as observed for pst in fig 3 the secondary sedimentation shows resilience and neutral stress at all flow and j ranges fig 3c approaching neutral process stress at flows 800 m3 h 1 it is also evidenced in table 3 by the pf of 0 05 and reliability increase to 95 process stresses related to sor in fig 3f are comparable to tss and bod5 for the ps varying between resilience and neutral process stresses pf 0 11 and 89 reliable the rrt of secondary sedimentation according to fig 3i shows the process with moderate resilience to the low flow dynamic environmental stressor although table 3 has a slightly higher pf at 0 15 possibly related to the neutral stresses observed at 400 m3 h 1 and rrt of 2 3 h fig 4 shows the process stress response of the operational mle system to a high flow dynamic environmental stressor verified according to table 1 the dynamic stressor event is shown on the left of fig 4 and includes event prominence as a positive scalar the sow for tss and bod5 in fig 4 display process stresses and resilience on the same plot due to bi directional data points generated at high flow conditions tss in fig 4a shows a large area of process stress above 40 mg tss l 1 across the entire flow range most concentrated at upper flow concentration psi 0 6 which is also captured in table 3 with a pf of 0 41 and 59 reliability tss shows resilience and neutral stresses occurring at the lowest flow concentration therefore the ps process is resilient and stressed during the dynamic high flow environmental stressor event the bod5 in fig 4d shows a larger resilient neutral zone approaching the centre of the flow range although this is not reflected in table 3 with a pf of 0 56 due to a higher density of data points in the upper tier the primary sludge generation in fig 4g shows a wide resilient neutral range from 1 5 to 3 5 m3 h 1 and flows up to 1250 m3 h 1 again with a highly concentrated stress zone at the highest flow concentration the asm1 mle data driven model for high flow dynamic environmental stressor conditions again generated three process stress simulations mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria as shown in fig 4 it displays the most concentrated stresses between 500 and 700 m3 h 1 and the upper range of concentrations however the concentrations of mlss heterotrophs and autotrophs show a narrow range with variations of 40 200 and 10 mg l 1 respectively highlighting the requirement for further scaling neutral process stresses occur for mlss fig 4b as a general linear decline over the narrow concentration range whereas heterotrophic bacteria fig 4e experience this at 1600 mg l 1 and autotrophic fractions fig 4h at 168 mg l 1 exhibit this from 800 m3 h 1 this suggests that although the mlss has a relatively wide operational range in relation to flow heterotrophic and autotrophic populations have a narrow neutral stress range due to the restricted range of concentrations it is also evident from case 1b in table 3 where diversion of excess flow to storm tanks reduces the impact of the high flow dynamic environmental stressor events with a mean pf of 0 37 and reliability of 63 the secondary sedimentation in fig 4 for j shows a large resilient neutral zone across the flow range up to 4 5 kg m3 h 1 with a small zone of concentrated process stress above although the process remained resilient with pf of 0 00 and 100 reliability sor in fig 4f shows a similar result but a larger concentrated stress zone propagating from the highest flow concentration reflected in the reduction of pf to 0 25 in table 3 rrt in fig 4i is generally proportional to process efficiency for physical sedimentation processes resulting in a large resilient neutral zone spanning the sow between 2 5 and 3 3 h whereas concentrated process stresses occurred at the highest flows and lowest rrt 4 4 global evaluation of dynamic resilience of wrrf against dynamic environmental stressors the gdra investigated the response of the mle process to dynamic environmental stressors over 48 h the gdra data was provided from instruments monitoring final effluent for nh4 tn and turbidity fig 5 defined as process boundary 1 in fig 2 in addition the generation of sow for each parameter and the failure characteristics were computed and presented in table 4 starting with nh4 and comparing the reaction to low a and high flow fig 5d dynamic environmental stressor events each sow shows resilient conditions with sharp peaks up to 5 mg nh4 l 1 these spikes are for the high flow dynamic environmental stressor possibly related to storm conditions explaining the four failure data points shown for case 2b in table 4 the tn sow in fig 5b for the low flow dynamic environmental stressor shows a large resilient zone below 6 mg tn l 1 and concentrated process stresses above this value corresponding with a pf of 0 37 and 63 reliability both zones show angular boundaries reflecting the data variation frequency over the limited range the high flow dynamic stressor sow for tn in fig 5a a zone of process stress that occurs above 6 mg tn l 1 is most concentrated at flows 500 m3 h 1 where the dilution effect is minimised this large area of process stress also corresponds with case 2b in table 4 showing a pf of 0 78 and 22 reliability therefore the mle suffers from decreased denitrification efficiency during high flow conditions possibly related to oxic conditions caused by sewer turbulence and dilute organic carbon entering the anoxic zones the sow for turbidity in fig 5c shows resilience across all flows and concentrations for cases 2a and 2b in table 4 this possibly relates to the restricted soc range between 10 and 25 ntu and that only one data point occurred in the upper tier as shown for case 2a in table 4 5 discussion 5 1 discrete and global dynamic resilience arising from dynamic environmental stressors the data cleaning and clustering methods extracted a robust soc from long term operational flow data 2015 to 2021 and was used to drive the slave models for ps as and secondary sedimentation the extreme high and low flow dynamic environmental stressor events were selected using prominence as the scaled magnitude of variation from the soc the normality of event data was checked using the anderson darling test and verified kruskal wallace to demonstrate statistically significant differences from the soc the soc timeseries were used to drive the slave model and the master model dynamic environmental stressor data although the methodology demonstrated the potential for event identification in continuous measurement systems some challenges were encountered one of the main limitations is parameter scaling when transforming actual data obtained during high flow stressors mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic populations had a limited concentration range therefore additional scaling is required to determine the influence of sludge age and process related boundary conditions the sow generated by ddra and gdra visualised the as response to dynamic environmental stressors for ps as and secondary sedimentation the sow populated zones of resilience and process stress of varying magnitudes with the low flow dynamic environmental stressor sow displaying mostly resilience to neutral process stress in both sedimentation processes pf 0 1 this was related to simulation outputs occurring below the soc when bod5 and tss concentrations are based on the dilution rates however both sedimentation processes exhibited the most concentrated process stress during the high flow dynamic environmental stressor these concentrated process stresses were particularly evident in the ps with a pf of 0 46 from the influence of storm flows as a process protection mechanism storm flow diversion limited influent flow to 390 l s 1 creating a disproportionate data range although the transfer of storm flows can be a dynamic environmental stressor untreated river discharge when storm tanks have reduced capacity reflecting on abily et al 2021 and the influence of wrrf on swbs future dynamic resilience studies should also consider storm flow storage however knowledge generation requires the classification of historical events and evaluation of the numerous eventualities and magnitudes as an extension the significance of cso discharge to watercourses as an alternative to adaption pathways presented by sadr et al 2020 where water companies now face possible prosecutions for pollution incidents resulting from cso discharges ofwat 2021 the as process presented a particular challenge during dynamic environmental stressor events with process stresses and resilience originating from numerous independent variables within the data driven models although previous studies have investigated asm kinetic parameter sensitivities theoretical changes do not reflect actual operational conditions for water companies learning from unit processes and wrrf data has great value where the source of operational changes is often unknown due to inadequate transactional record keeping previously identified by holloway et al 2019 despite data range visualising neutral and concentrated zones of process stress could develop a consensus for optimum wrrf operation while generating knowledge of dynamic stressor events time based changes such as temperature and nutrient carbon availability are crucial considerations when applying timely mitigations and interventions where dynamic environmental stressors disrupt bacterial growth and decay rates ramin et al 2014 a drawback of the dynamic resilience approach is that wrrf operational data can be infrequent or limited to the requirements of environmental permits newhart et al 2019 therefore the challenge for ddra and gdra is data richness quality quantity and range an example of this was soc misclassification that occurred for turbidity in gdra due to significant data variation reduced data ranges instrument reliability issues and calibration errors interestingly the sow for tn in gdra showed the greatest propensity for process stress of all gdra potentially resulting from autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial populations in the anoxic and oxic zones nitrification denitrification therefore accurate time based tn measurement is essential if n removal is a crucial treatment objective also fractionations of heterotrophs and autotrophs in the ddra sow and any correlations must be considered for model dimension reduction therefore from an applied standpoint and for gdra to be accurate the emphasis should be on improved instrument and data management to generate accurate insights to make informed decisions based on the dynamic resilience of wrrf 5 2 significance of discrete and global dynamic resilience methods this paper proposed a data driven modelling methodology extending research presented by juan garcía et al 2021 to demonstrate the dynamic resilience of wrrf in response to dynamic external environmental stressors the methodology has established a protocol for identifying and characterising dynamic soc classifying dynamic environmental stressor events then simulating and visualising process stresses or resilience however further research is required to ensure that scaling for as processes particularly in response to dynamic high flow stressors better reflects process related effects nevertheless these ddra and gdra methods could be applied alongside benchmark simulations alex et al 2018 where actual wrrf instrument data can be used to visualise the dynamics of resilience moreover it may avoid the computational demand associated with simulating numerous operational scenarios additionally a knowledge base of psi event cases similar to cbr could generate new knowledge of unknown known and known unknown events sweetapple et al 2018 however further research is required to classify the start and end of events from actual data where this research used 48 h events centred at the most significant peak magnitude a possible classification technique could involve characterising dynamic stressors from normalised parameter sensitivities demir and atçı 2021 these methods could group multivariate divergences to classify the type of dynamic stressor and then predict the resultant process stress or resilience previously research on resilience sweetapple et al 2017 has relied on the iwa operational cost and effluent quality indices to measure resilience generating possible solutions to theoretical scenarios ebrahimi et al 2017 however as regulatory requirements increase and data from instruments becomes more reliable it may be possible to extend si and psi indexes to consider actual events extracted from wrrf instrument data to evaluate the real time impact of dynamic resilience the dynamic philosophy of resilience is becoming increasingly relevant to water companies resilience task and finish group 2015 who struggle to manage process performance due to the growing severity of dynamic environmental stressors and water infrastructure deterioration overall this research has made the first step in extracting soc from actual wrrf operating beyond their original process design parameters it has also demonstrated the possibility of analysing the dynamic magnitude of process stress and resilience under the precept of dynamic resilience in turn this has generated an indexing system si and psi from actual wrrf instrument data to generate sow visualisations that communicate the dynamics of resilience 6 conclusions from the simulation of ddra and gdra completed for high and low flow dynamic environmental stressors the following conclusions and future implications can be drawn i the extraction classification and verification methodologies were sufficient to 1 generate a robust soc from long term flow data 2015 to 2021 and 2 verify statistically significant differences between dynamic environmental stressor events and the soc ii sow accuracy was dependant on three factors 1 whether the data range is sufficient to characterise the event and soc 2 the extent of data cleaning required and 3 the suitability of data for clustering methods iii limitations were encountered for as processes under high flow dynamic stressors where further scaling is required to ensure the psi scale is representative of threats to process performance iv it was possible to identify potential optimised operating conditions from the ddra in the as process with the neutral process stresses corresponding with sow for mlss heterotrophic and autotrophic v tn was most sensitive to dynamic environmental stressor events possibly related to nitrification autotrophs and heterotrophic denitrification therefore interventions should consider the numerous bacterial growth rates affecting many functional groups vi tn was most sensitive to dynamic environmental stressor events possibly

15721,the rigid cell membrane structure is widely thought to retain the intracellular water and positively contributes to the presence of bound water in waste activated sludge was which is the main obstacle of its highly efficient dewatering however few studies realized the quantification of intracellular water fraction in the total bound water thus there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of cell lysis is optimal for the dewaterability improvement this study specifically focused on the effect of microbial cell lysis on the water occurrence states of was the sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso amendment were used as the non chemical means for cell lysis without altering the chemical compositions of was the extent of cell lysis was quantified by the aqueous lactate dehydrogenase ldh released from intracellular cytoplasm and the water occurrence states of was were characterized by the transverse relaxation time t2 spectra of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the results indicated that 8 h sonication 60 w g dry matter solid content of was 23 10 0 30 g l completely lysed the microbial cells but only increased the moderately mobile water fraction from 0 555 to 2 370 similarly it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the fraction of moderately mobile water only rose from 0 555 to 0 805 the transmission electron microscope tem with ultrathin sections visually tracked the was micro morphology accompanied with the cell lysis the sonication caused the notable lysis of microbial cells and dispersed the external encapsulating components which originally surrounded microbial cells closely most of the microbial cells could be deformed but wasn t lysed by cyclic freezing thawing dmso amendment made the outer edge of microbial cells tend to be rough which may reflect the dmso enhanced permeability of cell membrane the correlative analysis further indicated that the capillary suction time cst had the close correlation with particle size zeta potential pearson coefficient 0 85 p value 0 05 but no strong correlation was identified between cst and slightly reduced bound water contents pearson coefficient 0 9 p value 0 05 instead of the cell integrity the compositional aggregation states dominated the water occurrence states of was highly efficient conditioning approaches should rely on the reduction of bio floc porosity through eliminating solid liquid interfacial affinity instead of damaging the cell membrane structure graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering cell lysis water organics affinity 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment processes it contains various pathogens hazardous metals and persistent organic pollutants thus may cause serious pollution risks if without appropriate disposal wu et al 2020 dewatering plays a crucial role in the highly efficient treatment of was and even facilitates the carbon emission reduction during energy utilization of was cao and pawłowski 2013 however was is mainly composed of microbial cells and some high molecule weight extracellular polymeric substances eps distributing outside of cells liu and fang 2003 the highly hydrated colloidal feature makes was difficult to be directly dewatered without pretreatments christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 many efforts have been devoted to explore the determinant factors on the sludge dewaterability the particle size distribution mowla et al 2013 surface charge christensen et al 2015 macro physical properties e g viscosity and eps park and novak 2007 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 all pose significant effects on the water occurrence states and colloidal stability of bio flocs specially the existing sludge conditioning approaches such as sonication cai et al 2018 khanal et al 2007 microwave treatment wojciechowska 2005 hydrothermal treatment yu et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops he et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 were all reported to be effective in disrupting rigid cell membranes and releasing intracellular water therefore there are still widely held views that the rigid cell membrane structure retains the intracellular water and positively contributes to the presence of bound water cao et al 2021 wu et al 2020 some previous studies even used the cell lysis to reflect the effectiveness of sludge dewaterability improvement hu et al 2021 however the percentage of intracellular water in the total amount of bound water is still lack of the quantitative analysis on the other hand the existing sludge conditioning approaches e g aops affect the multiple properties of was including the surface properties of solid compositions and the chemical composition of eps xiao et al 2017 thus it is hard to judge whether the existing conditioning approaches improve the sludge dewaterability through cell lysis or changing other physiochemical properties further studies specifically focusing on how the lysis of microbial cells or the release of intracellular water influences the dewaterability and water occurrence states of was are still demanded this study specifically investigated the effect of cell lysis on water occurrence states of was sonication is a typical non chemical method to rupture the microbial cell wall through the cyclic sound compression expansion with a frequency greater than 20 khz khanal et al 2007 the growth of ice crystals during sludge freezing process was also thought to non chemically induce cell lysis through the crystallization and expansion of intracellular bound water gao 2011 besides an important polar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is known to enhance the cell membrane permeability by disordering the arrangement of phospholipid molecules notman et al 2006 the above three approaches all can be used as the potential methods for cell lysis without influencing the chemical compositions of was therefore this study applied the sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dmso amendment to induce the cell lysis of was the extent of cell lysis was characterized by the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh and the ratio of live dead cells with fluorescence staining of nucleic acids the water occurrence states of was were quantitatively analyzed through the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution measured by low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr accordingly the extent of cell lysis and the water occurrence states were correlatively analyzed also the potential relationships among macro physical properties of bio flocs and extent of cell lysis were explored all the above results were believed to quantitively reveal the significance of cell lysis in sludge dewaterability improvement and serve as the direction basis for developing highly efficient sludge conditioning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples the triplicate sludge samples were taken from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant using the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process shanghai china at the sampling interval of 24 h ph 6 85 0 05 water content 97 69 0 03 wt 23 10 0 30 g l total solid and volatile solid 14 43 0 10 g l of the as collected sludge were determined following american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage american public health association 2009 all the sludge samples were stored at 4 c before the analytical experiments which would be finished within 5 d in order to minimize any possible change of physiochemical properties wu et al 2017 2 2 typical procedures for cell lysis of was sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dmso addition were used as the methods for cell lysis of was sonication of was was conducted using a high amplitude power ultrasounic liquid processor qsonica connecticut usa at the frequency of 20 khz and power input of 20 60 w g dry solid ds the ice bath 0 c was used to prevent the potential heat effect of sonication on denaturation of proteins thus the sonication induced cell lysis could be a completely physical process without affecting the chemical compositions of was the cyclic freezing thawing was conducted with freezing at 20 c for 30 min and subsequently thawing at room temperature 25 c until sludge temperature returned to the room temperature for the dmso induced cell permeability increase dmso was added into was at the pre determined dosage following the mechanical agitation at 200 rpm for 30 min 8 h sonication 60 w g ds of was in the ice bath 0 c was also conducted and the corresponding released ldh content was compared with the total ldh content in was the consistency of these two values would mean that 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be a method to fully realize the lysis of all microbes in bio flocs as a result the sludge sample with 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be regarded as the control sample with the complete lysis of cells the comparative analysis on the water occurrence states of this control sample and other samples with different cell lysis pretreatments could estimate how the different extent of cell lysis contribute to the variation of water occurrence states 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 ldh measurement ldh is a cytoplasmic enzyme which has 332 amino acid residues and the molecular weight of 144000 da eventoff et al 1977 as a macromolecule the transmembrane movement of ldh is impossible by microbial active transport the only way for ldh to release from intracellular cytoplasm to extracellular region is probably the destruction of cell membranes wagner et al 1992 therefore the level of extracellular ldh in aqueous phase can reflect the permeability of microbial cells in this study the aqueous ldh and total ldh of was were both measured by in vitro toxicology assay kit tox7 sigma missouri usa following the manufacturer s instructions the l lactic dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle sigma missouri usa was used as the ldh standard generally the released ldh in aqueous phase was measured in the supernatant directly obtained by centrifugation for the total ldh in was the 5 fold diluted raw sludge was first incubated by 1 10 volume of ldh assay lysis solution tox7 sigma missouri usa for 45 min and then the ldh in aqueous phase could be the total ldh released from solid phase the ratio of aqueous ldh and total ldh in was was used to estimate the extent of cell lysis 2 3 2 identifying live dead cells by fluorescence microscope in order to further identify the micro spatial distribution of live cells with integrated membranes and dead cells with damaged membranes a quantitative imaging method based on fluorescence staining was applied in this study the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits sigma missouri usa utilized the mixtures of syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain and red fluorescent nucleic acid stain propidium iodide the syto 9 stain generally labels all bacteria in a population those with intact membranes and those with damaged membranes in contrast propidium iodide penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes hu et al 2021 thus bacteria with damaged membranes can stain fluorescent red whereas bacteria with intact cell membranes stain fluorescent green the background remained virtually nonfluorescent the staining procedures were as following 1 the equal volumes of syto 9 stain 3 34 mmol l and propidium iodide 20 mmol l were mixed thoroughly 2 3 μl of the above dye mixture was added into each ml of sludge samples 3 the sample was mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min 4 5 μl of the stained sludge sample was trapped between a slide and an 18 mm square coverslip and imaged by fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon japan with the excitation emission wavelength of 480 500 nm for syto 9 stain and 490 635 nm for propidium iodide 2 3 3 visualization of cell lysis by ultrathin section with transmission electron microscope tem the micro morphology of sludge samples with different cell lysis pretreatments was analyzed by ultrathin section with tem first the sludge samples were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs for 1 2 times then the pre cooled 4 c 0 1 mol l phosphate buffering solution ph 7 containing 2 5 wt glutaraldehyde was added to the pbs washed sludge pellets to fix the microbial cells subsequently the pellets were washed by 0 1 mol l phosphate buffering solution ph 7 for 3 times and fixed by 1 wt osmic acid for another 2 h next the sludge samples were washed by another 3 times using 0 1 m phosphate buffering solution ph 7 and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions with ethanol mass concentrations of 30 50 60 70 80 90 and 95 successively finally the dehydrated samples were mixed with the resin embedding agent at the volume ratio of 1 1 and then polymerized in moulds at 70 c for 12 h ultrathin sections were cut with an ultramicrotome leica em uc7 germany using a diamond knife to obtain 70 90 nm slice the thin sections were stained with 50 ethanol saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate to enhance the electron contrast of biological material and examined with tem hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 80 kv 2 3 4 water state analysis by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr the water occurrence states of sludge were analyzed by low filed nmr as described in the section 2 2 in order to prepare a control sample with the complete lysis of all the microbial cells the sonication of sludge in ice bath 0 c was performed until the concentration of extracellular aqueous ldh didn t increase 8 h accordingly this control sample and the sludge samples treated by different cell lysis means in section 2 2 were centrifuged at 20000 g for 15 min to remove the supernatant so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the effect of cell lysis on bound water could be prominent the centrifugation obtained samples were separately subjected to the measurement of transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing was modified based on our previous study to realize the optimal signal intensity wu et al 2019 the area under each peak of t2 spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of water molecule protons with different mobility the t2 spectra of the sludge samples treated by sonication freezing thawing dmso and the control sample were comparatively analyzed thus the proportion of cell lysis and the corresponding water state transformation caused by different pretreatment means could be determined 2 3 5 other analytical methods the dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was used to measure the particle size distribution of was pre and post cell lysis the zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential meter zeta sizer nano z malvern uk the fractal dimension was analyzed based on the microscopic imaging methods described in the previous literature li et al 2020 the dewaterability of was was evaluated in term of capillary suction time cst according to the standard method american public health association 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of physical pretreatments on cell lysis 3 1 1 extracellular ldh quantification the extent of cell lysis was characterized via aqueous contents of ldh which should be originally present in the cell cytoplasm with the intact cell membrane yu et al 2019 with the increasing ultrasound power from 20 w to 60 w the aqueous ldh concentration of sludge could reach 0 60 0 02 mg l by 2 min sonication fig 1 a confirming the feasibility of sonication in destructing the cell membranes thus releasing the intracellular substances including ldh however the sonication deteriorated the sludge dewaterability fig s1 of supplementary materials this finding was inconsistent with the conventional cognition obtained from the previous studies which commonly reported the positive effects of cell lysis on sludge dewaterability the possible reason could be that the sonication loosened the spatial distribution of bio flocs and created more pore structure to retain interstitial water wu et al 2021a which was reflected by the visualization results in fig 3 and in accordance with the previously reported deterioration of sludge dewaterability accompanied with increasing loosely bound eps li and yang 2007 on the other hand although the sonication could promote the solubilization of eps into aqueous phase there are still some debates on the most appropriate contents of eps for the optimal sludge dewaterability wu et al 2020 for example the excessive removal of tightly bound eps would weaken the coagulation of bio flocs and accordingly pose adverse effects on sludge dewatering unexpectedly the cell lysis was not the prominent feature of freezing thawing operation since only four or five cycles of freezing thawing could effectively release ldh fig 1b but cst substantially dropped from 69 9 2 8 s to 18 1 1 7 s with only one time of freezing thawing operation fig s1 this may indicate that the cell lysis was not closely related to the sludge dewaterability improvement the recent study also found that the freezing treatment could enhance the stretching and vibration of hydrophilic functional groups in eps which made these groups vulnerable to be damaged under low temperature conditions peng et al 2021 besides the hydration layer of organic macromolecules e g extracellular proteins began to freeze below ice point as a result during the water crystallization process the hydrophilic groups of intramolecular chain could interact with each other instead of external water molecules which would alter the conformation of secondary structure units e g α helix and β sheet of extracellular proteins tompa et al 2009 therefore the freezing treatment could improve the sludge dewaterability through increasing eps hydrophobicity dmso had the limited effectiveness in cell lysis which was reflected by the much lower concentrations of aqueous ldh 0 12 mg l than those of sonication treated sludge samples fig 1c it was reported that the dmso molecules tend to reside just below the headgroups of the lipid molecules and push the lipid heads apart so that two of the lipid molecules sit on the opposite sides of the bilayer to get deeper into the bilayer notman et al 2006 as a consequence water molecules enter the bilayer and gradually formed a continuous chain of water however the formation of water pore may only enhance the ion permeability and could not facilitate the transmembrane transport of macromolecule e g ldh notman et al 2006 in another word the addition of dmso could not completely destruct the cell membranes this finding was further verified by the analysis of water occurrence states and dewaterability in the following sections as shown in fig 1d the continuous sonication at the power of 60 w g ds didn t raise the aqueous concentration of ldh continuously the maximum ldh release 1 65 0 01 mg l was achieved by 60 w g ds sonication for 1 h and the prolonged sonication time would not further release the intracellular ldh of which the concentration kept almost constant within the next 7 h additionally the total ldh content of was with ts of 2 31 was measured to be 1 60 0 07 mg l which was nearly same as that of sludge with 8 h sonication 60 w g ds therefore it was inferred that the sample treated by 8 h sonication at 60 w g ds could be regarded as the reference with the complete lysis of all the microbial cells the aqueous ldh concentration ratio of any sample and the control sample 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be used as the index to quantify the extent of cell lysis therefore through the data comparison in fig 1a and d it could be inferred that nearly 37 of cells 0 60 0 02 mg ldh l versus 1 60 0 07 mg ldh l were lysed by 2 min sonication 60 w g ds accordingly the 5 times of cyclic freezing thawing and 0 2 g dmso g ds could only realize 15 6 and 7 5 of cells lysed in was respectively fig 1b c and d 3 1 2 visualization of cell lysis the extent of cell integrity was also quantitatively characterized by fluorescent staining in which green fluorescence represented live cells with the integrated membranes and red fluorescence marked dead cells with damaged membranes as the fluorescence intensity data shown in fig 2 the intensity ratio of green red fluorescence constantly decreased with the increasing power input of sonication which indicated that the sonication could effectively damage the integrity of microbial cells also the sonication dispersed the aggregation states of sludge flocs fig s2a and s2b of supplementary materials for the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing only four or five cycles of freezing thawing operations could significantly reduce the density of live cells which was in accordance with the increasing trend of aqueous ldh contents dmso was used to increase the permeability of cell membrane but it should have limited effects on the transmembrane transport of propidium iodide notman et al 2006 as shown in fig 2c only when the dosage of dmso was increased over 0 2 g gds the obvious decrease of g r was observed which was in accordance with the rise of aqueous ldh at 0 2 g dmso gds this accordance reflected that only the sufficiently increased permeability of cell membrane with a high dosage of dmso could lead to the release of nucleic acids and the low addition of dmso 0 01 0 1 g gds could not effectively facilitate the transmembrane transport of propidium iodide or nucleic acids the micro morphology of sludge samples with different cell lysis pretreatments were characterized by ultrathin section with tem the cell aggregates and typical zoogloea structure could be recognized in the ultrathin sections of raw sludge figs 3 a 1 also the rod shaped bacterial cells were entrapped by dense materials inside the sludge matrix figs 3a 2 the sonication 60 w g ds for 2 min dispersed the external encapsulating components which originally surrounded microbial cells closely figs 3b 1 on the other hand the sonication caused notable lysis of microbial cells the damaged membrane structure was identified in fig 3b 2 the dispersed distribution of microbial cells featured the representative micro morphology of sludge sample treated by five times of cyclic freezing thawing treatment fig 3c no obvious cell lysis could be found and the large voids filled with extracellular polymers were considerably reduced and many bacteria were deformed figs 3c 2 thus indicating significant plastic deformation and migration of extracellular materials have taken place in the sludge flocs deneux mustin et al 2001 for the dmso treated sludge fig 3d there was no significant change in the cell aggregation states of microbial colonies but the outer edge of microbial cells tended to be rough which may reflect the dmso increased permeability of cell membrane and the material exchange between extracellular and intracellular regions the round dots may represent the liquid drops of insoluble dmso in the microbial cells 3 2 evolution of water occurrence state with cell lysis the evolution of water occurrence state in was with cell lysis was characterized by the transverse relaxation time t2 spectra so that how the cell lysis contributed to the evolution of water occurrence states could be unraveled due to the different affinities with the surrounding environment t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr rudi et al 2008 in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 one dominant peak and two minor peaks featured the t2 spectra in this study suggesting the existence of three major states of protons in sludge the most left peak t21 should correspond to the protons at solid state gussoni et al 2007 wu et al 2019 t22 and t23 should correspond to the bound water and the moderately mobile water respectively gussoni et al 2007 vesilind 1994 wu et al 2019 the quantification of water states with different mobility was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 spectra gummerson et al 1979 according to the data in table s1 of supplementary materials sonication continuously decreased the a21 fraction with the increasing power input and correspondingly increased the a23 fraction the information may reflect that the sonication promoted the solubilization of some solid compositions into aqueous phase also compared with the raw sludge the bound water fraction slightly decreased with the sonication for 2 min at power of 60 w g ds which also contributes to the increase in free water fraction a23 however the cell lysis ratio with the same sonication condition was nearly 50 according to the aqueous ldh content result in section 3 1 1 in another word the lysis of microbial cells limitedly contributed to the water occurrence state evolution of was on the other hand the sonication operation loosened the bio flocs of was and therefore enhance the solid water interactions which was characterized by the left shift of t2 peaks with the increasing power input of sonication fig 4a the cyclic operation of freezing thawing also left shifted the t2 peaks which was in accordance with the reduced hydrophobicity of eps under low temperature below 0 c peng et al 2021 based on the aqueous concentration of ldh section 3 1 1 it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the moderately mobile water only slightly increased from 0 555 to 0 805 with the cycle number of freezing thawing increasing from 0 to 5 fig 4b and table s1 this phenomenon also indicated the limited effectiveness of cell lysis in water occurrence state transformation dmso had few effects on the water occurrence states only 0 5 g dmso g ds slightly reduced the bound water by nearly 3 and increased the moderately mobile water fraction from 0 6 to 2 633 fig 4c and table s1 since the sample with 8 h sonication could be regarded as the sample with the complete cell lysis the corresponding water occurrence states could be the results obtained by complete cell lysis however compared with raw sludge there was no significant decrease in a22 of the sample with 8 h sonication fig 4d and table s1 again this result may direct to the ineffectiveness of cell lysis in bound water reduction of was 3 3 evolution of aggregation states of bio flocs with cell lysis the physical properties of was including particle size distribution surface charge properties and micro pore structure were reported to closely correlate with the water occurrence states of bio flocs therefore in order to explain the transformation of water occurrence states accompanied with the cell lysis the corresponding variation of these three physiochemical properties was systematically analyzed as follows 3 3 1 median particle size the median particle size d50 tended to be smaller with the increasing sonication power input especially from 50 to 60 w g ds fig 5 a the cyclic freezing thawing slightly increased d50 from 50 9 µm to 55 6 µm fig 5b which corresponded to the reduction in the absolute value of zeta potential fig 6 b the cyclic freezing thawing process reduced the repulsive force among solid particles and promoted the aggregation carrasco and gao 2019 dmso released intracellular substances through modifying the permeability of cell membranes but didn t induce the lysis of cells and almost had no effects on the aggregation states of solid compositions therefore the addition of dmso had no effects on the particle size of sludge samples as anticipated fig 5c also the particle size distribution may simultaneously influence the surface area and the porosity among microbial colloidal particles which was further characterized by fractal dimension in the following section 3 3 2 zeta potential zeta potential should be determined by the surface compositions of solid particles and ionic strength of aqueous phase in this study the physical treatment would not directly change the ionic strength of aqueous phase therefore the variations of surface charge could be influenced by the release of intracellular substances as shown in fig 6a the sonication treatment slightly reduced the electronegativity of sludge flocs compared with the raw sludge the zeta potentials of sludge particles increased from 15 5 mv to higher than 14 2 mv but fluctuated with the increasing zeta potential the freezing thawing treatment also increased zeta potential from 15 5 mv to 12 0 mv with the cycle number increasing from 0 to 5 fig 6b as plenty of charges in the floc interior are inaccessible the aggregation of flocs caused by freezing thawing treatment could decrease the exposure of solid surface and then lead to a reduction in the measured negative charges mikkelsen 2003 the similar variation trend of zeta potential was also observed with dmso added dmso could decrease the osmotic pressure difference inside and outside cell membranes through increasing the cell membrane permeability for ion transport notman et al 2007 notman et al 2006 therefore the release of ion from intracellular media may increase the ionic strength of cell surrounding environments and reduce the surface charge of solid compositions by charge neutralization sheng et al 2013 3 3 3 fractal dimension fractal dimension df reflects the micro morphology properties of an aggregate about space filling capacity surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form zhang et al 2018 with the increasing power input of sonication df constantly increased fig 7 a generally a higher fractal dimension means a lower space filling degree li et al 2020 moussas and zouboulis 2009 therefore the higher the fractal dimension the looser and smaller the bio flocs of sludge were which indicated that the sonication loosened the micro spatial distribution of sludge flocs and corresponded to the decreasing trend of particle size fig 5a the dmso led release of intracellular substances also increased df fig 7c additionally the higher fractal dimension may stand for the greater porosity of bio flocs which should provide the more space for the sterically hindered bound water e g interstitial water cheng et al 2018 wu et al 2019 but the water freezing led to the formation of homogeneous crystals which excluded the fine sludge particles and facilitated the agglomeration of solid compositions peng et al 2010 wu et al 2018 therefore the porosity could be reduced and df slightly decreased as shown in fig 7b how these variations in physiochemical properties accompanied with cell lysis affected the water occurrence states is further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 novel insights into correlations among cell lysis water occurrence states physical properties of colloidal particles and sludge dewaterability in this section the cell lysis water occurrence states and physical properties of colloidal particles were correlatively analyzed to identify the key influencing factors on sludge dewaterability according to table s2 s4 of supplementary materials the aqueous ldh concentration closely correlated with the g r ratio of fluorescent staining pearson correlation 0 95 p value 0 01 which indicated the consistency of these two methods for characterizing the cell lysis extent for the sonication treated sludge the aqueous ldh positively correlated with cst pearson coefficient 0 94 p value 0 02 but negatively correlated with the t21 and t23 peak positions pearson coefficient 0 90 p value 0 04 table s2 these results indicated that the sonication led cell lysis had the very limited efficiency in the bound water reduction instead the release of intracellular substances may enhance the binding strength of bio flocs to water cst also had the negative correlation with the median particle size pearson coefficient 0 93 p value 0 02 which indicated that the decreasing particle size was adverse for the sludge dewaterability in another word instead of the sonication induced cell lysis the sonication caused dispersion of sludge flocs dominated the deterioration of sludge dewaterability the expectative significant correlations between cell lysis extent and bound water reduction were not observed for the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing and dmso either on the contrary cst negatively correlated with zeta potential pearson coefficient 0 88 p value 0 05 for the sludge treated by cyclic freezing thawing treatment also the fraction of solid state protons a21 negatively correlated with the bound water fraction a22 in the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing table s3 these findings on the zeta potential and solid state protons may indicate that the interfacial properties played more important roles in sludge dewaterability improvement than cell lysis the release of intracellular water was not the key point for the bound water reduction besides the cell lysis extent characterized by aqueous ldh and median particle size were both closely related to the fractal dimension with pearson coefficients of 0 88 and p value 0 05 which reflected that the water crystallization excluded the solids from water and promoted the aggregation of sludge particles the increasing particle size reduced the porosity of bio flocs furthermore pearson coefficient of 0 99 with p value 0 01 verified that the reduction of bound water in dmso treated sludge positively contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water table s4 which was in accordance with the previous studies wu et al 2019 for the sonication treated sludge it is also worth to be noted that the t21 peak position significantly correlated with t22 and t23 peak positions which were determined with pearson coefficient 0 88 and p value 0 05 and indicated that the aggregation state of solid compositions significantly affected the strength of solid water interactions lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 to sum up the aggregation states of bio flocs dominated the bound water fractions of was the difficulty in sludge dewatering should be due to the water affinity of organics instead of steric hindrance caused by cell membrane therefore the future study on sludge dewaterability improvement shouldn t target the destruction of cell membranes instead more attention can be paid to the development of novel conditioning approaches that can weaken the water affinity of organics in was this insight also corresponded to our previous studies that modifying the molecular conformation of amphiphilic extracellular proteins could be a potential way for eliminating water holding capacities of bio flocs in was wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b 4 conclusions this study specifically focused on the effect of microbial cell lysis on the water occurrence states of was the extent of cell lysis was characterized by the aqueous ldh released from intracellular cytoplasm and the sludge micro morphology with cell lysis was visualized by tem with ultrathin sections it was found that the sonication could lysed 50 of cells with the power input of 60 w g ds for 2 min unexpectedly the cyclic freezing thawing and dmso had the limited effectiveness in the destruction of cell membrane structure also 8 h sonication 60 w g ds completely lysed the microbial cells in term of ldh release but only increased the moderately mobile water from 0 555 to 2 370 regardless of the positive effect of cell lysis on intracellular water reduction the sonication dispersed the micro spatial distribution of bio flocs solid state proton decreasing from 3 313 to 0 020 and accordingly increased df from 1 20 to 1 23 which enhanced the binding strength of bio flocs to water dmso released intracellular substances through modifying the permeability of cell membranes but didn t induce the lysis of cells and almost had no effects on the aggregation states of solid compositions similarly it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the moderately mobile water only rose from 0 555 to 0 805 on the contrary the cyclic freezing thawing process reduced the repulsive force among solid particles and promoted the aggregation which significantly contributed to the sludge dewaterability improvement in term of cst in sum instead of the cell integrity the aggregation states of bio flocs dominated the water occurrence states of was therefore the over focused significance of cell lysis in sludge dewaterability improvement could be confirmed by the results of this study and the effectiveness of conditioning operations should not be evaluated by the extent of cell lysis the future study on sludge dewaterability improvement shouldn t target the destruction of

15721,the rigid cell membrane structure is widely thought to retain the intracellular water and positively contributes to the presence of bound water in waste activated sludge was which is the main obstacle of its highly efficient dewatering however few studies realized the quantification of intracellular water fraction in the total bound water thus there still may be some debates on whether and what extent of cell lysis is optimal for the dewaterability improvement this study specifically focused on the effect of microbial cell lysis on the water occurrence states of was the sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso amendment were used as the non chemical means for cell lysis without altering the chemical compositions of was the extent of cell lysis was quantified by the aqueous lactate dehydrogenase ldh released from intracellular cytoplasm and the water occurrence states of was were characterized by the transverse relaxation time t2 spectra of low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr the results indicated that 8 h sonication 60 w g dry matter solid content of was 23 10 0 30 g l completely lysed the microbial cells but only increased the moderately mobile water fraction from 0 555 to 2 370 similarly it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the fraction of moderately mobile water only rose from 0 555 to 0 805 the transmission electron microscope tem with ultrathin sections visually tracked the was micro morphology accompanied with the cell lysis the sonication caused the notable lysis of microbial cells and dispersed the external encapsulating components which originally surrounded microbial cells closely most of the microbial cells could be deformed but wasn t lysed by cyclic freezing thawing dmso amendment made the outer edge of microbial cells tend to be rough which may reflect the dmso enhanced permeability of cell membrane the correlative analysis further indicated that the capillary suction time cst had the close correlation with particle size zeta potential pearson coefficient 0 85 p value 0 05 but no strong correlation was identified between cst and slightly reduced bound water contents pearson coefficient 0 9 p value 0 05 instead of the cell integrity the compositional aggregation states dominated the water occurrence states of was highly efficient conditioning approaches should rely on the reduction of bio floc porosity through eliminating solid liquid interfacial affinity instead of damaging the cell membrane structure graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords waste activated sludge bound water dewatering cell lysis water organics affinity 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is the inevitable by product of biological wastewater treatment processes it contains various pathogens hazardous metals and persistent organic pollutants thus may cause serious pollution risks if without appropriate disposal wu et al 2020 dewatering plays a crucial role in the highly efficient treatment of was and even facilitates the carbon emission reduction during energy utilization of was cao and pawłowski 2013 however was is mainly composed of microbial cells and some high molecule weight extracellular polymeric substances eps distributing outside of cells liu and fang 2003 the highly hydrated colloidal feature makes was difficult to be directly dewatered without pretreatments christensen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 many efforts have been devoted to explore the determinant factors on the sludge dewaterability the particle size distribution mowla et al 2013 surface charge christensen et al 2015 macro physical properties e g viscosity and eps park and novak 2007 xiao et al 2018 xu et al 2018 all pose significant effects on the water occurrence states and colloidal stability of bio flocs specially the existing sludge conditioning approaches such as sonication cai et al 2018 khanal et al 2007 microwave treatment wojciechowska 2005 hydrothermal treatment yu et al 2014 and advanced oxidation processes aops he et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 were all reported to be effective in disrupting rigid cell membranes and releasing intracellular water therefore there are still widely held views that the rigid cell membrane structure retains the intracellular water and positively contributes to the presence of bound water cao et al 2021 wu et al 2020 some previous studies even used the cell lysis to reflect the effectiveness of sludge dewaterability improvement hu et al 2021 however the percentage of intracellular water in the total amount of bound water is still lack of the quantitative analysis on the other hand the existing sludge conditioning approaches e g aops affect the multiple properties of was including the surface properties of solid compositions and the chemical composition of eps xiao et al 2017 thus it is hard to judge whether the existing conditioning approaches improve the sludge dewaterability through cell lysis or changing other physiochemical properties further studies specifically focusing on how the lysis of microbial cells or the release of intracellular water influences the dewaterability and water occurrence states of was are still demanded this study specifically investigated the effect of cell lysis on water occurrence states of was sonication is a typical non chemical method to rupture the microbial cell wall through the cyclic sound compression expansion with a frequency greater than 20 khz khanal et al 2007 the growth of ice crystals during sludge freezing process was also thought to non chemically induce cell lysis through the crystallization and expansion of intracellular bound water gao 2011 besides an important polar aprotic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide dmso is known to enhance the cell membrane permeability by disordering the arrangement of phospholipid molecules notman et al 2006 the above three approaches all can be used as the potential methods for cell lysis without influencing the chemical compositions of was therefore this study applied the sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dmso amendment to induce the cell lysis of was the extent of cell lysis was characterized by the amount of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase ldh and the ratio of live dead cells with fluorescence staining of nucleic acids the water occurrence states of was were quantitatively analyzed through the transverse spin spin relaxation time t2 distribution measured by low field nuclear magnetic resonance nmr accordingly the extent of cell lysis and the water occurrence states were correlatively analyzed also the potential relationships among macro physical properties of bio flocs and extent of cell lysis were explored all the above results were believed to quantitively reveal the significance of cell lysis in sludge dewaterability improvement and serve as the direction basis for developing highly efficient sludge conditioning approaches 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples the triplicate sludge samples were taken from the thickener of a typical municipal wastewater treatment plant using the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process shanghai china at the sampling interval of 24 h ph 6 85 0 05 water content 97 69 0 03 wt 23 10 0 30 g l total solid and volatile solid 14 43 0 10 g l of the as collected sludge were determined following american water works association standard methods for the examination of water and sewage american public health association 2009 all the sludge samples were stored at 4 c before the analytical experiments which would be finished within 5 d in order to minimize any possible change of physiochemical properties wu et al 2017 2 2 typical procedures for cell lysis of was sonication cyclic freezing thawing and dmso addition were used as the methods for cell lysis of was sonication of was was conducted using a high amplitude power ultrasounic liquid processor qsonica connecticut usa at the frequency of 20 khz and power input of 20 60 w g dry solid ds the ice bath 0 c was used to prevent the potential heat effect of sonication on denaturation of proteins thus the sonication induced cell lysis could be a completely physical process without affecting the chemical compositions of was the cyclic freezing thawing was conducted with freezing at 20 c for 30 min and subsequently thawing at room temperature 25 c until sludge temperature returned to the room temperature for the dmso induced cell permeability increase dmso was added into was at the pre determined dosage following the mechanical agitation at 200 rpm for 30 min 8 h sonication 60 w g ds of was in the ice bath 0 c was also conducted and the corresponding released ldh content was compared with the total ldh content in was the consistency of these two values would mean that 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be a method to fully realize the lysis of all microbes in bio flocs as a result the sludge sample with 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be regarded as the control sample with the complete lysis of cells the comparative analysis on the water occurrence states of this control sample and other samples with different cell lysis pretreatments could estimate how the different extent of cell lysis contribute to the variation of water occurrence states 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 ldh measurement ldh is a cytoplasmic enzyme which has 332 amino acid residues and the molecular weight of 144000 da eventoff et al 1977 as a macromolecule the transmembrane movement of ldh is impossible by microbial active transport the only way for ldh to release from intracellular cytoplasm to extracellular region is probably the destruction of cell membranes wagner et al 1992 therefore the level of extracellular ldh in aqueous phase can reflect the permeability of microbial cells in this study the aqueous ldh and total ldh of was were both measured by in vitro toxicology assay kit tox7 sigma missouri usa following the manufacturer s instructions the l lactic dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle sigma missouri usa was used as the ldh standard generally the released ldh in aqueous phase was measured in the supernatant directly obtained by centrifugation for the total ldh in was the 5 fold diluted raw sludge was first incubated by 1 10 volume of ldh assay lysis solution tox7 sigma missouri usa for 45 min and then the ldh in aqueous phase could be the total ldh released from solid phase the ratio of aqueous ldh and total ldh in was was used to estimate the extent of cell lysis 2 3 2 identifying live dead cells by fluorescence microscope in order to further identify the micro spatial distribution of live cells with integrated membranes and dead cells with damaged membranes a quantitative imaging method based on fluorescence staining was applied in this study the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits sigma missouri usa utilized the mixtures of syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stain and red fluorescent nucleic acid stain propidium iodide the syto 9 stain generally labels all bacteria in a population those with intact membranes and those with damaged membranes in contrast propidium iodide penetrates only bacteria with damaged membranes hu et al 2021 thus bacteria with damaged membranes can stain fluorescent red whereas bacteria with intact cell membranes stain fluorescent green the background remained virtually nonfluorescent the staining procedures were as following 1 the equal volumes of syto 9 stain 3 34 mmol l and propidium iodide 20 mmol l were mixed thoroughly 2 3 μl of the above dye mixture was added into each ml of sludge samples 3 the sample was mixed thoroughly and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min 4 5 μl of the stained sludge sample was trapped between a slide and an 18 mm square coverslip and imaged by fluorescence microscope eclipse 80i nikon japan with the excitation emission wavelength of 480 500 nm for syto 9 stain and 490 635 nm for propidium iodide 2 3 3 visualization of cell lysis by ultrathin section with transmission electron microscope tem the micro morphology of sludge samples with different cell lysis pretreatments was analyzed by ultrathin section with tem first the sludge samples were washed by phosphate buffered saline pbs for 1 2 times then the pre cooled 4 c 0 1 mol l phosphate buffering solution ph 7 containing 2 5 wt glutaraldehyde was added to the pbs washed sludge pellets to fix the microbial cells subsequently the pellets were washed by 0 1 mol l phosphate buffering solution ph 7 for 3 times and fixed by 1 wt osmic acid for another 2 h next the sludge samples were washed by another 3 times using 0 1 m phosphate buffering solution ph 7 and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions with ethanol mass concentrations of 30 50 60 70 80 90 and 95 successively finally the dehydrated samples were mixed with the resin embedding agent at the volume ratio of 1 1 and then polymerized in moulds at 70 c for 12 h ultrathin sections were cut with an ultramicrotome leica em uc7 germany using a diamond knife to obtain 70 90 nm slice the thin sections were stained with 50 ethanol saturated solution of lead citrate and uranyl acetate to enhance the electron contrast of biological material and examined with tem hitachi japan at an accelerating voltage of 80 kv 2 3 4 water state analysis by t2 relaxation time of low field nmr the water occurrence states of sludge were analyzed by low filed nmr as described in the section 2 2 in order to prepare a control sample with the complete lysis of all the microbial cells the sonication of sludge in ice bath 0 c was performed until the concentration of extracellular aqueous ldh didn t increase 8 h accordingly this control sample and the sludge samples treated by different cell lysis means in section 2 2 were centrifuged at 20000 g for 15 min to remove the supernatant so the relative percentages of water fractions potentially linked with solid phase were increased and the effect of cell lysis on bound water could be prominent the centrifugation obtained samples were separately subjected to the measurement of transverse relaxation time by low field nmr nmi20 030h 1 nmr system niumag electric corporation shanghai china the detailed instrument setting and data processing was modified based on our previous study to realize the optimal signal intensity wu et al 2019 the area under each peak of t2 spectrum was determined by cumulative integration for the relative quantification of water molecule protons with different mobility the t2 spectra of the sludge samples treated by sonication freezing thawing dmso and the control sample were comparatively analyzed thus the proportion of cell lysis and the corresponding water state transformation caused by different pretreatment means could be determined 2 3 5 other analytical methods the dynamic laser scattering mastersizer 3000 malvern uk was used to measure the particle size distribution of was pre and post cell lysis the zeta potential was measured using a zeta potential meter zeta sizer nano z malvern uk the fractal dimension was analyzed based on the microscopic imaging methods described in the previous literature li et al 2020 the dewaterability of was was evaluated in term of capillary suction time cst according to the standard method american public health association 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 effectiveness of physical pretreatments on cell lysis 3 1 1 extracellular ldh quantification the extent of cell lysis was characterized via aqueous contents of ldh which should be originally present in the cell cytoplasm with the intact cell membrane yu et al 2019 with the increasing ultrasound power from 20 w to 60 w the aqueous ldh concentration of sludge could reach 0 60 0 02 mg l by 2 min sonication fig 1 a confirming the feasibility of sonication in destructing the cell membranes thus releasing the intracellular substances including ldh however the sonication deteriorated the sludge dewaterability fig s1 of supplementary materials this finding was inconsistent with the conventional cognition obtained from the previous studies which commonly reported the positive effects of cell lysis on sludge dewaterability the possible reason could be that the sonication loosened the spatial distribution of bio flocs and created more pore structure to retain interstitial water wu et al 2021a which was reflected by the visualization results in fig 3 and in accordance with the previously reported deterioration of sludge dewaterability accompanied with increasing loosely bound eps li and yang 2007 on the other hand although the sonication could promote the solubilization of eps into aqueous phase there are still some debates on the most appropriate contents of eps for the optimal sludge dewaterability wu et al 2020 for example the excessive removal of tightly bound eps would weaken the coagulation of bio flocs and accordingly pose adverse effects on sludge dewatering unexpectedly the cell lysis was not the prominent feature of freezing thawing operation since only four or five cycles of freezing thawing could effectively release ldh fig 1b but cst substantially dropped from 69 9 2 8 s to 18 1 1 7 s with only one time of freezing thawing operation fig s1 this may indicate that the cell lysis was not closely related to the sludge dewaterability improvement the recent study also found that the freezing treatment could enhance the stretching and vibration of hydrophilic functional groups in eps which made these groups vulnerable to be damaged under low temperature conditions peng et al 2021 besides the hydration layer of organic macromolecules e g extracellular proteins began to freeze below ice point as a result during the water crystallization process the hydrophilic groups of intramolecular chain could interact with each other instead of external water molecules which would alter the conformation of secondary structure units e g α helix and β sheet of extracellular proteins tompa et al 2009 therefore the freezing treatment could improve the sludge dewaterability through increasing eps hydrophobicity dmso had the limited effectiveness in cell lysis which was reflected by the much lower concentrations of aqueous ldh 0 12 mg l than those of sonication treated sludge samples fig 1c it was reported that the dmso molecules tend to reside just below the headgroups of the lipid molecules and push the lipid heads apart so that two of the lipid molecules sit on the opposite sides of the bilayer to get deeper into the bilayer notman et al 2006 as a consequence water molecules enter the bilayer and gradually formed a continuous chain of water however the formation of water pore may only enhance the ion permeability and could not facilitate the transmembrane transport of macromolecule e g ldh notman et al 2006 in another word the addition of dmso could not completely destruct the cell membranes this finding was further verified by the analysis of water occurrence states and dewaterability in the following sections as shown in fig 1d the continuous sonication at the power of 60 w g ds didn t raise the aqueous concentration of ldh continuously the maximum ldh release 1 65 0 01 mg l was achieved by 60 w g ds sonication for 1 h and the prolonged sonication time would not further release the intracellular ldh of which the concentration kept almost constant within the next 7 h additionally the total ldh content of was with ts of 2 31 was measured to be 1 60 0 07 mg l which was nearly same as that of sludge with 8 h sonication 60 w g ds therefore it was inferred that the sample treated by 8 h sonication at 60 w g ds could be regarded as the reference with the complete lysis of all the microbial cells the aqueous ldh concentration ratio of any sample and the control sample 8 h sonication 60 w g ds could be used as the index to quantify the extent of cell lysis therefore through the data comparison in fig 1a and d it could be inferred that nearly 37 of cells 0 60 0 02 mg ldh l versus 1 60 0 07 mg ldh l were lysed by 2 min sonication 60 w g ds accordingly the 5 times of cyclic freezing thawing and 0 2 g dmso g ds could only realize 15 6 and 7 5 of cells lysed in was respectively fig 1b c and d 3 1 2 visualization of cell lysis the extent of cell integrity was also quantitatively characterized by fluorescent staining in which green fluorescence represented live cells with the integrated membranes and red fluorescence marked dead cells with damaged membranes as the fluorescence intensity data shown in fig 2 the intensity ratio of green red fluorescence constantly decreased with the increasing power input of sonication which indicated that the sonication could effectively damage the integrity of microbial cells also the sonication dispersed the aggregation states of sludge flocs fig s2a and s2b of supplementary materials for the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing only four or five cycles of freezing thawing operations could significantly reduce the density of live cells which was in accordance with the increasing trend of aqueous ldh contents dmso was used to increase the permeability of cell membrane but it should have limited effects on the transmembrane transport of propidium iodide notman et al 2006 as shown in fig 2c only when the dosage of dmso was increased over 0 2 g gds the obvious decrease of g r was observed which was in accordance with the rise of aqueous ldh at 0 2 g dmso gds this accordance reflected that only the sufficiently increased permeability of cell membrane with a high dosage of dmso could lead to the release of nucleic acids and the low addition of dmso 0 01 0 1 g gds could not effectively facilitate the transmembrane transport of propidium iodide or nucleic acids the micro morphology of sludge samples with different cell lysis pretreatments were characterized by ultrathin section with tem the cell aggregates and typical zoogloea structure could be recognized in the ultrathin sections of raw sludge figs 3 a 1 also the rod shaped bacterial cells were entrapped by dense materials inside the sludge matrix figs 3a 2 the sonication 60 w g ds for 2 min dispersed the external encapsulating components which originally surrounded microbial cells closely figs 3b 1 on the other hand the sonication caused notable lysis of microbial cells the damaged membrane structure was identified in fig 3b 2 the dispersed distribution of microbial cells featured the representative micro morphology of sludge sample treated by five times of cyclic freezing thawing treatment fig 3c no obvious cell lysis could be found and the large voids filled with extracellular polymers were considerably reduced and many bacteria were deformed figs 3c 2 thus indicating significant plastic deformation and migration of extracellular materials have taken place in the sludge flocs deneux mustin et al 2001 for the dmso treated sludge fig 3d there was no significant change in the cell aggregation states of microbial colonies but the outer edge of microbial cells tended to be rough which may reflect the dmso increased permeability of cell membrane and the material exchange between extracellular and intracellular regions the round dots may represent the liquid drops of insoluble dmso in the microbial cells 3 2 evolution of water occurrence state with cell lysis the evolution of water occurrence state in was with cell lysis was characterized by the transverse relaxation time t2 spectra so that how the cell lysis contributed to the evolution of water occurrence states could be unraveled due to the different affinities with the surrounding environment t2 of protons differs under the radio frequency pulse of low field nmr rudi et al 2008 in general a longer t2 time indicates a lower binding energy and higher mobility of water on the contrary the shorter t2 represents a tight linkage between water and structure of surrounding materials rudi et al 2008 as shown in fig 4 one dominant peak and two minor peaks featured the t2 spectra in this study suggesting the existence of three major states of protons in sludge the most left peak t21 should correspond to the protons at solid state gussoni et al 2007 wu et al 2019 t22 and t23 should correspond to the bound water and the moderately mobile water respectively gussoni et al 2007 vesilind 1994 wu et al 2019 the quantification of water states with different mobility was based on the cumulative integration of peak area in t2 spectra gummerson et al 1979 according to the data in table s1 of supplementary materials sonication continuously decreased the a21 fraction with the increasing power input and correspondingly increased the a23 fraction the information may reflect that the sonication promoted the solubilization of some solid compositions into aqueous phase also compared with the raw sludge the bound water fraction slightly decreased with the sonication for 2 min at power of 60 w g ds which also contributes to the increase in free water fraction a23 however the cell lysis ratio with the same sonication condition was nearly 50 according to the aqueous ldh content result in section 3 1 1 in another word the lysis of microbial cells limitedly contributed to the water occurrence state evolution of was on the other hand the sonication operation loosened the bio flocs of was and therefore enhance the solid water interactions which was characterized by the left shift of t2 peaks with the increasing power input of sonication fig 4a the cyclic operation of freezing thawing also left shifted the t2 peaks which was in accordance with the reduced hydrophobicity of eps under low temperature below 0 c peng et al 2021 based on the aqueous concentration of ldh section 3 1 1 it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the moderately mobile water only slightly increased from 0 555 to 0 805 with the cycle number of freezing thawing increasing from 0 to 5 fig 4b and table s1 this phenomenon also indicated the limited effectiveness of cell lysis in water occurrence state transformation dmso had few effects on the water occurrence states only 0 5 g dmso g ds slightly reduced the bound water by nearly 3 and increased the moderately mobile water fraction from 0 6 to 2 633 fig 4c and table s1 since the sample with 8 h sonication could be regarded as the sample with the complete cell lysis the corresponding water occurrence states could be the results obtained by complete cell lysis however compared with raw sludge there was no significant decrease in a22 of the sample with 8 h sonication fig 4d and table s1 again this result may direct to the ineffectiveness of cell lysis in bound water reduction of was 3 3 evolution of aggregation states of bio flocs with cell lysis the physical properties of was including particle size distribution surface charge properties and micro pore structure were reported to closely correlate with the water occurrence states of bio flocs therefore in order to explain the transformation of water occurrence states accompanied with the cell lysis the corresponding variation of these three physiochemical properties was systematically analyzed as follows 3 3 1 median particle size the median particle size d50 tended to be smaller with the increasing sonication power input especially from 50 to 60 w g ds fig 5 a the cyclic freezing thawing slightly increased d50 from 50 9 µm to 55 6 µm fig 5b which corresponded to the reduction in the absolute value of zeta potential fig 6 b the cyclic freezing thawing process reduced the repulsive force among solid particles and promoted the aggregation carrasco and gao 2019 dmso released intracellular substances through modifying the permeability of cell membranes but didn t induce the lysis of cells and almost had no effects on the aggregation states of solid compositions therefore the addition of dmso had no effects on the particle size of sludge samples as anticipated fig 5c also the particle size distribution may simultaneously influence the surface area and the porosity among microbial colloidal particles which was further characterized by fractal dimension in the following section 3 3 2 zeta potential zeta potential should be determined by the surface compositions of solid particles and ionic strength of aqueous phase in this study the physical treatment would not directly change the ionic strength of aqueous phase therefore the variations of surface charge could be influenced by the release of intracellular substances as shown in fig 6a the sonication treatment slightly reduced the electronegativity of sludge flocs compared with the raw sludge the zeta potentials of sludge particles increased from 15 5 mv to higher than 14 2 mv but fluctuated with the increasing zeta potential the freezing thawing treatment also increased zeta potential from 15 5 mv to 12 0 mv with the cycle number increasing from 0 to 5 fig 6b as plenty of charges in the floc interior are inaccessible the aggregation of flocs caused by freezing thawing treatment could decrease the exposure of solid surface and then lead to a reduction in the measured negative charges mikkelsen 2003 the similar variation trend of zeta potential was also observed with dmso added dmso could decrease the osmotic pressure difference inside and outside cell membranes through increasing the cell membrane permeability for ion transport notman et al 2007 notman et al 2006 therefore the release of ion from intracellular media may increase the ionic strength of cell surrounding environments and reduce the surface charge of solid compositions by charge neutralization sheng et al 2013 3 3 3 fractal dimension fractal dimension df reflects the micro morphology properties of an aggregate about space filling capacity surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form zhang et al 2018 with the increasing power input of sonication df constantly increased fig 7 a generally a higher fractal dimension means a lower space filling degree li et al 2020 moussas and zouboulis 2009 therefore the higher the fractal dimension the looser and smaller the bio flocs of sludge were which indicated that the sonication loosened the micro spatial distribution of sludge flocs and corresponded to the decreasing trend of particle size fig 5a the dmso led release of intracellular substances also increased df fig 7c additionally the higher fractal dimension may stand for the greater porosity of bio flocs which should provide the more space for the sterically hindered bound water e g interstitial water cheng et al 2018 wu et al 2019 but the water freezing led to the formation of homogeneous crystals which excluded the fine sludge particles and facilitated the agglomeration of solid compositions peng et al 2010 wu et al 2018 therefore the porosity could be reduced and df slightly decreased as shown in fig 7b how these variations in physiochemical properties accompanied with cell lysis affected the water occurrence states is further discussed in section 3 4 3 4 novel insights into correlations among cell lysis water occurrence states physical properties of colloidal particles and sludge dewaterability in this section the cell lysis water occurrence states and physical properties of colloidal particles were correlatively analyzed to identify the key influencing factors on sludge dewaterability according to table s2 s4 of supplementary materials the aqueous ldh concentration closely correlated with the g r ratio of fluorescent staining pearson correlation 0 95 p value 0 01 which indicated the consistency of these two methods for characterizing the cell lysis extent for the sonication treated sludge the aqueous ldh positively correlated with cst pearson coefficient 0 94 p value 0 02 but negatively correlated with the t21 and t23 peak positions pearson coefficient 0 90 p value 0 04 table s2 these results indicated that the sonication led cell lysis had the very limited efficiency in the bound water reduction instead the release of intracellular substances may enhance the binding strength of bio flocs to water cst also had the negative correlation with the median particle size pearson coefficient 0 93 p value 0 02 which indicated that the decreasing particle size was adverse for the sludge dewaterability in another word instead of the sonication induced cell lysis the sonication caused dispersion of sludge flocs dominated the deterioration of sludge dewaterability the expectative significant correlations between cell lysis extent and bound water reduction were not observed for the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing and dmso either on the contrary cst negatively correlated with zeta potential pearson coefficient 0 88 p value 0 05 for the sludge treated by cyclic freezing thawing treatment also the fraction of solid state protons a21 negatively correlated with the bound water fraction a22 in the sludge samples treated by cyclic freezing thawing table s3 these findings on the zeta potential and solid state protons may indicate that the interfacial properties played more important roles in sludge dewaterability improvement than cell lysis the release of intracellular water was not the key point for the bound water reduction besides the cell lysis extent characterized by aqueous ldh and median particle size were both closely related to the fractal dimension with pearson coefficients of 0 88 and p value 0 05 which reflected that the water crystallization excluded the solids from water and promoted the aggregation of sludge particles the increasing particle size reduced the porosity of bio flocs furthermore pearson coefficient of 0 99 with p value 0 01 verified that the reduction of bound water in dmso treated sludge positively contributed to the increase of moderately mobile water table s4 which was in accordance with the previous studies wu et al 2019 for the sonication treated sludge it is also worth to be noted that the t21 peak position significantly correlated with t22 and t23 peak positions which were determined with pearson coefficient 0 88 and p value 0 05 and indicated that the aggregation state of solid compositions significantly affected the strength of solid water interactions lee 1994 xiao et al 2017 to sum up the aggregation states of bio flocs dominated the bound water fractions of was the difficulty in sludge dewatering should be due to the water affinity of organics instead of steric hindrance caused by cell membrane therefore the future study on sludge dewaterability improvement shouldn t target the destruction of cell membranes instead more attention can be paid to the development of novel conditioning approaches that can weaken the water affinity of organics in was this insight also corresponded to our previous studies that modifying the molecular conformation of amphiphilic extracellular proteins could be a potential way for eliminating water holding capacities of bio flocs in was wu et al 2017 wu et al 2021b 4 conclusions this study specifically focused on the effect of microbial cell lysis on the water occurrence states of was the extent of cell lysis was characterized by the aqueous ldh released from intracellular cytoplasm and the sludge micro morphology with cell lysis was visualized by tem with ultrathin sections it was found that the sonication could lysed 50 of cells with the power input of 60 w g ds for 2 min unexpectedly the cyclic freezing thawing and dmso had the limited effectiveness in the destruction of cell membrane structure also 8 h sonication 60 w g ds completely lysed the microbial cells in term of ldh release but only increased the moderately mobile water from 0 555 to 2 370 regardless of the positive effect of cell lysis on intracellular water reduction the sonication dispersed the micro spatial distribution of bio flocs solid state proton decreasing from 3 313 to 0 020 and accordingly increased df from 1 20 to 1 23 which enhanced the binding strength of bio flocs to water dmso released intracellular substances through modifying the permeability of cell membranes but didn t induce the lysis of cells and almost had no effects on the aggregation states of solid compositions similarly it could be estimated that nearly 15 of cells were destructed after 5 times of freezing thawing but the moderately mobile water only rose from 0 555 to 0 805 on the contrary the cyclic freezing thawing process reduced the repulsive force among solid particles and promoted the aggregation which significantly contributed to the sludge dewaterability improvement in term of cst in sum instead of the cell integrity the aggregation

15722,deforestation is currently a widespread phenomenon and a growing environmental concern in the era of rapid climate change in temperate regions it is challenging to quantify the impacts of deforestation on the catchment dynamics and downstream aquatic ecosystems such as reservoirs and disentangle these from direct climate change impacts let alone project future changes to inform management here we tackled this issue by investigating a unique catchment reservoir system with two reservoirs in distinct trophic states meso and eutrophic both of which drain into the largest drinking water reservoir in germany due to the prolonged droughts in 2015 2018 the catchment of the mesotrophic reservoir lost an unprecedented area of forest exponential increase since 2015 and ca 17 1 loss in 2020 alone we coupled catchment nutrient exports hype and reservoir ecosystem dynamics gotm wet models using a process based modeling approach the coupled model was validated with datasets spanning periods of rapid deforestation which makes our future projections highly robust results show that in a short term time scale by 2035 increasing nutrient flux from the catchment due to vast deforestation 80 loss can turn the mesotrophic reservoir into a eutrophic state as its counterpart our results emphasize the more prominent impacts of deforestation than the direct impact of climate warming in impairment of water quality and ecological services to downstream aquatic ecosystems therefore we propose to evaluate the impact of climate change on temperate reservoirs by incorporating a time scale dependent context highlighting the indirect impact of deforestation in the short term scale in the long term scale e g to 2100 a guiding hypothesis for future research may be that indirect effects e g as mediated by catchment dynamics are as important as the direct effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords deforestation climate change temperate regions reservoir eutrophication process based modeling 1 introduction global deforestation is proceeding at unprecedented rates driven by increasing events of wildfires droughts heatwaves pests and pathogens mottl et al 2021 overpeck and breshears 2021 forest has been well acknowledged as high priority habitats as they store high biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services mori et al 2017 among them the positive feedbacks between forests and the water cycle are multifaceted and not only refer to water quantity dynamics but also to water quality e g by buffering of nutrients reducing erosion or enhancing in stream removal processing of nutrients thereby serving as a major management target for catchment centered water quality restoration sweeney et al 2004 in contrast deforestation leads to loss of key ecosystem functions and induces legacy effects on the catchment hydrosphere by changing runoff patterns or intensifying nutrient loading from these catchments woodward et al 2014 thus far large scale deforestation has been recognized as a key driver for the changes in the biogeochemical cycling at local and global scales lawrence and vandecar 2015 deforestation in temperate regions particularly in central european uplands has been relatively understudied compared to tropical areas in many tropical densely forested areas e g the amazon deforestation effects are predominantly addressed regarding catchment exports of particulate substances bormann et al 1974 nutrient cycling downing et al 1999 and system resilience zemp et al 2017 however despite the ongoing widespread deforestation in central europe only a few studies in poland boczoń et al 2018 the czech republic schmidt et al 2021 and germany jung et al 2021 were recently performed which all pointed to a change in dissolved mass export from the catchment but with contradictory trends varying magnitudes and temporal patterns our predictive ability to assess the impact of deforestation in temperate region therefore remains limited climate change and increasing deforestation overpeck and breshears 2021 as well as the significant difference in hydrogeological processes between temperate and tropical systems domis et al 2013 jointly call for more in depth explorations of the deforestation effects on catchment dynamics in the central european temperate regions furthermore the consequences of deforestation for the downstream waterbodies such as reservoirs have been rarely addressed in central europe reservoirs are highly valuable artificial infrastructures providing various ecological services to human including drinking water resources nutrient removal to downstream and flood protection rinke et al 2013 in particular small reservoirs constitute most existing reservoirs and are disproportionately important for biogeochemical processes harrison et al 2009 they usually have a relatively short water residence time and are highly sensitive to both climate change and anthropogenic perturbations adrian et al 2009 nevertheless except for a few cases that focused on specific water chemistry proxies kopáček et al 2017 2019 the impact of deforestation on the ecosystem dynamics in downstream reservoirs has been largely overlooked despite its vast management concern it is challenging to attribute the direct and indirect impacts on reservoir ecology to external forces direct effects from climate change on water bodies have been well acknowledged woolway et al 2020 whereas joint effects from indirect effects in the catchment via land use change including deforestation remain largely unquantified disentangling the effects is valuable because only a comprehensive integration of direct and indirect impacts can thoroughly inform management e g by prioritizing alternative mitigation measures either targeting catchment or reservoir focused management response a feasible method to address this challenge is to use process based models driven by different external forcing scenarios to project ecosystem dynamics in the future it is pivotal to bring the following five environmental compartments into one coherent chain of processing climatic physical drivers catchment hydrology biogeochemical processing in the catchment lake physics and aquatic ecology however such efforts are rare and existing approaches usually simplified either the catchment or the lake reservoir compartments depending on their research emphases barbosa et al 2021 couture et al 2014 nielsen et al 2021 thereby missing key mechanisms related to deforestation and its impact on lake reservoir ecosystem dynamics from the perspective of environmental modeling integrating the five modeling modules is challenging yet highly valuable in addition future projections of lakes responding to climate change have focused predominantly on physical properties such as temperature and stratification e g woolway et al 2020 and less frequently on water quality or ecology jane et al 2021 kraemer et al 2021 in addition these projections fundamentally cannot be validated reference systems are therefore extremely valuable for the validation of these projections however such opportunities are rare because most systems are substantially different in morphology water chemistry and ecological features which hampers direct comparison availability of monitoring data is another key determinant for such a comparative approach grab sampling is usually limited to offering a comprehensive understanding of a complex interacting catchment reservoir system instead high frequency monitoring approach representing the catchment and reservoir heterogeneities are recommended rode et al 2016 in this study we utilize a unique catchment reservoir system in central germany with two predams with similar morphological features but distinct trophic states meso and eutrophic the difference in trophic status is mainly driven by land use in the catchments with either forest or agriculture dominance these two systems have been intensively monitored at both catchment outlets and reservoirs since 2011 allowing for adequate modeling exploration the hypotheses are 1 large scale deforestation in temperate catchments of central european uplands can lead to increased nutrient fluxes to the downstream via an increase in both discharge and concentration 2 jointly with climate warming the changes in catchment nutrient exports can subsequently turn the downstream lake reservoir from meso into eutrophic state and deteriorating the water quality to address these hypotheses we established a coupled catchment hype and reservoir gotm wet model which was used to project reservoir water quality by 2035 under various climate change and deforestation scenarios we elaborated to disentangle the relative importance of climate change and deforestation and provide new insights for combating future climate change effects and safeguarding the water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the rappbode and hassel predams are located in the eastern harz mountains in central germany fig 1 and table 1 the two predams drain directly into the main rappbode reservoir two thirds of total inflow which is the largest drinking water reservoir in germany for about one million residents and providing additional services such as flood protection and electricity production rinke et al 2013 the two predams were built to reduce sediment and nutrient load to the main reservoir they are operated in continuous overflow on the spillway while the bottom outlets are normally closed they share similar morphological properties and catchment size friese et al 2014 however whereas the rappbode catchment is predominantly forest without agricultural use the hassel catchment consists of roughly equal areas of forest grassland and agriculture this could explain the distinct trophic states in rappbode mesotrophic and hassel eutrophic predams table 1 in addition the rappbode catchment underwent deforestation of ca 17 1 from 2015 to 2020 figs 1 and s1 since 1999 all wastewater from the settlements in

bias correction of rcp inputs déqué et al 2007 in addition three deforestation scenarios 0 50 and 80 deforestation were applied to the rappbode catchment for both 50 and 80 deforestation soil land classes previously defined as spruce forest coniferous trees in the hype model were changed to natural grassland cover as a typical natural process after deforestation 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r core team 2021 the analyses were based on the annually averaged simulated values during the projection period 2021 2035 effects of climate change were assessed by comparing model outputs from each rcp scenario in the period 2021 2035 with a historical baseline period of 2011 2018 thereby as a factor with four levels historical rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 for catchments the historical baseline was determined by field data in the catchment outlets for reservoirs it was determined by simulated data of the reservoir model driven by catchment inputs and climate projection picontrol the effect of deforestation was assessed by comparing modelled variables in the future period with each deforestation as a factor with three levels 0 50 and 80 loss

by the percentage of variance explained of climate change and deforestation and their interactions as fixed effects on the future projections of various hydro ecological variables climate change and deforestation scenarios were nested and different gcms were provided as replicates time was considered as the random effect in the model the model also estimated the contribution of residuals as the variance not explained by any factor all variables were naturally log transformed prior to the analysis to improve the normality the multilevel models were developed using r packages lme4 and variancepartition bates et al 2014 hoffman and schadt 2016 3 results 3 1 catchment model calibration and validation the hype model showed good performance for discharge at both stations during calibration and validation periods fig 2 and table s3 seasonal dynamics were well captured including flow conditions flood events and base flow the highest nse value 0 81 was observed at rappbode during validation and lowest nse value 0 74 was at hassel catchment during calibration pbias was below 20 for calibration and validation at both stations and was lower at rappbode than hassel no3 n loading was predicted reasonably well for calibration the model performed better in rappbode than hassel with nse of 0 54 and 0 36 respectively lognse provides similar outcomes during the validation period the model also showed good performance with nse of 0 71 in rappbode and 0 49 in hassel pbias values were below 10 for calibration and 20 for validation no3 n concentration shows a typical seasonal cycle with lower concentrations in late summer and high concentration in winter these patterns were more pronounced in hassel than in rappbode and the model could remarkably reproduce these catchment specific features the model showed reasonable performance for tp loading with nse between 0 12 and 0 45 in both catchments during both calibration and validation periods pbias values for both catchments were observed within the satisfactory range 22 to 21 except at hassel during the calibration 40 2 which was attributed to several simulated summer peaks against lower observed values several hydrological events were not captured by the model due to strong areal rainfall variation which was likely not accurately measured by the limited number of precipitation stations consequently lognse values were better than the original nse values nevertheless the model satisfactorily captured the low flow seasonal tp concentration amplitudes with winter lows and summer highs in both catchments and the more pronounced seasonality of tp in hassel than in rappbode the model evaluation for no3 n and tp concentrations also reflects good performance in both catchments with small differences between simulated and observed concentration and pbias ranged 18 31 17 03 for no3 n and 7 34 17 25 for tp table s3 nevertheless we consider the loads more important than concentrations for the impact on the trophic state of the predams and evaluation based on concentration using nse and pbias can be inadequate when the observed values are low and the discrepancy is close to detection limit the uncertainty analysis fig s6 shows small parameter uncertainty bands of discharge no3 n and tp indicating the low uncertainty related to parameter optimization in contrast total uncertainty shows a much larger range suggesting higher uncertainty caused by model structural uncertainties similar patterns were observed for no3 n and tp at both catchments more than 90 of the observed data for discharge no3 n and tp lies in the total uncertainty bands compared to no3 n higher uncertainties were observed for tp due to less observed data for calibration which can be improved by increasing availability of high frequency data taken together uncertainty associated with hype model is acceptable and equifinality of parameterization is unlikely 3 2 projections of catchment dynamics at annually averaged scale the model predicts that discharge in rappbode catchment slightly increases by up to 10 2 fig 3 table 2 due to climate changes and deforestation kw test p 0 01 and the change is significant at rcp6 0 or 8 5 and 50 or 80 deforestation pairwise wilcoxon test p 0 05 multilevel models show that over 90 of variance in annually average discharge is not explained by either climate change or deforestation fig 3f in addition no temporal change is found in discharge under any scenario projection mk test p 0 05 fig s7 for nutrient concentration in the rappbode catchment the model predicts that deforestation is the main driver of changes kw test p 0 001 while climate has no significant direct effect kw test p 0 05 fig 3 table 2 the increase of nutrient concentrations ranged 12 114 under both 50 and 80 deforestation compared to the reference scenario with no deforestation table 2 at 80 deforestation nutrient concentrations in rappbode catchment increase but remained significantly lower than those in hassel under 0 deforestation and discharge will be significantly higher than that in hassel wilcoxon test p 0 001 fig 3 multilevel models further reveal that deforestation explained ca 63 50 and 64 of the variations in no3 n tp and srp concentrations fig 3f similar to discharge pp is not well explained by either factor 95 variance explained by residuals for no3 n there is a significant increasing trend only at rcp8 5 under different deforestations mk test p 0 01 fig s7 for tp and srp a significant increasing trend is detected under each rcp and deforestation scenario mk test p 0 01 for pp no temporal trend is found in any scenario 3 3 reservoir model calibration and validation for both reservoirs simulated water temperature showed high accuracy with rmse below 1 0 c r higher than 0 98 and pbias below 4 in both calibration and validation respectively figs 4 and s8 tables s4 and s5 indicating that the model well captured the thermal dynamics on the vertical dimension in addition the highly variable do dynamics in the epilimnion and the deep water hypoxia were both successfully modeled with r 0 9 and pbias below 30 in rappbode and r 0 8 and pbias below 20 in hassel the model succeeded in predicting the inter and intra annual variations in no3 n with r of 0 55 0 68 and pbias of 15 12 for calibration validation respectively figs 4 s9 s11 and s12 the model performed better during the second validation 2011 2019 only surface data with r 0 9 and pbias about 15 figs s10 and s13 tables s4 and s5 summer depletion of no3 n was nicely captured by the model simulated nh4 n also agreed reasonably with observations the model underestimated the summer nh4 n peaks during calibration the model overall showed an acceptable performance for tn with r higher than 0 5 the model succeeded in grasping the magnitude and variations of tp with r 0 3 and pbias 30 for both calibration and validation despite its low level 0 01 0 03 mg l 1 several tp peaks in both reservoirs were not captured by the model besides the model captured the magnitude of srp which was occasionally above the detection limit 0 003 mg l 1 in rappbode predam during autumn winter and remained mostly undetectable in other seasons in addition silicon concentration was captured in terms of both seasonal variations and inter annual magnitude in both reservoirs with r 0 26 0 39 and pbias around 20 in calibration and validation respectively and better during second validation r 0 8 in rappbode in hassel pbias of simulated silicon was all below 8 the model predicted the magnitude and seasonality of chl a concentration reasonably well in both calibration and validation periods in both reservoirs with r in the range 0 28 0 64 and pbias about 4 30 the general patterns of phytoplankton community composition were nicely modeled with r for cyanobacteria green algae and diatom in the range 0 20 0 78 and pbias ranged 2 3 47 5 the results showed that during 2011 to 2015 diatom and cyanobacteria were the dominant groups while cyanobacteria was more abundant in hassel than rappbode figs 4 and s11 3 4 projections of reservoir ecosystem dynamics for tn no3 n tp srp and pp concentrations in rappbode predam model shows that differences among the deforestation gradients are significant but not among the climate change gradients kw test fig 5 table 2 in specific compared to 0 deforestation 50 and 80 deforestation lead to a significant increase of nutrient concentration tn no3 n tp srp and pp ranged 14 7 122 1 table 2 at 80 deforestation nutrient concentrations except for pp in rappbode remain lower than those in hassel at 0 deforestation wilcoxon test p 0 05 nevertheless tp and srp concentrations both approach to the level in hassel fig 5 multilevel model shows that deforestation accounts for 70 82 of variance in concentrations of tn tp no3 n and srp and 12 in pp fig 5 despite 14 7 49 8 increase in pp concentration at 50 and 80 deforestation respectively in lake biogeochemical processes are more important than external inputs resulting in the low explanatory of variance in pp climate change shows no direct contribution to the variations in nutrient concentrations all nutrient concentrations except for pp show a significant increasing trend over the projection period mk test p 0 05 fig s14 the model projections suggest that for chl a concentration three algal biomass and tsi differences among the deforestation gradients are significant but not among the climate change gradients kw test fig 5 table 2 in specific at 50 and 80 deforestation the model predicts an increase of chl a concentration and three algal biomass ranged 15 228 table 2 where green algae and diatom contribute a relative low proportion 7 18 of total algal biomass taken together 50 and 80 deforestation result in an increase of 5 6 and 9 5 in tsi respectively which ultimately exceed critical threshold of eutrophication 50 indicating the eutrophication in rappbode predam due to deforestation chl a and three algal groups in rappbode at 80 deforestation are still lower than those in hassel wilcoxon test p 0 05 whereas they all approach to a similar level fig 5 furthermore multilevel model shows that deforestation explains less variance in phytoplankton variables 40 63 compared to that for nutrients fig 5 from 2021 to 2035 chl a and cyanobacteria both show a significant increase trend under all projection scenarios mk test p 0 05 fig s15 in contrast green algae and diatom show an increasing trend under rcp2 6 but decreasing trend under rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 mk test p 0 05 fig s15 finally water temperature is only affected by climate change but not by deforestation and no significant change was detected in water temperature thermocline depth and schmidt stability from 2021 to 2035 fig s16 overall the model projects a shift to eutrophication state in the mesotrophic rappbode predam at 80 deforestation phytoplankton biomass appears to respond to deforestation and climate change in a more diverse pattern than nutrients 4 discussion 4 1 impact of deforestation on catchment dynamics our results on the impact of deforestation on discharge are in line with a few available long term field observations in temperate areas in the rappbode catchment no significantly increased discharge was observed under 17 1 deforestation in 2020 fig s17 si text the extreme drought in 2018 was associated with lower precipitation while the runoff precipitation ratio only fluctuated without clear trends fig s18 beudert et al 2018 pointed out that deforestation rate must exceed a threshold of 20 25 of the total catchment area to be detectable in discharge with precipitation higher than 500 mm y 1 however discharge was found unchanged over 30 years after a 40 deforestation in 2005 in the bavarian forest jung et al 2021 in addition our model projections suggest a slightly increased discharge by 6 8 and 10 2 under 50 and 80 deforestation respectively fig 3 table 2 the low increase of discharge in response to deforestation can be explained by a mixture of competing factors of reduced evapotranspiration from grassland fallow compared to conifer forest fig s19 and increased evaporation of grassland due to loss of the shading by the canopy and an increased evapotranspiration for all vegetation types due to global warming which may reduce the differences in evapotranspiration between the vegetation types no3 n concentration is predicted to increase by 78 9 under 50 deforestation table 2 while it was found doubled in bavarian forest after 40 deforestation jung et al 2021 similar extent of no3 n concentration increase after drastic deforestation was also reported in hubbard brook experimental forest us bormann et al 1974 and plešné national park kopáček et al 2017 our model suggests that the increase in no3 n concentration is mainly due to reduced no3 n uptake by tree vegetation and thereby lower n storage in the catchment in combination with lower transpiration this leads to increased soil moisture and no3 n increasing leaching from the soil after deforestation compared to n the increase in p after deforestation was less pronounced the dominant change occurred in srp and tp whereas pp was only slightly affected the projected increase of srp in the rappbode catchment under 80 deforestation 85 4 is consistent with that in the plešné national park where srp concentration in the streams increased by 50 100 after deforestation kopáček et al 2017 our model suggests that the lower p plant uptake in combination with slightly elevated soil moisture and related dissolution of p from soil increases soluble p availability an increasing srp availability due to higher water table and soil moisture can also be supported by associated changing redox conditions kopáček et al 2017 which is not explicitly considered by our model intriguingly suspended pp only slightly increased after deforestation because dense grassland vegetation sheltered the soil surface and prevents soil loss due to upland erosion which was explicitly modeled by hype continuous monitoring data from the rappbode catchment outlet partially confirm the consistent changing trends with model projections see si text fig s17 existing monitoring is proceeded to trace the change in the years to come 4 2 impact of deforestation on reservoirs we provide concrete evidence of noteworthy potential of reservoirs water quality deterioration by deforestation the projected eutrophication in the downstream reservoir rappbode resulted in a higher production of algal biomass fig 5 particularly at 80 deforestation scenario meanwhile the influence of warming induced lake physical changes huisman et al 2018 acts as a secondary role in driving the phytoplankton development figs s16 and s20 the magnitude of increase in cyanobacteria 21 36 in response to deforestation is in line with a recent global projection until 2050 20 30 in which both climate and anthropogenically driven land use changes are found to be associated with algal biomass increase kakouei et al 2021 interestingly cyanobacteria increased less than the other groups in relative terms fig 5 cyanobacteria can be generally regarded as more competitive under nutrient limitation especially n limitation than the other groups accordingly although cyanobacteria increased the most in absolute terms due to higher nutrient levels the degree of nutrient limitation decreased and consequently so did the competitive advantage of cyanobacteria allowing the diatoms and green algae to increase in biomass more in relative terms this is evident in the strong correlation of nutrients with diatoms and green algae but weaker correlation with cyanobacteria fig s20 nevertheless the response of the algal composition to nutrient enrichment is difficult to generalize and likely occurs more at the species level kong et al 2021 shatwell et al 2013 rather than in the broad taxonomic groups overall together with the findings from catchment modeling showing a higher impact of deforestation than climate change fig 3 our results emphasize the need to focus more on catchment land use changes particularly by climate change in the near future for downstream lakes reservoirs water quality intriguingly variations in the phytoplankton projections are not as well explained by the climate and deforestation factors 40 63 as those for the nutrient variables 70 82 excluding pp fig 5 controlling factors beyond climate and deforestation such as top down effect of grazing and competition between macrophytes and phytoplankton may also play a crucial role in mediating the phytoplankton development in future scenarios rousso et al 2020 hence projections on phytoplankton can be accurately achieved when both external forcing and process based models accounting for internal ecological descriptions in the lake reservoir are available which is exemplified in the present study we deem that the findings in the current study can be relevant for many other similar catchment reservoir systems in temperate regions catchment reservoir systems are widely distributed particularly in natural temperate forested areas van wijk et al 2021 due to an increasing frequency of droughts projected in the future hari et al 2020 we envision an increasing deforestation risk which may exert profound impacts on forest ecosystems and corresponding surface waters like rivers lakes and reservoirs by stimulating matter flux from the catchments our results therefore call for a more comprehensive evaluation of deforestation combining both catchment and ecosystem level dynamics in the receiving stagnant waters 4 3 merits and limitations of the coupled modeling approach our model coupling benefits vastly from the recent development of both catchment and aquatic ecosystem process based models janssen et al 2019 rode et al 2010 moreover our modeling approach distinguished from the existing studies because we coupled catchment and reservoir models at a process based level and validated the model across a period with rapid changes such model coupling requires a detailed configuration calibration validation and projection procedures and harmonized teamwork in both compartments despite emerging tools such as qwet nielsen et al 2021 insights from both catchment and lake expertises are eternally essential in addition our model was calibrated and validated against field observations of 10 years 2010 2019 covering a period with rapid change due to climate warming and deforestation figs 2 s10 and s13 therefore our study showcases the capacity of process based models in capturing ecosystems dynamics under changing external conditions which enhances the reliability of the future projections in addition we developed the coupled model in two adjacent reservoir systems with distinct ecological states we propose that it is valuable to conduct an ensemble sites approach that is to develop one process based model with identical parameters to multiple similar catchment lake systems to prove transferability of the underlying model system the parameter set of the catchment model is applicable for both natural and agricultural dominant catchments while the parameter set of the reservoir model represents both meso trophic and eutrophic states of reservoirs covering a wide gradient of catchment reservoir systems for example the two catchments largely differ in land use but both are well simulated for discharge using the same land use related parameters which gives us strong confidence in the reliability of land use dependent evapotranspiration parameters in addition the model is able to reflect decisive ecosystem characteristics not only to the timing and magnitude of single variables but also to important key properties the simulations showed a more eutrophic state for hassel compared to rappbode reflected by nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass and composition the shift from diatoms towards cyanobacteria with increasing phosphorus supply is a key feature along the eutrophication gradient such comparative studies turn out to be insightful with respect to identifying fundamental principles e g by using reference states carpenter et al 2011 or by comparing gradients of environmental drivers on ecological processes jeppesen et al 2020 in conclusion we suggest incorporating such a comparative limnological perspective more in the future modeling practice to improve trust in the model validity for projection nevertheless the current catchment modeling approach has limitations because the transient deforestation is missing and unlinked to climate change in the catchment modeling the deforestation scenarios 50 and 80 are currently modeled as a sudden shift in the land use whereas such a process is more progressive in reality for example no3 n concentration was found to increase immediately after deforestation or lagging one growing season but generally peaks in 5 7 years after deforestation jung et al 2021 schmidt et al 2021 thus we are modeling the worst case scenario and cautions are needed when linking model projections to management practice in addition the deforestation scenarios are not causally linked to climate change further studies are expected to incorporate more terrestrial dynamics in the catchment modeling to capture the delay in stream nutrient level changes moreover reforestation will take place after the deforestation which again is a transient process and specific reforestation management options will lead to deviating forest developments and associated nutrient export to fluvial and stagnant waters for future modeling approach we recommend the coupling of a forest growth model bugmann et al 2019 with the catchment nutrient export model lastly deforestation may increase the sensitivity of discharge to extreme precipitation events at sub daily scale unfortunately due to the limitation in the spatial context of precipitation data and the daily time step of the model extreme events could only be partly captured by hype thus a few extreme nutrient peaks are not well captured within the calibration and validation period fig 2 which opens the opportunity for further improvement based on increasing data availability and finer model resolution 4 4 implications for climate impact on reservoirs a time scale dependent framework our analyses underscore the need for revisiting our current focus in understanding the external drivers of lake reservoir ecosystems in a time scale dependent framework recent studies highlight the pronounced direct impact of climate changes till 2100 in temperature and mixing regime woolway and merchant 2019 lake oxygen jane et al 2021 and thermal habitat kraemer et al 2021 however such changes require at least decades in the future to become detectable our study reveals that in a shorter time scale i e 1 2 decades changes in catchment land use such as deforestation will likely lead to eutrophication in the reservoirs while the direct impacts of climate change remained limited this is the key interpretation of our work and thus lays a foundation for a field of research related to climate change impact studies indirect impacts from climate change are likely to be much more profound than the direct impacts in the next 1 2 decades this state also points to extreme events which have the potential to change whole ecosystems within a reasonable short time in addition to deforestation other processes may turn out to be of similar importance e g loss of key species or invasion of new ones bell et al 2021 groundwater drawdowns and accompanying habitat loss of aquatic ecosystems rinke et al 2021 therefore we advocate a timescale dependent framework to tackle the climate change impact on the catchment reservoir systems fig 6 in which both short term indirect impacts and long term direct impacts are summarized specifically in the time scale of next 1 2 decades indirect effects of climate change on lake reservoirs via catchment changes would be dominant calling for a focus on catchment and improved nutrient management practice on a longer time scale up to 2100 increasing direct impact from climate change are expected particularly in the worst scenario rcp8 5 woolway et al 2020 in parallel with more severe changes in the catchments e g deforestation at this stage both catchment management and climate adaptation strategies in downstream reservoirs such as selective withdrawal strategy mi et al 2020 and optimum water transport zhan et al 2021 will be highly recommended 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates that deforestation in temperate natural catchments results in an increased nutrient loading and can ultimately turn downstream mesotrophic reservoirs into a eutrophic state the enhanced nutrient loading n and p to the reservoirs after deforestation is attributed predominantly to the increasing nutrient concentration in the streams due to lower nutrient storage and uptake higher nutrient concentration in soil water and raised soil nutrient leaching in the catchments but marginally to the increasing discharge our results highlight the predominant indirect effect of climate change on lakes reservoirs via changing land use and catchment nutrient loading in the next 10 20 years direct effects of climate change on lakes reservoirs remain limited compared to indirect catchment effects in this short term scale but may become increasingly significant in the long run due to enhanced profound changes in thermal dynamics as a modeling approach the present study exemplifies the joint strength of coupled catchment and lake reservoir process based model in elucidating the complex causality chain from climate change to catchment reservoir ecosystems the unique dual system in this study site demonstrates the enormous value of comparative studies to improve the robustness of numerical model projections finally we propose to evaluate the climate change impact on lakes reservoirs under an updated framework with time scale dependency i e prioritizing the implementation of adaptation strategies in the upstream catchment in the near future and in the reservoir

15722,deforestation is currently a widespread phenomenon and a growing environmental concern in the era of rapid climate change in temperate regions it is challenging to quantify the impacts of deforestation on the catchment dynamics and downstream aquatic ecosystems such as reservoirs and disentangle these from direct climate change impacts let alone project future changes to inform management here we tackled this issue by investigating a unique catchment reservoir system with two reservoirs in distinct trophic states meso and eutrophic both of which drain into the largest drinking water reservoir in germany due to the prolonged droughts in 2015 2018 the catchment of the mesotrophic reservoir lost an unprecedented area of forest exponential increase since 2015 and ca 17 1 loss in 2020 alone we coupled catchment nutrient exports hype and reservoir ecosystem dynamics gotm wet models using a process based modeling approach the coupled model was validated with datasets spanning periods of rapid deforestation which makes our future projections highly robust results show that in a short term time scale by 2035 increasing nutrient flux from the catchment due to vast deforestation 80 loss can turn the mesotrophic reservoir into a eutrophic state as its counterpart our results emphasize the more prominent impacts of deforestation than the direct impact of climate warming in impairment of water quality and ecological services to downstream aquatic ecosystems therefore we propose to evaluate the impact of climate change on temperate reservoirs by incorporating a time scale dependent context highlighting the indirect impact of deforestation in the short term scale in the long term scale e g to 2100 a guiding hypothesis for future research may be that indirect effects e g as mediated by catchment dynamics are as important as the direct effects of climate warming on aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords deforestation climate change temperate regions reservoir eutrophication process based modeling 1 introduction global deforestation is proceeding at unprecedented rates driven by increasing events of wildfires droughts heatwaves pests and pathogens mottl et al 2021 overpeck and breshears 2021 forest has been well acknowledged as high priority habitats as they store high biodiversity and provide key ecosystem services mori et al 2017 among them the positive feedbacks between forests and the water cycle are multifaceted and not only refer to water quantity dynamics but also to water quality e g by buffering of nutrients reducing erosion or enhancing in stream removal processing of nutrients thereby serving as a major management target for catchment centered water quality restoration sweeney et al 2004 in contrast deforestation leads to loss of key ecosystem functions and induces legacy effects on the catchment hydrosphere by changing runoff patterns or intensifying nutrient loading from these catchments woodward et al 2014 thus far large scale deforestation has been recognized as a key driver for the changes in the biogeochemical cycling at local and global scales lawrence and vandecar 2015 deforestation in temperate regions particularly in central european uplands has been relatively understudied compared to tropical areas in many tropical densely forested areas e g the amazon deforestation effects are predominantly addressed regarding catchment exports of particulate substances bormann et al 1974 nutrient cycling downing et al 1999 and system resilience zemp et al 2017 however despite the ongoing widespread deforestation in central europe only a few studies in poland boczoń et al 2018 the czech republic schmidt et al 2021 and germany jung et al 2021 were recently performed which all pointed to a change in dissolved mass export from the catchment but with contradictory trends varying magnitudes and temporal patterns our predictive ability to assess the impact of deforestation in temperate region therefore remains limited climate change and increasing deforestation overpeck and breshears 2021 as well as the significant difference in hydrogeological processes between temperate and tropical systems domis et al 2013 jointly call for more in depth explorations of the deforestation effects on catchment dynamics in the central european temperate regions furthermore the consequences of deforestation for the downstream waterbodies such as reservoirs have been rarely addressed in central europe reservoirs are highly valuable artificial infrastructures providing various ecological services to human including drinking water resources nutrient removal to downstream and flood protection rinke et al 2013 in particular small reservoirs constitute most existing reservoirs and are disproportionately important for biogeochemical processes harrison et al 2009 they usually have a relatively short water residence time and are highly sensitive to both climate change and anthropogenic perturbations adrian et al 2009 nevertheless except for a few cases that focused on specific water chemistry proxies kopáček et al 2017 2019 the impact of deforestation on the ecosystem dynamics in downstream reservoirs has been largely overlooked despite its vast management concern it is challenging to attribute the direct and indirect impacts on reservoir ecology to external forces direct effects from climate change on water bodies have been well acknowledged woolway et al 2020 whereas joint effects from indirect effects in the catchment via land use change including deforestation remain largely unquantified disentangling the effects is valuable because only a comprehensive integration of direct and indirect impacts can thoroughly inform management e g by prioritizing alternative mitigation measures either targeting catchment or reservoir focused management response a feasible method to address this challenge is to use process based models driven by different external forcing scenarios to project ecosystem dynamics in the future it is pivotal to bring the following five environmental compartments into one coherent chain of processing climatic physical drivers catchment hydrology biogeochemical processing in the catchment lake physics and aquatic ecology however such efforts are rare and existing approaches usually simplified either the catchment or the lake reservoir compartments depending on their research emphases barbosa et al 2021 couture et al 2014 nielsen et al 2021 thereby missing key mechanisms related to deforestation and its impact on lake reservoir ecosystem dynamics from the perspective of environmental modeling integrating the five modeling modules is challenging yet highly valuable in addition future projections of lakes responding to climate change have focused predominantly on physical properties such as temperature and stratification e g woolway et al 2020 and less frequently on water quality or ecology jane et al 2021 kraemer et al 2021 in addition these projections fundamentally cannot be validated reference systems are therefore extremely valuable for the validation of these projections however such opportunities are rare because most systems are substantially different in morphology water chemistry and ecological features which hampers direct comparison availability of monitoring data is another key determinant for such a comparative approach grab sampling is usually limited to offering a comprehensive understanding of a complex interacting catchment reservoir system instead high frequency monitoring approach representing the catchment and reservoir heterogeneities are recommended rode et al 2016 in this study we utilize a unique catchment reservoir system in central germany with two predams with similar morphological features but distinct trophic states meso and eutrophic the difference in trophic status is mainly driven by land use in the catchments with either forest or agriculture dominance these two systems have been intensively monitored at both catchment outlets and reservoirs since 2011 allowing for adequate modeling exploration the hypotheses are 1 large scale deforestation in temperate catchments of central european uplands can lead to increased nutrient fluxes to the downstream via an increase in both discharge and concentration 2 jointly with climate warming the changes in catchment nutrient exports can subsequently turn the downstream lake reservoir from meso into eutrophic state and deteriorating the water quality to address these hypotheses we established a coupled catchment hype and reservoir gotm wet model which was used to project reservoir water quality by 2035 under various climate change and deforestation scenarios we elaborated to disentangle the relative importance of climate change and deforestation and provide new insights for combating future climate change effects and safeguarding the water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the rappbode and hassel predams are located in the eastern harz mountains in central germany fig 1 and table 1 the two predams drain directly into the main rappbode reservoir two thirds of total inflow which is the largest drinking water reservoir in germany for about one million residents and providing additional services such as flood protection and electricity production rinke et al 2013 the two predams were built to reduce sediment and nutrient load to the main reservoir they are operated in continuous overflow on the spillway while the bottom outlets are normally closed they share similar morphological properties and catchment size friese et al 2014 however whereas the rappbode catchment is predominantly forest without agricultural use the hassel catchment consists of roughly equal areas of forest grassland and agriculture this could explain the distinct trophic states in rappbode mesotrophic and hassel eutrophic predams table 1 in addition the rappbode catchment underwent deforestation of ca 17 1 from 2015 to 2020 figs 1 and s1 since 1999 all wastewater from the settlements in

bias correction of rcp inputs déqué et al 2007 in addition three deforestation scenarios 0 50 and 80 deforestation were applied to the rappbode catchment for both 50 and 80 deforestation soil land classes previously defined as spruce forest coniferous trees in the hype model were changed to natural grassland cover as a typical natural process after deforestation 2 5 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed in r core team 2021 the analyses were based on the annually averaged simulated values during the projection period 2021 2035 effects of climate change were assessed by comparing model outputs from each rcp scenario in the period 2021 2035 with a historical baseline period of 2011 2018 thereby as a factor with four levels historical rcps 2 6 6 0 and 8 5 for catchments the historical baseline was determined by field data in the catchment outlets for reservoirs it was determined by simulated data of the reservoir model driven by catchment inputs and climate projection picontrol the effect of deforestation was assessed by comparing modelled variables in the future period with each deforestation as a factor with three levels 0 50 and 80 loss

variance not explained by any factor all variables were naturally log transformed prior to the analysis to improve the normality the multilevel models were developed using r packages lme4 and variancepartition bates et al 2014 hoffman and schadt 2016 3 results 3 1 catchment model calibration and validation the hype model showed good performance for discharge at both stations during calibration and validation periods fig 2 and table s3 seasonal dynamics were well captured including flow conditions flood events and base flow the highest nse value 0 81 was observed at rappbode during validation and lowest nse value 0 74 was at hassel catchment during calibration pbias was below 20 for calibration and validation at both stations and was lower at rappbode than hassel no3 n loading was predicted reasonably well for calibration the model performed better in rappbode than hassel with nse of 0 54 and 0 36 respectively lognse provides similar outcomes during the validation period the model also showed good performance with nse of 0 71 in rappbode and 0 49 in hassel pbias values were below 10 for calibration and 20 for validation no3 n concentration shows a typical seasonal cycle with lower concentrations in late summer and high concentration in winter these patterns were more pronounced in hassel than in rappbode and the model could remarkably reproduce these catchment specific features the model showed reasonable performance for tp loading with nse between 0 12 and 0 45 in both catchments during both calibration and validation periods pbias values for both catchments were observed within the satisfactory range 22 to 21 except at hassel during the calibration 40 2 which was attributed to several simulated summer peaks against lower observed values several hydrological events were not captured by the model due to strong areal rainfall variation which was likely not accurately measured by the limited number of precipitation stations consequently lognse values were better than the original nse values nevertheless the model satisfactorily captured the low flow seasonal tp concentration amplitudes with winter lows and summer highs in both catchments and the more pronounced seasonality of tp in hassel than in rappbode the model evaluation for no3 n and tp concentrations also reflects good performance in both catchments with small differences between simulated and observed concentration and pbias ranged 18 31 17 03 for no3 n and 7 34 17 25 for tp table s3 nevertheless we consider the loads more important than concentrations for the impact on the trophic state of the predams and evaluation based on concentration using nse and pbias can be inadequate when the observed values are low and the discrepancy is close to detection limit the uncertainty analysis fig s6 shows small parameter uncertainty bands of discharge no3 n and tp indicating the low uncertainty related to parameter optimization in contrast total uncertainty shows a much larger range suggesting higher uncertainty caused by model structural uncertainties similar patterns were observed for no3 n and tp at both catchments more than 90 of the observed data for discharge no3 n and tp lies in the total uncertainty bands compared to no3 n higher uncertainties were observed for tp due to less observed data for calibration which can be improved by increasing availability of high frequency data taken together uncertainty associated with hype model is acceptable and equifinality of parameterization is unlikely 3 2 projections of catchment dynamics at annually averaged scale the model predicts that discharge in rappbode catchment slightly increases by up to 10 2 fig 3 table 2 due to climate changes and deforestation kw test p 0 01 and the change is significant at rcp6 0 or 8 5 and 50 or 80 deforestation pairwise wilcoxon test p 0 05 multilevel models show that over 90 of variance in annually average discharge is not explained by either climate change or deforestation fig 3f in addition no temporal change is found in discharge under any scenario projection mk test p 0 05 fig s7 for nutrient concentration in the rappbode catchment the model predicts that deforestation is the main driver of changes kw test p 0 001 while climate has no significant direct effect kw test p 0 05 fig 3 table 2 the increase of nutrient concentrations ranged 12 114 under both 50 and 80 deforestation compared to the reference scenario with no deforestation table 2 at 80 deforestation nutrient concentrations in rappbode catchment increase but remained significantly lower than those in hassel under 0 deforestation and discharge will be significantly higher than that in hassel wilcoxon test p 0 001 fig 3 multilevel models further reveal that deforestation explained ca 63 50 and 64 of the variations in no3 n tp and srp concentrations fig 3f similar to discharge pp is not well explained by either factor 95 variance explained by residuals for no3 n there is a significant increasing trend only at rcp8 5 under different deforestations mk test p 0 01 fig s7 for tp and srp a significant increasing trend is detected under each rcp and deforestation scenario mk test p 0 01 for pp no temporal trend is found in any scenario 3 3 reservoir model calibration and validation for both reservoirs simulated water temperature showed high accuracy with rmse below 1 0 c r higher than 0 98 and pbias below 4 in both calibration and validation respectively figs 4 and s8 tables s4 and s5 indicating that the model well captured the thermal dynamics on the vertical dimension in addition the highly variable do dynamics in the epilimnion and the deep water hypoxia were both successfully modeled with r 0 9 and pbias below 30 in rappbode and r 0 8 and pbias below 20 in hassel the model succeeded in predicting the inter and intra annual variations in no3 n with r of 0 55 0 68 and pbias of 15 12 for calibration validation respectively figs 4 s9 s11 and s12 the model performed better during the second validation 2011 2019 only surface data with r 0 9 and pbias about 15 figs s10 and s13 tables s4 and s5 summer depletion of no3 n was nicely captured by the model simulated nh4 n also agreed reasonably with observations the model underestimated the summer nh4 n peaks during calibration the model overall showed an acceptable performance for tn with r higher than 0 5 the model succeeded in grasping the magnitude and variations of tp with r 0 3 and pbias 30 for both calibration and validation despite its low level 0 01 0 03 mg l 1 several tp peaks in both reservoirs were not captured by the model besides the model captured the magnitude of srp which was occasionally above the detection limit 0 003 mg l 1 in rappbode predam during autumn winter and remained mostly undetectable in other seasons in addition silicon concentration was captured in terms of both seasonal variations and inter annual magnitude in both reservoirs with r 0 26 0 39 and pbias around 20 in calibration and validation respectively and better during second validation r 0 8 in rappbode in hassel pbias of simulated silicon was all below 8 the model predicted the magnitude and seasonality of chl a concentration reasonably well in both calibration and validation periods in both reservoirs with r in the range 0 28 0 64 and pbias about 4 30 the general patterns of phytoplankton community composition were nicely modeled with r for cyanobacteria green algae and diatom in the range 0 20 0 78 and pbias ranged 2 3 47 5 the results showed that during 2011 to 2015 diatom and cyanobacteria were the dominant groups while cyanobacteria was more abundant in hassel than rappbode figs 4 and s11 3 4 projections of reservoir ecosystem dynamics for tn no3 n tp srp and pp concentrations in rappbode predam model shows that differences among the deforestation gradients are significant but not among the climate change gradients kw test fig 5

deforestation respectively in lake biogeochemical processes are more important than external inputs resulting in the low explanatory of variance in pp climate change shows no direct contribution to the variations in nutrient concentrations all nutrient concentrations except for pp show a significant increasing trend over the projection period mk test p 0 05 fig s14 the model projections suggest that for chl a concentration three algal biomass and tsi differences among the deforestation gradients are significant but not among the climate change gradients kw test fig 5 table 2 in specific at

total algal biomass taken together 50 and 80 deforestation result in an increase of 5 6 and 9 5 in tsi respectively which ultimately exceed critical threshold of eutrophication 50 indicating the eutrophication in rappbode predam due to deforestation chl a and three algal groups in rappbode at 80 deforestation are still lower than those in hassel wilcoxon test p 0 05 whereas they all approach to a similar level fig 5 furthermore multilevel model shows that deforestation explains less variance in phytoplankton variables 40 63 compared to that for nutrients fig 5 from 2021 to 2035 chl a and

thermocline depth and schmidt stability from 2021 to 2035 fig s16 overall the model projects a shift to eutrophication state in the mesotrophic rappbode predam at 80 deforestation phytoplankton biomass appears to respond to deforestation and climate change in a more diverse pattern than nutrients 4 discussion 4 1 impact of deforestation on catchment dynamics our results on the impact of deforestation on discharge are in line with a few available long term field observations in temperate areas in the rappbode catchment no significantly increased discharge was observed under 17 1 deforestation in 2020 fig s17 si text the extreme drought in 2018 was associated with lower precipitation while the runoff precipitation ratio only fluctuated without clear trends fig s18 beudert et al 2018 pointed out that deforestation rate must exceed a threshold of 20 25 of the total catchment area to be detectable in discharge with precipitation higher than 500 mm y 1 however discharge was found unchanged over 30 years after a 40 deforestation in 2005 in the bavarian forest jung et al 2021 in addition our model projections suggest a slightly increased discharge by 6 8 and 10 2 under 50 and 80 deforestation respectively fig 3 table 2 the low increase of discharge in response to deforestation can be explained by a mixture of competing factors of reduced evapotranspiration from grassland fallow compared to conifer forest fig s19 and increased evaporation of grassland due to loss of the shading by the canopy and an increased evapotranspiration for all vegetation types due to global warming which may reduce the differences in evapotranspiration between the vegetation types no3 n concentration is predicted to increase by 78 9 under 50 deforestation table 2 while it was found doubled in bavarian forest after 40 deforestation jung et al 2021 similar extent of no3 n concentration increase after drastic deforestation was also reported in hubbard brook experimental forest us bormann et al 1974 and plešné national park kopáček et al 2017 our model suggests that the increase in no3 n concentration is mainly due to reduced no3 n uptake by tree vegetation and thereby lower n storage in the catchment in combination with lower transpiration this leads to increased soil moisture and no3 n increasing leaching from the soil after deforestation compared to n the increase in p after deforestation was less pronounced the dominant change occurred in srp and tp whereas pp was only slightly affected the projected increase of srp in the rappbode catchment under 80 deforestation 85 4 is consistent with that in the plešné national park where srp concentration in the streams increased by 50 100 after deforestation kopáček et al 2017 our model suggests that the lower p plant uptake in combination with slightly elevated soil moisture and related dissolution of p from soil increases soluble p availability an increasing srp availability due to higher water table and soil moisture can also be supported by associated changing redox conditions kopáček et al 2017 which is not explicitly considered by our model intriguingly suspended pp only slightly increased after deforestation because dense grassland vegetation sheltered the soil surface and prevents soil loss due to upland erosion which was explicitly modeled by hype continuous monitoring data from the rappbode catchment outlet partially confirm the consistent changing trends with model projections see si text fig s17 existing monitoring is proceeded to trace the change in the years to come 4 2 impact of deforestation on reservoirs we provide concrete evidence of noteworthy potential of reservoirs water quality deterioration by deforestation the projected eutrophication in the downstream reservoir rappbode resulted in a higher production of algal biomass fig 5 particularly at 80 deforestation scenario meanwhile the influence of warming induced lake physical changes huisman et al 2018 acts as a secondary role in driving the phytoplankton development figs s16 and s20 the magnitude of increase in cyanobacteria 21 36 in response to deforestation is in line with a recent global projection until 2050 20 30 in which both climate and anthropogenically driven land use changes are found to be associated with algal biomass increase kakouei et al 2021 interestingly cyanobacteria increased less than the other groups in relative terms fig 5 cyanobacteria can be generally regarded as more competitive under nutrient limitation especially n limitation than the other groups accordingly although cyanobacteria increased the most in absolute terms due to higher nutrient levels the degree of nutrient limitation decreased and consequently so did the competitive advantage of cyanobacteria allowing the diatoms and green algae to increase in biomass more in relative terms this is evident in the strong correlation of nutrients with diatoms and green algae but weaker correlation with cyanobacteria fig s20 nevertheless the response of the algal composition to nutrient enrichment is difficult to generalize and likely occurs more at the species level kong et al 2021 shatwell et al 2013 rather than in the broad taxonomic groups overall together with the findings from catchment modeling showing a higher impact of deforestation than climate change fig 3 our results emphasize the need to focus more on catchment land use changes particularly by climate change in the near future for downstream lakes reservoirs water quality intriguingly variations in the phytoplankton projections are not as well explained by the climate and deforestation factors 40 63 as those for the nutrient variables 70 82 excluding pp fig 5 controlling factors beyond climate and deforestation such as top down effect of grazing and competition between macrophytes and phytoplankton may also play a crucial role in mediating the phytoplankton development in future scenarios rousso et al 2020 hence projections on phytoplankton can be accurately achieved when both external forcing and process based models accounting for internal ecological descriptions in the lake reservoir are available which is exemplified in the present study we deem that the findings in the current study can be relevant for many other similar catchment reservoir systems in temperate regions catchment reservoir systems are widely distributed particularly in natural temperate forested areas van wijk et al 2021 due to an increasing frequency of droughts projected in the future hari et al 2020 we envision an increasing deforestation risk which may exert profound impacts on forest ecosystems and corresponding surface waters like rivers lakes and reservoirs by stimulating matter flux from the catchments our results therefore call for a more comprehensive evaluation of deforestation combining both catchment and ecosystem level dynamics in the receiving stagnant waters 4 3 merits and limitations of the coupled modeling approach our model coupling benefits vastly from the recent development of both catchment and aquatic ecosystem process based models janssen et al 2019 rode et al 2010 moreover our modeling approach distinguished from the existing studies because we coupled catchment and reservoir models at a process based level and validated the model across a period with rapid changes such model coupling requires a detailed configuration calibration validation and projection procedures and harmonized teamwork in both compartments despite emerging tools such as qwet nielsen et al 2021 insights from both catchment and lake expertises are eternally essential in addition our model was calibrated and validated against field observations of 10 years 2010 2019 covering a period with rapid change due to climate warming and deforestation figs 2 s10 and s13 therefore our study showcases the capacity of process based models in capturing ecosystems dynamics under changing external conditions which enhances the reliability of the future projections in addition we developed the coupled model in two adjacent reservoir systems with distinct ecological states we propose that it is valuable to conduct an ensemble sites approach that is to develop one process based model with identical parameters to multiple similar catchment lake systems to prove transferability of the underlying model system the parameter set of the catchment model is applicable for both natural and agricultural dominant catchments while the parameter set of the reservoir model represents both meso trophic and eutrophic states of reservoirs covering a wide gradient of catchment reservoir systems for example the two catchments largely differ in land use but both are well simulated for discharge using the same land use related parameters which gives us strong confidence in the reliability of land use dependent evapotranspiration parameters in addition the model is able to reflect decisive ecosystem characteristics not only to the timing and magnitude of single variables but also to important key properties the simulations showed a more eutrophic state for hassel compared to rappbode reflected by nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton biomass and composition the shift from diatoms towards cyanobacteria with increasing phosphorus supply is a key feature along the eutrophication gradient such comparative studies turn out to be insightful with respect to identifying fundamental principles e g by using reference states carpenter et al 2011 or by comparing gradients of environmental drivers on ecological processes jeppesen et al 2020 in conclusion we suggest incorporating such a comparative limnological perspective more in the future modeling practice to improve trust in the model validity for projection nevertheless the current catchment modeling approach has limitations because the transient deforestation is missing and unlinked to climate change in the catchment modeling the deforestation scenarios 50 and 80 are currently modeled as a sudden shift in the land use whereas such a process is more progressive in reality for example no3 n concentration was found to increase immediately after deforestation or lagging one growing season but generally peaks in 5 7 years after deforestation jung et al 2021 schmidt et al 2021 thus we are modeling the worst case scenario and cautions are needed when linking model projections to management practice in addition the deforestation scenarios are not causally linked to climate change further studies are expected to incorporate more terrestrial dynamics in the catchment modeling to capture the delay in stream nutrient level changes moreover reforestation will take place after the deforestation which again is a transient process and specific reforestation management options will lead to deviating forest developments and associated nutrient export to fluvial and stagnant waters for future modeling approach we recommend the coupling of a forest growth model bugmann et al 2019 with the catchment nutrient export model lastly deforestation may increase the sensitivity of discharge to extreme precipitation events at sub daily scale unfortunately due to the limitation in the spatial context of precipitation data and the daily time step of the model extreme events could only be partly captured by hype thus a few extreme nutrient peaks are not well captured within the calibration and validation period fig 2 which opens the opportunity for further improvement based on increasing data availability and finer model resolution 4 4 implications for climate impact on reservoirs a time scale dependent framework our analyses underscore the need for revisiting our current focus in understanding the external drivers of lake reservoir ecosystems in a time scale dependent framework recent studies highlight the pronounced direct impact of climate changes till 2100 in temperature and mixing regime woolway and merchant 2019 lake oxygen jane et al 2021 and thermal habitat kraemer et al 2021 however such changes require at least decades in the future to become detectable our study reveals that in a shorter time scale i e 1 2 decades changes in catchment land use such as deforestation will likely lead to eutrophication in the reservoirs while the direct impacts of climate change remained limited this is the key interpretation of our work and thus lays a foundation for a field of research related to climate change impact studies indirect impacts from climate change are likely to be much more profound than the direct impacts in the next 1 2 decades this state also points to extreme events which have the potential to change whole ecosystems within a reasonable short time in addition to deforestation other processes may turn out to be of similar importance e g loss of key species or invasion of new ones bell et al 2021 groundwater drawdowns and accompanying habitat loss of aquatic ecosystems rinke et al 2021 therefore we advocate a timescale dependent framework to tackle the climate change impact on the catchment reservoir systems fig 6 in which both short term indirect impacts and long term direct impacts are summarized specifically in the time scale of next 1 2 decades indirect effects of climate change on lake reservoirs via catchment changes would be dominant calling for a focus on catchment and improved nutrient management practice on a longer time scale up to 2100 increasing direct impact from climate change are expected particularly in the worst scenario rcp8 5 woolway et al 2020 in parallel with more severe changes in the catchments e g deforestation at this stage both catchment management and climate adaptation strategies in downstream reservoirs such as selective withdrawal strategy mi et al 2020 and optimum water transport zhan et al 2021 will be highly recommended 5 conclusions the present study demonstrates that deforestation in temperate natural catchments results in an increased nutrient loading and can ultimately turn downstream mesotrophic reservoirs into a eutrophic state the enhanced nutrient loading n and p to the reservoirs after deforestation is attributed predominantly to the increasing nutrient concentration in the streams due to lower nutrient storage and uptake higher nutrient concentration in soil water and raised soil nutrient leaching in the catchments but marginally to the increasing discharge our results highlight the predominant indirect effect of climate change on lakes reservoirs via changing land use and catchment nutrient loading in the next 10 20 years direct effects of climate change on lakes reservoirs remain limited compared to indirect catchment effects in this short term scale but may become increasingly significant in the long run due to enhanced profound changes in thermal dynamics as a modeling approach the present study exemplifies the joint strength of coupled catchment and lake reservoir process based model in elucidating the complex causality chain from climate change to catchment reservoir ecosystems the unique dual system in this study site demonstrates the enormous value of comparative studies to improve the robustness of numerical model projections finally we propose to evaluate the climate change impact on lakes reservoirs under an updated framework with time scale dependency i e prioritizing the implementation of adaptation strategies in the upstream catchment in the near future and in the reservoir

15723,the presence and or coating of natural colloids e g clays and metal oxides or hydroxides on collector surfaces has frequently been demonstrated to enhance the retention of engineered colloids that are negatively charged due to favorable electrostatic interactions however this work demonstrates that the presence of natural clay coating can lead to reduced or nonmonotonic retention of micro and nanoplastics mnps column experiments were carried out to systematically investigate the transport of mnps with different sizes in relatively smooth and rough sands that had various clay coating fractions these coating fractions on the collector were found to significantly influence mnp retention in a complex manner that changed with the colloid size and the roughness properties of the sand this observation was attributed to the impact of clay coatings on the roughness and morphology properties of collector surfaces that were dominant over surface charge scanning electron microscopy and interaction energy calculations on surfaces with pillars or valleys indicate that mechanisms that contributed to mnp retention changed with the colloid size in particular retention of nanosized plastics was mainly controlled by interactions on convex concave locations that changed with the solution chemistry whereas microsized plastics were also strongly influenced by the applied hydrodynamic torque and straining processes additionally the significant sensitivity of mnp retention under a low level ionic strength also reflects the importance of roughness and charge heterogeneities these observations are important for investigating the mechanisms of colloid transport in natural systems that ubiquitously exhibit clay coating on their surfaces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micro and nanoplastics natural clays grain surface roughness particle size transport 1 introduction the transport of engineered nanoparticles enps in porous media has attracted considerable research attention due to its relevance to environmental and industrial processes e g the fate of colloids in the subsurface deep bed filtration and riverbank filtration to date numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of enp transport in natural and or model porous media that represent subsurface environments fazeli sangani et al 2018 natural colloid is a key factor that differentiates physicochemical properties of natural and model porous media systems metal oxides or hydroxides are typical colloids that are associated with soil grains iron oxyhydroxides or goethite coatings on pure quartz have therefore been frequently used to deduce the influence of soil colloids on enp transport abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 enhanced retention of negatively charged enps has always been observed on these metal related coatings because of the increase in favorable electrostatic interactions and or alternations in surface roughness abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 for similar reasons the presence of soil colloids has also been considered to increase enp retention compared with pure quartz systems sagee et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 cornelis et al 2013 petosa et al 2013 mahdi et al 2018 it has been widely acknowledged that collector surface roughness and charge heterogeneity are critical to the interaction energy between enps and the solid water interface suresh and walz 1996 hoek et al 2003 hoek and agarwal 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2013 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 these physicochemical heterogeneities tend to enhance retention by locally reducing or eliminating the energy barrier to the primary minimum bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 additionally the relative sizes of both colloid and roughness charge heterogeneity contribute to the interaction between a colloid and the surface jin et al 2015a 2015b for example when a colloid is much larger than the size of a nanoscale heterogeneity the adhesion can be more susceptible to the influence of the particle size because of changes in the number of contacts between the particle and surface katainen et al 2006 a smaller colloid may also show a greater ability to diffuse into a crack or scratch on a surface stoll et al 2016 previous studies have also indicated that surface roughness can be dominant over other surface heterogeneities arising from charge hydrophobicity or van der waals interaction bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 liang et al 2021 roughness conditions associated with surface morphology can strongly influence the tendency and reversibility of colloid retention for example reduced energy barriers may occur at convex areas on a surface that facilitate the detachment of retained colloids from collector surface via hydrodynamic shear and or diffusion pazmino et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 in contrast deeper primary minima can be produced at concave locations leading to irreversible retention li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the relative importance of roughness to charge heterogeneity will depend on the sizes and amounts of nanoscale heterogeneities the colloid size and solution and solid phase chemistries bradford and torkzaban 2013 bradford et al 2018 shen et al 2018 contrary to conventional observations that exhibit enhanced retention of negative enps with the presence of typical mineral colloids abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 or soil colloids sagee et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 cornelis et al 2013 petosa et al 2013 mahdi et al 2018 limited publications implied a tendency of reduced retention due to decreased roughness of soil grains when concave locations on grain surface are partially filled by attached soil colloids liang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 additionally this retention may not be proportional to the number of attached colloids due to the potential coupled effects of altered roughness and charge heterogeneity of collector surfaces arisen from soil colloids and co existing pollutants xu et al 2021 the role of natural soil colloids on the transport and retention mechanisms of enps are still largely unknown note that polystyrene micro and nanoplastics mnps have been widely used as model colloids to study transport behavior in the past few decades roy and dzombak 1996 grolimund et al 1998 bradford et al 2009 molnar et al 2015 torkzaban and bradford 2016 ron et al 2019 li et al 2020 they have also been intensively used to study the transport of typical plastics dong et al 2018 chu et al 2019 keller et al 2020 tong et al 2020a 2020b he et al 2021 which are emerging pollutants because of their potential adverse effects on ecosystems alimi et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge rare information has been reported concerning the coupled roles of raw collector surface roughness the modification by natural clays and particle size on colloid transport the corresponding retention mechanisms involved are far from being fully understood therefore this study aims to reveal the role of natural clays that physicochemically modify collector surfaces and the essential association with particle size on the transport of mnps in particular quartz sands with different surface roughness properties were used as porous media that were modified by clays with different mass ratios to obtain variations in the surface physicochemical heterogeneities clays were used to represent natural surface heterogeneities for better predicting the transport behavior in real systems different sized mnps were selected to deduce the potential coupled role of surface heterogeneities and sensitivity of particle size to retention xdlvo calculations for mnps and collectors were conducted to better understand the mechanisms involved in retention processes findings from this study provide novel insight into mechanisms controlling the transport and retention of colloidal contaminants e g mnps and enps in engineered and natural environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 micro and nanoplastics spherical polystyrene mnps with diameters of 50 500 and 2000 nm suzhou mylife advanced material technology co ltd china were used as model colloids to minimize chemical heterogeneity of particle surfaces and to visualize the interactions of particles with grain surfaces at micro and or nanoscales particle suspensions for each experiment were freshly prepared by diluting a raw concentrated suspension into nacl solutions to achieve an approximate concentration of 10 mg l 1 for the particles and then sonicated for 15 min in a sonication bath mnp concentration was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer shimadzu rf 5301pc japan with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 666 nm zeta potentials and hydrodynamic diameters of the mnps in selected solution chemistries were measured using a zetasizer apparatus nano zs90 malvern instruments worcestershire u k 2 2 solution chemistry and porous media electrolyte solutions were prepared by dissolving nacl in ultrapure water and then diluting in selected ionic strength is of 0 5 or 1 0 mm the unadjusted ph values of these solutions were around 6 5 the porous media that were employed in column experiments consisted of commercial pure quartz with a relatively smooth surface or natural quartz with pronounced surface roughness made from purified clay free soil the former was purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china while the latter was obtained from loamy sand soil collected from the b horizon in southern china 24 59 n 111 18 e by washing off soil colloids liang et al 2021 a series of treatments were applied to minimize the surface chemical heterogeneity before the sands were packed into columns these treatments consisted of sequentially boiling in 65 hno3 and 10 h2o2 liang et al 2013 sieving to a size range of 300 to 600 μm and then coating by natural soil colloids the natural soil colloids mainly consisted of clays that were extracted from the loamy sand soil by sieving through a 200 mesh sieve the coating of clays on sand surfaces was performed using an approach similar to scheidegger et al 1993 that was developed to coat quartz sand with goethite briefly selected amounts of clay 5 12 5 25 or 50 g were added in 10 mm kno3 solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 5 by incrementally adding hno3 the soil colloid suspension was then shaken at 150 rpm min 1 for 24 h at room temperature after that 250 g of the purified sand was mixed with the treated suspension of clays and then shaken later the mixture was sequentially washed using 100 mm kno3 cation exchange and deionized water is reduction to remove unattached colloids finally the modified sand was dried in an oven at 50 c the treated sands are denoted herein using the mass ratios of clays to sand during the coating processes as 0 no clay 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 it should be noted that a large portion of clay particles was not attached to the grain surfaces and was washed out so only small fractions with small sizes were susceptible to being attached on sand surfaces characterizations and properties of the sands clays and clay coated sands included zeta potential chemical analysis for the surface sio2 percentages of the clay coated sand surface roughness n2 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and total organic carbon toc these methods were described in section 1 of the supporting information si 2 3 column experiments 2 3 1 transport experiments water saturated column experiments were performed following protocols outlined in liang et al 2013 stainless steel columns with a length of 12 cm and a diameter of 3 cm were employed the columns were wet packed with purified quartz without or with clay coatings the porosities of packed columns were determined gravimetrically a peristaltic pump was used to introduce the mnp suspensions and colloid free electrolyte solutions upward into the vertical column at a constant darcy velocity of 0 7 cm min 1 the columns were initially conditioned with at least 30 pore volumes pvs of a background electrolyte solution tracer experiments were also performed to test the homogeneity of the columns as described in section 1 of the si transport experiments were then conducted by injecting a 100 ml pulse of particle suspension into columns followed by elution with 100 ml of colloid free background solution the same is ph and darcy velocity were used for conditioning and transport experiments effluent samples were continuously collected using a fraction collector and mnp concentrations were determined using the fluorescence spectrophotometer to obtain breakthrough curves btcs to test the reproducibility some experimental conditions were repeated including cleaning of the quartz soil surface modification by soil colloids and column transport experiments under the same solution chemistries experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 2 4 theory calculations of the interaction energy or force between the mnps and collector surfaces were conducted to better understand the mechanisms that contributed to the retention under experimental solution chemistries details for these calculations are described in section 2 in the si micro and nanoscale surface morphology was represented as either concave locations or pillars interaction force maps were calculated for mnps in concave locations the concave locations were represented in these calculations as planes that intersect at selected angles the roughness height and fraction of pillars within the zone of adhesive influence were considered for interaction energy calculations the depths of the primary φ1min and secondary φ2min minima and the energy barrier height φbar were obtained by analyzing the interaction energy profiles a maxwellian energy balance approach shen et al 2007 was employed to estimate the value of the sticking efficiency in the primary minimum α1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of particles and porous media the hydrodynamic diameters d p of mnps are presented in fig s1 and table s1 the d p of mnps is slightly larger when the is 1 0 mm than 0 5 mm but suspensions are stable when the is 10 mm zeta potentials of mnps equal 18 3 and 11 4 mv when the is 0 5 and 1 mm respectively smooth and rough quartz sand grains were employed in mnp transport studies the physical and chemical properties of these purified sands have been extensively characterized previously liang et al 2020 2021 the zeta potentials of the rough 56 3 and 60 4 mv and smooth 60 5 and 64 3 mv sands are very similar when the is were 0 5 and 1 0 mm table s1 which confirms similar amounts of charge heterogeneity conversely scanning electron microscopy sem and laser confocal scanning microscopy lcsm images demonstrate significant differences in surface roughness between the relatively smooth figs s2a and s4a and rough quartz sand figs s3a and s4b in this research the fate of mnps was studied in smooth and rough quartz sand grains with different fractions 0 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 of clay coatings on their surfaces the distributions of clays with different mass fractions on the surfaces of smooth and rough sands are shown in figs s2 and s3 respectively the chemical analysis shows larger amounts of al and fe and lower amounts of sio2 as the clay fraction increases table s2 the decreasing quartz fraction and increase in elements e g fe al ca and mg with the clay fraction also indicate greater clay coverage on the quartz surfaces the relative percentages of the main elements analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds indicate good uniformity of the clay coating at different sites on a surface table s3 compared with the quartz sands the clays are less negatively charged have higher concentrations of metal elements and lower sio2 percentages tables s1 and s2 these observations indicate that charge heterogeneity is expected to increase with the mass fraction of clays on sand surfaces the toc values for all the coated and uncoated sands are lower than 0 1 g kg 1 due to the low clay fraction 0 20 attached to grain surfaces and the loss of organic compounds when the clays were soaked in liquid during the coating process the n2 bet surface areas table s2 of the smooth quartz with and without clay coatings ranged from 0 059 0 107 m2 g 1 whereas the values for the rough sand are much higher 0 869 1 195 m2 g 1 due to more pronounced surface roughness see sem images in figs s2 and s3 generally the presence of clays slightly increased the surface area of the smooth sand and tended to reduce that of the rough sand e g the surface area of sand with the highest clay fraction compared to those without clay however the presence of clays did not produce a significant difference in the surface areas of the sands mainly due to the small clay fractions that produced thin layers on the surfaces these results indicate that most of this surface area came from the quartz sand the surface roughness properties determined by lcsm generally indicate that the presence of clay coatings increased the roughness of smooth sand and tended to reduce the roughness of rough sand fig s4 and table s4 the porosities of packed columns were in a very narrow range of 0 465 0 479 and did not show a consistent trend with the mass of clay coating examples of tracer btcs obtained from columns with and without the clay coating displayed negligible difference as shown in fig s5 this information indicates that the presence of clay does not make a large difference in the porosity and hydraulic conditions in columns but did create a thin layer with micro or nanoscale heterogeneities that was much smaller than the grain size 3 2 mnp retention on sands with different clay fractions fig 1 and table 1 present btcs and the retained mass of

to reduce particle transport abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 sagee et al 2012 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 cornelis et al 2013 petosa et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 mahdi et al 2018 this decreased mobility has been attributed to the increasing amounts of micro or nanosized locations with positive or less negative charges e g charge heterogeneity on collector surfaces in contrast the retained mass of mnps in this study exhibits a monotonic decrease from 47 1 to 19 1 in the rough sand when the clay fraction increases from 0 to 0 2 fig 1a b different from the results for the rough sand the retained mass exhibits a nonmonotonic trend in the smooth sand with increasing clay fractions fig 1a c specifically the mass of retained mnps increases from 28 1 to 45 1 and then decreases back to 30 9 when the clay fraction increases from 0 pure sand 0 05 to 0 2 respectively table 1 note that results from these column experiments exhibit good reproducibility fig s6 and the mass recoveries in the effluent show small standard deviations less than 5 so these trends in mnp retention with clay fractions are not experimental artifacts clay coatings on collector surfaces can significantly alter the charge heterogeneity and surface roughness clays can create charge heterogeneity from their positive less negative surfaces that contribute to enhanced retention of negative colloids abudalo et al 2005 bradford and torkzaban 2013 petosa et al 2013 wang et al 2017 for example the amounts of typical clay elements al mg fe and ca increased and the surfaces of coated sands tended to be less negative with increasing mass of clays in coated sands tables s1 and s2 results from column studies showed decreasing retention on rough sand and nonmonotonic retention on smooth sand with increasing clay fraction these observations are contradictory to the prediction of enhanced retention as charge heterogeneity from the attached clay fraction increased consequently the modification of surface roughness by clay coating provides an alternative explanation small clay fractions tend to create both convex asperities and concave locations on smooth surfaces e g aside clay asperities and between clay asperities increasing the clay fraction on the smooth sand can initially increase roughness by creating asperities and then eventually fill concave locations to smoothen the surface when the clay fraction 0 2 fig s2 in the absence of clay the rough sand fig s3a exhibits much more concave sites than the smooth sand fig s2a the depths of concave valleys can be reduced filled or turned into protruding asperities by the presence of clay on the rough sand fig s3b c a quantitative interpretation of retention mechanisms is dependent on a multitude of factors including micro and nanoscopic roughness distributions of concave and convex sites charge heterogeneity solution chemistry pore size and geometry colloid concentration clay geometry and coating and velocity distributions that need to be resolved at the pore and interface scales a pore network model is able to mechanistically determine colloid retention mechanisms lin et al 2021a 2021b lin et al 2022 but it is a simplification of the full complexity of natural pore media and presently does not consider the role of clay coatings xdlvo calculations for convex table s5 and concave figs s7 and s8 asperities provide a plausible qualitative explanation for 50 nm mnp retention under various collector surface roughness and morphology note that secondary minima are too shallow to be a major contributor to mnp retention under these low is 0 5 and 1 mm conditions both concave and convex locations can reduce or eliminate energy barriers bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 however the primary minimum depth can be increased at concave locations leading to irreversible interactions shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 whereas primary minima are shallower at convex sites and more susceptible to removal by hydrodynamic forces or diffusion treumann et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin et al 2021b diffusing colloids experience random energy fluctuations that can allow them to overcome energy barriers that are smaller than about 8 kt e g bradford and torkzaban 2015 table s5 indicates that some convex roughness conditions reduced the energy barrier sufficiently to allow them to enter and be retained in a primary minimum the xdlvo calculations show that an increase in roughness fraction results in nonmonotonic trends of sticking efficiency α1 in the primary minima table s5 predicting a nonmonotonic alteration of mnp retention on pillar tops with the roughness fraction similar to the observed trend in mnp retention on smooth sand with increasing clay coating the predicted maximum amount of colloid retention occurs for small roughness fractions torkzaban and bradford 2016 this nonmonotonic variation of colloid attachment with convex site fraction has been theoretically indicated in previous publications bradford et al 2017 fig s9 presents the retention at convex locations on a clay coated surface additionally the energy barrier is absent at the bottom of valleys figs s7 and s8 indicating that these locations are favorable for retention attachment of natural clays at concave locations in rough sand fig s3 decreases the favorable valley areas and therefore reduces mnp retention as the clay fraction increases 3 3 coupled effects of sand surface roughness and clay coating with particle size fig 2 a b present the retention of different sizes of mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough and relatively smooth sand respectively without 0 and with clay coatings 0 2 corresponding btcs are shown in fig 2c d retention of mnps exhibits a complex dependency on the particle size that changes with the sand roughness which is influenced by the presence of clay coating mnp retention increases with increasing particle size in both sands without clay coatings however the influence of clay coating on mnp retention had different effects with particle size in rough and smooth sand in clay coated rough sand mnp retention slightly decreased with increasing particle size in contrast the retention in clay coated smooth sand exhibited a nonmonotonic dependency on the particle size with maximum retention occurring when the particle size was 500 nm clay coating diminished mnp retention for all particle sizes in the rough sand in contrast the coating produced similar greater and less retention in smooth sand when the particle size was 50 500 and 2000 nm respectively these results clearly show that the dependency of mnp retention on particle size significantly changes with the sand roughness and clay coating several factors may contribute to the observations shown in fig 2a b including differences in the mass transfer rate the applied hydrodynamic torque and interaction energies in the presence of sand roughness and clay coating each of these topics will be discussed below filtration theory is usually employed to predict the dependency of particle size on the mass transfer rate of a colloid to a collector surface yao et al 1971 the calculated single collector contact efficiency η messina et al 2015 for mnps in the employed porous media is predicted to decrease monotonically with increasing colloid size e g 50 500 and 2000 nm mnps have an η equal to 0 061 0 0104 and 0 0081 respectively the applied hydrodynamic torque will increase with the cubic of the particle radius on a smooth surface goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 consequently both differences in the mass transfer rate and the applied hydrodynamic torque will result in less colloid retention for a larger colloid size under the same chemical interactions these predictions follow the same retention trend as rough sand with clay coating but are not consistent with experimental observations in sands without clay coating or smooth sand with clay coating fig 2 similarly sem and lcsm images figs s3c and s4b show that the clay coating on rough sand creates a relatively smooth surface that would reduce retention increasing retention with greater particle size has previously been attributed to increased surface straining at microscopic roughness locations due to the alteration of lever arms for applied and resisting torques torkzaban and bradford 2016 and pore straining processes due to sieving and hydrodynamic bridging bradford et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 dong et al 2018 lin et al 2021b these observations indicate that surface and or pore straining processes can provide a possible explanation for increasing mnp retention with particle size on sands in the absence of clay colloids fig 2a b ripening can occur when diffusion or hydrodynamic forces overcome the repulse energy barrier bradford and torkzaban 2015 perez et al 2020 this can be facilitated by nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity on colloid surfaces that reduce the energy barrier surface straining was apparently reduced in the clay coated rough sand due to filling of roughness and concave locations that would otherwise enhance retention by altering level arms the influence of concave and convex locations on the retention of 50 nm mnps was already discussed in section 3 2 however the effects of surface morphology on interaction energy and colloid retention change with the particle size chen et al 2010 jin et al 2015b large colloids may be physically excluded from entering some of the concave sites sem images shown in fig s10 indicate that interactions in concave sites occur only when these valleys are large enough for mnps fig s11 indicates that attached clays at concave locations decrease the availability of large mnps for retention several authors have reported that alterations of solution chemistry produce less mnp release for smaller than larger particles torkzaban and bradford 2016 this implies that smaller particles are mainly associated with concave sites that are irreversible whereas larger particles can also reversibly interact on convex asperities clay coating can create small convex sites that contribute to retention in a nonmonotonic fashion in some cases i e results for smooth sand with clay coating in fig s12 the above information indicates that the slight decrease in particle retention with increasing mnp size on the rough sand with clay coating fig 2a likely reflects the combined influence of mass transfer retention on convex asperities less retention in concave sites and increasing hydrodynamic removal with larger particle sizes this may also explain the decreasing amounts of retention in the presence than the absence of clay coating in rough sand the nonmonotonic retention with increasing mnp size in smooth sand with clay coating fig 2b can likely be attributed to the influence of convex asperities on interaction energy profiles discussed in section 3 2 increases in applied hydrodynamic torque with particle size and size exclusion at some concave sites the mnp retention was maximum at 500 nm in clay coated smooth sand fig 2b because the hydrodynamic conditions allowed for attachment at some convex sites e g clay particles can form multiple contacts that are stable fig s13 it should be mentioned that clay modified sand exhibits greater amounts of charge heterogeneity than sands without clay coatings however clay coated sand frequently exhibits less mnp retention than uncoated sand fig 2a b e g mnps with all the tested sizes in rough sand and with 2000 nm in smooth sand even though the zeta potential of the clay coated sand was less negative charge heterogeneity therefore cannot explain the observed retention trends in fig 2 note that the uncoated sands were treated to remove charge heterogeneities and this may partially explain these results although chemical heterogeneity was not the primary cause for the observed trends of mnp transport its influence should not be entirely excluded for example increased chemical heterogeneity due to the clay coating may increase the tendency of attachment on convex locations and thus reduce the chance for retention in valley areas with deep primary minimum 3 4 mnp retention for different sand roughness clay coating and is fig 3 a b show the retention of different sizes of mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough and relatively smooth sand respectively in the absence of clay coating when the is equals 0 5 and 1 mm corresponding btcs are shown in fig 3c d the results were previously explained in section 3 3 for the is 0 5 mm data and were mainly attributed to nanoscale surface roughness for 50 nm mnps and surface and or pore straining processes for larger mnps an increase in is from 0 5 to 1 0 mm enhanced the mnp retention for all particle sizes both is conditions exhibited a similar trend of increasing retention with larger particle sizes however the increase in is had a much larger effect for smaller than larger mnps an increase in is tends to compress the double layer thickness and reduce colloid transport the secondary minimum is negligible at the considered is but the height of the energy barrier is diminished when the is 1 0 mm retention at convex asperities is therefore expected to increase with the is shen et al 2018 li et al 2020 consistent with experimental observations this effect is reported to be enhanced for smaller than larger mnps because of smaller energy barriers and lower hydrodynamic forces torkzaban and bradford 2016 conversely concave sites are reported to be independent of is shen et al 2018 li et al 2020 similarly straining processes are expected to be relatively insensitive to changes in is when the secondary minimum is negligible this finding is supported by the smaller differences in retention at both is conditions with the 2000 nm mnps ripening formation of surface dendrites was also observed for 500 and 2000 nm mnps on the rough sand when the is 1 0 mm and this likely contributed to straining processes bradford et al 2006 fig 4 shows the retention and btcs for different sized mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough a and c and smooth b and d sands that were coated by clays when the is 0 5 and 1 0 mm results for this data when the is 0 5 mm were previously discussed in section 3 3 in brief clay coatings on rough and smooth sands diminished straining and retention at concave locations so that retention was mainly controlled by convex sites and the applied hydrodynamic torque an increase in the is from 0 5 to 1 0 mm produced greater retention on both sands with clay coatings similar to fig 3 a higher is 1 0 mm lowers the energy barrier compression of the double layer thickness and enhances mpn retention in primary minimum on some convex sites mpn retention frequently exhibits a non monotonic trend with increasing particle size e g smooth sand with clay coating at both is and rough sand with clay coating when the is 1 mm due to differences in interaction energy profiles on rough surfaces and the applied hydrodynamic torque retention of 50 nm mnps is mainly controlled by convex sites because of lower energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torques conversely retention of 2000 nm mnps can happen by surface and or pore straining processes because of larger energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torques goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 bradford et al 2002 lin et al 2021b furthermore surface and pore straining processes can be enhanced by colloid colloid interactions that produce ripening for example ripening occurred for 500 and 2000 nm mnps when the is 1 0 mm on the smooth sand with clay coating the 500 nm mnps can sometimes exhibit the most retention because it is influenced both by nanoscale roughness at convex sites and intermediate values of the applied hydrodynamic torque that allow attachment it should be noted that these mnps are efficiently removed by collector surfaces even under relatively low is conditions complete retention of these mnps is therefore expected to occur under higher is conditions that are more typical of groundwater and this would diminish or eliminate the sensitivity of mnp retention to surface roughness and particle size however colloid retention is expected to still be sensitive to surface roughness and particle size at higher solution is when colloids have similar amounts of removal 4 conclusion this study illustrates that sand roughness and clay coatings significantly alter the magnitudes and mechanisms of colloid and nanoparticle retention in porous media and these factors change with the solution is and particle size in a complex manner the retention of mnps with increasing particle size exhibited decreasing increasing or nonmonotonic trends depending on the sand roughness clay coating and or solution is a number of factors contributed to observed mnp retention behavior including attachment at convex and concave sites and surface and or pore straining processes due to alternation of interaction energy profiles and applied hydrodynamic torques clay coatings tended to fill concave sites on rough sand and created convex sites on the relatively smooth sand mnp retention occurred at convex sites on relatively smooth sands with clay coatings especially for higher is and for smaller mnp sizes due to lower energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torque convex sites were more important for smaller sized mnps 50 nm and for relatively rough sand larger mnp sizes 500 and 2000 nm are associated with greater applied hydrodynamic torques and are therefore more susceptible to surface straining processes that alter lever arms at microscopic roughness locations and pore straining processes when ripening happens this study shows that the sand surface morphology and roughness dominantly controlled particle retention over charge heterogeneity from clay coatings on retention behavior our findings suggest that the surface roughness and particle size will strongly influence retention in subsurface environments when colloid removal is low enough this study highlights the critical role of natural clays on the environmental fate of colloids in the subsurface environment findings in this study imply that the influence of natural clay coatings changes with the solution chemistry and particle size surface roughness modification by ubiquitously occurring clays or colloids will significantly influence the removal of colloidal contaminants in environmental or industrial applications e g riverbank filtration and sand filtration for surface water or wastewater purification it also implies that engineering approaches

15723,the presence and or coating of natural colloids e g clays and metal oxides or hydroxides on collector surfaces has frequently been demonstrated to enhance the retention of engineered colloids that are negatively charged due to favorable electrostatic interactions however this work demonstrates that the presence of natural clay coating can lead to reduced or nonmonotonic retention of micro and nanoplastics mnps column experiments were carried out to systematically investigate the transport of mnps with different sizes in relatively smooth and rough sands that had various clay coating fractions these coating fractions on the collector were found to significantly influence mnp retention in a complex manner that changed with the colloid size and the roughness properties of the sand this observation was attributed to the impact of clay coatings on the roughness and morphology properties of collector surfaces that were dominant over surface charge scanning electron microscopy and interaction energy calculations on surfaces with pillars or valleys indicate that mechanisms that contributed to mnp retention changed with the colloid size in particular retention of nanosized plastics was mainly controlled by interactions on convex concave locations that changed with the solution chemistry whereas microsized plastics were also strongly influenced by the applied hydrodynamic torque and straining processes additionally the significant sensitivity of mnp retention under a low level ionic strength also reflects the importance of roughness and charge heterogeneities these observations are important for investigating the mechanisms of colloid transport in natural systems that ubiquitously exhibit clay coating on their surfaces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micro and nanoplastics natural clays grain surface roughness particle size transport 1 introduction the transport of engineered nanoparticles enps in porous media has attracted considerable research attention due to its relevance to environmental and industrial processes e g the fate of colloids in the subsurface deep bed filtration and riverbank filtration to date numerous studies have been carried out to elucidate the mechanisms of enp transport in natural and or model porous media that represent subsurface environments fazeli sangani et al 2018 natural colloid is a key factor that differentiates physicochemical properties of natural and model porous media systems metal oxides or hydroxides are typical colloids that are associated with soil grains iron oxyhydroxides or goethite coatings on pure quartz have therefore been frequently used to deduce the influence of soil colloids on enp transport abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 enhanced retention of negatively charged enps has always been observed on these metal related coatings because of the increase in favorable electrostatic interactions and or alternations in surface roughness abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 for similar reasons the presence of soil colloids has also been considered to increase enp retention compared with pure quartz systems sagee et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 cornelis et al 2013 petosa et al 2013 mahdi et al 2018 it has been widely acknowledged that collector surface roughness and charge heterogeneity are critical to the interaction energy between enps and the solid water interface suresh and walz 1996 hoek et al 2003 hoek and agarwal 2006 bradford and torkzaban 2013 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 these physicochemical heterogeneities tend to enhance retention by locally reducing or eliminating the energy barrier to the primary minimum bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 additionally the relative sizes of both colloid and roughness charge heterogeneity contribute to the interaction between a colloid and the surface jin et al 2015a 2015b for example when a colloid is much larger than the size of a nanoscale heterogeneity the adhesion can be more susceptible to the influence of the particle size because of changes in the number of contacts between the particle and surface katainen et al 2006 a smaller colloid may also show a greater ability to diffuse into a crack or scratch on a surface stoll et al 2016 previous studies have also indicated that surface roughness can be dominant over other surface heterogeneities arising from charge hydrophobicity or van der waals interaction bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 liang et al 2021 roughness conditions associated with surface morphology can strongly influence the tendency and reversibility of colloid retention for example reduced energy barriers may occur at convex areas on a surface that facilitate the detachment of retained colloids from collector surface via hydrodynamic shear and or diffusion pazmino et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 in contrast deeper primary minima can be produced at concave locations leading to irreversible retention li et al 2017 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 the relative importance of roughness to charge heterogeneity will depend on the sizes and amounts of nanoscale heterogeneities the colloid size and solution and solid phase chemistries bradford and torkzaban 2013 bradford et al 2018 shen et al 2018 contrary to conventional observations that exhibit enhanced retention of negative enps with the presence of typical mineral colloids abudalo et al 2005 foppen et al 2006 kim et al 2008 wang et al 2012 zhang et al 2016 wang et al 2017 lu et al 2021 or soil colloids sagee et al 2012 zhang et al 2012 cornelis et al 2013 petosa et al 2013 mahdi et al 2018 limited publications implied a tendency of reduced retention due to decreased roughness of soil grains when concave locations on grain surface are partially filled by attached soil colloids liang et al 2021 xu et al 2021 additionally this retention may not be proportional to the number of attached colloids due to the potential coupled effects of altered roughness and charge heterogeneity of collector surfaces arisen from soil colloids and co existing pollutants xu et al 2021 the role of natural soil colloids on the transport and retention mechanisms of enps are still largely unknown note that polystyrene micro and nanoplastics mnps have been widely used as model colloids to study transport behavior in the past few decades roy and dzombak 1996 grolimund et al 1998 bradford et al 2009 molnar et al 2015 torkzaban and bradford 2016 ron et al 2019 li et al 2020 they have also been intensively used to study the transport of typical plastics dong

our knowledge rare information has been reported concerning the coupled roles of raw collector surface roughness the modification by natural clays and particle size on colloid transport the corresponding retention mechanisms involved are far from being fully understood therefore this study aims to reveal the role of natural clays that physicochemically modify collector surfaces and the essential association with particle size on the transport of mnps in particular quartz sands with different surface roughness properties were used as porous media that were modified by clays with different mass ratios to obtain variations in the surface physicochemical heterogeneities clays were used to represent natural surface heterogeneities for better predicting the transport behavior in real systems different sized mnps were selected to deduce the potential coupled role of surface heterogeneities and sensitivity of particle size to retention xdlvo calculations for mnps and collectors were conducted to better understand the mechanisms involved in retention processes findings from this study provide novel insight into mechanisms controlling the transport and retention of colloidal contaminants e g mnps and enps in engineered and natural environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 micro and nanoplastics spherical polystyrene mnps with diameters of 50 500 and 2000 nm suzhou mylife advanced material technology co ltd china were used as model colloids to minimize chemical heterogeneity of particle surfaces and to visualize the interactions of particles with grain surfaces at micro and or nanoscales particle suspensions for each experiment were freshly prepared by diluting a raw concentrated suspension into nacl solutions to achieve an approximate concentration of 10 mg l 1 for the particles and then sonicated for 15 min in a sonication bath mnp concentration was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer shimadzu rf 5301pc japan with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission wavelength of 666 nm zeta potentials and hydrodynamic diameters of the mnps in selected solution chemistries were measured using a zetasizer apparatus nano zs90 malvern instruments worcestershire u k 2 2 solution chemistry and porous media electrolyte solutions were prepared by dissolving nacl in ultrapure water and then diluting in selected ionic strength is of 0 5 or 1 0 mm the unadjusted ph values of these solutions were around 6 5 the porous media that were employed in column experiments consisted of commercial pure quartz with a relatively smooth surface or natural quartz with pronounced surface roughness made from purified clay free soil the former was purchased from tianjin guangfu fine chemical research institute china while the latter was obtained from loamy sand soil collected from the b horizon in southern china 24 59 n 111 18 e by washing off soil colloids liang et al 2021 a series of treatments were applied to minimize the surface chemical heterogeneity before the sands were packed into columns these treatments consisted of sequentially boiling in 65 hno3 and 10 h2o2 liang et al 2013 sieving to a size range of 300 to 600 μm and then coating by natural soil colloids the natural soil colloids mainly consisted of clays that were extracted from the loamy sand soil by sieving through a 200 mesh sieve the coating of clays on sand surfaces was performed using an approach similar to scheidegger et al 1993 that was developed to coat quartz sand with goethite briefly selected amounts of clay 5 12 5 25 or 50 g were added in 10 mm kno3 solution and the solution ph was adjusted to 2 5 by incrementally adding hno3 the soil colloid suspension was then shaken at 150 rpm min 1 for 24 h at room temperature after that 250 g of the purified sand was mixed with the treated suspension of clays and then shaken later the mixture was sequentially washed using 100 mm kno3 cation exchange and deionized water is reduction to remove unattached colloids finally the modified sand was dried in an oven at 50 c the treated sands are denoted herein using the mass ratios of clays to sand during the coating processes as 0 no clay 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 it should be noted that a large portion of clay particles was not attached to the grain surfaces and was washed out so only small fractions with small sizes were susceptible to being attached on sand surfaces characterizations and properties of the sands clays and clay coated sands included zeta potential chemical analysis for the surface sio2 percentages of the clay coated sand surface roughness n2 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area and total organic carbon toc these methods were described in section 1 of the supporting information si 2 3 column experiments 2 3 1 transport experiments water saturated column experiments were performed following protocols outlined in liang et al 2013 stainless steel columns with a length of 12 cm and a diameter of 3 cm were employed the columns were wet packed with purified quartz without or with clay coatings the porosities of packed columns were determined gravimetrically a peristaltic pump was used to introduce the mnp suspensions and colloid free electrolyte solutions upward into the vertical column at a constant darcy velocity of 0 7 cm min 1 the columns were initially conditioned with at least 30 pore volumes pvs of a background electrolyte solution tracer experiments were also performed to test the homogeneity of the columns as described in section 1 of the si transport experiments were then conducted by injecting a 100 ml pulse of particle suspension into columns followed by elution with 100 ml of colloid free background solution the same is ph and darcy velocity were used for conditioning and transport experiments effluent samples were continuously collected using a fraction collector and mnp concentrations were determined using the fluorescence spectrophotometer to obtain breakthrough curves btcs to test the reproducibility some experimental conditions were repeated including cleaning of the quartz soil surface modification by soil colloids and column transport experiments under the same solution chemistries experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 2 4 theory calculations of the interaction energy or force between the mnps and collector surfaces were conducted to better understand the mechanisms that contributed to the retention under experimental solution chemistries details for these calculations are described in section 2 in the si micro and nanoscale surface morphology was represented as either concave locations or pillars interaction force maps were calculated for mnps in concave locations the concave locations were represented in these calculations as planes that intersect at selected angles the roughness height and fraction of pillars within the zone of adhesive influence were considered for interaction energy calculations the depths of the primary φ1min and secondary φ2min minima and the energy barrier height φbar were obtained by analyzing the interaction energy profiles a maxwellian energy balance approach shen et al 2007 was employed to estimate the value of the sticking efficiency in the primary minimum α1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of particles and porous media the hydrodynamic diameters d p of mnps are presented in fig s1 and table s1 the d p of mnps is slightly larger when the is 1 0 mm than 0 5 mm but suspensions are stable when the is 10 mm zeta potentials of mnps equal 18 3 and 11 4 mv when the is 0 5 and 1 mm respectively smooth and rough quartz sand grains were employed in mnp transport studies the physical and chemical properties of these purified sands have been extensively characterized previously liang et al 2020 2021 the zeta potentials of the rough 56 3 and 60 4 mv and smooth 60 5 and 64 3 mv sands are very similar when the is were 0 5 and 1 0 mm table s1 which confirms similar amounts of charge heterogeneity conversely scanning electron microscopy sem and laser confocal scanning microscopy lcsm images demonstrate significant differences in surface roughness between the relatively smooth figs s2a and s4a and rough quartz sand figs s3a and s4b in this research the fate of mnps was studied in smooth and rough quartz sand grains with different fractions 0 0 02 0 05 0 1 and 0 2 of clay coatings on their surfaces the distributions of clays with different mass fractions on the surfaces of smooth and rough sands are shown in figs s2 and s3 respectively the chemical analysis shows larger amounts of al and fe and lower amounts of sio2 as the clay fraction increases table s2 the decreasing quartz fraction and increase in elements e g fe al ca and mg with the clay fraction also indicate greater clay coverage on the quartz surfaces the relative percentages of the main elements analyzed by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds indicate good uniformity of the clay coating at different sites on a surface table s3 compared with the quartz sands the clays are less negatively charged have higher concentrations of metal elements and lower sio2 percentages tables s1 and s2 these observations indicate that charge heterogeneity is expected to increase with the mass fraction of clays on sand surfaces the toc values for all the coated and uncoated sands are lower than 0 1 g kg 1 due to the low clay fraction 0 20 attached to grain surfaces and the loss of organic compounds when the clays were soaked in liquid during the coating process the n2 bet surface areas table s2 of the smooth quartz with and without clay coatings ranged from 0 059 0 107 m2 g 1 whereas the values for the rough sand are much higher 0 869 1 195 m2 g 1 due to more pronounced surface roughness see sem images in figs s2 and s3 generally the presence of clays slightly increased the surface area of the smooth sand and tended to reduce that of the rough sand e g the surface area of sand with the highest clay fraction compared to those without clay however the presence of clays did not produce a significant difference in the surface areas of the sands mainly due to the small clay fractions that produced thin layers on the surfaces these results indicate that most of this surface area came from the quartz sand the surface roughness properties determined by lcsm generally indicate that the presence of clay coatings increased the roughness of smooth sand and tended to reduce the roughness of rough sand fig s4 and table s4 the porosities of packed columns were in a very narrow range of 0 465 0 479 and did not show a consistent trend with the mass of clay coating examples of tracer btcs obtained from columns with and without the clay coating displayed negligible difference as shown in fig s5 this information indicates that the presence of clay does not make a large difference in the porosity and hydraulic conditions in columns but did create a thin layer with micro or nanoscale heterogeneities that was much smaller than the grain size 3 2 mnp retention on sands with different clay fractions fig 1 and table 1 present btcs and the retained mass of

2017 mahdi et al 2018 this decreased mobility has been attributed to the increasing amounts of micro or nanosized locations with positive or less negative charges e g charge heterogeneity on collector surfaces in contrast the retained mass of mnps in this study exhibits a monotonic decrease from 47 1 to 19 1 in the rough sand when the clay fraction increases from 0 to 0 2 fig 1a b different from the results for the rough sand the retained mass exhibits a nonmonotonic trend in the smooth sand with increasing clay fractions fig 1a c specifically the mass of retained mnps increases from 28 1 to 45 1 and then decreases back to 30 9 when the clay fraction increases from 0 pure sand 0 05 to 0 2 respectively table 1 note that results from these column experiments exhibit good reproducibility fig s6 and the mass recoveries in the effluent show small standard deviations less than 5 so these trends in mnp retention with clay fractions are not experimental artifacts clay coatings on collector surfaces can significantly alter the charge heterogeneity and surface roughness clays can create charge heterogeneity from their positive less negative surfaces that contribute to enhanced retention of negative colloids abudalo et al 2005 bradford and torkzaban 2013 petosa et al 2013 wang et al 2017 for example the amounts of typical clay elements al mg fe and ca increased and the surfaces of coated sands tended to be less negative with increasing mass of clays in coated sands tables s1 and s2 results from column studies showed decreasing retention on rough sand and nonmonotonic retention on smooth sand with increasing clay fraction these observations are contradictory to the prediction of enhanced retention as charge heterogeneity from the attached clay fraction increased consequently the modification of surface roughness by clay coating provides an alternative explanation small clay fractions tend to create both convex asperities and concave locations on smooth surfaces e g aside clay asperities and between clay asperities increasing the clay fraction on the smooth sand can initially increase roughness by creating asperities and then eventually fill concave locations to smoothen the surface when the clay fraction 0 2 fig s2 in the absence of clay the rough sand fig s3a exhibits much more concave sites than the smooth sand fig s2a the depths of concave valleys can be reduced filled or turned into protruding asperities by the presence of clay on the rough sand fig s3b c a quantitative interpretation of retention mechanisms is dependent on a multitude of factors including micro and nanoscopic roughness distributions of concave and convex sites charge heterogeneity solution chemistry pore size and geometry colloid concentration clay geometry and coating and velocity distributions that need to be resolved at the pore and interface scales a pore network model is able to mechanistically determine colloid retention mechanisms lin et al 2021a 2021b lin et al 2022 but it is a simplification of the full complexity of natural pore media and presently does not consider the role of clay coatings xdlvo calculations for convex table s5 and concave figs s7 and s8 asperities provide a plausible qualitative explanation for 50 nm mnp retention under various collector surface roughness and morphology note that secondary minima are too shallow to be a major contributor to mnp retention under these low is 0 5 and 1 mm conditions both concave and convex locations can reduce or eliminate energy barriers bradford et al 2017 2018 shen et al 2018 however the primary minimum depth can be increased at concave locations leading to irreversible interactions shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 whereas primary minima are shallower at convex sites and more susceptible to removal by hydrodynamic forces or diffusion treumann et al 2014 torkzaban and bradford 2016 bradford et al 2017 li et al 2017 lin et al 2021b diffusing colloids experience random energy fluctuations that can allow them to overcome energy barriers that are smaller than about 8 kt e g bradford and torkzaban 2015 table s5 indicates that some convex roughness conditions reduced the energy barrier sufficiently to allow them to enter and be retained in a primary minimum the xdlvo calculations show that an increase in roughness fraction results in nonmonotonic trends of sticking efficiency α1 in the primary minima table s5 predicting a nonmonotonic alteration of mnp retention on pillar tops with the roughness fraction similar to the observed trend in mnp retention on smooth sand with increasing clay coating the predicted maximum amount of colloid retention occurs for small roughness fractions torkzaban and bradford 2016 this nonmonotonic variation of colloid attachment with convex site fraction has been theoretically indicated in previous publications bradford et al 2017 fig s9 presents the retention at convex locations on a clay coated surface additionally the energy barrier is absent at the bottom of valleys figs s7 and s8 indicating that these locations are favorable for retention attachment of natural clays at concave locations in rough sand fig s3 decreases the favorable valley areas and therefore reduces mnp retention as the clay fraction increases 3 3 coupled effects of sand surface roughness and clay coating with particle size fig 2 a b present the retention of different sizes of mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough and relatively smooth sand respectively without 0 and with clay coatings 0 2 corresponding btcs are shown in fig 2c d retention of mnps exhibits a complex dependency on the particle size that changes with the sand roughness which is influenced by the presence of clay coating mnp retention increases with increasing particle size in both sands without clay coatings however the influence of clay coating on mnp retention had different effects with particle size in rough and smooth sand in clay coated rough sand mnp retention slightly decreased with increasing particle size in contrast the retention in clay coated smooth sand exhibited a nonmonotonic dependency on the particle size with maximum retention occurring when the particle size was 500 nm clay coating diminished mnp retention for all particle sizes in the rough sand in contrast the coating produced similar greater and less retention in smooth sand when the particle size was 50 500 and 2000 nm respectively these results clearly show that the dependency of mnp retention on particle size significantly changes with the sand roughness and clay coating several factors may contribute to the observations shown in fig 2a b including differences in the mass transfer rate the applied hydrodynamic torque and interaction energies in the presence of sand roughness and clay coating each of these topics will be discussed below filtration theory is usually employed to predict the dependency of particle size on the mass transfer rate of a colloid to a collector surface yao et al 1971 the calculated single collector contact efficiency η messina et al 2015 for mnps in the employed porous media is predicted to decrease monotonically with increasing colloid size e g 50 500 and 2000 nm mnps have an η equal to 0 061 0 0104 and 0 0081 respectively the applied hydrodynamic torque will increase with the cubic of the particle radius on a smooth surface goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 consequently both differences in the mass transfer rate and the applied hydrodynamic torque will result in less colloid retention for a larger colloid size under the same chemical interactions these predictions follow the same retention trend as rough sand with clay coating but are not consistent with experimental observations in sands without clay coating or smooth sand with clay coating fig 2 similarly sem and lcsm images figs s3c and s4b show that the clay coating on rough sand creates a relatively smooth surface that would reduce retention increasing retention with greater particle size has previously been attributed to increased surface straining at microscopic roughness locations due to the alteration of lever arms for applied and resisting torques torkzaban and bradford 2016 and pore straining processes due to sieving and hydrodynamic bridging bradford et al 2002 zhang et al 2010 dong et al 2018 lin et al 2021b these observations indicate that surface and or pore straining processes can provide a possible explanation for increasing mnp retention with particle size on sands in the absence of clay colloids fig 2a b ripening can occur when diffusion or hydrodynamic forces overcome the repulse energy barrier bradford and torkzaban 2015 perez et al 2020 this can be facilitated by nanoscale roughness and charge heterogeneity on colloid surfaces that reduce the energy barrier surface straining was apparently reduced in the clay coated rough sand due to filling of roughness and concave locations that would otherwise enhance retention by altering level arms the influence of concave and convex locations on the retention of 50 nm mnps was already discussed in section 3 2 however the effects of surface morphology on interaction energy and colloid retention change with the particle size chen et al 2010 jin et al 2015b large colloids may be physically excluded from entering some of the concave sites sem images shown in fig s10 indicate that interactions in concave sites occur only when these valleys are large enough for mnps fig s11 indicates that attached clays at concave locations decrease the availability of large mnps for retention several authors have reported that alterations of solution chemistry produce less mnp release for smaller than larger particles torkzaban and bradford 2016 this implies that smaller particles are mainly associated with concave sites that are irreversible whereas larger particles can also reversibly interact on convex asperities clay coating can create small convex sites that contribute to retention in a nonmonotonic fashion in some cases i e results for smooth sand with clay coating in fig s12 the above information indicates that the slight decrease in particle retention with increasing mnp size on the rough sand with clay coating fig 2a likely reflects the combined influence of mass transfer retention on convex asperities less retention in concave sites and increasing hydrodynamic removal with larger particle sizes this may also explain the decreasing amounts of retention in the presence than the absence of clay coating in rough sand the nonmonotonic retention with increasing mnp size in smooth sand with clay coating fig 2b can likely be attributed to the influence of convex asperities on interaction energy profiles discussed in section 3 2 increases in applied hydrodynamic torque with particle size and size exclusion at some concave sites the mnp retention was maximum at 500 nm in clay coated smooth sand fig 2b because the hydrodynamic conditions allowed for attachment at some convex sites e g clay particles can form multiple contacts that are stable fig s13 it should be mentioned that clay modified sand exhibits greater amounts of charge heterogeneity than sands without clay coatings however clay coated sand frequently exhibits less mnp retention than uncoated sand fig 2a b e g mnps with all the tested sizes in rough sand and with 2000 nm in smooth sand even though the zeta potential of the clay coated sand was less negative charge heterogeneity therefore cannot explain the observed retention trends in fig 2 note that the uncoated sands were treated to remove charge heterogeneities and this may partially explain these results although chemical heterogeneity was not the primary cause for the observed trends of mnp transport its influence should not be entirely excluded for example increased chemical heterogeneity due to the clay coating may increase the tendency of attachment on convex locations and thus reduce the chance for retention in valley areas with deep primary minimum 3 4 mnp retention for different sand roughness clay coating and is fig 3 a b show the retention of different sizes of mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough and relatively smooth sand respectively in the absence of clay coating when the is equals 0 5 and 1 mm corresponding btcs are shown in fig 3c d the results were previously explained in section 3 3 for the is 0 5 mm data and were mainly attributed to nanoscale surface roughness for 50 nm mnps and surface and or pore straining processes for larger mnps an increase in is from 0 5 to 1 0 mm enhanced the mnp retention for all particle sizes both is conditions exhibited a similar trend of increasing retention with larger particle sizes however the increase in is had a much larger effect for smaller than larger mnps an increase in is tends to compress the double layer thickness and reduce colloid transport the secondary minimum is negligible at the considered is but the height of the energy barrier is diminished when the is 1 0 mm retention at convex asperities is therefore expected to increase with the is shen et al 2018 li et al 2020 consistent with experimental observations this effect is reported to be enhanced for smaller than larger mnps because of smaller energy barriers and lower hydrodynamic forces torkzaban and bradford 2016 conversely concave sites are reported to be independent of is shen et al 2018 li et al 2020 similarly straining processes are expected to be relatively insensitive to changes in is when the secondary minimum is negligible this finding is supported by the smaller differences in retention at both is conditions with the 2000 nm mnps ripening formation of surface dendrites was also observed for 500 and 2000 nm mnps on the rough sand when the is 1 0 mm and this likely contributed to straining processes bradford et al 2006 fig 4 shows the retention and btcs for different sized mnps 50 500 and 2000 nm on rough a and c and smooth b and d sands that were coated by clays when the is 0 5 and 1 0 mm results for this data when the is 0 5 mm were previously discussed in section 3 3 in brief clay coatings on rough and smooth sands diminished straining and retention at concave locations so that retention was mainly controlled by convex sites and the applied hydrodynamic torque an increase in the is from 0 5 to 1 0 mm produced greater retention on both sands with clay coatings similar to fig 3 a higher is 1 0 mm lowers the energy barrier compression of the double layer thickness and enhances mpn retention in primary minimum on some convex sites mpn retention frequently exhibits a non monotonic trend with increasing particle size e g smooth sand with clay coating at both is and rough sand with clay coating when the is 1 mm due to differences in interaction energy profiles on rough surfaces and the applied hydrodynamic torque retention of 50 nm mnps is mainly controlled by convex sites because of lower energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torques conversely retention of 2000 nm mnps can happen by surface and or pore straining processes because of larger energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torques goldman et al 1967 o neill 1968 bradford et al 2002 lin et al 2021b furthermore surface and pore straining processes can be enhanced by colloid colloid interactions that produce ripening for example ripening occurred for 500 and 2000 nm mnps when the is 1 0 mm on the smooth sand with clay coating the 500 nm mnps can sometimes exhibit the most retention because it is influenced both by nanoscale roughness at convex sites and intermediate values of the applied hydrodynamic torque that allow attachment it should be noted that these mnps are efficiently removed by collector surfaces even under relatively low is conditions complete retention of these mnps is therefore expected to occur under higher is conditions that are more typical of groundwater and this would diminish or eliminate the sensitivity of mnp retention to surface roughness and particle size however colloid retention is expected to still be sensitive to surface roughness and particle size at higher solution is when colloids have similar amounts of removal 4 conclusion this study illustrates that sand roughness and clay coatings significantly alter the magnitudes and mechanisms of colloid and nanoparticle retention in porous media and these factors change with the solution is and particle size in a complex manner the retention of mnps with increasing particle size exhibited decreasing increasing or nonmonotonic trends depending on the sand roughness clay coating and or solution is a number of factors contributed to observed mnp retention behavior including attachment at convex and concave sites and surface and or pore straining processes due to alternation of interaction energy profiles and applied hydrodynamic torques clay coatings tended to fill concave sites on rough sand and created convex sites on the relatively smooth sand mnp retention occurred at convex sites on relatively smooth sands with clay coatings especially for higher is and for smaller mnp sizes due to lower energy barriers and applied hydrodynamic torque convex sites were more important for smaller sized mnps 50 nm and for relatively rough sand larger mnp sizes 500 and 2000 nm are associated with greater applied hydrodynamic torques and are therefore more susceptible to surface straining processes that alter lever arms at microscopic roughness locations and pore straining processes when ripening happens this study shows that the sand surface morphology and roughness dominantly controlled particle retention over charge heterogeneity from clay coatings on retention behavior our findings suggest that the surface roughness and particle size will strongly influence retention in subsurface environments when colloid removal is low enough this study highlights the critical role of natural clays on the environmental fate of colloids in the subsurface environment findings in this study imply that the influence of natural clay coatings changes with the solution chemistry and particle size surface roughness modification by ubiquitously occurring clays or colloids will significantly influence the removal of colloidal contaminants in environmental or industrial applications e g riverbank filtration and sand filtration for surface water or wastewater purification it also implies that engineering approaches to modify surface roughness could be used to control the mobility of particles in porous media for specific environmental applications e g optimization for enhancing or diminishing the retention of

coupled to the reduction of several compounds either directly i e nitrate metal oxides or in consortia with syntrophic bacterial partners i e sulfate however the mechanisms underlying extracellular electron transfer eet between anme and their bacterial partners or external electron acceptors are poorly understood in this study we investigated electron and carbon flow for an anaerobic methanotrophic consortium dominated by candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens in a ch4 fed microbial electrolysis cell mec acetate was identified as a likely intermediate for the methanotrophic consortium which stimulated the growth of the known electroactive genus geobacter electrochemical characterization stoichiometric calculations of the system along with stable isotope based assays revealed that acetate was not produced from ch4 directly in the absence of ch4 current was still generated and the microbial community remained largely unchanged a substantial portion of the generated current in the absence of ch4 was linked to the oxidation of the intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb and the breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances epss the ability of ca m nitroreducens to use stored phb as a carbon and energy source and its ability to donate acetate as a diffusible electron carrier expands the known metabolic diversity of this lineage that likely underpins its success

electrodes pierced the rubber stoppers the 150 ml biomass inoculum noted above was transferred into the anode chamber leaving a 60 ml headspace in the cathode chamber 150 ml of sterile 50 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs was filled as electrolyte after inoculation in the anaerobic chamber the anode chamber was sparged with 90 ch4 ch4 co2 n2 90 5 5 for 15 min to supply ch4 as the exogenous electron

instruments inc usa which also recorded chronoamperometric current the headspace gas compositions for both the anode and cathode chambers were measured periodically to track ch4 consumption and co2 production in order to further verify that the ca m nitroreducens consortium was metabolically active for electrode dependent aom a feeding gas manipulating assay and an isotopic labelling assay was conducted in parallel in a replicated mec respectively to be specific in the gas manipulating assay ch4 in the headspace of anode chamber was intermittently replaced by argon to investigate the potential chronoamperometric dependency on ch4 availability regarding the isotope assay 10 ml of anodic headspace was replaced by 13ch4 99 99 13c sigma aldrich and liquid samples were intermittently withdrawn from the anode chamber to analyze the enrichment of 13co2 to confirm aom activity to validate a potential intermediate dependent eet pathway of the methanotrophic consortium the presence of intermediates was identified by liquid sampling from anode chamber for volatile fatty acids vfas measurement throughout the incubation and their correlation to chronoamperometric current response was

used for inoculum was flushed with ar co2 95 5 for 15 min to remove residual ch4 dissolved in the solution potential production of 13c labeled acetate was identified by analyses of liquid samples from the anode chamber during the period with the current peak our previous study found that acetate may be produced as an intermediate by ca m nitroreducens via intracellular storage compounds cai et al 2019 to test whether this indirect pathway for acetate production from aom also exists when ca m nitroreducens respirate to an electrode in the mec we conducted a similar experiment to our previous study by preincubating ca m nitroreducens enrichment culture with 13ch4 to build up 13c labeled intracellular storage compounds and then examining the potential production of 13c labelled acetate when preincubated biomass was incubated in an mec specifically 150 ml biomass collected from the parent reactor was transferred into a 210 ml bioreactor for preincubation after flushing the bioreactor with ch4 ch4 co2 n2 90 5 5 for 15 min 30 ml of the headspace gas was replaced with 13ch4 sufficient nitrate and ammonium were supplied to the culture throughout 20 days of the preincubation period preincubated biomass was then transferred into a replicate mec reactor which was operated at the same condition as mentioned above but with 30 ml non labeled ch4 supplied to the headspace of the anode chamber liquid samples were intermittently collected during the period that peak current was observed to determine the production of 13c labeled acetate additional batches were performed in the absence of exogenous ch4 supply to investigate the contribution of endogenous pathways to current generation freshly prepared inoculum see above was diluted 150 ml 75 ml 50 ml 30 ml 15 ml 7 5 ml made

of all mecs were sparged with inert mixed gas ar co2 v v 95 5 for 15 min to exclude exogenous ch4 unless otherwise indicated reactors with different concentrations of inoculum were operated at the exactly same conditions to the ch4 amended mecs detailed above as a control a duplicate reactor inoculated with 150 ml biomass was operated with an open circuit without ch4 amendment this experimental design was to distinguish whether the source of intermediate was from endogenous metabolism of methanotrophic biomass or from oxidation of supplied ch4 for these batches intracellular storage compounds polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen and extracellular polymeric substances eps of the methanotrophic biomass were quantified before and after operation of the mecs to identify their contribution to current generation a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and pha staining was applied to identify the populations storing intracellular pha to further verify that intracellular storage compounds could make a measurable contribution to current generation we did an additional experiment to test the current generation by the methanotrophic biomass that had been starved to deplete intracellular storage compounds specifically 150 ml biomass was collected from the parent reactor and transferred to a 210 ml bioreactor for starvation incubation sufficient nitrate and ammonium were fed to the biomass while no ch4 was supplied to provide the exogenous electron donor other conditions were the same as for the parent reactor 2 4 microbial community profiling with

in the form of co2 recovered from ch4 oxidation stoichiometrically calculated according to eq 3 except for electrons recovered from ch4 oxidation faradaic contribution could also be stemmed from ammonium oxidation as the anammox bacteria in the methanotrophic consortium could potentially oxidize ammonium supplied in the medium to generate current shaw et al 2020 to evaluate the faradaic contribution from ammonium oxidation we set up another replicate mec in this test biomass 75 ml was prepared by washing and resuspending in the fresh medium free of ammonium and 15nh4cl 0 15 g l was supplemented to the final biomass suspension ammonium consumption and dinitrogen production including 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 were quantified throughout the experimental period moreover after sampling was complete for 15n tracing additional nh4cl 0 3 g l was supplemented to test the dependency of current generation on ammonium as all mecs were operated by polarizing anodes at 0 2 v versus an ag agcl h2 was produced in the cathode chamber from h2o evolution h2 accumulated in the cathode chamber could diffuse to the anode chamber through the cem serving as another electron donor for current generation to evaluate the potential faradaic contribution from h2 oxidation we set up another two replicate electrochemical systems with the same configuration to our mecs to test the h2 diffusion rate through the cem allowing for an estimation of the potential faradaic contribution of h2 details of methods and estimation are present in the supplementary material 2 8 chemical analytical methods liquid

described previously zhang et al 2019b the aqueous dissolved ch4 was determined from gaseous ch4 concentration in the headspace according to henry s law for mass balance calculations net co2 production was quantified by the sum of co2 increase detected in the headspace and the liquid media dissolved co2 was measured in 1 ml of liquid from the anode chamber followed sampled with a syringe and injected into 4 5 ml exetainer vials labco uk the vials were acidified with 0 2 ml hcl stock solution 1 m to extract dissolved co2 vials were then kept for at least 1 h to equilibrate with the headspace before final gc measurements for isotopic analysis aom was indicated by the production of 13co2 1 ml of liquid sample was withdrawn from the anode chamber at each sampling time point and centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min the supernatant was injected into 4 5 ml exetainer vials and stored at 20 c until measurement prior to measurement 0 2 ml 1m hcl was injected into each thawed sample to extract co2 the resulting co2 in the headspace of vials was analysed for the isotopic enrichment δ13c on a gas chromatograph combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc c irms isoprime uk in the stable isotope geochemistry laboratory at uq pha and glycogen analysis was performed on the biomass inoculum from the parent reactor and the biofilm detached from the electrodes at the end of the mec incubations via vigorous vortexing of the electrodes biomass samples were freeze dried with glycogen glucose equivalents and pha extracted and quantified according to details presented in a previous study lai et al 2021 both loosely and tightly bound eps were extracted from the methanotrophic biomass using a heat extraction method as described in a previous study li and yang 2007 both eps extractions were analysed for polysaccharides proteins and total organic carbon toc li and yang 2007 polysaccharide content was measured with the phenol sulfuric acid method li and yang 2007 using glucose as the standard protein was quantified with a spectrophotometric method by using a commercial bca protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific inc us toc was analysed with a toc analyser shimadzu 5000 a japan for the analysis of 13c labeled acetate 20 µl of 200 mm 3nph ie 3 nitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride sigma n21804 in 50 aqueous acetonitrile was mixed with 20 ul of 120 mm edc 6

extracellular respiration of the methanotrophic consortium revealed by chronoamperometric characterization and stoichiometric balance the extracellular respiratory capability of the methanotrophic consortium dominated by ca m nitroreducens has previously been indicated zhang et al 2019b while eet supported electrode dependent aom by this consortium was not fully confirmed current generation was observed in ch4 fuelled mecs figs 1 a s1 s2a and it dropped by around 25 when the ch4 gas fed to the headspace of the anode chamber was intermittently replaced by inert ar gas fig s1 which demonstrated the correlation between current generation and ch4 availability further isotope assay showed that δ13c value of co2 in the 13ch4 fed mec steadily increased along the incubation course from 24 9 on day 0 to 129 0 on day 32 fig s2b the enrichment of 13co2 revealed aom activity in mecs for the further resolution of carbon and electron flows in ch4 fed mecs we quantified ch4 consumption and co2 production with simultaneous analysis of carbon and electron balance with a fresh replicated setup in agreement with the current profiles of the other two mecs figs s1 s2a a striking peak 0 73 ma was observed in the new setup from day 7 to day 9 before a steep decline over the next 20 days fig 1a stage 1 and stabilizing around 0 03 ma for the remainder of the system operation stage 2 ch4 was consumed at a relatively stable rate around 1 1 mmol mg protein d which was about 17 of the ch4 consumption rate in the parent reactor however the current decline was not due to exhaustion of ch4 in the anode chamber with only 14 6 utilised throughout the first operational stage stage 1 days 0 to 45 and ch4 replenishment at the beginning of stage 2 did not stimulate an increase in current output total co2 production was consistent with the higher current output in stage 1 but ch4 was consumed at a relatively constant rate indicating an alternative electron source was responsible for the initial spike in current this was supported by the calculated stoichiometric balances which indicated that the electrons and carbon recovered were considerably higher 177 6 and 267 1 respectively than what was possible through ch4 oxidation alone during the first stage table s1 calculation details in supporting information as anammox bacteria were previously reported to be capable of bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium shaw et al 2020 the anammox bacteria ca kuenenia sp in the methanotrophic consortium could potentially oxidize ammonium to generate current in our isotopic tracing batch test with 15nh4cl amendment steady 30n2 accumulation was observed which indicated the bioelectrochemical oxidation of 15nh4 in the mec fig s4b 29n2 was relatively stable fig s4b suggesting that there was limited nh4 leaching from cell lysis otherwise 29n2 would increase due to the contribution of unlabeled nh4 from cell lysis however the reaction rate of bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium was extremely low as evidenced by limited 30n2 accumulation and ammonium consumption fig s4b 4c moreover no nh4 concentration dependency of the current was observed fig s4d further faradaic calculation confirmed that the faradaic contribution from nh4 oxidation was negligible to the current generation calculation details shown in supplementary material meanwhile as h2 evolution from the water splitting was the electron accepting reaction in the cathode h2 produced in the cathode could diffuse to the anode through cem providing additional electron donor for anodic current generation our diffusion test and corresponding faradaic estimation also excluded the significant role of h2 as an alternative electron source details shown in supplementary material electron balance based on the net co2 accumulation revealed that only 66 2 of electrons could be accounted for based on the assumption that the current output during the first stage was solely from measured ch4 oxidation this result suggests the oxidation of alternate carbonaceous compounds with a higher oxidised state than ch4 zhang et al 2020 which provided additional electron donor for current generation in the mec during stage 2 the coulombic efficiency was 91 9 based on ch4 consumption and the carbon recovery was 90 4 suggesting that ch4 oxidation was the main source of generated current when the system stabilised due to the limitation of ch4 availability in the aqueous solution ch4 fuelled microbial fuel cells were normally reported with low current density zhang et al 2020 the utilization of alternative electron donors explained why higher current density was observed in our mec than most of current densities reported in relevant work to date table s2 given acetate has previously been suggested as a diffusible intermediate for ca m nitroreducens enrichments systems bai et al 2019 berger et al 2021 ding et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b its concentration was monitored throughout the two stages of operation acetate accumulation and consumption were observed during stage 1 but was below the detection limit during stage 2 fig 1a notably the prominent current change during the first stage was clearly correlated with the concentration of acetate a spike in the acetate concentration occurred prior to the spike in current suggesting that acetate was an intermediate for current evolution in the system 3 2 physiological evidence for the pathway of intermediate production 3 2 1 extracellular respiration of the methanotrophic consortium via endogenous metabolism in order to further investigate the contribution of non ch4 sources for carbon and electrons the mec systems were operated with the same biomass and operational conditions but without the supply of exogenous ch4 current output and steady charge accumulation were observed for these batches figs 2 a s6a f with a similar characteristic spike in the current output early in the operation to the one observed in the presence of ch4 in addition acetate was also found to be closely correlated with the fluctuation in the current output fig 2a it suggested that acetate driven current output was the result of the break down and oxidation of some of the seed methanotrophic biomass as no exogenous electron donors were provided to mecs the linear correlation between the equivalent electron capacity of current output and the seeding biomass amount supported that current was fuelled by biomass degradation fig 2b biomass fuelled mecs have been widely reported to extract electrons from endogenous biomass organics ge et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the general principle of these mecs is that cells in the biomass die off when no exogenous electron donors are supplied to support the growth and survival of microorganisms and the organics released from cell lysis serve as the reducing equivalents for current output long et al 2018 yang et al 2013 more specifically biomass undergoes the first two steps of anaerobic digestion i e hydrolysis and acidogenesis releasing readily biodegradable organics normally vfas for respiration by exoelectrogens de mes et al 2003 ge et al 2013 the lysis featured process was also observed here in the control mec inoculated with the methanotrophic biomass and operated with an open circuit ammonium or phosphate release is a good indication of cell lysis since we used pbs in the medium to increase the conductivity of electrolyte measurement of phosphate increase as an indicator for cell lysis was not feasible thus we used ammonium concentration as proxy to evaluate potential cell lysis de mes et al 2003 the rapid accumulation of ammonium from 40 5 mg l 1 to 86 8 mg l 1 fig s7 is a clear indication of cell lysis hydrolysis and fermentation of the organics released during lysis was confirmed by the detection of vfas mainly acetate butyrate propionate and valerate fig s8b acetate was the dominant fermentative product and its accumulation started to decrease from day 24 accompanied by ch4 generation fig s9 suggesting acetoclastic methanogenesis this metabolic process can be evidenced by characteristic microbial community change in the open circuit mec after 48 days of operation the microbial community completely changed in comparison to the inoculum with an unclassified member of the acetogenic acetobacteraceae and methanogens of methanobacterium and methanosaeta genera dominating the community fig 3 acetate production in the closed circuit mec without exogenous ch4 supply seemed to follow a different metabolic process ammonium was relatively stable during the initial period but increased slightly at the end of the operation fig s7 as bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium by ca kuenenia sp in the consortium was found to be at extremely low rate fig s4 the stable ammonium suggested minor cell lysis in the biomass fuelled mec acetate saw a quick accumulation and consumption while other vfa species did not observe significant accumulation fig s8a the growth of acetogens and methanogens in the open circuit mec and the absence of these microorganisms in the closed circuit mec suggested that different metabolic pathways for acetate production and utilization were used in two conditions fig 3 in contrast to the complete shift of microbial community in the open circuit mec only a minor change was observed for the methanotrophic consortium after 48 days while ca m nitroreducens completely disappeared in the open circuit system it persisted in the closed circuit systems but with population slight declined from 33 6 to 25 4 and 22 4 in the mec with 150 ml and 75 ml of inoculum biomass respectively despite the absence of supplied ch4 in line with the community profile rt pcr results showed that ca m nitroreducens still persisted in biofilm built on electrodes in closed circuit mecs although a slight drop was also observed in comparison to the inoculum from 3 56 0 27 x 107 to 2 79 0 13 107 copies mg 1 dna and from 3 78 0 39 x 107 to 2 63 0 16 107 copies mg 1 dna in the mec with 150 ml and 75 ml of inoculum biomass respectively fig s10 these results suggest a non ch4 carbon source is being used by the methanotrophic consortium and for current generation in the system it appears that acetate oxidation makes a major faradaic contribution with or without the supply of ch4 figs 1 and 2 given the well known electrogenic acetate utilising genus geobacter lovley et al 2011 ying et al 2018 is the only member to proliferate during the operation of the mec 2 7 fig 3 it is likely that this population is responsible for the oxidation of acetate and the transfer of electrons directly to the electrode fig 1 metagenomic sequencing and subsequent genome based analyses of the community are required to assess the electrogenic potential of other populations 3 2 2 acetate production from endogenous metabolism of the methanotrophic consortium in order to investigate the source of the detected acetate in the closed circuit mecs mec batch experiments with different treatments were performed as shown in fig 4 a the mecs fuelled solely by the ca m nitroreducens enrichment showed the stable fraction of 13c labeled acetate at approximately 1 25 which represented natural abundance of 13c labeled acetate when the ca m nitroreducens enrichment was incubated in the mec in the presence of 13ch4 no obvious 13c enriched was detected fig 4b suggesting that acetate is not directly derived from the ch4 provided in the test in contrast the ca m nitroreducens enrichment preincubated with 13ch4 was found to release acetate with notable 13c fraction between 6 2 and 18 9 when it was incubated in the mec fed with non labeled ch4 fig 4c these findings suggested that ca m nitroreducens used an indirect metabolic pathway to produce acetate via certain intracellular storage substances when it respirated to electrodes which was consistent with our previous study with the ca m nitroreducens enrichment regarding its metabolic acetate production cai et al 2019 3 3 potential carbonaceous precursors and responsible microorganisms for acetate production additional experiments were performed to investigate potential sources of carbon and electrons to explain the observed generation of current and acetate in the absence of ch4 including the measurement of eps and carbon storage compounds our previous study demonstrated that intracellular carbon storage compounds can be accumulated by the consortium cai et al 2019 chromatographic analysis showed that the inoculum methanotrophic biomass contained pha mainly phb of 151 0 1 5 mg g 1 dw and 117 11 8 mg g 1 dw for inoculum used in the mec without and with ch4 amendment respectively but a negligible amount of glycogen data not shown carbon and electron balance also confirmed the phb production by the ca m nitroreducens enrichment when it grew with ch4 and nitrate details seen in supplementary material fig s11 table s3 all phb was used during the first 48 days of mec operation without exogenous ch4 supply and 76 1 was used from 117 11 8 to 28 3 5 in the mec with ch4 supply fig 5 a indicating that a substantial proportion of the current generation in both mecs originated from the oxidation of this storage compound this can be supported by the fact that a much smaller current peak was observed in the mec incubated with biomass that had been starved to consume intracellular storage compounds fig s12 importantly fish coupled with nile blue a staining of the biomass confirmed that intracellular accumulation of phb was confined to the ca m nitroreducens cells and that this population was responsible for the measured dynamics of this storage compound in the mec system fig 5b this is supported by the fact that ca m nitroreducens encodes genes for a complete metabolic pathway of phb synthesis haroon et al 2013 and the correlation between the initial phb amount and acetate production in the mec the electrons generated from pha degradation could be transported directly to poised electrodes via unknown eet pathways of ca m nitroreducens thus energy could maybe be conserved by phb metabolism via yet unidentified eet mechanisms to sustain the consortia this was consistent with the observation that a lag phase was always experienced in mecs for acetate and current burst figs 1a and 2a as increasing attachment of ca m nitroreducens to electrodes stimulate the electrons that produced from phb degradation transferring to electrodes meanwhile energy was also conserved via substrate level phosphorylation during acetate production from acetyl coa as a central intermediate in contrast ca m nitroreducens could not gain energy in the open circuit system due to the absence of an electron sink the ability of the ca m nitroreducens to rely on stored pha as an electron and carbon source and to respire to the electrode would explain its persistence and the stability of consortium community in the closed circuit mec in contrast to the open circuit mec fig 3 in addition to carbon storage polymers eps is a known source of carbon and energy for microorganisms when exogenous carbon sources become limiting wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a protein was the predominant component for both the loosely and tightly bound eps fractions with a 50 reduction measured for both over the operation of the mec fig 5c polysaccharide only accounted for a small proportion of the eps and also showed a substantial decrease 74 3 and 59 3 for loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps respectively fig 5c over the 48 days of mec operation the measured loss of proteins and polysaccharides was reflected in the 50 60 reduction in the total organic carbon toc of the eps fig 5c were further indicative of the potential contribution of eps in the extracellular metabolism of the methanotrophic biomass when no exogenous ch4 was supplied acetate and other vfas could also partly be derived from the hydrolysis and fermentation of the eps fig 5a by fermentative populations fig 3 mapping of electron flux demonstrated that 80 7 of electrons for current production in the mec without ch4 supply was contributed by phb with the remaining 19 3 from eps see calculation in supplementary material biomass eps in the mec with ch4 supply saw a similar decline to that in the mec without ch4 supply fig 5c supporting the likely role of eps as an alternative carbon and energy source in the ch4 fed mec table s1 4 conclusions this study showed the complex carbon and energy flows for ch4 metabolising communities acetate production from phb degradation was identified as an energy source for the current generation by a methanotrophic consortium it is suggested that the current generated in the mec inoculated with a methanotrophic consortium is derived from both the break down of the seed biomass and aom ca m nitroreducens and geobacter were the main electroactive microorganisms present and are likely responsible for the extracellular transfer of electrons to the electrode ca m nitroreducens appears to utilise stored phb and geobacter likely utilises acetate produced from the break down of phb and eps further study is required to fully elucidate the metabolic pathways and potential specific interactions between these populations similar studies of the role of storage

15724,anaerobic oxidation of methane aom is an important microbial process mitigating methane ch4 emission from natural sediments anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme have been shown to mediate aom coupled to the reduction of several compounds either directly i e nitrate metal oxides or in consortia with syntrophic bacterial partners i e sulfate however the mechanisms underlying extracellular electron transfer eet between anme and their bacterial partners or external electron acceptors are poorly understood in this study we investigated electron and carbon flow for an anaerobic methanotrophic consortium dominated by candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens in a ch4 fed microbial electrolysis cell mec acetate was identified as a likely intermediate for the methanotrophic consortium which stimulated the growth of the known electroactive genus geobacter electrochemical characterization stoichiometric calculations of the system along with stable isotope based assays revealed that acetate was not produced from ch4 directly in the absence of ch4 current was still generated and the microbial community remained largely unchanged a substantial portion of the generated current in the absence of ch4 was linked to the oxidation of the intracellular polyhydroxybutyrate phb and the breakdown of extracellular polymeric substances epss the ability of ca m nitroreducens to use stored phb as a carbon and energy source and its ability to donate acetate as a diffusible electron carrier expands the known metabolic diversity of this lineage that likely underpins its success

including hydrogen formate and acetate but have never been confirmed experimentally hoehler et al 1994 meulepas et al 2010 nauhaus et al 2005 sørensen et al 2001 several studies have suggested acetate

biochar or humic acids were the available electron sink bai et al 2019 berger et al 2021 ding et al 2017 ouboter et al 2022 zhang et al 2019b however the specific interactions between the populations of these enrichments and the source and mechanism for the production of any intermediates was not directly assessed and remains poorly understood the aim of the current study was to better understand the electron and carbon flows in anaerobic methanotrophic communities using a ca m nitroreducens enrichment grown in a microbial electrolysis cell mec polarized electrodes were provided as the sole electron acceptor which allowed the representative electrochemical characterizations and real time capture of respiratory electrons for electron balance assessments we specifically examined the variation of acetate to understand its potential role as an electron carrier in the consortium meanwhile the role of polymeric substances including polyhydroxyalkanoate and extracellular polymeric substances eps was evaluated as potential precursors for the intermediate production 2 materials and methods the inoculum used for investigations was a methanotrophic culture dominated by ca m

the top port of each bottle was sealed with a rubber stopper and a plastic cap with a central hole to allow an electrode to pass through a polarized electrode was assembled in the anode chamber

cathode pierced through the rubber stoppers into their respective chambers leaving approx 3 cm protruding to attach the electrical wiring epoxy resin was used to ensure a gas tight seal where the electrodes pierced the rubber stoppers the 150 ml biomass inoculum noted above was transferred into the anode chamber leaving a 60 ml headspace in the cathode chamber 150 ml of sterile 50 mm phosphate buffered saline pbs was filled as electrolyte after inoculation in the anaerobic chamber the anode chamber was sparged with 90 ch4 ch4 co2 n2 90 5 5 for 15 min to supply ch4 as the exogenous electron donor reactors were operated in batch mode at room temperature 24 1 c the anode was polarized at 0 2 v versus an ag agcl reference electrode re 5b basi usa controlled by a potentiostat chi 1030c ch instruments inc usa which also recorded chronoamperometric current the headspace gas compositions for both the anode and cathode chambers were measured periodically to track ch4 consumption and co2 production in order to further verify that the ca m nitroreducens consortium was metabolically active for electrode dependent aom a feeding gas manipulating assay and an isotopic labelling assay was conducted in parallel in a replicated mec respectively to be specific in the gas manipulating assay ch4 in the headspace of anode chamber was intermittently replaced by argon to investigate the potential chronoamperometric dependency on ch4 availability regarding the isotope assay 10 ml of anodic headspace was replaced by 13ch4 99 99 13c sigma aldrich and liquid samples were intermittently withdrawn from the anode chamber to analyze the enrichment of 13co2 to confirm aom activity to validate a potential intermediate dependent eet pathway of the methanotrophic consortium the presence of intermediates was identified by liquid sampling from anode chamber for volatile fatty acids vfas measurement throughout the incubation and their correlation to chronoamperometric current response was evaluated 2 3 batch experiments replicate mecs operated at the same condition with 30 ml 13c labeled ch4 99 13c atom sigma supplied to the headspace of the anode chamber before inoculation biomass used for inoculum was flushed with ar co2 95 5 for 15 min to remove residual ch4 dissolved in the solution potential production of 13c labeled acetate was identified by analyses of liquid samples from the anode chamber during the period with the current peak our previous study found that acetate may be produced as an intermediate by ca m nitroreducens via intracellular storage compounds cai et al 2019 to test whether this indirect pathway for acetate production from aom also exists when ca m nitroreducens respirate to an electrode in the mec we conducted a similar experiment to our previous study by preincubating ca m nitroreducens enrichment culture with 13ch4 to build up 13c labeled intracellular storage compounds and then examining the potential production of 13c labelled acetate when preincubated biomass was incubated in an mec specifically 150 ml biomass collected from the parent reactor was transferred into a 210 ml bioreactor for preincubation after flushing the bioreactor with ch4 ch4 co2 n2 90 5 5 for 15 min 30 ml of the headspace gas was replaced with 13ch4 sufficient nitrate and ammonium were supplied to the culture throughout 20 days of the preincubation period preincubated biomass was then transferred into a replicate mec reactor which was operated at the same condition as mentioned above but with 30 ml non labeled ch4 supplied to the headspace of the anode chamber liquid samples were intermittently collected during the period that peak current was observed to determine the production of 13c labeled acetate additional batches were performed in the absence of exogenous ch4 supply to investigate the contribution of endogenous pathways to current generation freshly prepared inoculum see above was diluted 150 ml 75 ml 50 ml 30 ml 15 ml 7 5 ml made up to 150 ml with fresh media to give gradient biomass concentrations v v0 1 00 0 50 0 33 0 10 0 05 respectively with each concentration used to inoculate freshly set up mecs afterwards anode chambers of all mecs were sparged with inert mixed gas ar co2 v v 95 5 for 15 min to exclude exogenous ch4 unless otherwise indicated reactors with different concentrations of inoculum were operated at the exactly same conditions to the ch4 amended mecs detailed above as a control a duplicate reactor inoculated with 150 ml biomass was operated with an open circuit without ch4 amendment this experimental design was to distinguish whether the source of intermediate was from endogenous metabolism of methanotrophic biomass or from oxidation of supplied ch4 for these batches intracellular storage compounds polyhydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen and extracellular polymeric substances eps of the methanotrophic biomass were quantified before and after operation of the mecs to identify their contribution to current generation a combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and pha staining was applied to identify the populations storing intracellular pha to further verify that intracellular storage compounds could make a measurable contribution to current generation we did an additional experiment to test the current generation by the methanotrophic biomass that had been starved to deplete intracellular storage compounds specifically 150 ml biomass was collected from the parent reactor and transferred to a 210 ml bioreactor for starvation incubation sufficient nitrate and ammonium were fed to the biomass while no ch4 was supplied to provide the exogenous electron donor other conditions were the same as for the parent reactor 2 4 microbial community profiling with 16s rrna amplicon sequencing 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was applied to characterize the microbial community at the end of electrochemical incubation course biofilm colonized fibers in replicate

in the form of co2 recovered from ch4 oxidation stoichiometrically calculated according to eq 3 except for electrons recovered from ch4 oxidation faradaic contribution could also be stemmed from ammonium oxidation as the anammox bacteria in the methanotrophic consortium could potentially oxidize ammonium supplied in the medium to generate current shaw et al 2020 to evaluate the faradaic contribution from ammonium oxidation we set up another replicate mec in this test biomass 75 ml was prepared by washing and resuspending in the fresh medium free of ammonium and 15nh4cl 0 15 g l was supplemented to the final biomass suspension ammonium consumption and dinitrogen production including 28n2 29n2 and 30n2 were quantified throughout the experimental period moreover after sampling was complete for 15n tracing additional nh4cl 0 3 g l was supplemented to test the dependency of current generation on ammonium as all mecs were operated by polarizing anodes at 0 2 v versus an ag agcl h2 was produced in the cathode chamber from h2o evolution h2 accumulated in the cathode chamber could diffuse to the anode chamber through the cem serving as another electron donor for current generation to evaluate the potential faradaic contribution from h2 oxidation we set up another two replicate electrochemical systems with the same configuration to our mecs to test the h2 diffusion rate through the cem allowing for an estimation of the potential faradaic contribution of h2 details of methods and estimation are present in the supplementary material 2 8 chemical analytical methods liquid samples were taken from anodic chambers of reactors by syringes and filtered immediately through a 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filter merck the concentration of vfas was measured on shimadzu hplc system with a bio rad hplc column 300 7 8 mm and a refractive index detector zhang et al 2019b for ch4 n2 and co2 determinations 0 1 ml of headspace gas sample was collected with a gas tight

described previously zhang et al 2019b the aqueous dissolved ch4 was determined from gaseous ch4 concentration in the headspace according to henry s law for mass balance calculations net co2 production was quantified by the sum of co2 increase detected in the headspace and the liquid media dissolved co2 was measured in 1 ml of liquid from the anode chamber followed sampled with a syringe and injected into 4 5 ml exetainer vials labco uk the vials were acidified with 0 2 ml hcl stock solution 1 m to extract dissolved co2 vials were then kept for at least 1 h to equilibrate with the headspace before final gc measurements for isotopic analysis aom was indicated by the production of 13co2 1 ml of liquid sample was withdrawn from the anode chamber at each sampling time point and centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min the supernatant was injected into 4 5 ml exetainer vials and stored at 20 c until measurement prior to measurement 0 2 ml 1m hcl was injected into each thawed sample to extract co2 the resulting co2 in the headspace of vials was analysed for the isotopic enrichment δ13c on a gas chromatograph combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometer gc c irms isoprime uk in the stable isotope geochemistry laboratory at uq pha and glycogen analysis was performed on the biomass inoculum from the parent reactor and the biofilm detached from the electrodes at the end of the mec incubations via vigorous vortexing of the electrodes biomass samples were freeze dried with glycogen glucose equivalents and pha extracted and quantified according to details presented in a previous study lai et al 2021 both loosely and tightly bound eps were extracted from the methanotrophic biomass using a heat extraction method as described in a previous study li and yang 2007 both eps extractions were analysed for polysaccharides proteins and total organic carbon toc li and yang 2007 polysaccharide content was measured with the phenol sulfuric acid method li and yang 2007 using

shimadzu uhplc system coupled to a shimadzu 8060 triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometer according to the method modified from han et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 intermediate dependent extracellular respiration of the methanotrophic consortium revealed by chronoamperometric characterization and stoichiometric balance the extracellular respiratory capability of the methanotrophic consortium dominated by ca m nitroreducens has previously been indicated zhang et al 2019b while eet supported electrode dependent aom by this consortium was not fully confirmed current generation was observed in ch4 fuelled mecs figs 1 a s1 s2a and it dropped by around 25 when the ch4 gas fed to the headspace of the anode chamber was intermittently replaced by inert ar gas fig s1 which demonstrated the correlation between current generation and ch4 availability further isotope assay showed that δ13c value of co2 in the 13ch4 fed mec steadily increased along the incubation course from 24 9 on day 0 to 129 0 on day 32 fig s2b the enrichment of 13co2 revealed aom activity in mecs for the further resolution of carbon and electron flows in ch4 fed mecs we quantified ch4 consumption and co2 production with simultaneous analysis of carbon and electron balance with a fresh replicated setup in agreement with the current profiles of the other two mecs figs s1 s2a a striking peak 0 73 ma was observed in the new setup from day 7 to day 9 before a steep decline over the next 20 days fig 1a stage 1 and stabilizing around 0 03 ma for the remainder of the system operation stage 2 ch4 was consumed at a relatively stable rate around 1 1 mmol mg protein d which was about 17 of the ch4 consumption rate in the parent reactor however the current decline was not due to exhaustion of ch4 in the anode chamber with only 14 6 utilised throughout the first operational stage stage 1 days 0 to 45 and ch4 replenishment at the beginning of stage 2 did not stimulate an increase in current output total co2 production was consistent with the higher current output in stage 1 but ch4 was consumed at a relatively constant rate indicating an alternative electron source was responsible for the initial spike in current this was supported by the calculated stoichiometric balances which indicated that the electrons and carbon recovered were considerably higher 177 6 and 267 1 respectively than what was possible through ch4 oxidation alone during the first stage table s1 calculation details in supporting information as anammox bacteria were previously reported to be capable of bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium shaw et al 2020 the anammox bacteria ca kuenenia sp in the methanotrophic consortium could potentially oxidize ammonium to generate current in our isotopic tracing batch test with 15nh4cl amendment steady 30n2 accumulation was observed which indicated the bioelectrochemical oxidation of 15nh4 in the mec fig s4b 29n2 was relatively stable fig s4b suggesting that there was limited nh4 leaching from cell lysis otherwise 29n2 would increase due to the contribution of unlabeled nh4 from cell lysis however the reaction rate of bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium was extremely low as evidenced by limited 30n2 accumulation and ammonium consumption fig s4b 4c moreover no nh4 concentration dependency of the current was observed fig s4d further faradaic calculation confirmed that the faradaic contribution from nh4 oxidation was negligible to the current generation calculation details shown in supplementary material meanwhile as h2 evolution from the water splitting was the electron accepting reaction in the cathode h2 produced in the cathode could diffuse to the anode through cem providing additional electron donor for anodic current generation our diffusion test and corresponding faradaic estimation also excluded the significant role of h2 as an alternative electron source details shown in supplementary material electron balance based on the net co2 accumulation revealed that only 66 2 of electrons could be accounted for based on the assumption that the current output during the first stage was solely from measured ch4 oxidation this result suggests the oxidation of alternate carbonaceous compounds with a higher oxidised state than ch4 zhang et al 2020 which provided additional electron donor for current generation in the mec during stage 2 the coulombic efficiency was 91 9 based on ch4 consumption and the carbon recovery was 90 4 suggesting that ch4 oxidation was the main source of generated current when the system stabilised due to the limitation of ch4 availability in the aqueous solution ch4 fuelled microbial fuel cells were normally reported with low current density zhang et al 2020 the utilization of alternative electron donors explained why higher current density was observed in our mec than most of current densities reported in relevant work to date table s2 given acetate has previously been suggested as a diffusible intermediate for ca m nitroreducens enrichments systems bai et al 2019 berger et al 2021 ding et al 2017 zhang et al 2019b its concentration was monitored throughout the two stages of operation acetate accumulation and consumption were observed during stage 1 but was below the detection limit during stage 2 fig 1a notably the prominent current change during the first stage was clearly correlated with the concentration of acetate a spike in the acetate concentration occurred prior to the spike in current suggesting that acetate was an intermediate for current evolution in the system 3 2 physiological evidence for the pathway of intermediate production 3 2 1 extracellular respiration of the methanotrophic consortium via endogenous metabolism in order to further investigate the contribution of non ch4 sources for carbon and electrons the mec systems were operated with the same biomass and operational conditions but without the supply of exogenous ch4 current output and steady charge accumulation were observed for these batches figs 2 a s6a f with a similar characteristic spike in the current output early in the operation to the one observed in the presence of ch4 in addition acetate was also found to be closely correlated with the fluctuation in the current output fig 2a it suggested that acetate driven current output was the result of the break down and oxidation of some of the seed methanotrophic biomass as no exogenous electron donors were provided to mecs the linear correlation between the equivalent electron capacity of current output and the seeding biomass amount supported that current was fuelled by biomass degradation fig 2b biomass fuelled mecs have been widely reported to extract electrons from endogenous biomass organics ge et al 2013 zhao et al 2018 the general principle of these mecs is that cells in the biomass die off when no exogenous electron donors are supplied to support the growth and survival of microorganisms and the organics released from cell lysis serve as the reducing equivalents for current output long et al 2018 yang et al 2013 more specifically biomass undergoes the first two steps of anaerobic digestion i e hydrolysis and acidogenesis releasing readily biodegradable organics normally vfas for respiration by exoelectrogens de mes et al 2003 ge et al 2013 the lysis featured process was also observed here in the control mec inoculated with the methanotrophic biomass and operated with an open circuit ammonium or phosphate release is a good indication of cell lysis since we used pbs in the medium to increase the conductivity of electrolyte measurement of phosphate increase as an indicator for cell lysis was not feasible thus we used ammonium concentration as proxy to evaluate potential cell lysis de mes et al 2003 the rapid accumulation of ammonium from 40 5 mg l 1 to 86 8 mg l 1 fig s7 is a clear indication of cell lysis hydrolysis and fermentation of the organics released during lysis was confirmed by the detection of vfas mainly acetate butyrate propionate and valerate fig s8b acetate was the dominant fermentative product and its accumulation started to decrease from day 24 accompanied by ch4 generation fig s9 suggesting acetoclastic methanogenesis this metabolic process can be evidenced by characteristic microbial community change in the open circuit mec after 48 days of operation the microbial community completely changed in comparison to the inoculum with an unclassified member of the acetogenic acetobacteraceae and methanogens of methanobacterium and methanosaeta genera dominating the community fig 3 acetate production in the closed circuit mec without exogenous ch4 supply seemed to follow a different metabolic process ammonium was relatively stable during the initial period but increased slightly at the end of the operation fig s7 as bioelectrochemical oxidation of ammonium by ca kuenenia sp in the consortium was found to be at extremely low rate fig s4 the stable ammonium suggested minor cell lysis in the biomass fuelled mec acetate saw a quick accumulation and consumption while other vfa species did not observe significant accumulation fig s8a the growth of acetogens and methanogens in the open circuit mec and the absence of these microorganisms in the closed circuit mec suggested that different metabolic pathways for acetate production and utilization were used in two conditions fig 3 in contrast to the complete shift of microbial community in the open circuit mec only a minor change was observed for the methanotrophic consortium after 48 days while ca m nitroreducens completely disappeared in the open circuit system it persisted in the closed circuit systems but with population slight declined from 33 6 to 25 4 and 22 4 in the mec with 150 ml and 75 ml of inoculum biomass respectively despite the absence of supplied ch4 in line with the community profile rt pcr results showed that ca m nitroreducens still persisted in biofilm built on electrodes in closed circuit mecs although a slight drop was also observed in comparison to the inoculum from 3 56 0 27 x 107 to 2 79 0 13 107 copies mg 1 dna and from 3 78 0 39 x 107 to 2 63 0 16 107 copies mg 1 dna in the mec with 150 ml and 75 ml of inoculum biomass respectively fig s10 these results suggest a non ch4 carbon source is being used by the methanotrophic consortium and for current generation in the system it appears that acetate oxidation makes a major faradaic contribution with or without the supply of ch4 figs 1 and 2 given the well known electrogenic acetate utilising genus geobacter lovley et al 2011 ying et al 2018 is the only member to proliferate during the operation of the mec 2 7 fig 3 it is likely that this population is responsible for the oxidation of acetate and the transfer of electrons directly to the electrode fig 1 metagenomic sequencing and subsequent genome based analyses of the community are required to assess the electrogenic potential of other populations 3 2 2 acetate production from endogenous metabolism of the methanotrophic consortium in order to investigate the source of the detected acetate in the closed circuit mecs mec batch experiments with different treatments were performed as shown in fig 4 a the mecs fuelled solely by the ca m nitroreducens enrichment showed the stable fraction of 13c labeled acetate at approximately 1 25 which represented natural abundance of 13c labeled acetate when the ca m nitroreducens enrichment was incubated in the mec in the presence of 13ch4 no obvious 13c enriched was detected fig 4b suggesting that acetate is not directly derived from the ch4 provided in the test in contrast the ca m nitroreducens enrichment preincubated with 13ch4 was found to release acetate with notable 13c fraction between 6 2 and 18 9 when it was incubated in the mec fed with non labeled ch4 fig 4c these findings suggested that ca m nitroreducens used an indirect metabolic pathway to produce acetate via certain intracellular storage substances when it respirated to electrodes which was consistent with our previous study with the ca m nitroreducens enrichment regarding its metabolic acetate production cai et al 2019 3 3 potential carbonaceous precursors and responsible microorganisms for acetate production additional experiments were performed to investigate potential sources of carbon and electrons to explain the observed generation of current and acetate in the absence of ch4 including the measurement of eps and carbon storage compounds our previous study demonstrated that intracellular carbon storage compounds can be accumulated by the consortium cai et al 2019 chromatographic analysis showed that the inoculum methanotrophic biomass contained pha mainly phb of 151 0 1 5 mg g 1 dw and 117 11 8 mg g 1 dw for inoculum used in the mec without and with ch4 amendment respectively but a negligible amount of glycogen data not shown carbon and electron balance also confirmed the phb production by the ca m nitroreducens enrichment when it grew with ch4 and nitrate details seen in supplementary material fig s11 table s3 all phb was used during the first 48 days of mec operation without exogenous ch4 supply and 76 1 was used from 117 11 8 to 28 3 5 in the mec with ch4 supply fig 5 a indicating that a substantial proportion of the current generation in both mecs originated from the oxidation of this storage compound this can be supported by the fact that a much smaller current peak was observed in the mec incubated with biomass that had been starved to consume intracellular storage compounds fig s12 importantly fish coupled with nile blue a staining of the biomass confirmed that intracellular accumulation of phb was confined to the ca m nitroreducens cells and that this population was responsible for the measured dynamics of this storage compound in the mec system fig 5b this is supported by the fact that ca m nitroreducens encodes genes for a complete metabolic pathway of phb synthesis haroon et al 2013 and the correlation between the initial phb amount and acetate production in the mec the electrons generated from pha degradation could be transported directly to poised electrodes via unknown eet pathways of ca m nitroreducens thus energy could maybe be conserved by phb metabolism via yet unidentified eet mechanisms to sustain the consortia this was consistent with the observation that a lag phase was always experienced in mecs for acetate and current burst figs 1a and 2a as increasing attachment of ca m nitroreducens to electrodes stimulate the electrons that produced from phb degradation transferring to electrodes meanwhile energy was also conserved via substrate level phosphorylation during acetate production from acetyl coa as a central intermediate in contrast ca m nitroreducens could not gain energy in the open circuit system due to the absence of an electron sink the ability of the ca m nitroreducens to rely on stored pha as an electron and carbon source and to respire to the electrode would explain its persistence and the stability of consortium community in the closed circuit mec in contrast to the open circuit mec fig 3 in addition to carbon storage polymers eps is a known source of carbon and energy for microorganisms when exogenous carbon sources become limiting wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019a protein was the predominant component for both the loosely and tightly bound eps fractions with a 50 reduction measured for both over the operation of the mec fig 5c polysaccharide only accounted for a small proportion of the eps and also showed a substantial decrease 74 3 and 59 3 for loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps respectively fig 5c over the 48 days of mec operation the measured loss of proteins and polysaccharides was reflected in the 50 60 reduction in the total organic carbon toc of the eps fig 5c were further indicative of the potential contribution of eps in the extracellular metabolism of the methanotrophic biomass when no exogenous ch4 was supplied acetate and other vfas could also partly be derived from the hydrolysis and fermentation of the eps fig 5a by fermentative populations fig 3 mapping of electron flux demonstrated that 80 7 of electrons for current production in the mec without ch4 supply was contributed by phb with the remaining 19 3 from eps see calculation in supplementary material biomass eps in the mec with ch4 supply saw a similar decline to that in the mec without ch4 supply fig 5c supporting the likely role of eps as an alternative carbon and energy source in the ch4 fed mec table s1 4 conclusions this study showed the complex carbon and energy flows for ch4 metabolising communities acetate production from phb degradation was identified as an energy source for the current generation by a methanotrophic consortium it is suggested that the current generated in the mec inoculated with a methanotrophic consortium is derived from both the break down of the seed biomass and aom ca m nitroreducens and geobacter were the main electroactive microorganisms present and are likely responsible for the extracellular transfer of electrons to the electrode ca m nitroreducens appears to utilise stored phb and geobacter likely utilises acetate produced from the break down of phb and eps further study is required to fully elucidate the metabolic pathways and potential specific interactions between these populations similar studies of the role of storage
