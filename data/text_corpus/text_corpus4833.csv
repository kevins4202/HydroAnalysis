introduction species distribution models sdms are a set of analytical tools used to identify suitable environmental conditions for a species potential establishment by identifying locations with environmental conditions that match observed species occurrence phillips et al 2009 sdms make use of species occurrences and relevant environmental predictors to provide estimates of current and future potential distributions they are popular in the field of biological invasions as they provide information to facilitate efforts intended to prevent invasions or enable early responses through rapid interception and surveillance frameworks srivastava et al 2019 2021 sdms can be categorised into two groups static and dynamic based on their treatment of environmental and or ecological aspect of a species niche static sdms treat the environment and ecological niche of a species as essentially invariant such as occurrence and climatic data averaged over long reference periods the underlying assumption is stationarity of species environment relationships elith and leathwick 2009 dynamic sdms treat the environmental and ecological components of species niches as temporally and spatially variable matching occurrences with shorter term time specific data such as interannual variations in climate laube et al 2015 a major limitation of static sdms is the averaging of environmental data which can result in inaccurate assessments of a species niche bateman et al 2016 for example sdms usually include predictors that are averaged over a period of 30 fick and hijmans 2017 or 50 hijmans et al 2005 years irrespective of the subset of years during which the species was recorded thus making the climatic data unrepresentative of the actual conditions at the time of the species presence this discrepancy can significantly affect sdm performance milanesi et al 2020 spatiotemporal variation in species occurrences have been considered in the field of movement ecology by assigning time

occurrences despite the fact that sdm performance improves when time specific environmental variables are matched to species observations scales et al 2017 although some studies such as andrew and fox 2020 have incorporated environmental variability in their models our study is unique in several ways first we focus on the mountain pine beetle a highly mobile and invasive insect pest that presents a unique challenge for predicting its distribution second we explicitly compare the predictive performance of dynamic species distribution models with static sdms which to our knowledge has not been done before for highly mobile insect pests lastly we incorporate biotic predictors in our modified static sdm framework which is unusual as most sdms only consider abiotic predictors with the availability of high resolution spatiotemporal climate databases wang et al 2016 development of time specific climate predictors has become more straightforward these datasets enable sdm users to

populations are sensitive to short term changes in environmental conditions andrew and fox 2020 here we modify the traditional static sdm framework to incorporate dynamic biotic and abiotic predictors we use the native invasive mountain pine beetle mpb dendroctonus ponderosae as a model species mpb is an irruptive forest insect native to western north america that colonizes the subcortical tissues of its host trees fig 1 a its primary host is lodgepole pine pinus contorta but it can utilize most pinus spp in its range safranyik and carroll 2006 during epidemics mpb employs pheromone mediated cooperative attacks to overcome otherwise effective tree defenses fig 1b successful colonization causes tree mortality within a year and beetles can only reproduce in a tree for a single generation landscape scale outbreaks fig 1c have occurred several times during the past century in western north america safranyik and carroll 2006 the current epidemic began in the mid 1990s and has spread over approximately 20 million ha cooke and carroll 2017 in 2006 mpb breached the rocky mountains and invaded the pine forests of alberta de la giroday et al 2012 fig 1d raising concern that the beetle will spread into the transcontinental boreal jack pine safranyik et al 2010 cooke and carroll 2017 the invasion of novel habitats by mpb provides an ideal opportunity to apply species distribution models to assess the risk of eastward spread in this study we compare the ability of static and dynamic sdms to predict the potential distribution of mpb across alberta including the impact of interannual variation in key input variables and relevant biotic predictors 2 material and methods static sdms were created for the periods 1981 2010 and 1991 2020 and dsdms for the period 2009 2019 the technical workflow is presented in fig 2 2 1 occurrence data annual data indicating the location and severity of mpb infestations was acquired from the government of alberta ministry of agriculture forestry and rural economic development for the years 2009 to 2019 briefly these data comprise the number of infested trees at georeferenced locations collected by observers from rotary wing aircraft flown at fixed elevation following a grid pattern to ensure thorough coverage of the provincial forested land base see government of alberta 2012 the dataset was screened for erroneous occurrences and duplicate records 2 1 1 static occurrences for developing static sdms all the occurrence data from the 2009 2019 study period were used the occurrences were rarefied using the spthin package r core team 2021 such that each observation fell inside a separate 800 m grid cell this reduced the final dataset to 10 008 records from a total of 393 731 spatial filtering was carried out to mitigate sampling bias in the data and improve model predictive accuracy the occurrence dataset was randomly partitioned into 30 internal testing and 70 training sets keeping aside 10 for independent testing of model performance a buffer of 110 km around mpb occurrences was created using sdmtoolbox brown et al 2017 to define the mpb accessible area 10 000 background points were generated within the mpb accessible area the choice of buffer radius was determined based on the long range dispersal abilities of mpb jackson et al 2008 a bias grid was created to account for sampling bias using the target group approach phillips et al 2009 we used raw annual aerial survey data and generated a bias grid that up weights occurrence data points with fewer neighbours in the geographic landscape using the gaussian kernel density sampling localities tool we created a bias grid using sdmtoolbox brown et al 2017 following srivastava et al 2021 to select background points with the same bias as occurrence data 2 1 2 dynamic occurrences to develop dsdms the study period was divided into 11 annual time steps 2009 2019 we defined the mpb accessible area or model calibration region m and generated 10 000 background points specific to each year within the m region we organized the data into yearly sets and for each we randomly partitioned the data into 30 internal testing and 70 training sets after keeping aside 10 for independent testing as described above details of the occurrence data are provided in supplementary information table s1 to account for sampling bias in the occurrence data we created bias grids for each year we also analysed the frequency of observed presences fop for predictors using the miamaxent package vollering et al 2019 to assess the annual occurrence patterns of mpb and determine if they agreed with the known environmental preferences of mpb see supplementary material 2 2 environmental data we used climatena v7 00 to generate averaged as well as annual climatic data climatena is a standalone software application that provides monthly annual and averaged climatic data between 1901 and 2100 wang et al 2016 2 2 1 static and dynamic predictors climatic using climatena we generated averaged climatic data for two periods 1981 2010 set 1 and 1991 2020 set 2 for each period we generated 25 averaged variables at 800 800 m resolution and clipped climatic data layers to model calibration areas variable predictors were subjected to a multicollinearity test using pearson s correlation coefficient r and only one variable from each set of correlated variables r 0 80 was selected depending on its biological importance and its relative contribution to the overall model based on jackknife resampling the method provides systematic resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias tukey 1958 we selected 5 climatic variables that best matched our selection criteria for inclusion in our models for simplicity and uniformity we maintained our selected predictors in all sdms static and dynamic however for dsdms we created two additional biotic predictors that were relevant to mpb biology see below to determine dynamic climatic predictors we generated annual variables for each year 2009 2019 at the same spatial resolution to averaged climatic datasets and clipped them to their respective calibration areas a complete list of predictors considered and selected for the analysis is provided in table 1 2 2 2 dynamic predictors biotic to build robust and biologically relevant dsdms we derived two biotic predictors as indicators of niche conditions for mpb across alberta a the annual proportion of available host trees and b the degree of introgression i e q values cullingham et al 2011 between the beetle s primary host lodgepole pine and the novel host jack pine p banksiana 2 2 2 1 proportion of host the quality of a habitat for mpb is primarily a function of available susceptible host trees typically defined as pine trees 80 years old safranyik and carroll 2006 available trees are not static and will decline with ongoing mpb infestation during an outbreak we calculated the initial proportion of susceptible pine trees in a cell from alberta vegetation inventory avi data and then used mpbspread a spatially explicit cellular automata model that simulates mpb impacts over landscapes carroll et al 2017 to make annual adjustments based on infestation status for the period 2009 to 2019 once a stand is infested with beetles the proportion of susceptible pine trees declines based on the mortality predicted by mpbspread 2 2 2 2 introgression although most pines in the native range of mpb are viable hosts the fitness i e reproductive capacity of beetles does vary amongst host species e g cerezke 1995 raffa et al 2013 langor 1989 rosenberger et al 2018 the pine forests of alberta are dominated by lodgepole pine in the west transitioning to jack pine in the east e g little and viereck 1971 range expansion has allowed mpb to access jack pine with the first successful in situ attacks confirmed in 2011 cullingham et al 2011 in a study of the genetic structure of the lodgepole pine jack pine hybrid zone in alberta cullingham et al 2012 calculated genetic ancestry q of the two species modelled the relationship between their occurrence and environment and then projected the genetic contribution of each species over the landscape we used the map of q values 0 pure lodgepole pine 100 pure jack pine from cullingham et al 2012 to estimate the degree of lodgepole pine jack pine introgression amongst mpb host trees and assess its impact on habitat suitability 2 3 species distribution model the r software package kuenm cobos et al 2019 was used to develop the species distribution models this package uses the maxent model and offers automation of model calibration final model creation and their transfers and evaluations since maxent is a presence only model it reduces challenges associated with unreliable absence records jiménez valverde et al 2008 and has been used successfully in the past to model invasive species potential distributions jarnevich and young 2015 west et al 2016 maxent is a machine learning model for developing probability distributions using the principle of maximum entropy phillips et al 2017 it is capable of modelling complex species responses by considering several types of predictor features including linear quadratic hinge threshold and product maxent also uses regularization to select features that contribute the most to the model fit we selected feature classes and fine tuned the regularization multiplier using kuenm in this case the model makes use of environmental grids and species occurrences to output a probability distribution surface where each grid cell has predicted suitability of conditions for mpb phillips et al 2017 2 3 1 model calibration the kuenm package provides best parameter selection considering statistical significance predictive power and model complexity cobos et al 2019 for each sdm and dsdm 15 candidate models were created by combining 1 set of environmental predictors 5 multiplier values 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 and all possible combinations of 3 feature classes linear quadratic and product to avoid complex and redundant features threshold and hinge features were excluded elith et al 2010 the candidate model performance based on omission rates e 5 and model complexity aicc was evaluated the best performing models statistically significant with omission rates below 5 were selected and those with δaicc values 2 were chosen as final versions for model transfer table s2 2 3 2 final models and model transfer following cobos et al 2019 sdms using the full set of occurrences and the selected parameterizations from the final models were created table s2 logistic outputs using 10 cross validation folds were produced and these models were transferred to the province of alberta using the unclipped environmental variables 2 3 3 model evaluation dynamic and static mpb distribution predictions were evaluated using the independent test data true skill statistic tss sensitivity correct classification rate ccr and omission error fraction oe at maximizing test sensitivity and specificity threshold srivastava et al 2019 2021 were used to evaluate the models tss is a measure of the difference between the rate of successes and errors whereas sensitivity is the fraction of correctly predicted presences ccr is the fraction of correctly predicted points of presence and pseudo absence whereas oe or false negative rate is the presence that is outside the area predicted we extracted the same number of pseudo absences pas as testing presences to calculate the evaluation scores pas were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences testing data and pas remained unique to each dynamic and static sdm and were excluded from all model fits area under the curve auc test has been found inappropriate for presence only models as it assigns similar weight to both commission and omission errors lobo et al 2008 hence the partial receiver operating characteristic proc ratio was calculated from 500 replicates each of which used 50 of all available points for testing with an allowable omission error of 5 peterson et al 2008 a proc ratio value of 1 0 shows a better performing model the tss ranges from 1 to 1 where values of 0 or less indicate a model performance no better than random and a value of 1 indicates perfect performance allouche et al 2006 the evaluation scores were calculated using nichetoolbox osorio olvera et al 2020 3 results 3 1 dynamic and static sdms evaluation results using the independent test data revealed a higher predictive capacity of dsdms when compared with static sdms we found that the dsdms performed significantly better than the sdm in four out of five tests specifically the dsdms outperformed static sdm i but not sdm ii in terms of false negatives while the difference was small it is possible that the dsdm s lack of improvement in false negatives could be due to the high mobility of the mountain pine beetle and its ability to rapidly shift its range in response to changing environmental conditions table 2 fig 3 3 2 mpb potential distribution annual predicted distributions from the dsdms accurately captured the temporal variability in mpb potential distributions expected with year specific environmental changes dsdms provided robust temporal trends of mpb potential distributions while generating predictions that support documented mpb distributional shifts fig 4 by contrast static sdms over predicted suitable areas for both averaged periods table 2 and fig 5 supplementary figs s2a and s2b mpb suitable areas showed a dynamic pattern of increase and decrease for the entire study period and was predicted to be highest in 2009 122 134 903 km2 and lowest in 2011 18 086 492 km2 northern regions of alberta along with the areas in the north west and south west were modelled to be at high risk of mpb invasion and future expansion 3 3 environmental responses and variable contribution suitable environmental conditions for mpb mean se of all dsdms were defined by the number of heating degree days dd 18 13 6 5 to 41 10 9 chilling degree days dd 0

figs s3a s3g not surprisingly suitable mpb distributions were found in areas where susceptible hosts were available pine proportions from 0 05 0 01 to 1 00 0 00 figs s3a s3g interestingly mpb preferred areas where q values were between 0 00 0 00 and 0 09 0 04 indicative of lodgepole pine with a low degree of jack pine introgression figs 6 and s3a s3g model jackknifing quantified the regularized training gain for individual variables for all dsdms see fig s4 although the variable responsible for increasing the training gain varied for each dsdm dd 0 tended to provide the most useful information when used in isolation whereas pine on a few occasions yielded the largest loss of training gain when omitted from the model overall q values ffp mat and dd 0 were the strongest predictors table 3 4 discussion our results support the notion of nonstationarity of species distributions in space and time mpb distribution in recently invaded habitats was dependent on temporal environmental variation consequently as predicted dsdms outperformed static sdms providing more accurate predictions of mpb distribution our findings were also in agreement with past studies that have shown that models with time specific variables produced more accurate predictions for mobile species than sdms using static variables pearce et al 2001 reside et al 2010 where possible future efforts to predict the potential distributions of short lived highly mobile species should consider dsdms over static sdms to generate more robust predictions biotic predictors comprised the largest contributions to the dsdms clearly the availability of susceptible host trees i e pine is fundamental to habitat suitability for mpb safranyik and carroll 2006 and consequently the omission of it as a variable in our models often produced the the largest loss of training gain surprisingly however the degree of lodgepole pine introgression with jack pine i e q values was the most consistent predictor of habitat suitablility amongst years even relatively small degrees of jack pine introgression reduced habitat suitability and the likelihood of observing mpb occurrence although our results seem to contradict several in vivo assessments concluding that jack pine is a suitable host for beetle development cerezke 1995 rosenberger et al 2018 epidemic mpb populations have not spread beyond areas of low introgression see figs 6c and s5 despite invasion of the pine forests of alberta in 2006 cooke and carroll 2017 colonization of susceptible trees by foraging mpb is the outcome of a complex series of interactions amongst the beetles trees and the environment safranyik and carroll 2006 further research is required to elucidate how apparently small levels of jack pine introgression negatively affect these interactions climatic variables associated with temperature especially the accumulation of chilling degree days were consistent dynamic predictors in our dsdms these results indicate that the suitability of climatic conditions remains a significant constraint to mpb invasion of eastern pine forests as suggested by safranyik et al 2010 the importance of seasonal variation in temperature to mpb populations is consistent with studies of outbreaks from the beetle s native range amelioration of extreme winter minimum temperatures stahl et al 2006 sambaraju et al 2012 and the occurrence of warmer summer conditions preisler et al 2012 sambaraju et al 2019 have been associated with increased probability of outbreaks static sdms overestimated mpb suitability ranges which in turn could lead to biased estimation of mpb distribution this likely arises from temporal mismatch between the year in which the species occurrence was recorded and the timeframe of the predictor variable dynamic sdms reduce risk of mismatch between species locations and predictors by using annual survey data and open access software that provides high resolution seasonal and annual climate data dynamic sdms can be developed by matching the specific locations of a given year with their respective environment the potential to accommodate interannual variability is critical to the management of range shifting species with irruptive dynamics such as mpb where rapid and accurate decision making is critical to attempts to mitigate impacts before populations increase to unmanageable levels carroll et al 2006 the development of dynamic sdms has historically been restricted due to the unavailability of climatic data at finer temporal resolutions milanesi et al 2020 however development of spatially explicit databases that provide climate data at monthly and yearly resolution e g chelsa karger et al 2017 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 has made the transition from static to dynamic distribution modelling possible to date the use of time specific environmental variables to predict species distributions has focused on ungulates kaczensky et al 2014 birds ingenloff and peterson 2021 and marine animals mannocci et al 2017 such modelling approaches are very rare in the case of invasive species despite several merits over static sdms invasive species are dynamic in nature and can impact native communities in ways that are hard to forecast dukes and mooney 1999 researchers have promoted the incorporation of biotic interactions into sdms srivastava et al 2019 as even at macroscales they increase the explanatory power of the sdms araújo and luoto 2007 unfortunately biotic interactions are often ignored in sdm development despite the fact that projections might be inaccurate in the case of transformed environmental conditions resulting from biotic interactions as well as changing climate srivastava et al 2019 in this study we used novel dynamic biotic predictors specific to mpb biology derived from a provincial forest inventory i e the availability of susceptible host trees and the degree of native novel host introgression in the past forest inventories have been used primarily for generating species occurrences pecchi et al 2019 however forest inventories can also be used to generate information on the presence of host trees their age height relative abundance etc which in turn can help generate specific predictors depicting important biotic interactions we have shown that novel predictors derived from large scale forest inventories can improve overall biological significance of sdms inclusion of biotic predictors advances dynamic distribution modelling beyond the use of climatic predictors alone to delineate species potential distributional ranges protection of mobile species or conservation of natural resources against harmful hitchhiking pests in large areas is a difficult task given the uncertainty of their distributions runge et al 2014 tools intended to aid such management planning should address spatio temporal variability for successful conservation outcomes andrew and fox 2020 dsdm approaches represent temporal variations in the environment that match the timing of species occurrence such dynamic approaches can lead to improved predictions of species absences bateman et al 2016 and range boundaries while reducing over prediction ingenloff and peterson 2021 moreover they can also accommodate modelled predictions under the influence of climate change serra diaz et al 2016 hence dynamic sdms can help inform time sensitive management decisions we understand that our approach is dependent on availability of relevant species occurrence and environmental data that may not be widely accessible however if relevant datasets become available in future research should be carried out to develop species specific dynamic biotic predictors the present dsdm framework will help species distribution modellers in understanding the distributional dynamics of other invasive species of concern or any mobile species particularly living in more climatically variable regions data

mpb and determine if they agreed with the known environmental preferences of mpb see supplementary material 2 2 environmental data we used climatena v7 00 to generate averaged as well as annual climatic data climatena is a standalone software application that provides monthly annual and averaged climatic data between 1901 and 2100 wang et al 2016 2 2 1 static and dynamic predictors climatic using climatena we generated averaged climatic data for two periods 1981 2010 set 1 and 1991 2020 set 2 for each period we generated 25 averaged variables at 800 800 m resolution and clipped climatic data layers to model calibration areas variable predictors were subjected to a multicollinearity test using pearson s correlation coefficient r and only one variable from each set of correlated variables r 0 80 was selected depending on its biological importance and its relative contribution to the overall model based on jackknife resampling the method provides systematic resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias tukey 1958 we selected 5 climatic variables that best matched our selection criteria for inclusion in our models for simplicity and uniformity we maintained our selected predictors in all sdms static and dynamic however for dsdms we created two additional biotic predictors that were relevant to mpb biology see below to determine dynamic climatic predictors we generated annual variables for each year 2009 2019 at the same spatial resolution to averaged climatic datasets and clipped them to their respective calibration areas a complete list of predictors considered and selected for the analysis is provided in table 1 2 2 2 dynamic predictors biotic to build robust and biologically relevant dsdms we derived two biotic predictors as indicators of niche conditions for mpb across alberta a the annual proportion of available host trees and b the degree of introgression i e q values cullingham et al 2011 between the beetle s primary host lodgepole pine and the novel host jack pine p banksiana 2 2 2 1 proportion of host the quality of a habitat for mpb is primarily a function of available susceptible host trees typically defined as pine trees 80 years old safranyik and carroll 2006 available trees are not static and will decline with ongoing mpb infestation during an outbreak we calculated the initial proportion of susceptible pine trees in a cell from alberta vegetation inventory avi data and then used mpbspread a spatially explicit cellular automata model that simulates mpb impacts over landscapes carroll et al 2017 to make annual adjustments based on infestation status for the period 2009 to 2019 once a stand is infested with beetles the proportion of susceptible pine trees declines based on the mortality predicted by mpbspread 2 2 2 2 introgression although most pines in the native range of mpb are viable hosts the fitness i e reproductive capacity of beetles does vary amongst host species e g cerezke 1995 raffa et al 2013 langor 1989 rosenberger et al 2018 the pine forests of alberta are dominated by lodgepole pine in the west transitioning to jack pine in the east e g little and viereck 1971 range expansion has allowed mpb to access jack pine with the first successful in situ attacks confirmed in 2011 cullingham et al 2011 in a study of the genetic structure of the lodgepole pine jack pine hybrid zone in alberta cullingham et al 2012 calculated genetic ancestry q of the two species modelled the relationship between their occurrence and environment and then projected the genetic contribution of each species over the landscape we used the map of q values 0 pure lodgepole pine 100 pure jack pine from cullingham et al 2012 to estimate the degree of lodgepole pine jack pine introgression amongst mpb host trees and assess its impact on habitat suitability 2 3 species distribution model the r software package kuenm cobos et al 2019 was used to develop the species distribution models this package uses the maxent model and offers automation of model calibration final model creation and their transfers and evaluations since maxent is a presence only model it reduces challenges associated with unreliable absence records jiménez valverde et al 2008 and has been used successfully in the past to model invasive species potential distributions jarnevich and young 2015 west et al 2016 maxent is a machine learning model for developing probability distributions using the principle of maximum entropy phillips et al 2017 it is capable of modelling complex species responses by considering several types of predictor features including linear quadratic hinge threshold and product maxent also uses regularization to select features that contribute the most to the model fit we selected feature classes and fine tuned the regularization multiplier using kuenm in this case the model makes use of environmental grids and species occurrences to output a probability distribution surface where each grid cell has predicted suitability of conditions for mpb phillips et al 2017 2 3 1 model calibration the kuenm package provides best parameter selection considering statistical significance predictive power and model complexity cobos et al 2019 for each sdm and dsdm 15 candidate models were created by combining 1 set of environmental predictors 5 multiplier values 0 25 0 5 1 2 4 and all possible combinations of 3 feature classes linear quadratic and product to avoid complex and redundant features threshold and hinge features were excluded elith et al 2010 the candidate model performance based on omission rates e 5 and model complexity aicc was evaluated the best performing models statistically significant with omission rates below 5 were selected and those with δaicc values 2 were chosen as final versions for model transfer table s2 2 3 2 final models and model transfer following cobos et al 2019 sdms using the full set of occurrences and the selected parameterizations from the final models were created table s2 logistic outputs using 10 cross validation folds were produced and these models were transferred to the province of alberta using the unclipped environmental variables 2 3 3 model evaluation dynamic and static mpb distribution predictions were evaluated using the independent test data true skill statistic tss sensitivity correct classification rate ccr and omission error fraction oe at maximizing test sensitivity and specificity threshold srivastava et al 2019 2021 were used to evaluate the models tss is a measure of the difference between the rate of successes and errors whereas sensitivity is the fraction of correctly predicted presences ccr is the fraction of correctly predicted points of presence and pseudo absence whereas oe or false negative rate is the presence that is outside the area predicted we extracted the same number of pseudo absences pas as testing presences to calculate the evaluation scores pas were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences testing data and pas remained unique to each dynamic and static sdm and were excluded from all model fits area under the curve auc test has been found inappropriate for presence only models as it assigns similar weight to both commission and omission errors lobo et al 2008 hence the partial receiver operating characteristic proc ratio was calculated from 500 replicates each of which used 50 of all available points for testing with an allowable omission error of 5 peterson et al 2008 a proc ratio value of 1 0 shows a better performing model the tss ranges from 1 to 1 where values of 0 or less indicate a model performance no better than random and a value of 1 indicates perfect performance allouche et al 2006 the evaluation scores were calculated using nichetoolbox osorio olvera et al 2020 3 results 3 1 dynamic and static sdms evaluation results using the independent test data revealed a higher predictive capacity of dsdms when compared with static sdms we found that the dsdms performed significantly better than the sdm in four out of five tests specifically the dsdms outperformed static sdm i but not sdm ii in terms of false negatives while the difference was small it is possible that the dsdm s lack of improvement in false negatives could be due to the high mobility of the mountain pine beetle and its ability to rapidly shift its range in response to changing environmental conditions table 2 fig 3 3 2 mpb potential distribution annual predicted distributions from the dsdms accurately captured the temporal variability in mpb potential distributions expected with year specific environmental changes dsdms provided robust temporal trends of mpb potential distributions while generating predictions that support documented mpb distributional shifts fig 4 by contrast static sdms over predicted suitable areas for both averaged periods table 2 and fig 5 supplementary figs s2a and s2b mpb suitable areas showed a dynamic pattern of increase and decrease for the entire study period and was predicted to be highest in 2009 122 134 903 km2 and lowest in 2011 18 086 492 km2 northern regions of alberta along with the areas in the north west and south west were modelled to be at high risk of mpb invasion and future expansion 3 3 environmental responses and variable contribution suitable environmental conditions for mpb mean se of all dsdms were defined by the number of heating degree days dd 18 13 6 5 to 41 10 9 chilling degree days dd 0

figs s3a s3g not surprisingly suitable mpb distributions were found in areas where susceptible hosts were available pine proportions from 0 05 0 01 to 1 00 0 00 figs s3a s3g interestingly mpb preferred areas where q values were between 0 00 0 00 and 0 09 0 04 indicative of lodgepole pine with a low degree of jack pine introgression figs 6 and s3a s3g model jackknifing quantified the regularized training gain for individual variables for all dsdms see fig s4 although the variable responsible for increasing the training gain varied for each dsdm dd 0 tended to provide the most useful information when used in isolation whereas pine on a few occasions yielded the largest loss of training gain when omitted from the model overall q values ffp mat and dd 0 were the strongest predictors table 3 4 discussion our results support the notion of nonstationarity of species distributions in space and time mpb distribution in recently invaded habitats was dependent on temporal environmental variation consequently as predicted dsdms outperformed static sdms providing more accurate predictions of mpb distribution our findings were also in agreement with past studies that have shown that models with time specific variables produced more accurate predictions for mobile species than sdms using static variables pearce et al 2001 reside et al 2010 where possible future efforts to predict the potential distributions of short lived highly mobile species should consider dsdms over static sdms to generate more robust predictions biotic predictors comprised the largest contributions to the dsdms clearly the availability of susceptible host trees i e pine is fundamental to habitat suitability for mpb safranyik and carroll 2006 and consequently the omission of it as a variable in our models often produced the the largest loss of training gain surprisingly however the degree of lodgepole pine introgression with jack pine i e q values was the most consistent predictor of habitat suitablility amongst years even relatively small degrees of jack pine introgression reduced habitat suitability and the likelihood of observing mpb occurrence although our results seem to contradict several in vivo assessments concluding that jack pine is a suitable host for beetle development cerezke 1995 rosenberger et al 2018 epidemic mpb populations have not spread beyond areas of low introgression see figs 6c and s5 despite invasion of the pine forests of alberta in 2006 cooke and carroll 2017 colonization of susceptible trees by foraging mpb is the outcome of a complex series of interactions amongst the beetles trees and the environment safranyik and carroll 2006 further research is required to elucidate how apparently small levels of jack pine introgression negatively affect these interactions climatic variables associated with temperature especially the accumulation of chilling degree days were consistent dynamic predictors in our dsdms these results indicate that the suitability of climatic conditions remains a significant constraint to mpb invasion of eastern pine forests as suggested by safranyik et al 2010 the importance of seasonal variation in temperature to mpb populations is consistent with studies of outbreaks from the beetle s native range amelioration of extreme winter minimum temperatures stahl et al 2006 sambaraju et al 2012 and the occurrence of warmer summer conditions preisler et al 2012 sambaraju et al 2019 have been associated with increased probability of outbreaks static sdms overestimated mpb suitability ranges which in turn could lead to biased estimation of mpb distribution this likely arises from temporal mismatch between the year in which the species occurrence was recorded and the timeframe of the predictor variable dynamic sdms reduce risk of mismatch between species locations and predictors by using annual survey data and open access software that provides high resolution seasonal and annual climate data dynamic sdms can be developed by matching the specific locations of a given year with their respective environment the potential to accommodate interannual variability is critical to the management of range shifting species with irruptive dynamics such as mpb where rapid and accurate decision making is critical to attempts to mitigate impacts before populations increase to unmanageable levels carroll et al 2006 the development of dynamic sdms has historically been restricted due to the unavailability of climatic data at finer temporal resolutions milanesi et al 2020 however development of spatially explicit databases that provide climate data at monthly and yearly resolution e g chelsa karger et al 2017 and terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 has made the transition from static to dynamic distribution modelling possible to date the use of time specific environmental variables to predict species distributions has focused on ungulates kaczensky et al 2014 birds ingenloff and peterson 2021 and marine animals mannocci et al 2017 such modelling approaches are very rare in the case of invasive species despite several merits over static sdms invasive species are dynamic in nature and can impact native communities in ways that are hard to forecast dukes and mooney 1999 researchers have promoted the incorporation of biotic interactions into sdms srivastava et al 2019 as even at macroscales they increase the explanatory power of the sdms araújo and luoto 2007 unfortunately biotic interactions are often ignored in sdm development despite the fact that projections might be inaccurate in the case of transformed environmental conditions resulting from biotic interactions as well as changing climate srivastava et al 2019 in this study we used novel dynamic biotic predictors specific to mpb biology derived from a provincial forest inventory i e the availability of susceptible host trees and the degree of native novel host introgression in the past forest inventories have been used primarily for generating species occurrences pecchi et al 2019 however forest inventories can also be used to generate information on the presence of host trees their age height relative abundance etc which in turn can help generate specific predictors depicting important biotic interactions we have shown that novel predictors derived from large scale forest inventories can improve overall biological significance of sdms inclusion of biotic predictors advances dynamic distribution modelling beyond the use of climatic predictors alone to delineate species potential distributional ranges protection of mobile species or conservation of natural resources against harmful hitchhiking pests in large areas is a difficult task given the uncertainty of their distributions runge et al 2014 tools intended to aid such management planning should address spatio temporal variability for successful conservation outcomes andrew and fox 2020 dsdm approaches represent temporal variations in the environment that match the timing of species occurrence such dynamic approaches can lead to improved predictions of species absences bateman et al 2016 and range boundaries while reducing over prediction ingenloff and peterson 2021 moreover they can also accommodate modelled predictions under the influence of climate change serra diaz et al 2016 hence dynamic sdms can help inform time sensitive management decisions we understand that our approach is dependent on availability of relevant species occurrence and environmental data that may not be widely accessible however if relevant datasets become available in future research should be carried out to develop species specific dynamic biotic predictors the present dsdm framework will help species distribution modellers in understanding the distributional dynamics of other invasive species of concern or any mobile species particularly living in more climatically variable regions data

24166,vegetation plays a vital role in global carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems and could be affected by climate changes and human activities in the current context of rapid urban expansion understanding the impacts of urbanization and climate changes on net primary productivity npp is helpful to sequester more atmospheric carbon and achieve carbon neutrality we explored the terrestrial spatio temporal npp dynamics in china during the years 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively using the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model based on multi source remote sensing data we then proposed a neighborhood substitution model to isolate the effects of urbanization and climate changes on npp and examined the driving forces for the npp update the results revealed that while urbanization was likely to reduce npp averagely by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c in the two stages climate changes improved npp by 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c respectively indicating that the climate changes offset the reduced vegetation productivity from rapid urbanization the results highlighted that the rapidly urbanizing process reduced vegetation productivity due to the lost vegetated land and degraded vegetation productivity in addition the residual effect other than urbanization and the climate changes also played a part on the degraded vegetation carbon sequestration reducing npp by an average of 4 29 tg c yea r 1 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in the two stages which could be related to other human activities we recommend protecting vegetation cover and making informed land use plan as means to improve carbon sequestration in the context of rapid urban expansion and climate changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords net primary productivity neighborhood substitution urbanization climate changes quantitative assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanization has been observed in the last few decades and although urban built up land accounts for less than 3 of the global land area more than 60 of global fossil energy carbon emissions come from cities grimm et al 2008 huo et al 2022 urban expansion is often accompanied by changes in land cover over the urban area and its surroundings shifts in population changes in economic centers and urban functions and structures guan et al 2019 zhou and chen 2018 also the urbanization process has an important impact on the regional climate soil and vegetation growth for example the impact of the heat island effect caused by urbanization has caused concern in urban environment and public health studies yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 urbanization imposes a dramatic impact on the material and energy flow of terrestrial ecosystems especially on the carbon cycle terrestrial vegetation is an important global carbon sink and the changes in carbon sequestration capacity from vegetation is mainly influenced by climate changes and human activities where urbanization is one of the most typical cases of the human activities alexander and wu 2012 ge et al 2021 furthermore in recent years the more frequency of climate extremes and natural disasters caused by climate changes has affected the carbon sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems ge et al 2021 therefore quantifying the effects of urbanization and climate changes on carbon sequestration from terrestrial vegetation is important for designing appropriate strategies to address the challenges facing sustainable urban development terrestrial vegetation is an ecosystem component that plays a key role in sequestering carbon energy exchange biogeochemical cycle and regulating the global carbon balance wu et al 2020 the vegetation carbon sink was effectively reflected by net primary productivity npp which is the accumulated amount of organic matter produced by vegetation in a unit area over a time period npp represents the portion of organic carbon fixed by the plant minus its own respiratory consumption and is used for the growth of vegetation ito 2011 liu et al 2021 potter et al 2003 field observations are usually conducted for precise site based studies but difficult to be launched over large areas long time series npp calculated based on multi source remote sensing imagery can facilitate to monitor and assess the state of the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales sha et al 2022 song et al 2018 yuan et al 2014 urban expansion is one of the important factors causing changes in npp and there have been comprehensive researches on urban growth and its effects on terrestrial vegetation lu et al 2010 while most studies have shown that urbanization causes different degrees of loss of terrestrial npp it is less clear how npp in urban areas was updated given a number of factors may impose direct and indirect impact on npp in an urban environment wu et al 2014b loss of vegetated land from urbanization may reduce npp but updated urban environment related to intensified human activities may promote vegetation growth guan et al 2019 the balance of the complex impact from multiple factors is so far rarely quantified in literature meanwhile the impact of climate change on npp has been comprehensively examined climate changes e g precipitation and temperature have exhibited different impact on terrestrial npp for example global warming was likely to extend the growing season of vegetation and thus improve vegetation productivity ge et al 2021 but others showed that temperature precipitation and solar radiation can exhibit negative effects on vegetation growth qu et al 2020 to quantify the effect of urbanization on vegetation carbon sequestration a common way is to compare the difference of vegetation productivity proxied by npp in vegetated and urbanized areas npp in vegetated areas observing no land cover changes during the study time provides a baseline for studying the effect on npp from urbanization tian et al 2019 wu et al 2014b liner system models was also used to assess the impact of urbanization xu et al 2018 but this method was assumed to exist in the study system between the expansion of built up land and carbon sequestration which oversampled the effect of urbanization on npp residual trend based and regression based models were often used to quantify the impact of climate change on npp ge et al 2021 residual trend based models are relatively convenient to implement but difficult to distinguish the complex interactions of multiple contributing factors zhao et al 2021 regression based models are probably categorized as one of the most popular ways to separate the impacts on vegetation productivity from climate and human activities though are limited with considerable uncertainties he et al 2015 quantitative analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of the impact of urbanization and climate factors on npp can help to proactively achieve the carbon neutrality the impact from urbanization and climate changes varies over space at the same time understanding the temporal dynamics of the impact from urbanization is important for policy intervention china is the largest developing country in the world and has experienced very rapid urbanization since its opening up especially in the last 20 years chen et al 2018 tian et al 2019 the rapid economic development and urban expansion have encroached considerable vegetated area while increased energy consumption which has led to reduced carbon sequestration and increase in carbon emissions to effectively respond to global warming and achieve the goal of carbon neutrality china should resort to multiple channels to increase carbon sinks and mitigate carbon emissions chen et al 2020 analysis of the effects of urbanization and climate changes on the terrestrial vegetation can provide a comprehensive perspective on how complex factors affect carbon sequestration by vegetation we simulated and calculated the urbanization and climate driven npp values individually based on multi source remote sensing data and isolated the impacts of urbanization and climate change for analysis the main objectives of this study were to effectively modeling the impacts of urbanization and climate changes on npp in china under different socioeconomic development stages during the past two decades to highlight the spatial and temporal variability of the different impacts and their driving mechanisms intending to propose recommendations on improving terrestrial carbon sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study the mainland of china was selected as the study area as shown in fig 1 the terrain in china is complex and diverse containing multiple geomorphic units with varied landform types and diversity of vegetation cover in recent decades due to the influence of climate changes and human activities the land cover in china has changed significantly and the area of vegetation cover has increased significantly duo et al 2016 however the rapid expansion of urbanization and the occurrence of extreme climate events have led to critical impacts on the vegetation growth in china li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 2 2 data collection and preprocessing the datasets used in this paper include remotely sensed vegetation products meteorological data land cover data and socioeconomic statistical data majority of the required datasets were sourced from and processed on the google earth engine gee platform all data were selected from 2000 2020 in terms of the temporal window and resampled uniformly to a spatial resolution of 500 m normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is an important indicator to vegetation growth health which was reversed from remote sensing imagery the ndvi data in the gee platform were derived from the mod13a1 v6 1 product which was based on the maximum value method to generate 16 day synthetic data with a resolution of 500 m ndvi is calculated by normalized difference between infrared and near infrared bands and is one of the important parameters reflecting crop growth and nutrient information ndvi which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing national oceanic and atmospheric administration advanced very high resolution radiometer noaa avhrr derived ndvi the modis ndvi products is computed from atmospherically corrected bi directional surface reflectance that have been masked for water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows meteorological data including monthly temperature precipitation solar radiation and evapotranspiration data were used to calculate terrestrial npp came from an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 land hosted by the gee platform era5 land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics muñoz sabater et al 2021 land cover data were obtained from the 1990 2020 landsat derived annual china land cover dataset clcd produced by yang et al yang and huang 2021 the product has a resolution of 30 m and its overall accuracy reaches 79 31 and the product was evaluated based on third party test samples and its overall classification accuracy was better than that of mcd12q1 esacci lc from glc and globeland30 products the clcd mainly classified chinese land into nine categories cropland forest shrub grassland water snow ice barren impervious and wetland the statistics include data on carbon emissions and urbanization rates the carbon emission data came from the carbon emission accounts datasets for emerging economies ceads https www ceads net cn which includes multi scale accurate and up to date data on energy emissions and socioeconomic trade in china and other countries guan et al 2021 shan et al 2018 2020 the urbanization rate calculated as the percentage of the total urbanized population to the total population in china each year was obtained from the national statistical yearbook of china http www stats gov cn used to evaluate the degree of urbanization of the country wang et al 2021 in addition to better demonstrate the spatial variation of climate change impacts on npp the study area was divided into four wet dry regions i e humid semi humid arid and semi arid regions fig 2 this data was obtained from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn with division of regions based on annual dryness index monthly mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and vegetation type the main vegetation in humid areas is tropical forests and other mixed forests while forest steppe dominates the semi humid areas grasslands and desert grasslands in semi arid areas and deserts in arid areas pei et al 2013 2 3 temporal variation in urbanization intensity the rapid urbanization has had a great impact on resources and the environment and the effects of urbanization were not consistent in different development stages cui et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the impervious surface area ratio percentage of impervious was defined as the percentage of impervious surface area to total land area each year in order to analyze the effects of urbanization and climate changes on terrestrial npp at different stages of urbanization we divided the urbanization stages based on the average urbanization rate and percentage of impervious from 2000 to 2020 fig 3 the average urbanization rate in the last 20 years is 50 52 and the average impervious surface area ratio is 0 6245 the urbanization rates from each year from 2000 to 2010 were all smaller than the average and that from 2010 to 2020 were all higher than the average thus the period was divided into a slow urbanization stage 2000 2010 and a rapid urbanization stage 2010 2020 2 4 methods 2 4 1 mapping npp the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model was used to calculate the terrestrial npp in china from 2000 to 2020 the casa a light use efficiency lue model is widely used to estimate and simulate terrestrial npp at different scales liu et al 2019 wen et al 2018 the input of the model includes ndvi and meteorological data variables such as solar radiation temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the workflow for calculating npp are as follows 1 npp x t apar x t ε x t where npp x t g c m 2 is the net primary productivity fixed by vegetation at a pixel cell x in month t apar x t g c m 2 mont h 1 is the amount of photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by vegetation at a pixel cell

radiation at a pixel cell x in month t fpar x t is the proportion of absorption of incident photosynthetic effective radiation by the vegetation r is the proportion of effective solar radiation that vegetation can use to the total solar radiation r 0 5 field et al 1995 xu et al 2018 yan et al 2021a 3 fpar x t ndvi x t ndv i i min ndv i i max ndv i i min fpa r max fpa r min fpa r min where ndv i i max and ndv i i min indicate the maximum and minimum ndvi values of the i th vegetation type respectively the ndv i i max value corresponds to the 95 lower percentile of ndvi of the i th vegetation type and the ndv i i min value corresponds to the 5 lower percentile of ndvi and fpa r max 0 95 and fpa r min 0 001 fpar x t can be calculated by the ratio vegetation index sr 4 fpar x t sr x t s r i

eq 5 based on the ndv i i min and ndv i i max the research showed that the fpar value estimated using fpar ndvi was higher than the measured value and the fpar estimated using fpar sr was lower than the measured value but with less error therefore in this paper the average value of the two methods was calculated to minimize the error of the results α 0 5 as shown in eq 6 6 fpar x t α fpa r ndvi 1 α fpa r sr the actual light use efficiency ε x t can be obtained in the following 7 ε x t t ε 1 x t t ε 2 x t w ε x t ε max where t ε 1 x t and t ε 2 x t indicate the stress effects of low and high temperatures on light energy utilization respectively and are calculated based on maximum and minimum temperatures w ε x t is the coefficient of water stress impact which reflecting the effect of water conditions and is computed with regional evapotranspiration mm ε max gc m j 1 is the monthly maximum light use efficiency the value of maximum light use efficiency varies with vegetation type and different ε max value was used in the calculation for different vegetation types su et al 2022 yu et al 2009 in order to improve the accuracy of npp calculation ε max was calibrated based on the relationship between observed npp and calculated npp with modified least squares mls and the calibrated value of ε max was used in this paper zhu et al 2006 2 4 2 modeling the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp land cover changes and climate changes are believed to be the important factors affecting npp liu et al 2019 yan et al 2021b urbanization degrades vegetation cover into impervious lands and inevitably reduces vegetation productivity kong et al 2019 the impact from climate fluctuations on npp is complex and hard to model to separate the impact on terrestrial npp from urbanization and climate changes during a period from a start year ys to an end year ye we simulate the values of npp under climate change driven and urbanization driven conditions in the climate driven simulations we adopt a fixed climate factors method to quantify the impact of climate change on npp and in the urbanization driven simulations we adopt the neighborhood substitution approach to quantify the impact of urbanization on npp during ys ye a method based on neighborhood similarity property substitution the following is a detailed description of the method in the different simulations urbanization driven simulations we first calculate the npp in newly urbanized area based on an assumption that no land cover changes had ever occurred during the period and that the npp of the newly urbanized area in the end year ye could be estimated from the npp statistics in the neighborhood area having the same land cover in the initial year ys taking npp changes from 2000 to 2010 as an example np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the actual npp values in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively and nourba n 00 10 represents the theoretical npp for the newly urbanized area which did not experience urbanization the workflow is shown in fig 4 in the neighborhood with a limited size locations covered by the same land cover type are assumed to have the identical environmental attributes climate soil etc i e the theoretical npp values are close under similar environmental conditions therefore the actual npp value in the newly urbanized area was replaced by the average value of the actual npp within the neighborhood with the same land cover type and nourba n 00 10 was computed fig 4c to determine the size of the neighborhood window experiments were carried out with 10 km as the starting value and 5 km as the increment we calculated the variation of nourba n 00 10 as the size of neighborhood for each province in china separately and the results show that the mean value of nourba n 00 10 no longer changes when the size of neighborhood window exceeds 95 km for the computational efficiency we set 95 km as the neighborhood radius when computing nourba n 00 10 nourba n 00 10 represents the value of npp after excluding the impact of urbanization so the difference between its value and the actual npp value in the initial year i e the year of 2000 means that the npp changes is only affected by climate change and other factors and the value of npp change caused by the impact of urbanization in 2000 2010 slow urbanization stage can be calculated according to eq 8 9 8 np p 2010 np p 2000 u r b a n i z a t i o n c l i m a t e r e d i s u a l f a c t o r s nourba n 00 10 np p 2000 c l i m a t e r e d i s u a l f a c t o r s δ u r 00 10 np p 2010 np p 2000 nourba n 2010 np p 2000 9 np p 2010 nourba n 00 10 where np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the actual npp value in 2000 and 2010 respectively δ u r 00 10 is the amount of npp changes affected only by urbanization from 2000 to 2010 similarly the amount of npp changes in 2010 2020 rapid urbanization stage and 2000 2020 from the effects of urbanization expansion alone can be calculated with eq 10 11 10 δ u r 10 20 np p 2020 nourba n 10 20 δ u r 00 20 np p 2020 nourba n 00 20 11 δ u r 00 10 δ u r 10 20 where np p 2020 is the actual npp value in 2020 nourba n 10 20 and nourba n 00 20 are the npp value unaffected by urbanization during the periods 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 δ u r 10 20 and δ u r 00 20 are the amount of npp changes only affected by urbanization during the periods 2000 2010 and 2000 2020 climate change driven simulations we calculated the climate change impact on terrestrial npp by fixing the changes in climate factors over time during the study time period ys ye it was assumed that the climate factors did not change including temperature precipitation and solar radiation while other factors changed over time the climate factors in ys and all factors other than the climate in ye were adopted to calculate npp at ye using casa model based on the above assumptions indicating the npp of ys ye without climate changes and all factors in ys were adopted to calculate npp of ys taking npp changes from 2000 to 2010 as an example np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the observed npp values in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively noclimat e 00 10 represents the npp in 2010 which was not affected by climate change during 2000 2010 noclimat e 00 10 was calculated by taking the climate factors for 2000 and other factors for 2010 into the casa model i e keeping the climate factors unchanged for the period 2000 2010 the climate change impact on npp during the slow and rapid urbanization stage can be assessed by eqs 12 14 12 δ c l 00 10 np p 2010 noclimat e 00 10 13 δ c l 10 20 np p 2020 noclimat e 10 20 δ c l 00 20 np p 2020 noclimat e 00 20 14 δ c l 00 10 δ c l 10 20 where np p 2010 and np p 2020 are the observed npp values in 2010 and 2020 noclimat e 00 10 noclimat e 10 20 and noclimat e 00 20 are modeled npp values unaffected by climate changes during the periods 2000 2010 2000 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively δ c l 00 10 δ c l 10 20 and δ c l 00 20 are modeled npp changes only affected by climate changes during the periods 2000 2010 2000 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively 2 4 3 reliability assessment in this paper confidence analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to calculate and test the uncertainty of the results the confidence analysis indicates the uncertainty of the model by calculating a confidence interval at 95 confidence level which was obtained by calculating the mean 1 96 sd standard deviation of the model results which reflects the main range of the results shao et al 2016 the sensitivity of the model parameters was proxied using a sensitivity coefficient which made the model parameters dimensionless using the rate of change the sensitivity coefficient can reflect the effect of the model parameters on the results and it can be calculated by the eq 15 beven 1979 zhang et al 2021 15 s i r p i p i r where s i denotes the sensitivity coefficient of the i th factor r is the value of model results p i is the value of the i th factor in this study the model parameters include solar radiation temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and ndvi the sensitivity coefficients of the parameters to the model results were calculated based on eq 15 and the model results include the impact of urbanization and climate change on npp for the periods 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 3 results 3 1 urbanization and land cover changes the urban expansion and land vegetation cover changes in china in the past two decades are reflected by the ratio of land cover changes in two divided stages table 1 overall the highest percentage of area converted into other land cover types was found for cropland 33 6 in 2000 2010 and 28 7 in 2010 2020 followed by grassland 28 2 in 2000 2010 and 31 8 in 2010 2020 in the slow and rapid urbanization stages the main conversion targets of cropland were impervious surface 6 3 and 6 2 forest 11 8 and 11 0 and grassland 13 1 and 10 0 grassland and forest were the main sources of conversion to cropland mainly due to land reclamation in the northeast and northwest of china yang and huang 2021 the results of land cover conversion also revealed a certain degree of interconversion between wasteland and grassland over the past 20 years liu et al 2020 in both the slow and rapid urbanization stages most of the newly impervious surface was converted from cropland in addition to a limited part of grassland and water bodies du et al 2011 based on the land cover transfer ratio matrix we further compared the net change values for each land types in the slow and rapid urbanization stages as shown in fig 5 in the last 20 years the net increase in impervious surface area was the largest in both the magnitude and the changing rate and the increase was greater in the rapid urbanization stage 63 000 km² than in the slow urbanization stage 58 000 km² which indicates that the urbanization process tended to accelerate in the second period if compared to that in the first period forests were identified as the next showing the most obvious change the implementation of a series of policies such as the gain for green project after 2000 has significantly increased china s forest area xie et al 2018 the net change in cropland was negative and the net loss was the greatest during the slow urbanization stage but the decreasing rate was largely mitigated during the rapid urbanization stage probably due to the implementation of the red lines for maintaining 120 million hectares cropland after 2010 xie et al 2018 3 2 npp reduced from urbanization the newly urbanized areas in the period 2000 2020 showed a negative effect on terrestrial npp the impact of urbanization process on terrestrial npp under the slow and rapid urbanization stages was simulated by urbanization driven simulations or the neighborhood similarity property substitution fig 6 the results showed that urban expansion reduced npp by an average of 4 93 tg c yea r 1 during 2000 2020 and urbanization in the slow and rapid urbanization stages in total has reduced npp by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c respectively which indicated that higher urban intensity may present more reducing effect on npp while existing studies suggested that the urban heat island effect due to accelerated urbanization would contribute to the increase of npp ding et al 2010 pei et al 2013 the overall negative effect of urban sprawl on npp was much greater than the positive effect for example for the two most developed regions guangdong gd and shanghai sh fig 6d which presented high urbanization intensity the reduced npp during the rapid urbanization stage was less prominent than that in the slow urbanization stage npp reduced by 0 15 tg c and 1 3 tg c in the slow urbanization stage in sh and gd and 0 12 and 1 21 tg c in the rapid urbanization stage respectively the less impact on npp under the rapid urbanization period could be attributed to improved vegetation management or environmental contributions to vegetation growth such as heat island effect li et al 2018 given a warmer temperature increase is reported to present a positive role on vegetation growth guan et al 2019 thus counteracted the negative impact of urbanization on npp since the reform and opening up china has observed rapid urbanization the negative impacts of urbanization on china s terrestrial npp were mainly concentrated in the eastern and coastal regions and a few arid regions in northwest china fig 6a 6c the negative effect of urbanization on npp is closely correlated to the distance to urban center fig 6d indicating that a higher intensity in urbanization may cause a greater negative impact on npp newly urbanized area was mainly derived from cropland with 80 of the newly urbanized area was converted from cropland in the past 20 years table 1 in the slow and rapid urbanization stages 49 000 km² and 52 000 km² of cropland have been turned into urban built up respectively the reduced area cropland and grassland may explain in part the loss of npp during the study period from fig 6 it can be learned that urbanization affects the decrease of npp mainly in the middle and low latitudes where cropland is occupied leading to more cropland being reclaimed in the middle and high latitudes e g the northeast of china wang et al 2017 the npp of cropland totaled 275 42 tg c in 2000 and 258 66 tg c in 2010 with considerable decrease of npp possibly because of the massive conversion of cropland into urban built up after 2010 due to the implementation of some cropland protection policies the total area of cropland has been increased and npp has been effectively improved ge et al 2021 wang et al 2017 and the total value of cropland npp is 290 68 tg c in 2020 in the first period i e 2000 2010 urban expansion mainly encroached cropland while grassland and forest explained much of the urbanized area in the second period in both cases reduced vegetation would decrease terrestrial vegetation carbon sink 3 3 npp reduction offset by climate changes global climate changes may update the functions and structure of terrestrial ecosystems to assess the impacts from the spatial distribution of climate change on terrestrial npp we simulated the terrestrial npp assuming no climate changes from 2000 to 2020 with results shown in fig 7 although the climate changes may increase or decrease vegetation npp it shows an overall facilitative effect to npp increasing it by an average of 9 51 tg c yea r 1 during 2000 2020 and a total of 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c during the slow urbanization and rapid urbanization stages respectively compared with the impact of urbanization on npp that from the climate changes showed more spatially extensive but less intensive during the study period the average climate induced increase in npp was 2 59 gc m 2 yea r 1 3 07 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 61 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the slow and rapid urbanization stage respectively a positive impact of climate changes on npp was observed in southern and central china but negative in most other regions including western china which is likely related to the varied response from the different vegetation types across those regions the impact on terrestrial npp from the climate changes also showed temporal variation with wider area and more positive effect observed in the first period than in the second period fig 7a and 7b in the humid and semi humid regions in southern central and northeastern china fig 2 dominated by forests and croplands the changes in climate played a promoting role on npp opposed to the negative impact in most other regions in temperate and high latitude zones where precipitation was not a constraint factor on vegetation growth higher temperature was reported to increase npp due to extended length of growing season guan et al 2019 song et al 2018 in the arid regions mainly covered by sparse vegetation or desert grassland increased temperature and insufficient precipitation discouraged vegetation growth thus reduced vegetation productivity fig 7 3 4 reliability assessment of the results in order to assess the reliability of the results the uncertainty of the results and the sensitivity of the parameters were investigated using confidence analysis and sensitivity analysis beven 1979 the results show that at 95 confidence level the confidence intervals for the impact of urbanization on npp are 26 24 106 45 and 21 12 92 17 for the period 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively and the confidence intervals for the impact of climate changes on npp are 9 86 16 01 and 8 93 12 16 respectively we compared the results of this paper with those of studies from the same period and region as our study and found that the range of values of previous studies were similar to the confidence intervals of our results and the spatial distribution of the results was generally consistent ge et al 2021 guan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 pei et al 2013 wen et al 2019 it was reported that china s terrestrial npp decreased by 5 27 tg c year 1 with urbanization during 2000 2006 and the range of values was 0 100 pei et al 2013 liu et al calculated the impact of urbanization and climate change on npp in 2000 2010 with values ranging from 0 400 and 21 17 respectively liu et al 2019 wen et al analyzed the impact of urbanization on npp in 2000 2010 with the range of 0 265 wen et al 2019 moreover the npp in china increased by 1 88 gc m 2 yea r 1 with climate change during 2001 2016 and the range of values was 10 10 ge et al 2021 the results of this paper were in good agreement with the results of previous studies indicating that the results based on the proposed method are reliable and valid the sensitivity analysis indicates the degree to which the model output varies with changes in the input parameters the sensitivity of the model was performed for the main parameters including temperature precipitation solar radiation and ndvi ndvi was found to be the most sensitive parameter in the urbanization driven model with sensitivity coefficients averaged 0 57 and 0 51 for 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively while the most sensitive variable was the solar radiation 0 55 in the period 2000 2010 and the temperature in the period 2010 2020 0 49 we then selected two typical regions including the yangtze river delta yrd and pearl river delta prd which are among showing the most rapid urbanization to compare the impact of the considered factors from the current study with similar studies based on the statistical yearbook data the average urbanization rate of yrd was 72 11 and prd was 67 05 during 2000 2020 the results are shown in fig 8 and the statistical analysis revealed that the impact of urbanization on npp in the yrd was 5 28 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 5 13 gc m 2 yea r 1 for 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively and 7 33 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 7 57 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the prd and the impact of climate change on npp in the two stages for the yrd were gc m 2 yea r 1 and 0 71 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 29 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 76 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the prd the negative effect of urbanization on the npp for prd and yrd in both 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 varied high to low from the center of the urban agglomeration to the surrounding area suggesting more negative impact on npp in the areas with higher urbanization intensity furthermore compared to prd yrd had higher urbanization and therefore more npp reduced from urbanization the negative impact of climate changes on npp in prd was mainly located in the central area characterized by urbanized area which suggested that climate changes mainly showed negative impact on npp in urban area and positive impact on non urban area which was consistent with the previous studies li et al 2022 wu et al 2014a climate changes had the identical effect on npp in yrd except a greater range of urbanized area in yrd the previous study indicated that the npp of prd increased by 1 54 gc m 2 yea r 1 during 2000 2020 due to climate change li et al 2022 and the npp in prd reduced by 0 35 tg c for urbanization during 2001 2009 yan et al 2018 npp in yrd decreased by 3 43 gc m 2 yea r 1 for urbanization and increased by 0 5 gc m 2 yea r 1 for climate change during 1999 2010 wu et al 2014a the urbanization reduced npp by 2 45 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 4 18 gc m 2 yea r 1 in the yrd and prd respectively from 1982 to 2015 zhang et al 2021 4 discussions urbanization presented a critical impact on energy and mass cycle in terrestrial ecosystems including carbon cycle li et al 2020 the impact from urbanization process and climate changes on terrestrial npp could vary considerably under different urbanization stages and spatial contexts it has been a challenge to understand how terrestrial vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration from vegetation responds to different factors multi source remote sensing data combined with advanced ecological modeling methods can provide useful channels to understand such patterns the current study investigate the impact from urbanization and climate changes during the last two decades and some valuable patterns were revealed 4 1 climate change offsets npp decrease induced by urbanization climate changes offset the decrease in npp caused by urbanization although it was reported some indirect effects of urbanization e g heat island effect can promote vegetation growth lu et al 2021 the overall effect of urbanization process is more likely to reduce vegetation npp guan et al 2019 jonsson et al 2003 the impact of urbanization on npp change was found much stable in both the slow and rapid urbanization periods while the positive contribution of climate changes to npp was more prominent in the first period than that in the second figs 7 and 9a vegetated land cover could be encroached by urbanization which may cause changes in the landscape of the vegetation cover at the same time the reduced npp from urbanization to the average npp in the whole study area uta in percentage decreased along the years fig 9b to mitigate the side impact of urban expansion on vegetation carbon sequestration there is a need to increase the carbon sequestration density from the limited green space in urban areas in china great effort has been input to promote vegetation cover and offset the negative effects of urbanization by increasing vegetation cover e g by afforestation fig 5 and table 1 forests contributed the most to china s terrestrial carbon sink yu et al 2022 and the expansion of forest areas in recent years has indeed led to improved npp table 1 and fig 9b with an average increase of 2 19 gc m 2 yea r 1 from 2000 to 2010 and 5 49 gc m 2 yea r 1 from 2010 to 2020 although the increase of forest area was low in the rapid urbanization stage the total npp in china was increasing which indicates that the increase of vegetation cover can effectively improve vegetation carbon sequestration fig 10 4 2 residual effect on the change of npp in addition to urbanization and climate changes closely related to vegetation growth there are a number of other anthropogenic and natural factors that can also have some impact on npp ge et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 such as anthropogenic land management policies fertilization of soil deforestation and the occurrence of forest wildfires the effect of residual factors on npp was obtained by subtracting the effect of urbanization and climate on npp from the change of npp over the study period fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the impact of residual factors on npp over the period 2000 2020 showing an overall negative impact on npp the spatial distribution pattern indicates a negative effect from residual factors on npp in eastern and northeastern china while most likely positive in western and southeastern china the negative effect of residual factors on npp is generally much lower in 2010 2020 than that in 2000 2010 though exception of enhancement effect was also noticed in a few regions for example in inner mongolia and qinghai tibet plateau regions the negative effect of residual factors on npp has increased more obviously and since these regions are mainly grassland areas such phenomenon may be related to the increase of local grazing intensity sun et al 2021 and overgrazing would destroy the local vegetation diversity and thus reduce the npp of vegetation in this region fedrigo et al 2018 ge et al 2021 as seen in fig 11 the impact of residual factors on terrestrial npp in china might not be neglected residual factors reduced npp by an average of 4 29 tg c yea r 1 in 2000 2010 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in 2010 2020 confirming the part unexplained from the impacts of either human activities or climate changes on npp in the current context of rapid economic development it might deserve to investigate further the residual factors to improve terrestrial npp such as implementing rational land management policies avoiding overgrazing of grasslands and improved management for croplands 4 3 fast urbanization increased carbon emissions urbanization process has triggered land cover changes resulting in expanded built up areas accompanied by increased energy consumption the expansion of built up is often an indicator to economic development and enhanced carbon emissions as the result of intensified human activities and a main cause of degraded npp zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 12 the carbon emissions in the second or rapid urbanization period are much higher than the values in the first or slow urbanization period confirming a close link between the urbanization and carbon emissions additionally a higher urbanization rate meant a more prominent negative impact on npp fig 6 previous studies have demonstrated that rapid urbanization process not only decreased npp from urban vegetation but also induced more carbon emissions guan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore under the context of the rapid urbanization it is of great important to optimize urban development policies targeting improved carbon sink from terrestrial vegetation and reduced carbon emissions shi et al 2020 4 4 comparison and applications facing the ecological challenges from rapid urbanization in recent years it is valuable to assess the impact on vegetation productivity from urbanization and climate changes simulation models driven by urbanization and climate changes and neighborhood substitution analysis were proposed intending to quantify and isolate the contributions of the impact from urbanization and climate changes at pixel level based on the proposed modeling the spatio temporal patterns of the impact on terrestrial npp from urbanization and climate changes in china were mapped during the last two decades the npp values of the studied urbanized area during the study period were represented by the neighborhood npp which was the average npp of the same land cover in the neighborhood as the study pixels not urbanized this method was consistent with the tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 and can better model the effects of urbanization we simulated the impact of climate changes on npp by controlling the changes of climate factors generally the results based on the method of this paper indicated that urbanization decreased the npp and climate changes improved npp in most part of the study area which was consistent with the previous studies liu et al 2019 the model proposed in this study can be applied similarly to analyze the impact on npp from urbanization and climate changes in other regions a more commonly used method to isolate the impact from the factors of anthropologic activities and climate changes on npp is known as residual trend analysis restrend zhao et al 2021 which computes the difference or termed as residual between the observed npp and the model npp and establishes a regression function for the residual against the time years restrend is believed to be able to separate the impact on npp from climatic changes and human activities ge et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 but ineffective to apply to a specific factor e g urbanization process from human activities theoretically the model proposed in this study can be applied to other time windows and regions with available data satisfying the model input a similar workflow could be reasonably constructed to analyze the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp in other regions however due to the different availability and accessibility of various types of data we only modeled the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp in china over the past 20 years while leaving further work such as applying our models to other regions or extending to global scales for future studies the remotely sensed products were resampled to 500 m in resolution containing mixed pixel issues in urban land cover yan et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 which could be replaced by other higher resolution dataset to reduce the uncertainty in the modeled results 5 conclusion in this study we proposed modeling the impact on npp from urbanization and climate changes by applying a neighborhood substitution analysis we used multi source remote sensing data derive npp during the years 2000 2020 and modeled the effects of urbanization process and climate changes on npp in china for two consecutive sub periods the results of the study indicated that there was an overall increasing trend in npp during both the periods by 2 19 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 5 49 gc m 2 yea r 1 during 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively the impact of urbanization on npp was negative in both periods due to a loss of vegetated land and degraded npp density which reduced npp by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c in the slow and rapid urbanization stages respectively climate changes offset a negative impact from urbanization by improving npp by 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c in the study periods respectively in addition the residual factors other than urbanization process and climate changes showed a negative impact on npp reducing npp by 4 29 tg c yea r 1 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in the two periods respectively accurately capturing the impact of the urbanization and climate changes on terrestrial npp is helpful to understand the functions and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the context of rapid urban expansion modeling the isolated effects of urbanization processes on npp can provide informed support for making urban development policies to improve carbon sequestration from urban vegetation furthermore residual factors other than urbanization and climate changes had considerable impact on npp providing alternative promising channels to increase terrestrial npp future work may focus on extending the proposed model to test more regions based on finer scale datasets funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number nos

24166,vegetation plays a vital role in global carbon sink in terrestrial ecosystems and could be affected by climate changes and human activities in the current context of rapid urban expansion understanding the impacts of urbanization and climate changes on net primary productivity npp is helpful to sequester more atmospheric carbon and achieve carbon neutrality we explored the terrestrial spatio temporal npp dynamics in china during the years 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively using the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model based on multi source remote sensing data we then proposed a neighborhood substitution model to isolate the effects of urbanization and climate changes on npp and examined the driving forces for the npp update the results revealed that while urbanization was likely to reduce npp averagely by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c in the two stages climate changes improved npp by 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c respectively indicating that the climate changes offset the reduced vegetation productivity from rapid urbanization the results highlighted that the rapidly urbanizing process reduced vegetation productivity due to the lost vegetated land and degraded vegetation productivity in addition the residual effect other than urbanization and the climate changes also played a part on the degraded vegetation carbon sequestration reducing npp by an average of 4 29 tg c yea r 1 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in the two stages which could be related to other human activities we recommend protecting vegetation cover and making informed land use plan as means to improve carbon sequestration in the context of rapid urban expansion and climate changes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords net primary productivity neighborhood substitution urbanization climate changes quantitative assessment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rapid urbanization has been observed in the last few decades and although urban built up land accounts for less than 3 of the global land area more than 60 of global fossil energy carbon emissions come from cities grimm et al 2008 huo et al 2022 urban expansion is often accompanied by changes in land cover over the urban area and its surroundings shifts in population changes in economic centers and urban functions and structures guan et al 2019 zhou and chen 2018 also the urbanization process has an important impact on the regional climate soil and vegetation growth for example the impact of the heat island effect caused by urbanization has caused concern in urban environment and public health studies yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2016 urbanization imposes a dramatic impact on the material and energy flow of terrestrial ecosystems especially on the carbon cycle terrestrial vegetation is an important global carbon sink and the changes in carbon sequestration capacity from vegetation is mainly influenced by climate changes and human activities where urbanization is one of the most typical cases of the human activities alexander and wu 2012 ge et al 2021 furthermore in recent years the more frequency of climate extremes and natural disasters caused by climate changes has affected the carbon sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems ge et al 2021 therefore quantifying the effects of urbanization and climate changes on carbon sequestration from terrestrial vegetation is important for designing appropriate strategies to address the challenges facing sustainable urban development terrestrial vegetation is an ecosystem component that plays a key role in sequestering carbon energy exchange biogeochemical cycle and regulating the global carbon balance wu et al 2020 the vegetation carbon sink was effectively reflected by net primary productivity npp which is the accumulated amount of organic matter produced by vegetation in a unit area over a time period npp represents the portion of organic carbon fixed by the plant minus its own respiratory consumption and is used for the growth of vegetation ito 2011 liu et al 2021 potter et al 2003 field observations are usually conducted for precise site based studies but difficult to be launched over large areas long time series npp calculated based on multi source remote sensing imagery can facilitate to monitor and assess the state of the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales sha et al 2022 song et al 2018 yuan et al 2014 urban expansion is one of the important factors causing changes in npp and there have been comprehensive researches on urban growth and its effects on terrestrial vegetation lu et al 2010 while most studies have shown that urbanization causes different degrees of loss of terrestrial npp it is less clear how npp in urban areas was updated given a number of factors may impose direct and indirect impact on npp in an urban environment wu et al 2014b loss of vegetated land from urbanization may reduce npp but updated urban environment related to intensified human activities may promote vegetation growth guan et al 2019 the balance of the complex impact from multiple factors is so far rarely quantified in literature meanwhile the impact of climate change on npp has been comprehensively examined climate changes e g precipitation and temperature have exhibited different impact on terrestrial npp for example global warming was likely to extend the growing season of vegetation and thus improve vegetation productivity ge et al 2021 but others showed that temperature precipitation and solar radiation can exhibit negative effects on vegetation growth qu et al 2020 to quantify the effect of urbanization on vegetation carbon sequestration a common way is to compare the difference of vegetation productivity proxied by npp in vegetated and urbanized areas npp in vegetated areas observing no land cover changes during the study time provides a baseline for studying the effect on npp from urbanization tian et al 2019 wu et al 2014b liner system models was also used to assess the impact of urbanization xu et al 2018 but this method was assumed to exist in the study system between the expansion of built up land and carbon sequestration which oversampled the effect of urbanization on npp residual trend based and regression based models were often used to quantify the impact of climate change on npp ge et al 2021 residual trend based models are relatively convenient to implement but difficult to distinguish the complex interactions of multiple contributing factors zhao et al 2021 regression based models are probably categorized as one of the most popular ways to separate the impacts on vegetation productivity from climate and human activities though are limited with considerable uncertainties he et al 2015 quantitative analysis of the spatial and temporal variation of the impact of urbanization and climate factors on npp can help to proactively achieve the carbon neutrality the impact from urbanization and climate changes varies over space at the same time understanding the temporal dynamics of the impact from urbanization is important for policy intervention china is the largest developing country in the world and has experienced very rapid urbanization since its opening up especially in the last 20 years chen et al 2018 tian et al 2019 the rapid economic development and urban expansion have encroached considerable vegetated area while increased energy consumption which has led to reduced carbon sequestration and increase in carbon emissions to effectively respond to global warming and achieve the goal of carbon neutrality china should resort to multiple channels to increase carbon sinks and mitigate carbon emissions chen et al 2020 analysis of the effects of urbanization and climate changes on the terrestrial vegetation can provide a comprehensive perspective on how complex factors affect carbon sequestration by vegetation we simulated and calculated the urbanization and climate driven npp values individually based on multi source remote sensing data and isolated the impacts of urbanization and climate change for analysis the main objectives of this study were to effectively modeling the impacts of urbanization and climate changes on npp in china under different socioeconomic development stages during the past two decades to highlight the spatial and temporal variability of the different impacts and their driving mechanisms intending to propose recommendations on improving terrestrial carbon sinks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study the mainland of china was selected as the study area as shown in fig 1 the terrain in china is complex and diverse containing multiple geomorphic units with varied landform types and diversity of vegetation cover in recent decades due to the influence of climate changes and human activities the land cover in china has changed significantly and the area of vegetation cover has increased significantly duo et al 2016 however the rapid expansion of urbanization and the occurrence of extreme climate events have led to critical impacts on the vegetation growth in china li et al 2020 wang et al 2019 2 2 data collection and preprocessing the datasets used in this paper include remotely sensed vegetation products meteorological data land cover data and socioeconomic statistical data majority of the required datasets were sourced from and processed on the google earth engine gee platform all data were selected from 2000 2020 in terms of the temporal window and resampled uniformly

directional surface reflectance that have been masked for water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows meteorological data including monthly temperature precipitation solar radiation and evapotranspiration data were used to calculate terrestrial npp came from an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of european reanalysis era5 land hosted by the gee platform era5 land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to era5 reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics muñoz sabater et al 2021 land cover data were obtained from the 1990 2020 landsat derived annual china land cover dataset clcd produced by yang et al yang and huang 2021 the product has a resolution of 30 m and its overall accuracy reaches 79 31 and the product was evaluated based on third party test samples and its overall classification accuracy was better than that of mcd12q1 esacci lc from glc and globeland30 products the clcd mainly classified chinese land into nine categories cropland forest shrub grassland water snow ice barren impervious and wetland the statistics include data on carbon emissions and urbanization rates the carbon emission data came from the carbon emission accounts datasets for emerging economies ceads https www ceads net cn which includes multi scale accurate and up to date data on energy emissions and socioeconomic trade in china and other countries guan et al 2021 shan et al 2018 2020 the urbanization rate calculated as the percentage of the total urbanized population to the total population in china each year was obtained from the national statistical yearbook of china http www stats gov cn used to evaluate the degree of urbanization of the country wang et al 2021 in addition to better demonstrate the spatial variation of climate change impacts on npp the study area was divided into four wet dry regions i e humid semi humid arid and semi arid regions fig 2 this data was obtained from the resource and environmental science and data center of the chinese academy of sciences https www resdc cn with division of regions based on annual dryness index monthly mean temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature and vegetation type the main vegetation in humid areas is tropical forests and other mixed forests while forest steppe dominates the semi humid areas grasslands and desert grasslands in semi arid areas and deserts in arid areas pei et al 2013 2 3 temporal variation in urbanization intensity the rapid urbanization has had a great impact on resources and the environment and the effects of urbanization were not consistent in different development stages cui et al 2019 wang et al 2021 the impervious surface area ratio percentage of impervious was defined as the percentage of impervious surface area to total land area each year in order to analyze the effects of urbanization and climate changes on terrestrial npp at different stages of urbanization we divided the urbanization stages based on the average urbanization rate and percentage of impervious from 2000 to 2020 fig 3 the average urbanization rate in the last 20 years is 50 52 and the average impervious surface area ratio is 0 6245 the urbanization rates from each year from 2000 to 2010 were all smaller than the average and that from 2010 to 2020 were all higher than the average thus the period was divided into a slow urbanization stage 2000 2010 and a rapid urbanization stage 2010 2020 2 4 methods 2 4 1 mapping npp the carnegie ames stanford approach casa model was used to calculate the terrestrial npp in china from 2000 to 2020 the casa a light use efficiency lue model is widely used to estimate and simulate terrestrial npp at different scales liu et al 2019 wen et al 2018 the input of the model includes ndvi and meteorological data variables such as solar radiation temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration the workflow for calculating npp are as follows 1 npp x t apar x t ε x t where npp x t g c m 2 is the net primary productivity fixed by vegetation at a pixel cell x in month t apar x t g c m 2 mont h 1 is the amount of photosynthetic active radiation absorbed by vegetation at a pixel cell

vegetation can use to the total solar radiation r 0 5 field et al 1995 xu et al 2018 yan et al 2021a 3 fpar x t ndvi x t ndv i i min ndv i i max ndv i i min fpa r max fpa r min fpa r min where ndv i i max and ndv i i min indicate the maximum and minimum ndvi values of the i th vegetation type respectively the ndv i i max value corresponds to the 95 lower percentile of ndvi of the i th vegetation type and the ndv i i min value corresponds to the 5 lower percentile of ndvi and fpa r max 0 95 and fpa r min 0 001 fpar x t can be calculated by the ratio vegetation index sr 4 fpar x t sr x t s r i

eq 5 based on the ndv i i min and ndv i i max the research showed that the fpar value estimated using fpar ndvi was higher than the measured value and the fpar estimated using fpar sr was lower than the measured value but with less error therefore in this paper the average value of the two methods was calculated to minimize the error of the results α 0 5 as shown in eq 6 6 fpar x t α fpa r ndvi 1 α fpa r sr the actual light use efficiency ε x t can be obtained in the following 7 ε x t t ε 1 x t t ε 2 x t w ε x t ε max where t ε 1 x t and t ε 2 x t indicate the stress effects of low and high temperatures on light energy utilization respectively and are calculated based on maximum and minimum temperatures w ε x t is the coefficient of water stress impact which reflecting the effect of water conditions and is computed with regional evapotranspiration mm ε max gc m j 1 is the monthly maximum light use efficiency the value of maximum light use efficiency varies with vegetation type and different ε max value was used in the calculation for different vegetation types su et al 2022 yu et al 2009 in order to improve the accuracy of npp calculation ε max was calibrated based on the relationship between observed npp and calculated npp with modified least squares mls and the calibrated value of ε max was used in this paper zhu et al 2006 2 4 2 modeling the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp land cover changes and climate changes are believed to be the important factors affecting npp liu et al 2019 yan et al 2021b urbanization degrades vegetation cover into impervious lands and inevitably reduces vegetation productivity kong et al 2019 the impact from climate fluctuations on npp is complex and hard to model to separate the impact on terrestrial npp from urbanization and climate changes during a period from a start year ys to an end year ye we simulate the values of npp under climate change driven and urbanization driven conditions in the climate driven simulations we adopt a fixed climate factors method to quantify the impact of climate change on npp and in the urbanization driven simulations we adopt the neighborhood substitution approach to quantify the impact of urbanization on npp during ys ye a method based on neighborhood similarity property substitution the following is a detailed description of the method in the different simulations urbanization driven simulations we first calculate the npp in newly urbanized area based on an assumption that no land cover changes had ever occurred during the period and that the npp of the newly urbanized area in the end year ye could be estimated from the npp statistics in the neighborhood area having the same land cover in the initial year ys taking npp changes from 2000 to 2010 as an example np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the actual npp values in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively and nourba n 00 10 represents the theoretical npp for the newly urbanized area which did not experience urbanization the workflow is shown in fig 4 in the neighborhood with a limited size locations covered by the same land cover type are assumed to have the identical environmental attributes climate soil etc i e the theoretical npp values are close under similar environmental conditions therefore the actual npp value in the newly urbanized area was replaced by the average value of the actual npp within the neighborhood with the same land cover type and nourba n 00 10 was computed fig 4c to determine the size of the neighborhood window experiments were carried out with 10 km as the starting value and 5 km as the increment we calculated the variation of nourba n 00 10 as the size of neighborhood for each province in china separately and the results show that the mean value of nourba n 00 10 no longer changes when the size of neighborhood window exceeds 95 km for the computational efficiency we set 95 km as the neighborhood radius when computing nourba n 00 10 nourba n 00 10 represents the value of npp after excluding the impact of urbanization so the difference between its value and the actual npp value in the initial year i e the year of 2000 means that the npp changes is only affected by climate change and other factors and the value of npp change caused by the impact of urbanization in 2000 2010 slow urbanization stage can be calculated according to eq 8 9 8 np p 2010 np p 2000 u r b a n i z a t i o n c l i m a t e r e d i s u a l f a c t o r s nourba n 00 10 np p 2000 c l i m a t e r e d i s u a l f a c t o r s δ u r 00 10 np p 2010 np p 2000 nourba n 2010 np p 2000 9 np p 2010 nourba n 00 10 where np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the actual npp value in 2000 and 2010 respectively δ u r 00 10 is the amount of npp changes affected only by urbanization from 2000 to 2010 similarly the amount of npp changes in 2010 2020 rapid urbanization stage and 2000 2020 from the effects of urbanization expansion alone can be calculated with eq 10 11 10 δ u r 10 20 np p 2020 nourba n 10 20 δ u r 00 20 np p 2020 nourba n 00 20 11 δ u r 00 10 δ u r 10 20 where np p 2020 is the actual npp value in 2020 nourba n 10 20 and nourba n 00 20 are the npp value unaffected by urbanization during the periods 2010 2020 and 2000 2020 δ u r 10 20 and δ u r 00 20 are the amount of npp changes only affected by urbanization during the periods 2000 2010 and 2000 2020 climate change driven simulations we calculated the climate change impact on terrestrial npp by fixing the changes in climate factors over time during the study time period ys ye it was assumed that the climate factors did not change including temperature precipitation and solar radiation while other factors changed over time the climate factors in ys and all factors other than the climate in ye were adopted to calculate npp at ye using casa model based on the above assumptions indicating the npp of ys ye without climate changes and all factors in ys were adopted to calculate npp of ys taking npp changes from 2000 to 2010 as an example np p 2000 and np p 2010 are the observed npp values in the years 2000 and 2010 respectively noclimat e 00 10 represents the npp in 2010 which was not affected by climate change during 2000 2010 noclimat e 00 10 was calculated by taking the climate factors for 2000 and other factors for 2010 into the casa model i e keeping the climate factors unchanged for the period 2000 2010 the climate change impact on npp during the slow and rapid urbanization stage can be assessed by eqs 12 14 12 δ c l 00 10 np p 2010 noclimat e 00 10 13 δ c l 10 20 np p 2020 noclimat e 10 20 δ c l 00 20 np p 2020 noclimat e 00 20 14 δ c l 00 10 δ c l 10 20 where np p 2010 and np p 2020 are the observed npp values in 2010 and 2020 noclimat e 00 10 noclimat e 10 20 and noclimat e 00 20 are modeled npp values unaffected by climate changes during the periods 2000 2010 2000 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively δ c l 00 10 δ c l 10 20 and δ c l 00 20 are modeled npp changes only affected by climate changes during the periods 2000 2010 2000 2020 and 2000 2020 respectively 2 4 3 reliability assessment in this paper confidence analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to calculate and test the uncertainty of the results the confidence analysis indicates the uncertainty of the model by calculating a confidence interval at 95 confidence level which was obtained by calculating the mean 1 96 sd standard deviation of the model results which reflects the main range of the results shao et al 2016 the sensitivity of the model parameters was proxied using a sensitivity coefficient which made the model parameters dimensionless using the rate of change the sensitivity coefficient can reflect the effect of the model parameters on the results and it can be calculated by the eq 15 beven 1979 zhang et al 2021 15 s i r p i p i r where s i denotes the sensitivity coefficient of the i th factor r is the value of model results p i is the value of the i th factor in this study the model parameters include solar radiation temperature precipitation evapotranspiration and ndvi the sensitivity coefficients of the parameters to the model results were calculated based on eq 15 and the model results include the impact of urbanization and climate change on npp for the periods 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 3 results 3 1 urbanization and land cover changes the urban expansion and land vegetation cover changes in china in the past two decades are reflected by the ratio of land cover changes in two divided stages table 1 overall the highest percentage of area converted into other land cover types was found for cropland 33 6 in 2000 2010 and 28 7 in 2010 2020 followed by grassland 28 2 in 2000 2010 and 31 8 in 2010 2020 in the slow and rapid urbanization stages the main conversion targets of cropland were impervious surface 6 3 and 6 2 forest 11 8 and 11 0 and grassland 13 1 and 10 0 grassland and forest were the main sources of conversion to cropland mainly due to land reclamation in the northeast and northwest of china yang and huang 2021 the results of land cover conversion also revealed a certain degree of interconversion between wasteland and grassland over the past 20 years liu et al 2020 in both the slow and rapid urbanization stages most of the newly impervious surface was converted from cropland in addition to a limited part of grassland and water bodies du et al 2011 based on the land cover transfer ratio matrix we further compared the net change values for each land types in the slow and rapid urbanization stages as shown in fig 5 in the last 20 years the net increase in impervious surface area was the largest in both the magnitude and the changing rate and the increase was greater in the rapid urbanization stage 63 000 km² than in the slow urbanization stage 58 000 km² which indicates that the urbanization process tended to accelerate in the second period if compared to that in the first period forests were identified as the next showing the most obvious change the implementation of a series of policies such as the gain for green project after 2000 has significantly increased china s forest area xie et al 2018 the net change in cropland was negative and the net loss was the greatest during the slow urbanization stage but the decreasing rate was largely mitigated during the rapid urbanization stage probably due to the implementation of the red lines for maintaining 120 million hectares cropland after 2010 xie et al 2018 3 2 npp reduced from urbanization the newly urbanized areas in the period 2000 2020 showed a negative effect on terrestrial npp the impact of urbanization process on terrestrial npp under the slow and rapid urbanization stages was simulated by urbanization driven simulations or the neighborhood similarity property substitution fig 6 the results showed that urban expansion reduced npp by an average of 4 93 tg c yea r 1 during 2000 2020 and urbanization in the slow and rapid urbanization stages in total has reduced npp by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c respectively which indicated that higher urban intensity may present more reducing effect on npp while existing studies suggested that the urban heat island effect due to accelerated urbanization would contribute to the increase of npp ding et al 2010 pei et al 2013 the overall negative effect of urban sprawl on npp was much greater than the positive effect for example for the two most developed regions guangdong gd and shanghai sh fig 6d which presented high urbanization intensity the reduced npp during the rapid urbanization stage was less prominent than that in the slow urbanization stage npp reduced by 0 15 tg c and 1 3 tg c in the slow urbanization stage in sh and gd and 0 12 and 1 21 tg c in the rapid urbanization stage respectively the less impact on npp under the rapid urbanization period could be attributed to improved vegetation management or environmental contributions to vegetation growth such as heat island effect li et al 2018 given a warmer temperature increase is reported to present a positive role on vegetation growth guan et al 2019 thus counteracted the negative impact of urbanization on npp since the reform and opening up china has observed rapid urbanization the negative impacts of urbanization on china s terrestrial npp were mainly concentrated in the eastern and coastal regions and a few arid regions in northwest china fig 6a 6c the negative effect of urbanization on npp is closely correlated to the distance to urban center fig 6d indicating that a higher intensity in urbanization may cause a greater negative impact on npp newly urbanized area was mainly derived from cropland with 80 of the newly urbanized area was converted from cropland in the past 20 years table 1 in the slow and rapid urbanization stages 49 000 km² and 52 000 km² of cropland have been turned into urban built up respectively the reduced area cropland and grassland may explain in part the loss of npp during the study period from fig 6 it can be learned that urbanization affects the decrease of npp mainly in the middle and low latitudes where cropland is occupied leading to more cropland being reclaimed in the middle and high latitudes e g the northeast of china wang et al 2017 the npp of cropland totaled 275 42 tg c in 2000 and 258 66 tg c in 2010 with considerable decrease of npp possibly because of the massive conversion of cropland into urban built up after 2010 due to the implementation of some cropland protection policies the total area of cropland has been increased and npp has been effectively improved ge et al 2021 wang et al 2017 and the total value of cropland npp is 290 68 tg c in 2020 in the first period i e 2000 2010 urban expansion mainly encroached cropland while grassland and forest explained much of the urbanized area in the second period in both cases reduced vegetation would decrease terrestrial vegetation carbon sink 3 3 npp reduction offset by climate changes global climate changes may update the functions and structure of terrestrial ecosystems to assess the impacts from the spatial distribution of climate change on terrestrial npp we simulated the terrestrial npp assuming no climate changes from 2000 to 2020 with results shown in fig 7 although the climate changes may increase or decrease vegetation npp it shows an overall facilitative effect to npp increasing it by an average of 9 51 tg c yea r 1 during 2000 2020 and a total of 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c during the slow urbanization and rapid urbanization stages respectively compared with the impact of urbanization on npp that from the climate changes showed more spatially extensive but less intensive during the study period the average climate induced increase in npp was 2 59 gc m 2 yea r 1 3 07 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 61 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the slow and rapid urbanization stage respectively a positive impact of climate changes on npp was observed in southern and central china but negative in most other regions including western china which is likely related to the varied response from the different vegetation types across those regions the impact on terrestrial npp from the climate changes also showed temporal variation with wider area and more positive effect observed in the first period than in the second period fig 7a and 7b in the humid and semi humid regions in southern central and northeastern china fig 2 dominated by forests and croplands the changes in climate played a promoting role on npp opposed to the negative impact in most other regions in temperate and high latitude zones where precipitation was not a constraint factor on vegetation growth higher temperature was reported to increase npp due to extended length of growing season guan et al 2019 song et al 2018 in the arid regions mainly covered by sparse vegetation or desert grassland increased temperature and insufficient precipitation discouraged vegetation growth thus reduced vegetation productivity fig 7 3 4 reliability assessment of the results in order to assess the reliability of the results the uncertainty of the results and the sensitivity of the parameters were investigated using confidence analysis and sensitivity analysis beven 1979 the results show that at 95 confidence level the confidence intervals for the impact of urbanization on npp are 26 24 106 45 and 21 12 92 17 for the period 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively and the confidence intervals for the impact of climate changes on npp are 9 86 16 01 and 8 93 12 16 respectively we compared the results of this paper with those of studies from the same period and region as our study and found that the range of values of previous studies were similar to the confidence intervals of our results and the spatial distribution of the results was generally consistent ge et al 2021 guan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 pei et al 2013 wen et al 2019 it was reported that china s terrestrial npp decreased by 5 27 tg c year 1 with urbanization during 2000 2006 and the range of values was 0 100 pei et al 2013 liu et al calculated the impact of urbanization and climate change on npp in 2000 2010 with values ranging from 0 400 and 21 17 respectively liu et al 2019 wen et al analyzed the impact of urbanization on npp in 2000 2010 with the range of 0 265 wen et al 2019 moreover the npp in china increased by 1 88 gc m 2 yea r 1 with climate change during 2001 2016 and the range of values was 10 10 ge et al 2021 the results of this paper were in good agreement with the results of previous studies indicating that the results based on the proposed method are reliable and valid the sensitivity analysis indicates the degree to which the model output varies with changes in the input parameters the sensitivity of the model was performed for the main parameters including temperature precipitation solar radiation and ndvi ndvi was found to be the most sensitive parameter in the urbanization driven model with sensitivity coefficients averaged 0 57 and 0 51 for 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively while the most sensitive variable was the solar radiation 0 55 in the period 2000 2010 and the temperature in the period 2010 2020 0 49 we then selected two typical regions including the yangtze river delta yrd and pearl river delta prd which are among showing the most rapid urbanization to compare the impact of the considered factors from the current study with similar studies based on the statistical yearbook data the average urbanization rate of yrd was 72 11 and prd was 67 05 during 2000 2020 the results are shown in fig 8 and the statistical analysis revealed that the impact of urbanization on npp in the yrd was 5 28 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 5 13 gc m 2 yea r 1 for 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively and 7 33 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 7 57 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the prd and the impact of climate change on npp in the two stages for the yrd were gc m 2 yea r 1 and 0 71 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 29 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 1 76 gc m 2 yea r 1 for the prd the negative effect of urbanization on the npp for prd and yrd in both 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 varied high to low from the center of the urban agglomeration to the surrounding area suggesting more negative impact on npp in the areas with higher urbanization intensity furthermore compared to prd yrd had higher urbanization and therefore more npp reduced from urbanization the negative impact of climate changes on npp in prd was mainly located in the central area characterized by urbanized area which suggested that climate changes mainly showed negative impact on npp in urban area and positive impact on non urban area which was consistent with the previous studies li et al 2022 wu et al 2014a climate changes had the identical effect on npp in yrd except a greater range of urbanized area in yrd the previous study indicated that the npp of prd increased by 1 54 gc m 2 yea r 1 during 2000 2020 due to climate change li et al 2022 and the npp in prd reduced by 0 35 tg c for urbanization during 2001 2009 yan et al 2018 npp in yrd decreased by 3 43 gc m 2 yea r 1 for urbanization and increased by 0 5 gc m 2 yea r 1 for climate change during 1999 2010 wu et al 2014a the urbanization reduced npp by 2 45 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 4 18 gc m 2 yea r 1 in the yrd and prd respectively from 1982 to 2015 zhang et al 2021 4 discussions urbanization presented a critical impact on energy and mass cycle in terrestrial ecosystems including carbon cycle li et al 2020 the impact from urbanization process and climate changes on terrestrial npp could vary considerably under different urbanization stages and spatial contexts it has been a challenge to understand how terrestrial vegetation productivity and carbon sequestration from vegetation responds to different factors multi source remote sensing data combined with advanced ecological modeling methods can provide useful channels to understand such patterns the current study investigate the impact from urbanization and climate changes during the last two decades and some valuable patterns were revealed 4 1 climate change offsets npp decrease induced by urbanization climate changes offset the decrease in npp caused by urbanization although it was reported some indirect effects of urbanization e g heat island effect can promote vegetation growth lu et al 2021 the overall effect of urbanization process is more likely to reduce vegetation npp guan et al 2019 jonsson et al 2003 the impact of urbanization on npp change was found much stable in both the slow and rapid urbanization periods while the positive contribution of climate changes to npp was more prominent in the first period than that in the second figs 7 and 9a vegetated land cover could be encroached by urbanization which may cause changes in the landscape of the vegetation cover at the same time the reduced npp from urbanization to the average npp in the whole study area uta in percentage decreased along the years fig 9b to mitigate the side impact of urban expansion on vegetation carbon sequestration there is a need to increase the carbon sequestration density from the limited green space in urban areas in china great effort has been input to promote vegetation cover and offset the negative effects of urbanization by increasing vegetation cover e g by afforestation fig 5 and table 1 forests contributed the most to china s terrestrial carbon sink yu et al 2022 and the expansion of forest areas in recent years has indeed led to improved npp table 1 and fig 9b with an average increase of 2 19 gc m 2 yea r 1 from 2000 to 2010 and 5 49 gc m 2 yea r 1 from 2010 to 2020 although the increase of forest area was low in the rapid urbanization stage the total npp in china was increasing which indicates that the increase of vegetation cover can effectively improve vegetation carbon sequestration fig 10 4 2 residual effect on the change of npp in addition to urbanization and climate changes closely related to vegetation growth there are a number of other anthropogenic and natural factors that can also have some impact on npp ge et al 2021 zhou et al 2013 such as anthropogenic land management policies fertilization of soil deforestation and the occurrence of forest wildfires the effect of residual factors on npp was obtained by subtracting the effect of urbanization and climate on npp from the change of npp over the study period fig 11 shows the spatial distribution of the impact of residual factors on npp over the period 2000 2020 showing an overall negative impact on npp the spatial distribution pattern indicates a negative effect from residual factors on npp in eastern and northeastern china while most likely positive in western and southeastern china the negative effect of residual factors on npp is generally much lower in 2010 2020 than that in 2000 2010 though exception of enhancement effect was also noticed in a few regions for example in inner mongolia and qinghai tibet plateau regions the negative effect of residual factors on npp has increased more obviously and since these regions are mainly grassland areas such phenomenon may be related to the increase of local grazing intensity sun et al 2021 and overgrazing would destroy the local vegetation diversity and thus reduce the npp of vegetation in this region fedrigo et al 2018 ge et al 2021 as seen in fig 11 the impact of residual factors on terrestrial npp in china might not be neglected residual factors reduced npp by an average of 4 29 tg c yea r 1 in 2000 2010 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in 2010 2020 confirming the part unexplained from the impacts of either human activities or climate changes on npp in the current context of rapid economic development it might deserve to investigate further the residual factors to improve terrestrial npp such as implementing rational land management policies avoiding overgrazing of grasslands and improved management for croplands 4 3 fast urbanization increased carbon emissions urbanization process has triggered land cover changes resulting in expanded built up areas accompanied by increased energy consumption the expansion of built up is often an indicator to economic development and enhanced carbon emissions as the result of intensified human activities and a main cause of degraded npp zhou et al 2021 as shown in fig 12 the carbon emissions in the second or rapid urbanization period are much higher than the values in the first or slow urbanization period confirming a close link between the urbanization and carbon emissions additionally a higher urbanization rate meant a more prominent negative impact on npp fig 6 previous studies have demonstrated that rapid urbanization process not only decreased npp from urban vegetation but also induced more carbon emissions guan et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore under the context of the rapid urbanization it is of great important to optimize urban development policies targeting improved carbon sink from terrestrial vegetation and reduced carbon emissions shi et al 2020 4 4 comparison and applications facing the ecological challenges from rapid urbanization in recent years it is valuable to assess the impact on vegetation productivity from urbanization and climate changes simulation models driven by urbanization and climate changes and neighborhood substitution analysis were proposed intending to quantify and isolate the contributions of the impact from urbanization and climate changes at pixel level based on the proposed modeling the spatio temporal patterns of the impact on terrestrial npp from urbanization and climate changes in china were mapped during the last two decades the npp values of the studied urbanized area during the study period were represented by the neighborhood npp which was the average npp of the same land cover in the neighborhood as the study pixels not urbanized this method was consistent with the tobler s first law of geography tobler 1970 and can better model the effects of urbanization we simulated the impact of climate changes on npp by controlling the changes of climate factors generally the results based on the method of this paper indicated that urbanization decreased the npp and climate changes improved npp in most part of the study area which was consistent with the previous studies liu et al 2019 the model proposed in this study can be applied similarly to analyze the impact on npp from urbanization and climate changes in other regions a more commonly used method to isolate the impact from the factors of anthropologic activities and climate changes on npp is known as residual trend analysis restrend zhao et al 2021 which computes the difference or termed as residual between the observed npp and the model npp and establishes a regression function for the residual against the time years restrend is believed to be able to separate the impact on npp from climatic changes and human activities ge et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 but ineffective to apply to a specific factor e g urbanization process from human activities theoretically the model proposed in this study can be applied to other time windows and regions with available data satisfying the model input a similar workflow could be reasonably constructed to analyze the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp in other regions however due to the different availability and accessibility of various types of data we only modeled the impact of urbanization and climate changes on npp in china over the past 20 years while leaving further work such as applying our models to other regions or extending to global scales for future studies the remotely sensed products were resampled to 500 m in resolution containing mixed pixel issues in urban land cover yan et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 which could be replaced by other higher resolution dataset to reduce the uncertainty in the modeled results 5 conclusion in this study we proposed modeling the impact on npp from urbanization and climate changes by applying a neighborhood substitution analysis we used multi source remote sensing data derive npp during the years 2000 2020 and modeled the effects of urbanization process and climate changes on npp in china for two consecutive sub periods the results of the study indicated that there was an overall increasing trend in npp during both the periods by 2 19 gc m 2 yea r 1 and 5 49 gc m 2 yea r 1 during 2000 2010 and 2010 2020 respectively the impact of urbanization on npp was negative in both periods due to a loss of vegetated land and degraded npp density which reduced npp by 48 57 tg c and 50 13 tg c in the slow and rapid urbanization stages respectively climate changes offset a negative impact from urbanization by improving npp by 97 71 tg c and 92 46 tg c in the study periods respectively in addition the residual factors other than urbanization process and climate changes showed a negative impact on npp reducing npp by 4 29 tg c yea r 1 and 3 94 tg c yea r 1 in the two periods respectively accurately capturing the impact of the urbanization and climate changes on terrestrial npp is helpful to understand the functions and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the context of rapid urban expansion modeling the isolated effects of urbanization processes on npp can provide informed support for making urban development policies to improve carbon sequestration from urban vegetation furthermore residual factors other than urbanization and climate changes had considerable impact on npp providing alternative promising channels to increase terrestrial npp future work may focus on extending the proposed model to test more regions based on finer scale datasets funding this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number nos

24167,in this research a dynamic simulation model samimi salinity sodicity management with an interactive model interface is developed for managing the effects of agricultural water use and crop choices on soil salinization and sodification and their impacts on crop yields samimi integrates the vertical hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback by a compartmental non linear model architecture with its holistic integrated approach to salinity sodicity processes it adopts a system dynamics approach though it is simplified in spatial resolution the model credibility is sufficiently evaluated with indirect structure tests and against the data by hydrus 1d and soil column experiments that were conducted as part of the samimi salinity sodicity management interdisciplinary multi institutional network project conducted in the semi arid konya closed basin of turkey model analysis provide valuable insights to the role of irrigation efficiency water quality and crop choices on soil degradation and yield losses which are important for learning about and management of salinity sodicity related problems although irrigation efficiency is desirable for water conservation purposes it may result in higher salinity sodicity levels because of insufficient leaching in well drained soil profiles salinity and sodicity have opposite effects on soil hydraulic conductivity and while low saline irrigation water is desirable for agricultural production under relatively high sodic conditions it can lead to reduced hydraulic conductivity which can degrade soil characteristics to the detriment of crops salinity is not simply correlated with relative irrigation water consumption but with the crop salt tolerance as well hence low water consuming crops with high salt tolerance can lead to over salinization rendering the soil profiles inappropriate for cultivation of salt vulnerable crops if not sufficiently leached before by precipitation and or good quality irrigation water the model is published as a publicly available online interactive simulation tool with a fast simulating user friendly interface targeting researchers students experts farmers and policy makers keywords soil salinity soil sodicity irrigation management system dynamics interactive simulation data availability we have shared the data and the model through an online storage website the links is made available in the manuscript 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity are processes which pose threats to agricultural production and farmer livelihoods with their adverse effects on soil quality and crop yields they emerge due mainly to accumulation of various salt minerals in the soil layers hillel 2000 soil salinity is defined as the concentration of salt minerals dissolved in soil water while sodicity refers to the ratio of adsorbed na cations to all cations in the exchange complex tanji 2002 the accumulation of salts may take place through natural processes such as rock weathering or seawater intrusion in groundwater and also through human induced practices which are mostly related to inappropriate irrigation practices human induced salinization primarily happens following irrigation in semi arid and arid regions where the rates of precipitation are considerably lower than evapotranspiration vengosh 2003 under limited precipitation various salt minerals introduced by irrigation into the rootzone may not sufficiently leach through the soil profile via percolation furthermore shallow water table below the rootzone can be another source for salinization as dissolved salt minerals can move upwards through capillary rise and be deposited in rootzone after evapotranspiration while irrigation is a great facilitator to boost agricultural production with irrigated farmlands globally providing 35 40 of the crop production and constituting 20 25 of the cultivated lands montanarella et al 2015 meier et al 2018 around 76 million ha farmland is affected by human induced soil salinization montanarella et al 2015 the loss of crop production due to soil salinity is assessed as 27 3 billion usd annually qadir et al 2014 the area salinized by irrigation in turkey was estimated around 1 5 million ha in 2004 frenken 2009 parts of semi arid konya closed basin of turkey with its almost 2 5 million ha arable lands atesoglu et al 2019 is a region with a high potentiality of salt related problems management and control of salinity and sodicity on irrigated farmlands require knowledge and expertise crafted by experiments and models the purpose of this research is to develop a relatively simplified however holistic mathematical model of the soil salinity sodicity processes that can be used for agricultural water and crop management purposes as well as a simulation tool for learning irrigation water quantity quality and method largely driven by farmers practices and technology and crop choices are the crucial elements of management and control of salt related problems in farmlands sub surface hydraulic flow solute transport accumulation and adsorption of salt minerals and crop growth are interconnected dynamically complex processes simple statistical models are developed to mathematically elucidate the interactions between individual components of soil water crop nexus for example the impact of various salt composition in soil water on the hydraulic conductivity of a soil profile is mainly based on a well established statistical model which is built on laboratory scale experiments ezlit et al 2013 mcneal 1968 likewise the crop stresses which reduce plant transpiration rates due to water scarcity or high salt concentration have been quantified with statistical models allen et al 1998 feddes and zaradny 1978 van genuchten 1987 however such models by themselves are not useful to examine the salinization sodification problem from a management perspective to answer this need comprehensive process based numeric models are built to integrate hydraulic flow solute transport and crop growth as simultaneous dynamic processes the characteristics and capabilities of such models differ with respect to their specific purposes the existing well established models offer miscellaneous simulation abilities in high spatial and temporal resolutions for example hydrus 1d simunek et al 2018 and swap kroes et al 2009 can simulate hydraulic flow solute transport crop growth and chemical process in soil profile in detail nevertheless their simulation interfaces are not useful for long term simulations with seasonal variations and changing agricultural practices and for fast interactive simulation of compound mathematical equations furthermore with their highly parametric model interfaces these models appeal to a professional audience with sufficient knowledge on soil processes to understand and operate these models mostly in conjunction with laboratory experimental research on the other hand saltmod oosterbaan 2002 and drainmod s kandil et al 1995 with their user friendly interfaces address a larger audience and can be used for long term simulations for hydraulic and solute transport however they lack soil sodicity and its impact on hydraulic conductivity samimi presented in this article is built on system dynamics approach it adopts a process based compartmental model architecture and integrates the hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback it builds on previous works on subsurface vertical hydraulic flow khan et al 2007 luo et al 2009 and soil salinity mau and porporato 2015 2016 saysel and barlas 2001 likewise other models for example salt of the earth sote model kramer and mau 2020 and smituv poulose et al 2021 are built on system dynamics approach representing hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback on the other hand sote is not designed as a management simulator and smituv and samimi adopt different approaches to solute transport and crop yield response as well as to interface design system dynamics approach is adopted in modeling and simulation of dynamically complex non linear feedback systems it aims at modeling of dynamic problems with an endogenous perspective in order to unravel the internal causes of problems developing over time in system dynamics causal loop diagramming helps us to reveal and depict the feedback causalities and the stock flow structures are useful to represent the compartmental processes delays and sources of information that drive changes in the dynamic systems behavior sterman 2000 barlas 2002 in the next section model structure is represented followed by the section on model credibility evaluation a comprehensive simulation analysis of the model is presented in section 4 followed by the conclusions 2 model description the model consists of interacting modules of hydraulic flow hydraulic model and solute transport solute model yield response is a function of water and salt stresses a simplified view of the stock flow structure the accumulations and rates in the environment and the main feedback mechanism between the two processes is depicted in fig 1 soil is represented in compartments of three layers of surface rootzone and saturated zone the rootzone is the first 50 cm depth of the soil while saturated zone represents the deep aquifer the aquifer bed depth is 500 m the depth of water table changes with the water volume in the saturated zone vertical hydraulic flows on the left hand side drive the advective salt transport on the right hand side sodicity is a function of relative concentration of different salts it influences the hydraulic conductivity and therefore the hydraulic flows on the left hand side this interaction between the hydraulic model left and solute transport right creates multiple feedbacks climatic and soil conditions crop alternatives and irrigation norms are parameterized based on the field data obtained for the konya closed basin moreover lab experimental data of the leaching tests are used to set model hydraulic parameters and for further validation purposes as described in section 3 the model is simulated on a daily basis for a time horizon of 15 years the computational method is euler s integration with a time step of 0 125 model is built and simulated on stella architect software of the isee systems inc 2 1 hydraulic model the physical representation of the hydraulic model is demonstrated in fig 2 the top layer represents the soil surface water that can accumulate on top of the soil profile and the rootzone is represented as a compartment below the soil surface the saturated zone stands for the groundwater in the soil profile at the bottom vertical movement of the water between the soil compartments is governed by irrigation precipitation evaporation runoff infiltration transpiration percolation and capillary rise the field area

processes considering the energy balance between air and soil surface and kcb refers to the fao s basal crop coefficient which corresponds to crop transpiration allen et al 1998 under the semi arid conditions water can evaporate not only from soil surface but also from the very shallow depth of topsoil which results in capillary rise of water from rootzone to soil surface accordingly the gap

2007 17 θ v w v w v a where v w is the volume of water within the soil profile m3 and the v a stands for the volume of air in the pores m3 the hydraulic flow in unsaturated soil conditions is formulated with richards equation for the percolation and capillary rise to rootzone as in the infiltration equation the impact of solute composition in rootzone on the hydraulic conductivity is

solute model the solute model represents the transport and accumulation of the solutes and calculates the salinity and sodicity across soil compartments the transport is by advective flows salinity influences transpiration rates hence the crop yield while salinity and sodicity influences the hydraulic conductivity hence the infiltration and percolation rates the salt minerals are introduced into the soil profile by irrigation water in dissolved forms for the sake of simplicity the cations are aggregated under ca2 and na as also adopted by mau and porporato 2015 the mass balance equations for the salt minerals are below in eqs 21 22 as in mau 2015 q s n a equivalents stands for the na cations present in soil water on the soil surface while q s c a equivalents stands for the ca2 cations in the same compartment likewise q r n a is for na cations in the soil water in rootzone while q r c a is for the corresponding ca2 cations lastly q a n a and q a c a stands for the na and ca2 cations dissolved in saturated zone respectively eqs 21 and 22 present the accumulation of na and ca2 cations in rootzone the formulations for the surface and saturated zone are the same 21 q r n a t q r n a

cations move with the hydraulic flow in proportion with the solute concentration in the soil compartment the advective transport of solute by soil water is described by the following formula which is also referred as darcy flow hillel 2003 23 j c q c where j c is the flux of the solute mass per time e q t 1 q is the flow of the water which are detailed in the hydraulic model description m 3 t 1 c is the concentration of the solute in the soil water e q m 3 salt concentration in each soil compartment is calculated by the sum of cation concentrations as for example for the rootzone salt concentration is 24 c r s q r n a s r q r c a s r the salt concentrations can be converted to standard measurement of soil salinity electrical conductivity via the rule of thumb huang et al 2012 in eq 25 25 10 e c c r s the two well known measures sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp express soil sodicity while sar indicates the sodicity level of soil water or irrigation water esp indicates the ratio of adsorbed na cations in the soil complex to all adsorbed cations esp is calculated to gage the impact of soil sodicity on hydraulic conductivity nevertheless calculating the esp ratio requires considering the ion exchange equilibrium the adsorption desorption process occurs very fast in very short time steps therefore thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed mau and porporato 2016 eq 26 represents ion exchange process in the soil complex yaron et al 1973 26 k s c e x c a e s n a 2 c r s e x n a 2 e s c a where k s c is the selectivity coefficient specific to soil type e q m 3 levy and hillel 1968 e s c a is the fraction of ca2 dissolved in soil water dimensionless and e x c a is the fraction of adsorbed ca2 dimensionless likewise e s n a is the fraction of na in soil water dimensionless and e x n a is the fraction of adsorbed na dimensionless the fraction of a cation in the soil water is the ratio of concentration of each cation over the total salt concentration therefore e s n a and e s c a are formulated respectively 27 e s n a c r n a c r s 28 e s c a c r c a c r s moreover the fraction of sodium adsorbed by the soil complex e x n a is calculated through a mathematical rearrangement of the eq 26 it is assumed that the amount of total adsorbed cations in the soil complex is always equal to the cation exchange capacity therefore the sum of the fraction of the adsorbed cations e x n a and e x c a equals to 1 consequently e x n a can be expressed as 1 e x c a after the substitution eq 29 is written as a quadratic formula 29 a e x n a 2 b e x n a z 0 where a dimensionless and z dimensionless are substitutes in eqs 30 31 and b is a constant dimensionless 30 a e s c a k s c e s n a 2 c r s 31 z e x n a e x c a therefore the fraction of adsorbed na e x n a can be found by solving the eq 32 32 e x n a b b 2 4 a z 2 a nevertheless the standard expression of the soil sodicity is the exchangeable sodium percentage e s p 33 e s p e x n a 100 hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile highly depends on the salinity and sodicity conditions the reduction on hydraulic qualities due to salinity and sodicity is formulated based on ezlit et al 2013 which improves mcneal s clay swelling model mcneal 1968 the reduction on the hydraulic conductivity is expressed by relative saturated hydraulic conductivity r k s a t this parameter indicates the relative reduction in the hydraulic conductivity as a ratio which can take values between 0 and 1 2 3 crop yield response the model simulates crop yield loss for each crop season crops can experience stress due to the water deficit or high salt concentrations in rootzone daily transpiration and potential transpiration rates are accumulated throughout a growth season t and t p respectively yield loss is calculated with respect to the eq 34 formulated in the fao s irrigation and drainage paper n0 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 34 1 y a y m 1 t t p k y where y a indicates the actual yield dimensionless y m is the maximum yield that the crop can achieve without experiencing any stress and k y is the crop specific yield response factor dimensionless 3 model credibility evaluation model credibility validity is crucial in model based analysis and the criteria depends on the model purpose and architecture in system dynamics model validation is expanded over model development rather than being considered a singular stage after model construction and behavior analysis this is due to causal descriptive feedback rich endogenous nature of model architecture rather than being data driven and correlational yet after model construction there is a formal model validation stage that consists of first structural and then behavioral validation tests barlas 1996 structural validation tests help building confidence in the causal theory and is conducted through direct ex dimensional consistency in equation writing and simulation supported validity tests ex assessment of behavioral response to extreme conditions and parameter sensitivity behavioral validation is meaningful only if there is sufficient confidence on model structure and its focuses is behavior pattern match rather than point prediction it is conducted through visual as well as statistical measures for example by mean trend autocorrelation and amplitude estimates barlas 1996 samimi has been built on the theory for hydraulic flows and solute transport and it is tested with direct and indirect simulation supported structure tests below first parameter sensitivity tests for structural validity purposes are presented followed by behavioral validation tests parameter sensitivity tests examine the behavioral responses of key model variables to selected model parameter values to observe if the model response confirms the theory after that model behavioral validity is evaluated against hydrus 1d simunek et al 2018 and the column experiments nick 2021 of the samimi project 3 1 parameter sensitivity tests for structural validation sensitivity of model variables volumetric water content at the rootzone salinity electrical conductivity of rootzone water and sodicity rootzone sodium adsorption ratio to two environmental parameters precipitation and soil type are discussed 3 1 1 sensitivity to precipitation in the first experiment soil type is clay loam carsel and parrish 1988 the crop is corn zea mays l and irrigation is not applied potential evaporation and potential transpiration are 15 and 10 m3day 1 respectively equivalent to 1 5 and 1 mmday 1 the initial value for volumetric water content is 0 3 m3m 3 electrical conductivity is 4 5 dsm 1 and sodium adsorption ratio is 13 8 four different constant precipitation rates are applied 1 3 5 and 7 mmday 1 respectively results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the volumetric water content sensitivity to precipitation is appropriate for very low precipitation evapotranspiration exceeds infiltration and the water content is reduced with increasing precipitation water content increases however while θ stabilizes for the first two runs it stabilizes but then keeps increasing for the third and the fourth runs this is due to reduction in hydraulic conductivity and percolation loss to the deep layer caused by the reduction in ec it is observed that higher precipitation washes higher amount of salt and electrical conductivity ec is reduced since the lowest precipitation is not sufficient to leach the dissolved salt minerals decreasing water content results in higher ec sar response is similar to that of ec in pattern 3 1 2 sensitivity to soil hydraulic characteristics the second set of tests check for model sensitivity to soil type represented with soil specific parameters consisting of porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and van genuchten water retention parameters carsel and parrish 1988 the represented soil types stand for clay loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam respectively in these tests precipitation is eliminated irrigation is 5 mmday 1 and the crop is corn the salinity level of the irrigation water is 1 5 ec dsm 1 and the sar value of irrigation water set as 6 3 e q m 3 1 2 equivalent to mmolcl 1 2 results are illustrated in fig 4 with constant irrigation rate θ is soon stabilized the water content is the highest for clay loam which is less conductive and has the highest water holding capacity and lowest for sandy loam which is the most conductive soil type moreover stabilization occurs at different time points in different soil types as their hydraulic conductivities and water holding capacities are different an initial increase and then stabilization are observed in both ec and sar soil properties impact the progression of these variables as the soil conducts less water and have a higher water holding capacity it is relatively harder to replace the present soil water and dissolved minerals through leaching therefore the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratios are subject to longer delays in reaching equilibrium in less conductive soils 3 2 behavior pattern tests in this section the model behavior pattern match with hydrus 1d and the column experiments data are illustrated for building further confidence on model credibility and its capabilities 3 2 1 tests with hydrus 1d hydrus 1d simulates vertical water flows and solute transport in soil profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution samimi model outputs are compared with those of hydrus 1d under identical experimental conditions soil type is set as clay loam carsel and parrish 1988 the crop type irrigation water quality potential evaporation and transpiration rates and initial values of observed variables are the same with the previous sensitivity test the irrigation regime replicates three different conditions in one model experiment 120 days constant irrigation with 5 mmday 1 followed with 120 dry days followed with 200 mmday 1 irrigation with 40 days intervals depicted in fig 5 left hand side the outputs are generated for one representative point while different observation nodes are set for hydrus 1d to observe differences at small spatial distances fig 5 right hand side the volumetric water content electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and transpiration root water uptake over time for both models are observed in fig 6 it is observed that volumetric water content of both models increase and stabilize during the first 120 days and then decline during next 120 days after that three peaks are observed with three irrigations over the last 120 days electrical conductivity increases during the first 120 days with further augmentation in the second 120 days thereafter three bottoms are observed during the last 120 days corresponding to irrigation applications sar increases and bottoms follow the same patterns with electrical conductivity there is a strong pattern match between hydrus 1d and samimi generated values of volumetric water content ec and sar transpiration simulated by samimi initially declines whereas it is in equilibrium in hydrus 1d this is mainly due to different stress thresholds and calculation methods adopted by different models the following peaks and declines match in pattern however its dimensions are smoothed in samimi because of its higher spatial aggregation of the hydraulic processes 3 2 2 tests with column experiment because of the lack of ec and sar data sufficiently representing the column soil quality in these tests we only rely on the data on soil water content soil column experiments nick 2021 last for 402 days with a soil column of 0 55 m below the soil column there is a constant water table at the bottom in our model we implement the hydraulic parameters and conditions of the soil column and mimic the irrigation application the irrigation regime on the left and changes in volumetric water content on the right are illustrated in fig 7 the data for the experiment averages volumetric water content measured at 8 28 and 48 cm depths the simulated data represents volumetric water content at the middle of the column volumetric water content increases and stabilizes at the beginning due to capillary rise from the water table at the bottom after this there are consecutive peaks during irrigation and steady periods between them increase decrease and steady patterns match however the model smooths the values measured in the experiment along with that the simulated water content stabilizes around 0 39 m3m 3 while the mean of experiment measurements is around 0 37 m3m 3 4 model analysis in this section the impact of irrigation efficiency water quality and crops on soil quality and yield loss over multiple seasons are analyzed with simulation experiments the soil type is set as clay loam crop type is corn zea mays l and the water quality parameters are 1 5 dsm 1 electrical conductivity and 6 3 mmolcl 1 2 sodium adsorption ratio as set in model quality evaluation tests daily precipitation data is generated by the online weather generator marksim the annual average precipitation corresponds to 2401 m3ha 1yr 1 equivalent to 240 1 mmyr 1 jones et al 2002 irrigation water applications are embedded in the model as time series prepared for each crop type considering the crop water requirement and precipitation rates so as to avoid water stress the model is run for four years 14 760 days to observe the multi seasonal dynamics 4 1 effect of irrigation efficiency three irrigation efficiency rates 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 reflecting a spectrum of available irrigation technologies in the literature brouwer et al 1989 are assessed the electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and yield loss parameters are presented in figs 8 both for ec and sar similar patterns are observed salts are introduced during crop seasons with irrigation the increase and stabilization periods and leached during off seasons with winter irrigations the decrease and stabilization periods with increasing irrigation efficiency the ec and sar and yield losses increase since higher efficiency reduces water losses to percolation and therefore reduces leaching of salts 4 2 effect of irrigation water quality three different water qualities are evaluated non saline and non sodic water ec 0 1 and sar 2 slightly saline and sodic water ec 3 and sar 30 and highly saline and sodic water ec 8 and sar 30 the irrigation efficiency is 0 7 the impact of irrigation water quality on electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and reduction hydraulic conductivity of rootzone and seasonal yield loss percentages are illustrated in fig 9 soil salinization and sodification process are in positive correlation with the quality of irrigation water through leaching of accumulated salts with non saline and sodic water both salinity and sodicity variables are considerably reduced meanwhile increasing soil sodicity reduces hydraulic conductivity but increasing salinity counterbalances this impact experiments ezlit et al 2013 mcneal 1968 as an outcome of this dual effect highest reduction is monitored when irrigation water quality is the best with the least salt concentration nevertheless since the effect of hydraulic conductivity on water logging and crop yields is not analysed in this study the seasonal yield loss percentages are in positive correlation with salinity of irrigation water 4 3 effect of crop the crops are corn sunflower and sugar beet planted consecutively along four seasons to show the progression of key variables over several crop seasons these crops have varying irrigation water demands and salt tolerances the sugar beet is the most water demanding crop followed by corn and sunflower sugar beet also is the most salt tolerant crop followed by sunflower and corn the results for salinization sodification and seasonal yield loss percentages are given in fig 10 it is observed that ec and sar do not follow correlation neither with relative salt tolerance nor with relative water demand of the crops ec and sar values are not orderly increasing with crop salt tolerances not they are orderly decreasing with crop water demand and therefore irrigation while higher irrigation rates help flushing of salts by percolation salt tolerance creates higher evapotranspiration rates leaving more of the salt introduced by irrigation on the soil profile correspondingly for example beet build the medium level of ec and sar while it doesn t suffer losses due to crop stress but corn builds the least ec and sar while it suffers highest losses 4 4 the model interface a model interface is developed see appendix and is publicly available in isee exchange website https exchange iseesystems com public mehmet can tunca samimi model interface to use samimi as a learning tool users are guided throughout the simulator by information on the basics of soil salinization sodification and simulator use during the game set up they can choose between precipitation regime soil type and water quality as environmental variables and can decide on the availability of groundwater as a boundary condition after game starts over ten cropping seasons they can decide on the crop type irrigation efficiency and irrigation amounts for each multi seasonal experiment the simulator generates long term results in a short simulation time on soil salinity sodicity and reduction on hydraulic conductivity as well as on groundwater level soil moisture yield losses due to crop stresses caused by adverse hydraulic and or salinity conditions samimi is a novel interactive learning environment of soil salinity sodicity control for practitioners and students 5 discussion and conclusion this research is on dynamic modeling of soil salinization and sodification for its management and control on irrigated farmlands the model is built on the theory on soil hydraulic flows solute transport and crop yield response it is parameterized and validated based on field data in konya closed basin another numeric model hydrus 1d and lab scale soil column experiments conducted under samimi project based on the model an interactive simulator is designed and published targeting not only researchers and experts but students practitioners and planners as well simulation results highlight the dependence of salinity and sodicity on various environmental and management factors environmental factors such as precipitation and soil hydraulic characteristics are analyzed with model sensitivity analysis the complex interaction of management factors such as water quality quantity and crop choice create some counterintuitive results firstly in semi arid conditions the rootzone is quite prone to salt accumulation even with non saline irrigation water this is mainly caused by insufficient leaching of salts with higher irrigation efficiencies on the other hand if subsurface drainage is insufficient to avoid percolating water accumulating in shallow saturated zones groundwater can become a source of salinity through capillary rise and inefficient excess irrigation can induce salinity secondly salt tolerant crops with high evapotranspiration rates under high saline conditions can become a source of salinity in semi arid regions off season precipitations may not be sufficient to leach these salts this may become an important factor in farm management particularly if the desired rotations include crops vulnerable to salts accumulated during previous seasons thirdly the balance between salinity and sodicity have impact soil hydraulic conductivity low saline waters with relatively high sodic characteristics degrade soil hydraulic properties and can lead to crop losses in further research both the predictive and learning aspects of our model can be improved firstly crop growth module can be developed to test for the impact of salinity and water stress on developmental stages of the crop within a growth season and to represent the mechanisms of salt uptake by the crop from soil water management perspective these amendments are expected to help us understand the possible role of salt tolerant crops in soil remediation from behavioral systems perspective the model can be coupled with a socioeconomic model of farmer response to soil water and salinity sodicity stresses the coupled model can be used to test the effect of farm level economic incentives on soil quality crop yield and farm economics from agricultural policy perspective lastly the interactive learning environment published in the appendix can be tested with the interested groups to have their feedback on further improvements and tailoring of the simulator design towards specified objectives funding information the research entitled samimi network salinity sodicity management interdisciplinary multi institutional network is sponsored by the

24167,in this research a dynamic simulation model samimi salinity sodicity management with an interactive model interface is developed for managing the effects of agricultural water use and crop choices on soil salinization and sodification and their impacts on crop yields samimi integrates the vertical hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback by a compartmental non linear model architecture with its holistic integrated approach to salinity sodicity processes it adopts a system dynamics approach though it is simplified in spatial resolution the model credibility is sufficiently evaluated with indirect structure tests and against the data by hydrus 1d and soil column experiments that were conducted as part of the samimi salinity sodicity management interdisciplinary multi institutional network project conducted in the semi arid konya closed basin of turkey model analysis provide valuable insights to the role of irrigation efficiency water quality and crop choices on soil degradation and yield losses which are important for learning about and management of salinity sodicity related problems although irrigation efficiency is desirable for water conservation purposes it may result in higher salinity sodicity levels because of insufficient leaching in well drained soil profiles salinity and sodicity have opposite effects on soil hydraulic conductivity and while low saline irrigation water is desirable for agricultural production under relatively high sodic conditions it can lead to reduced hydraulic conductivity which can degrade soil characteristics to the detriment of crops salinity is not simply correlated with relative irrigation water consumption but with the crop salt tolerance as well hence low water consuming crops with high salt tolerance can lead to over salinization rendering the soil profiles inappropriate for cultivation of salt vulnerable crops if not sufficiently leached before by precipitation and or good quality irrigation water the model is published as a publicly available online interactive simulation tool with a fast simulating user friendly interface targeting researchers students experts farmers and policy makers keywords soil salinity soil sodicity irrigation management system dynamics interactive simulation data availability we have shared the data and the model through an online storage website the links is made available in the manuscript 1 introduction soil salinity and sodicity are processes which pose threats to agricultural production and farmer livelihoods with their adverse effects on soil quality and crop yields they emerge due mainly to accumulation of various salt minerals in the soil layers hillel 2000 soil salinity is defined as the concentration of salt minerals dissolved in soil water while sodicity refers to the ratio of adsorbed na cations to all cations in the exchange complex tanji 2002 the accumulation of salts may take place through natural processes such as rock weathering or seawater intrusion in groundwater and also through human induced practices which are mostly related to inappropriate irrigation practices human induced salinization primarily happens following irrigation in semi arid and arid regions where the rates of precipitation are considerably lower than evapotranspiration vengosh 2003 under limited precipitation various salt minerals introduced by irrigation into the rootzone may not sufficiently leach through the soil profile via percolation furthermore shallow water table below the rootzone can be another source for salinization as dissolved salt minerals can move upwards through capillary rise and be deposited in rootzone after evapotranspiration while irrigation is a great facilitator to boost agricultural production with irrigated farmlands globally providing 35 40 of the crop production and constituting 20 25 of the cultivated lands montanarella et al 2015 meier et al 2018 around 76 million ha farmland is affected by human induced soil salinization montanarella et al 2015 the loss of crop production due to soil salinity is assessed as 27 3 billion usd annually qadir et al 2014 the area salinized by irrigation in turkey was estimated around 1 5 million ha in 2004 frenken 2009 parts of semi arid konya closed basin of turkey with its almost 2 5 million ha arable lands atesoglu et al 2019 is a region with a high potentiality of salt related problems management and control of salinity and sodicity on irrigated farmlands require knowledge and expertise crafted by experiments and models the purpose of this research is to develop a relatively simplified however holistic mathematical model of the soil salinity sodicity processes that can be used for agricultural water and crop management purposes as well as a simulation tool for learning irrigation water quantity quality and method largely driven by farmers practices and technology and crop choices are the crucial elements of management and control of salt related problems in farmlands sub surface hydraulic flow solute transport accumulation and adsorption of salt minerals and crop growth are interconnected dynamically complex processes simple statistical models are developed to mathematically elucidate the interactions between individual components of soil water crop nexus for example the impact of various salt composition in soil water on the hydraulic conductivity of a soil profile is mainly based on a well established statistical model which is built on laboratory scale experiments ezlit et al 2013 mcneal 1968 likewise the crop stresses which reduce plant transpiration rates due to water scarcity or high salt concentration have been quantified with statistical models allen et al 1998 feddes and zaradny 1978 van genuchten 1987 however such models by themselves are not useful to examine the salinization sodification problem from a management perspective to answer this need comprehensive process based numeric models are built to integrate hydraulic flow solute transport and crop growth as simultaneous dynamic processes the characteristics and capabilities of such models differ with respect to their specific purposes the existing well established models offer miscellaneous simulation abilities in high spatial and temporal resolutions for example hydrus 1d simunek et al 2018 and swap kroes et al 2009 can simulate hydraulic flow solute transport crop growth and chemical process in soil profile in detail nevertheless their simulation interfaces are not useful for long term simulations with seasonal variations and changing agricultural practices and for fast interactive simulation of compound mathematical equations furthermore with their highly parametric model interfaces these models appeal to a professional audience with sufficient knowledge on soil processes to understand and operate these models mostly in conjunction with laboratory experimental research on the other hand saltmod oosterbaan 2002 and drainmod s kandil et al 1995 with their user friendly interfaces address a larger audience and can be used for long term simulations for hydraulic and solute transport however they lack soil sodicity and its impact on hydraulic conductivity samimi presented in this article is built on system dynamics approach it adopts a process based compartmental model architecture and integrates the hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback it builds on previous works on subsurface vertical hydraulic flow khan et al 2007 luo et al 2009 and soil salinity mau and porporato 2015 2016 saysel and barlas 2001 likewise other models for example salt of the earth sote model kramer and mau 2020 and smituv poulose et al 2021 are built on system dynamics approach representing hydraulic flow solute transport and crop processes in feedback on the other hand sote is not designed as a management simulator and smituv and samimi adopt different approaches to solute transport and crop yield response as well as to interface design system dynamics approach is adopted in modeling and simulation of dynamically complex non linear feedback systems it aims at modeling of dynamic problems with an endogenous perspective in order to unravel the internal causes of problems developing over time in system dynamics causal loop diagramming helps us to reveal and depict the feedback causalities and the stock flow structures are useful to represent the compartmental processes delays and sources of information that drive changes in the dynamic systems behavior sterman 2000 barlas 2002 in the next section model structure is represented followed by the section on model credibility evaluation a comprehensive simulation analysis of the model is presented in section 4 followed by the conclusions 2 model description the model consists of interacting modules of hydraulic flow hydraulic model and solute transport solute model yield response is a function of water and salt stresses a simplified view of the stock flow structure the accumulations and rates in the environment and the main feedback mechanism between the two processes is depicted in fig 1 soil is represented in compartments of three layers of surface rootzone and saturated zone the rootzone is the first 50 cm depth of the soil while saturated zone represents the deep aquifer the aquifer bed depth is 500 m the depth of water table changes with the water volume in the saturated zone vertical hydraulic flows on the left hand side drive the advective salt transport on the right hand side sodicity is a function of relative concentration of different salts it influences the hydraulic conductivity and therefore the hydraulic flows on the left hand side this interaction between the hydraulic model left and solute transport right creates multiple feedbacks climatic and soil conditions crop alternatives and irrigation norms are parameterized based on the field data obtained for the konya closed basin moreover lab experimental data of the leaching tests are used to set model hydraulic parameters and for further validation purposes as described in section 3 the model is simulated on a daily basis for a time horizon of 15 years the computational method is euler s integration with a time step of 0 125 model is built and simulated on stella architect software of the isee systems inc 2 1 hydraulic model the physical representation of the hydraulic model is demonstrated in fig 2 the top layer represents the soil surface water that can accumulate on top of the soil profile and the rootzone is represented as a compartment below the soil surface the saturated zone stands for the groundwater in the soil profile at the bottom vertical movement of the water between the soil compartments is governed by irrigation precipitation evaporation runoff infiltration transpiration percolation and capillary rise the field area

processes considering the energy balance between air and soil surface and kcb refers to the fao s basal crop coefficient which corresponds to crop transpiration allen et al 1998 under the semi arid conditions water can evaporate not only from soil surface but also from the very shallow depth of topsoil which results in capillary rise of water from rootzone to soil surface accordingly the gap

2007 17 θ v w v w v a where v w is the volume of water within the soil profile m3 and the v a stands for the volume of air in the pores m3 the hydraulic flow in unsaturated soil conditions is

solute model the solute model represents the transport and accumulation of the solutes and calculates the salinity and sodicity across soil compartments the transport is by advective flows salinity influences transpiration rates hence the crop yield while salinity and sodicity influences the hydraulic conductivity hence the infiltration and percolation rates the salt minerals are introduced into the soil profile by irrigation water in dissolved forms for the sake of simplicity the cations are aggregated under ca2 and na as also adopted by mau and porporato 2015 the mass balance equations for the salt minerals are below in eqs 21 22 as in mau 2015 q s n a equivalents stands for the na cations present in soil water on the soil surface while q s c a equivalents stands for the ca2 cations in the same compartment likewise q r n a is for na cations in the soil water in rootzone while q r c a is for the corresponding ca2 cations lastly q a n a and q a c a stands for the na and ca2 cations dissolved in saturated zone respectively eqs 21 and 22 present the accumulation of na and ca2 cations in rootzone the formulations for the surface and saturated zone are the same 21 q r n a t q r n a

cations move with the hydraulic flow in proportion with the solute concentration in the soil compartment the advective transport of solute by soil water is described by the following formula which is also referred as darcy flow hillel 2003 23 j c q c where j c is the flux of the solute mass per time e q t 1 q is the flow of the water which are detailed in the hydraulic model description m 3 t 1 c is the concentration of the solute in the soil water e q m 3 salt concentration in each soil compartment is calculated by the sum of cation concentrations as for example for the rootzone salt concentration is 24 c r s q r n a s r q r c a s r the salt concentrations can be converted to standard measurement of soil salinity electrical conductivity via the rule of thumb huang et al 2012 in eq 25 25 10 e c c r s the two well known measures sodium adsorption ratio sar and exchangeable sodium percentage esp express soil sodicity while sar indicates the sodicity level of soil water or irrigation water esp indicates the ratio of adsorbed na cations in the soil complex to all adsorbed cations esp is calculated to gage the impact of soil sodicity on hydraulic conductivity nevertheless calculating the esp ratio requires considering the ion exchange equilibrium the adsorption desorption process occurs very fast in very short time steps therefore thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed mau and porporato 2016 eq 26 represents ion exchange process in the soil complex yaron et al 1973 26 k s c e x c a e s n a 2 c r s e x n a 2 e s c a where k s c is the selectivity coefficient specific to soil type e q m 3 levy and hillel 1968 e s c a is the fraction of ca2 dissolved in soil water dimensionless and e x c a is the fraction of adsorbed ca2 dimensionless likewise e s n a is the fraction of na in soil water dimensionless and e x n a is the fraction of adsorbed na dimensionless the fraction of a cation in the soil water is the ratio of concentration of each cation over the total salt concentration therefore e s n a and e s c a are formulated respectively 27 e s n a c r n a c r s 28 e s c a c r c a c r s moreover the fraction of sodium adsorbed by the soil complex e x n a is calculated through a mathematical rearrangement of the eq 26 it is assumed that the amount of total adsorbed cations in the soil complex is always equal to the cation exchange capacity therefore the sum of the fraction of the adsorbed cations e x n a and e x c a equals to 1 consequently e x n a can be expressed as 1 e x c a after the substitution eq 29 is written as a quadratic formula 29 a e x n a 2 b e x n a z 0 where a dimensionless and z dimensionless are substitutes in eqs 30 31 and b is a constant dimensionless 30 a e s c a k s c e s n a 2 c r s 31 z e x n a e x c a therefore the fraction of adsorbed na e x n a can be found by solving the eq 32 32 e x n a b b 2 4 a z 2 a nevertheless the standard expression of the soil sodicity is the exchangeable sodium percentage e s p 33 e s p e x n a 100 hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile highly depends on the salinity and sodicity conditions the reduction on hydraulic qualities due to salinity and sodicity is formulated based on ezlit et al 2013 which improves mcneal s clay swelling model mcneal 1968 the reduction on the hydraulic conductivity is expressed by relative saturated hydraulic conductivity r k s a t this parameter indicates the relative reduction in the hydraulic conductivity as a ratio which can take values between 0 and 1 2 3 crop yield response the model simulates crop yield loss for each crop season crops can experience stress due to the water deficit or high salt concentrations in rootzone daily transpiration and potential transpiration rates are accumulated throughout a growth season t and t p respectively yield loss is calculated with respect to the eq 34 formulated in the fao s irrigation and drainage paper n0 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 34 1 y a y m 1 t t p k y where y a indicates the actual yield dimensionless y m is the maximum yield that the crop can achieve without experiencing any stress and k y is the crop specific yield response factor dimensionless 3 model credibility evaluation model credibility validity is crucial in model based analysis and the criteria depends on the model purpose and architecture in system dynamics model validation is expanded over model development rather than being considered a singular stage after model construction and behavior analysis this is due to causal descriptive feedback rich endogenous nature of model architecture rather than being data driven and correlational yet after model construction there is a formal model validation stage that consists of first structural and then behavioral validation tests barlas 1996 structural validation tests help building confidence in the causal theory and is conducted through direct ex dimensional consistency in equation writing and simulation supported validity tests ex assessment of behavioral response to extreme conditions and parameter sensitivity behavioral validation is meaningful only if there is sufficient confidence on model structure and its focuses is behavior pattern match rather than point prediction it is conducted through visual as well as statistical measures for example by mean trend autocorrelation and amplitude estimates barlas 1996 samimi has been built on the theory for hydraulic flows and solute transport and it is tested with direct and indirect simulation supported structure tests below first parameter sensitivity tests for structural validity purposes are presented followed by behavioral validation tests parameter sensitivity tests examine the behavioral responses of key model variables to selected model parameter values to observe if the model response confirms the theory after that model behavioral validity is evaluated against hydrus 1d simunek et al 2018 and the column experiments nick 2021 of the samimi project 3 1 parameter sensitivity tests for structural validation sensitivity of model variables volumetric water content at the rootzone salinity electrical conductivity of rootzone water and sodicity rootzone sodium adsorption ratio to two environmental parameters precipitation and soil type are discussed 3 1 1 sensitivity to precipitation in the first experiment soil type is clay loam carsel and parrish 1988 the crop is corn zea mays l and irrigation is not applied potential evaporation and potential transpiration are 15 and 10 m3day 1 respectively equivalent to 1 5 and 1 mmday 1 the initial value for volumetric water content is 0 3 m3m 3 electrical conductivity is 4 5 dsm 1 and sodium adsorption ratio is 13 8 four different constant precipitation rates are applied 1 3 5 and 7 mmday 1 respectively results are shown in fig 3 it is observed that the volumetric water content sensitivity to precipitation is appropriate for very low precipitation evapotranspiration exceeds infiltration and the water content is reduced with increasing precipitation water content increases however while θ stabilizes for the first two runs it stabilizes but then keeps increasing for the third and the fourth runs this is due to reduction in hydraulic conductivity and percolation loss to the deep layer caused by the reduction in ec it is observed that higher precipitation washes higher amount of salt and electrical conductivity ec is reduced since the lowest precipitation is not sufficient to leach the dissolved salt minerals decreasing water content results in higher ec sar response is similar to that of ec in pattern 3 1 2 sensitivity to soil hydraulic characteristics the second set of tests check for model sensitivity to soil type represented with soil specific parameters consisting of porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity and van genuchten water retention parameters carsel and parrish 1988 the represented soil types stand for clay loam sandy clay loam and sandy loam respectively in these tests precipitation is eliminated irrigation is 5 mmday 1 and the crop is corn the salinity level of the irrigation water is 1 5 ec dsm 1 and the sar value of irrigation water set as 6 3 e q m 3 1 2 equivalent to mmolcl 1 2 results are illustrated in fig 4 with constant irrigation rate θ is soon stabilized the water content is the highest for clay loam which is less conductive and has the highest water holding capacity and lowest for sandy loam which is the most conductive soil type moreover stabilization occurs at different time points in different soil types as their hydraulic conductivities and water holding capacities are different an initial increase and then stabilization are observed in both ec and sar soil properties impact the progression of these variables as the soil conducts less water and have a higher water holding capacity it is relatively harder to replace the present soil water and dissolved minerals through leaching therefore the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratios are subject to longer delays in reaching equilibrium in less conductive soils 3 2 behavior pattern tests in this section the model behavior pattern match with hydrus 1d and the column experiments data are illustrated for building further confidence on model credibility and its capabilities 3 2 1 tests with hydrus 1d hydrus 1d simulates vertical water flows and solute transport in soil profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution samimi model outputs are compared with those of hydrus 1d under identical experimental conditions soil type is set as clay loam carsel and parrish 1988 the crop type irrigation water quality potential evaporation and transpiration rates and initial values of observed variables are the same with the previous sensitivity test the irrigation regime replicates three different conditions in one model experiment 120 days constant irrigation with 5 mmday 1 followed with 120 dry days followed with 200 mmday 1 irrigation with 40 days intervals depicted in fig 5 left hand side the outputs are generated for one representative point while different observation nodes are set for hydrus 1d to observe differences at small spatial distances fig 5 right hand side the volumetric water content electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and transpiration root water uptake over time for both models are observed in fig 6 it is observed that volumetric water content of both models increase and stabilize during the first 120 days and then decline during next 120 days after that three peaks are observed with three irrigations over the last 120 days electrical conductivity increases during the first 120 days with further augmentation in the second 120 days thereafter three bottoms are observed during the last 120 days corresponding to irrigation applications sar increases and bottoms follow the same patterns with electrical conductivity there is a strong pattern match between hydrus 1d and samimi generated values of volumetric water content ec and sar transpiration simulated by samimi initially declines whereas it is in equilibrium in hydrus 1d this is mainly due to different stress thresholds and calculation methods adopted by different models the following peaks and declines match in pattern however its dimensions are smoothed in samimi because of its higher spatial aggregation of the hydraulic processes 3 2 2 tests with column experiment because of the lack of ec and sar data sufficiently representing the column soil quality in these tests we only rely on the data on soil water content soil column experiments nick 2021 last for 402 days with a soil column of 0 55 m below the soil column there is a constant water table at the bottom in our model we implement the hydraulic parameters and conditions of the soil column and mimic the irrigation application the irrigation regime on the left and changes in volumetric water content on the right are illustrated in fig 7 the data for the experiment averages volumetric water content measured at 8 28 and 48 cm depths the simulated data represents volumetric water content at the middle of the column volumetric water content increases and stabilizes at the beginning due to capillary rise from the water table at the bottom after this there are consecutive peaks during irrigation and steady periods between them increase decrease and steady patterns match however the model smooths the values measured in the experiment along with that the simulated water content stabilizes around 0 39 m3m 3 while the mean of experiment measurements is around 0 37 m3m 3 4 model analysis in this section the impact of irrigation efficiency water quality and crops on soil quality and yield loss over multiple seasons are analyzed with simulation experiments the soil type is set as clay loam crop type is corn zea mays l and the water quality parameters are 1 5 dsm 1 electrical conductivity and 6 3 mmolcl 1 2 sodium adsorption ratio as set in model quality evaluation tests daily precipitation data is generated by the online weather generator marksim the annual average precipitation corresponds to 2401 m3ha 1yr 1 equivalent to 240 1 mmyr 1 jones et al 2002 irrigation water applications are embedded in the model as time series prepared for each crop type considering the crop water requirement and precipitation rates so as to avoid water stress the model is run for four years 14 760 days to observe the multi seasonal dynamics 4 1 effect of irrigation efficiency three irrigation efficiency rates 0 5 0 7 and 0 9 reflecting a spectrum of available irrigation technologies in the literature brouwer et al 1989 are assessed the electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and yield loss parameters are presented in figs 8 both for ec and sar similar patterns are observed salts are introduced during crop seasons with irrigation the increase and stabilization periods and leached during off seasons with winter irrigations the decrease and stabilization periods with increasing irrigation efficiency the ec and sar and yield losses increase since higher efficiency reduces water losses to percolation and therefore reduces leaching of salts 4 2 effect of irrigation water quality three different water qualities are evaluated non saline and non sodic water ec 0 1 and sar 2 slightly saline and sodic water ec 3 and sar 30 and highly saline and sodic water ec 8 and sar 30 the irrigation efficiency is 0 7 the impact of irrigation water quality on electrical conductivity sodium adsorption ratio and reduction hydraulic conductivity of rootzone and seasonal yield loss percentages are illustrated in fig 9 soil salinization and sodification process are in positive correlation with the quality of irrigation water through leaching of accumulated salts with non saline and sodic water both salinity and sodicity variables are considerably reduced meanwhile increasing soil sodicity reduces hydraulic conductivity but increasing salinity counterbalances this impact experiments ezlit et al 2013 mcneal 1968 as an outcome of this dual effect highest reduction is monitored when irrigation water quality is the best with the least salt concentration nevertheless since the effect of hydraulic conductivity on water logging and crop yields is not analysed in this study the seasonal yield loss percentages are in positive correlation with salinity of irrigation water 4 3 effect of crop the crops are corn sunflower and sugar beet planted consecutively along four seasons to show the progression of key variables over several crop seasons these crops have varying irrigation water demands and salt tolerances the sugar beet is the most water demanding crop followed by corn and sunflower sugar beet also is the most salt tolerant crop followed by sunflower and corn the results for salinization sodification and seasonal yield loss percentages are given in fig 10 it is observed that ec and sar do not follow correlation neither with relative salt tolerance nor with relative water demand of the crops ec and sar values are not orderly increasing with crop salt tolerances not they are orderly decreasing with crop water demand and therefore irrigation while higher irrigation rates help flushing of salts by percolation salt tolerance creates higher evapotranspiration rates leaving more of the salt introduced by irrigation on the soil profile correspondingly for example beet build the medium level of ec and sar while it doesn t suffer losses due to crop stress but corn builds the least ec and sar while it suffers highest losses 4 4 the model interface a model interface is developed see appendix and is publicly available in isee exchange website https exchange iseesystems com public mehmet can tunca samimi model interface to use samimi as a learning tool users are guided throughout the simulator by information on the basics of soil salinization sodification and simulator use during the game set up they can choose between precipitation regime soil type and water quality as environmental variables and can decide on the availability of groundwater as a boundary condition after game starts over ten cropping seasons they can decide on the crop type irrigation efficiency and irrigation amounts for each multi seasonal experiment the simulator generates long term results in a short simulation time on soil salinity sodicity and reduction on hydraulic conductivity as well as on groundwater level soil moisture yield losses due to crop stresses caused by adverse hydraulic and or salinity conditions samimi is a novel interactive learning environment of soil salinity sodicity control for practitioners and students 5 discussion and conclusion this research is on dynamic modeling of soil salinization and sodification for its management and control on irrigated farmlands the model is built on the theory on soil hydraulic flows solute transport and crop yield response it is parameterized and validated based on field data in konya closed basin another numeric model hydrus 1d and lab scale soil column experiments conducted under samimi project based on the model an interactive simulator is designed and published targeting not only researchers and experts but students practitioners and planners as well simulation results highlight the dependence of salinity and sodicity on various environmental and management factors environmental factors such as precipitation and soil hydraulic characteristics are analyzed with model sensitivity analysis the complex interaction of management factors such as water quality quantity and crop choice create some counterintuitive results firstly in semi arid conditions the rootzone is quite prone to salt accumulation even with non saline irrigation water this is mainly caused by insufficient leaching of salts with higher irrigation efficiencies on the other hand if subsurface drainage is insufficient to avoid percolating water accumulating in shallow saturated zones groundwater can become a source of salinity through capillary rise and inefficient excess irrigation can induce salinity secondly salt tolerant crops with high evapotranspiration rates under high saline conditions can become a source of salinity in semi arid regions off season precipitations may not be sufficient to leach these salts this may become an important factor in farm management particularly if the desired rotations include crops vulnerable to salts accumulated during previous seasons thirdly the balance between salinity and sodicity have impact soil hydraulic conductivity low saline waters with relatively high sodic characteristics degrade soil hydraulic properties and can lead to crop losses in further research both the predictive and learning aspects of our model can be improved firstly crop growth module can be developed to test for the impact of salinity and water stress on developmental stages of the crop within a growth season and to represent the mechanisms of salt uptake by the crop from soil water management perspective these amendments are expected to help us understand the possible role of salt tolerant crops in soil remediation from behavioral systems perspective the model can be coupled with a socioeconomic model of farmer response to soil water and salinity sodicity stresses the coupled model can be used to test the effect of farm level economic incentives on soil quality crop yield and farm economics from agricultural policy perspective lastly the interactive learning environment published in the appendix can be tested with the interested groups to have their feedback on further improvements and tailoring of the simulator design towards specified objectives funding information the research entitled samimi network salinity sodicity management interdisciplinary multi institutional network is sponsored by the

24168,wheat leaf number is linked to plant development and biomass making it important to accurately simulate in crop models leaf appearance is driven by temperature photoperiod and time this study compared the original dssat cropsim ceres temperature based linear leaf number submodule with four submodule variations that incorporated more biologically representative nonlinear functions for temperature photoperiod and time the observed data came from soil plant atmosphere research spar and multi year treatment free air co2 enrichment face experiments which covered spring and winter wheat varieties and a broad range of thermal environments and co2 levels the nonlinear functions improved leaf number simulation accuracy as compared to the original version however leaf area index lai accuracy declined suggesting further research is needed on the relationship between these responses model accuracy was not impacted by co2 levels but varied with seasonal growing degree days suggesting further evaluation of leaf appearance methods across a wider temperature range is needed keywords crop model phenology development leaf number data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat production is critical to global food security as it accounts for roughly 20 of calories consumed worldwide curtis and halford 2014 shiferaw et al 2013 accurate simulation of wheat biomass and yield depends on modeling leaf area growth and development due to its linkage with light absorption and dry matter accumulation amir and sinclair 1991 hodges and ritchie 1991 mcmaster et al 1991 the number of emerged leaves is used to measure development in wheat as it is correlated with tiller appearance klepper et al 1982 mcmaster et al 1991 rickman and klepper 1991 and the timing of certain developmental stages brooking et al 1995 calderini et al 1996 jamieson et al 1998 robertson et al 1996 therefore many wheat simulation models calculate haun stage hs which is the number of fully expanded leaves added to the ratio of the length of the currently expanding leaf to the length of the most recent fully expanded leaf haun 1973 models also calculate the leaf appearance rate lar the number of leaves added during a time step streck et al 2003 and add it to the hs of the previous time step to simulate the hs of the current time step in light of changing climatic conditions bezner kerr et al 2022 which are likely to influence wheat lar and development it is important to evaluate and improve leaf number simulation methods used in crop models because they are critical decision support tools the major driver of lar in wheat is temperature though other factors such as photoperiod carbon availability plant age and irradiance have also been shown to have an effect baumont et al 2019 bos and neuteboom 1998 cao and moss 1989a 1989b kirby 1995 slafer and rawson 1995a 1997 streck et al 2003 volk and bugbee 1991 temperature is the most common driver used to simulate leaf appearance in crop models ritchie 1991 volk and bugbee 1991 wang and engel 1998 various approaches have been used to model the effect of temperature on lar which can broadly be categorized into linear and nonlinear functions white et al 2012 all temperature functions have a base temperature below which no leaves appear but otherwise they all vary in how lar changes with increasing temperature the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropsim ceres cscer wheat model is one of a suite of crop models in the dssat platform hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 dssat cscer uses a three segment linear thermal time function to account for temperature effects once a certain amount of thermal time has been accumulated a new leaf appears the temperatures at the inflection points are known as cardinal temperatures and vary slightly between the vegetative and reproductive stages however the upper limit for the optimal temperature range is consistently set at 50 c this is a high threshold for the optimum range considering negative effects on wheat leaf development have been observed at 30 c rahman et al 2009 the lar function used in dssat cscer also does not account for the lar response to temperature being nonlinear near the base and optimum temperatures or photoperiod affecting lar cao and moss 1989b hotsonyame and hunt 1997 slafer and rawson 1995b studies have shown that the linearity assumption for thermal time accumulation used in many mainstream crop models including dssat cscer is violated under extreme temperatures birch et al 1998 xue et al 2004 which has led to the proposal of multiple nonlinear lar functions for wheat baumont et al 2019 streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 and the adoption of nonlinear beta functions for maize and potato models fleisher et al 2006 kim et al 2012 the parameters used for nonlinear lar functions are also more biologically representative than those used in segmented linear functions streck et al 2003 the goal of this study was to compare the existing dssat cscer leaf number function with two variations of two nonlinear beta functions streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 the five functions varied with winter or spring wheat cultivar specific cardinal temperatures the method for simulating air temperature effects and photoperiod and time effects on lar multiple data sets from soil plant atmosphere research spar and free air co2 enrichment face experiments were used to test the functions against a wide range of management and climate conditions for two cultivars the face data consisted of multiple combinations of temperature nitrogen n water availability w and co2 levels to provide a broad data set to evaluate lar submodule performances with respect to a spring wheat cultivar based on the large range of temperatures in the experimental data used to test these functions we anticipate nonlinear functions will more accurately predict lar at the more extreme temperatures the influence of leaf number function choice on simulation accuracy for end of season leaf area index biomass and grain yield was also evaluated the results from this study will provide improved modules for simulating lar under high temperature conditions which can increase confidence in estimating impacts of climate change on wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 dssat cscer leaf number submodule the dssat cscer version 4 8 0 model uses a 3 segment linear thermal time accumulation submodule which increases between a base and an optimum temperature plateaus for an optimum temperature range and decreases from the highest optimum temperature until the maximum temperature the base temperature is 0 c the optimum temperature range is 26 0 to 50 0 c for the vegetative stage and 30 0 to 50 0 c for the reproductive stage the maximum temperature is 60 0 c the temperature used for thermal time calculations is the daily average temperature average of the minimum and maximum daily temperature dssat cscer does not take photoperiod effects into account when calculating leaf number hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 the dssat cscer leaf number submodule is broken into phases to account for the effect of plant age on leaf appearance hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 the lengths of the phases are defined in the species and ecotype input files and are set as two leaves for the first phase and 13 leaves for the second phase for the first phase eq 1 the submodule calculates leaf number using eq 1 1 l n u m s d i min l n u m x 1 0 9 l n u m s d i 1 t t i p h i n t i where lnumsdi is the number of leaves per stem at time step i lnumx is the maximum possible number of leaves per stem and is used to limit the leaf number range lnumx is hardcoded to 100 so this part of the equation is generally not called into use during simulations tti is the daily thermal time c days and phinti is the phyllochron interval c days which is calculated using a combination of a cultivar specific user defined standard phyllochron interval called phints and a factor of 0 5 that decreases phinti for the first two leaves resulting in a higher lar earlier in the season in this way the increase in lar for the first two leaves in response to seed reserves is simulated peterson et al 1989 the second phase eq 2 3 uses a slight variation of eq 1 to adjust for the decrease in lar over time 2 t t t m p i t t i p h i n t i l n u m s g i 1 l n u m s d i 1 3 l n u m s d i l n u m s d i 1 t t i t t t m p i p h i n t i t t t m p i p h i n t s where tttmpi is a temporary thermal time value c days phinti is the same as phints as the factor is set to one for the second phase and lnumsgi 1 is the integer value of lnumsdi 1 plus 1 the original dssat leaf number submodule will be referred to as the original submodule for the rest of the paper 2 2 nonlinear leaf number submodules two variations of two nonlinear leaf number submodules were compared with the linear dssat cscer submodule resulting in five leaf number submodules in total the beta function proposed by wang and engel 1998 uses nonlinear functions for both temperature and photoperiod effects on lar eq 4 7 4 r l a r l a m a x f t f p where rla is the daily leaf appearance rate leaves d 1 rla max is the maximum leaf appearance rate under optimum temperature and photoperiod leaves d 1 and f t and f p are unitless functions for the effects of temperature and photoperiod respectively eqs 5 and 7 5 f t 2 t t m i n α t o p t t m i n α t t m i n 2 α t o p t t m i n 2 α for t m i n t t m a x f t 0 for t t m i n o r t t m a x 6 α ln 2 ln t m a x t m i n t o p t t m i n where tmin topt and tmax are the minimum optimum and maximum cardinal temperatures for lar c and t is the daily mean temperature calculated by summing hourly temperatures and dividing by 24 c 7 f p 1 e x p ω p p c where p is the actual photoperiod h pc is the critical photoperiod below which lar is 0 h and ω is the photoperiod sensitivity coefficient h 1 the coefficients pc and ω were set at 0 and 0 2 h 1 respectively based on literature volk and bugbee 1991 xue 2000 the haun stage hs is found by adding rla to the previous time step s hs the lar function proposed by streck et al 2003 is a modified version of the wang and engel 1998 function eqs 5 9 it uses the same f t and f p functions eqs 5 and 7 but adds a chronology function f c eq 9 to the rla equation eq 8 to account for the increase in distance that a primordium must first expand before appearing at the whorl as more leaves are added and the effect of seed reserves on lar for the first two leaves peterson et al 1989 8 r l a r l a m a x f t f p f c 9 f c 1 if h s 2 f c h s 2 b if h s 2 where f c is a unitless chronology function hs is the haun stage and b is a unitless sensitivity coefficient representing the decrease in f c with each unit of increase in hs and was set to 0 3 based on literature streck et al 2003 streck et al 2003 found that cardinal temperatures remained constant across cultivars but only used winter wheat varieties as the yecora rojo and apogee cultivars used for our simulations are spring wheat varieties we ran the wang and engel 1998 and the streck et al 2003 submodules using both the original winter wheat cardinal temperatures used by streck et al 2003 and spring wheat cardinal temperatures the spring wheat cardinal temperatures were taken from white et al 2012 who conducted a different free air co2 enrichment face experiment using yecora rojo at maricopa az than the one used for the simulations in this paper the tmin topt and tmax values for the original winter wheat models were 0 0 22 0 and 35 0 c respectively streck et al 2003 xue 2000 the tmin topt and tmax values for spring wheat were set to 0 0 27 5 and 43 9 c respectively white et al 2012 for the sake of brevity the wang and engel winter wheat leaf number submodule will be referred to as bww beta winter wheat and the wang and engel spring wheat leaf number submodule will be referred to as bsw beta spring wheat the streck et al submodules will be referred to as bww t and bsw t beta winter spring wheat with time function for the winter and spring wheat variations respectively 2 3 observed data the main simulations were based on a multi year free air co2 enrichment face experiment in maricopa az latitude 33 06 longitude 111 98 elevation 361 m kimball et al 2016 soil properties were taken from kimball et al 1992 the experiment had 16 treatments spread across four years 1993 1994 1996 1997 all treatments used yecora rojo a spring wheat cultivar with low photoperiod sensitivity that was grown as a winter wheat the treatments were combinations of high low n wet dry ambient elevated co2 and ambient elevated minimum temperature all treatments received some level of irrigation due to low rainfall conditions but the wet treatments received more irrigation than the dry treatments the total seasonal growing degree days gdd eq 10 were also used to categorize the treatments by temperature table 1 10 g d d i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where gdd is the total seasonal growing degree days c days n is the number of days in the growing season tmax is the maximum daily temperature c tmin is the minimum daily temperature c and tbase is the temperature below which there is no growth c which for wheat is 0 c treatments were divided between above and below average gdd the average gdd was 1144 days a summary of the climate conditions is shown in table 1 a summary of the management practices is shown in table 2 a further set of simulations were run to test only the leaf number submodules using observed data from soil plant atmosphere research spar chambers in beltsville md fleisher et al 2009 the spar study measured in season leaf number for apogee spring wheat grown under elevated co2 conditions 643 ppm with sufficient water and n the chambers were kept at a constant day night temperature combination of 23 18 c planting occurred on may 2nd 2006 the study was not run until maturity so the simulation included a forced harvest on the last observed day of the study july 13th 2006 water and n stress effects were turned off in the simulation because the experiment provided nonlimiting water and fertilizer the leaf number submodules were also not linked to water or n stress the in season leaf numbers used were the average across twelve chambers each of which consisted of five plants per sample date 2 4 model calibration seven cultivar parameters p1v p1d p5 g1 g2 g3 and phints and two ecotype parameters phl2 and phf3 in the cscer model were calibrated manually using observed data from treatments 902 906 910 and 914 of the face experiment these treatments were picked for calibration due to low stress production conditions and ambient co2 levels parameters were manually changed to minimize normalized root mean squared error nrmse eq 12 the cultivar parameters were calibrated in stages as some parameters have downstream effects on later variables such as length of the reproductive phase effecting yield the p1v p1d and phints parameters were calibrated first via minimizing nrmse for the anthesis day of year next the p5 parameter was calibrated next using the maturity day of year nrmse then the g3 parameter using the biomass nrmse and finally the g1 and g2 parameters using the grain yield nrmse after the cultivar parameters were calibrated the phl2 and phf3 ecotype parameters were calibrated using leaf number nrmse the parameters used are listed in table 3 parameters were re calibrated for each leaf number submodule used but the calibration results were similar across all leaf number submodules so the same cultivar parameters were used throughout for the face simulations using consistent cultivar parameters also allowed for better comparison of the leaf number submodules themselves as results were not being influenced by differences in parameters the leaf appearance rate beta functions were assumed to be cultivar independent other than the difference in cardinal temperature between winter and spring wheat the phints phl2 and phf3 parameters listed in table 3 were not used in the nonlinear leaf number submodules the remaining 12 treatments of the face experiment were used for evaluation the spar experiment used a different spring wheat cultivar named apogee the original dssat leaf number submodule used the phints parameter table 3 therefore the simulations for all datasets were run using a modified version of the yecora rojo parameters table 3 that changed phints from 60 to 67 the new phints value was calculated by averaging the observed phyllochron intervals change in total accumulated thermal time divided by change in leaf number the phl2 and phf3 values used for the face experiments were kept after further calibration runs no additional calibration was run and the cultivar parameters used in table 3 were re used as the other cultivar parameters did not affect leaf number simulations which was the only output examined the cultivar parameters in table 3 are not used by the nonlinear leaf number beta functions so the difference in phints did not affect their outcomes 2 5 statistics all statistics were calculated using r r core team 2022 simulated results were compared to the observed data using the willmott s index of agreement d eq 11 root mean squared error rmse eq 12 and normalized root mean squared error nrmse eq 13 11 d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 12 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 13 n r m s e r m s e y where i is the day of observation n is the number of observations yi is the observed value on day i ŷi is the simulated value on day i and ӯ is the average observed value to assess whether the model performed better under certain growing conditions the face simulations were also broken down into different categories to see if the accuracy of simulated leaf number lai biomass and grain yield was strongly affected difference in nrmse 0 1 the categories were predominantly based on the treatments used by kimball 2016 ambient versus elevated co2 ambient versus artificially high temperature achieved by heating the fields to increase tmin low versus high n fertilizer application and dry versus wet treatments table 2 since the experiment ran over multiple seasons and the heated treatments did not necessarily correspond to the warmest growing seasons due to annual seasonal weather differences the simulations were also broken down by below or above average total seasonal growing degree days to examine the impact of temperature on model accuracy 3 results for the spar experiment simulations all nonlinear leaf number submodules had a lower in season leaf number nrmse value than the linear calibrated original leaf number submodule fig 1 the original and bww submodules overestimated leaf number the lowest nrmse value was achieved using the bww t submodule nrmse 0 045 the simulations for the face experiment were used to examine multiple model outputs including leaf number leaf area index biomass and yield as the leaf number is not linked to development in the dssat cscer model and all runs used the same cultivar parameters all lar submodules resulted in the same days to anthesis nrmse 0 050 and days to maturity nrmse 0 030 table 4 shows the nrmse values across all the leaf number submodules for the sake of clarity only three of the five leaf number submodules used for the face simulations were selected for further detailed analysis in this paper the submodules chosen were the original submodule the bww submodule because it had the lowest lai and biomass nrmse of the new submodules and the bsw t submodule because it had the lowest final leaf number nrmse table 4 the original submodule vastly overestimated final leaf number fig 2 a the quality of simulation for in season lai was inversely proportional to the quality of final leaf number simulation with the submodules that resulted in the lowest final leaf number nrmse values having the highest in season lai nrmse values all submodules overestimated lai table 4 but the bsw t submodule resulted in the highest overestimations of lai fig 2b the effect of leaf number submodule on in season biomass fig 2c and grain yield fig 2d was small difference in nrmse 0 1 the simulations were also divided by treatment and growing conditions to assess whether these affected simulation accuracy the effect of co2 levels on simulation accuracy for leaf number lai biomass and grain yield was small with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for all leaf number submodules the leaf number nrmse was higher under elevated versus ambient minimum temperatures for the original and bww submodules with a difference in nrmse of 0 121 and 0 128 respectively but not for the bsw t submodule fig 3 a b which only had a difference of 0 05 the effect of temperature treatment on lai and biomass simulation accuracy was small fig 3c 2f with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for all submodules the grain yield nrmse was larger for high temperature treatments fig 3h than for ambient temperature treatments fig 3g with differences of 0 206 0 205 and 0 185 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively the total seasonal growing degree days gdd is another way to look at the impact of temperature on crop development the leaf number nrmse was higher for below average gdd seasons than for above average gdd seasons for the original and bww submodules with a difference of 0 157 and 0 175 for the original and bww submodules respectively though the bww submodule had a smaller absolute nrmse value than the original submodule for all seasonal gdd values the bsw t submodule on the other hand had a small difference in leaf number nrmse 0 085 between the two gdd categories with the above average gdd seasons having the larger nrmse value fig 4 a b above average total seasonal gdd resulted in larger lai nrmse values for all submodules with differences of 0 136 0 276 and 0 596 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively fig 4c d biomass nrmse values for above average seasonal gdd treatments were larger for all submodules though only the bsw t submodule had a difference greater than 0 1 0 158 fig 4e f the difference in grain yield nrmse between below and above average gdd treatments was small 0 1 for all submodules fig 4g h final leaf number nrmse for the original and bww submodules was lower for high n treatments than for low n treatments with differences in nrmse of 0 145 and 0 1 for the original and bww submodules respectively final leaf number nrmse for the bsw t submodule was lower for the low n treatment but the difference between treatments was small 0 1 fig 5 a b lai nrmse was higher for high n treatments than for low n treatments for all submodules though the difference between treatments was 0 1 for the original submodule fig 5c d the differences in lai nrmse

the impact of irrigation levels on lai and biomass nrmse was small with nrmse differences of 0 1 for all leaf number submodules fig 6c d e f grain yield nrmse was larger for wet treatments than for dry treatments fig 6g h with differences of 0 111 0 131 and 0 182 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively 4 discussion this study compared five different leaf number submodule variations one linear four nonlinear under a range of growing conditions using the dssat cscer wheat model the nonlinear bww t submodule had the smallest nrmse value for in season leaf number nrmse 0 045 when compared with the observed spar chamber data streck et al 2003 evaluated both their lar function and the wang and engel 1998 lar function using in season winter wheat data they found that the wang and engel function had an in season haun stage hs equivalent to leaf number rmse ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 and the streck et al model had a rmse of 0 2 the in season leaf number rmse for our simulations of the spar experiment was smallest for the bww t submodule rmse 0 243 and is comparable to the rmse value found by streck et al 2003 the in season leaf number rmse values for the spar experiment using the bww and bsw submodules rmse 0 552 and 0 354 respectively were smaller than the range found by streck et al 2003 for the wang and engel function the leaf number rmse for the original submodule was slightly higher than the largest rmse value found by streck et al 2003 suggesting nonlinear models provided a closer fit white et al 2012 evaluated various leaf number functions for yecora rojo the same spring wheat cultivar used for the face simulations in the current study using in season leaf number data from a different face dataset than the one used for the current study they found an rmse of 0 32 leaves plant 1 for both three segment linear similar to that used in dssat and beta function similar to wang and engel and streck et al leaf number submodules when compared to the spar simulations the white et al 2012 in season leaf number rmse was comparable to or larger than the rmse values obtained using the bsw and bww t submodules rmse 0 354 and 0 243 respectively but smaller than the rmse values for the other leaf number submodules the nonlinear bsw t submodule had the smallest nrmse value for final leaf number nrmse 0 100 when compared with the observed face data the face field study did not have in season leaf number data so it is not possible to evaluate the model s ability to simulate leaf number throughout the growing season for that data set the in season leaf number rmse values found by streck et al 2003 were much smaller than final leaf number results we obtained for the face data with the original average rmse 8 86 bww rmse 6 14 and bww t rmse 2 83 submodules when the winter wheat cardinal temperatures were replaced with spring wheat temperatures our results became comparable with those from streck et al 2003 with the bsw submodule having an average final leaf number rmse of 0 89 and the bsw t submodule having an average rmse of 0 83 as the streck et al 2003 study used in season measurements and we used end of season measurements the values are not directly comparable but they do provide a good ballpark estimate of accuracy it is also possible that the kimball et al 2016 data set we used for observed data had more variability than the observed data used by streck et al 2003 as there were more years and n treatments the rmse from white et al 2012 is smaller than the final leaf number rmse values for any of the leaf number submodules we used for the face simulations the face experiment was used for a more extensive analysis beyond leaf number the bsw t submodule had the smallest leaf number nrmse but it also had the largest lai nrmse however all leaf number submodules tended to overestimate lai especially when observed lai values were greater than three this is in agreement with kassie et al 2016 who also found poor lai simulations and a tendency towards overestimation though kassie et al 2016 did not comment on leaf number simulation accuracy biomass nrmse increased as lai nrmse increased but the increase was small though lai is linked to biomass simulation it has been found that once lai exceeds a value of three the impact of increased lai on intercepted solar radiation canopy photosynthesis and therefore biomass is small asseng et al 2004 kassie et al 2016 water and n stress also are more likely to be limiting growth factors than lai so poor lai simulation rarely has large downstream effects kassie et al 2016 however proper accounting for leaf area is important in terms of predicting rate of canopy closure crop respiration n and w use and canopy persistence and senescence rates and thus further work is needed to improve lai simulations the simulations were categorized by treatment to determine if growth conditions influenced simulation accuracy only three of the five leaf number submodules were chosen for this analysis the elevated co2 treatments did not result in a discernable difference in simulation accuracy as compared to ambient co2 treatments with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for leaf number lai biomass and grain yield simulations for all three leaf number submodules this suggests that the overall dssat cscer model was able to account for the effect of elevated co2 on these variables which is promising for future climate change simulation studies the impact of temperature treatment ambient vs artificially elevated tmin on simulation accuracy varied with relevant differences in nrmse seen for leaf number and grain yield end of season measurements like final leaf number and grain yield had a limited sample size which could be skewing the statistics there were fewer ambient temperature treatments used for evaluation than elevated temperature treatments as there were only four regular temperature treatments total and two of those were used for the calibration data set the regular and elevated temperature treatments defined by kimball 2016 did not necessarily correspond to cooler or warmer growing seasons therefore this paper also broke down the simulations by above and below average total seasonal gdd there was not a clear trend across all variables with final leaf number having lower nrmse values for high gdd seasons lai and biomass having lower nrmse values for low gdd seasons and grain yield nrmse showing small difference between low and high gdd seasons as the number of observations was not evenly distributed between the treatments it is possible that some of the treatment effects seen were due to limited sample sizes especially in the case of final leaf number the leaf number nrmse values for the original and bww submodules were also large for both seasonal gdd categories which resulted in the absolute difference between nrmse being large even if the relative difference was not as large schauberger et al 2017 ran a multi model ensemble of nine wheat models including dssat for high temperature conditions they found that crop models were able to accurately simulate the effect of high temperatures 30 36 c on grain yields which is supported by our findings that there was not a large difference in grain yield nrmse between below and above average seasonal gdd simulations however hussain et al 2018 found that crop model accuracy significantly decreased under high temperatures the timing of heat stress determines the severity of its impact ullah et al 2022 for our face simulations the average maximum daily temperatures during the simulated anthesis milk development and dough development stages were 22 3 23 1 and 26 6 c respectively the exact temperature threshold for heat stress varies between studies and developmental phases with 30 c commonly being used as a high temperature treatment ullah et al 2022 so it is possible that the face simulations did not experience substantial temperature stress during critical developmental stages and thus the model s heat stress capacities were never truly tested both lai and biomass simulations tended towards overestimation under above average seasonal gdd conditions suggesting that the model was not capturing the full stress effect further experimentation with a wider range of temperatures especially high temperatures is needed for a more thorough understanding of the model s ability to replicate leaf number under future climate conditions the nrmse values for high n treatments were either lower than or equivalent to those of low n treatments for leaf number biomass and grain yield this is expected as crop models simulate potential production and adjust for stresses such as low n simulating stressed scenarios requires additional steps that can introduce uncertainty the tendency towards underestimation for low n scenarios seen in biomass and grain yield simulations also suggests that the model is overestimating the severity of n stress lai nrmse values are smaller for low n treatments on the other hand because the model overestimates lai under unstressed conditions the addition of excessive n stress for the low n treatments partially counteracts this inherent overestimation of lai resulting in smaller nrmse values wet treatments had either larger or equivalent nrmse values than dry treatments across all variables and leaf number submodules this is possibly due to there being more data points for the wet treatments there was not a clear trend towards over or under estimation across variables overall the nonlinear beta functions more accurately simulated leaf number than the original three segment linear function used by dssat cscer the inverse relationship between leaf number simulation accuracy and lai simulation accuracy suggests however that further research is needed on modeling the relationship between these two variables 5 conclusion using a nonlinear beta function as compared to the original segmented linear function currently used in the dssat cscer wheat model significantly improved leaf number simulations the function proposed by streck et al 2003 implemented using winter wheat variety cardinal temperatures resulted in the lowest leaf number normalized root mean square error nrmse values for a soil plant atmosphere research spar chamber experiment the same function but using the spring wheat cardinal temperatures from white et al 2012 instead of the original winter wheat temperatures also resulted in the lowest leaf number nrmse values for multiple treatments within a free air co2 enrichment face experiment however the improvements in leaf number simulation resulted in degraded leaf area index lai simulation accuracy which in turn had negative effects on biomass simulation accuracy this suggests that further work is needed in addressing knowledge gaps regarding the relationships between leaf number and lai simulation breaking down the simulations by treatment showed that model accuracy was not impacted by co2 levels but varied with seasonal growing degree days gdd suggesting further evaluation of leaf appearance methods across a wider range of temperatures

24168,wheat leaf number is linked to plant development and biomass making it important to accurately simulate in crop models leaf appearance is driven by temperature photoperiod and time this study compared the original dssat cropsim ceres temperature based linear leaf number submodule with four submodule variations that incorporated more biologically representative nonlinear functions for temperature photoperiod and time the observed data came from soil plant atmosphere research spar and multi year treatment free air co2 enrichment face experiments which covered spring and winter wheat varieties and a broad range of thermal environments and co2 levels the nonlinear functions improved leaf number simulation accuracy as compared to the original version however leaf area index lai accuracy declined suggesting further research is needed on the relationship between these responses model accuracy was not impacted by co2 levels but varied with seasonal growing degree days suggesting further evaluation of leaf appearance methods across a wider temperature range is needed keywords crop model phenology development leaf number data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat production is critical to global food security as it accounts for roughly 20 of calories consumed worldwide curtis and halford 2014 shiferaw et al 2013 accurate simulation of wheat biomass and yield depends on modeling leaf area growth and development due to its linkage with light absorption and dry matter accumulation amir and sinclair 1991 hodges and ritchie 1991 mcmaster et al 1991 the number of emerged leaves is used to measure development in wheat as it is correlated with tiller appearance klepper et al 1982 mcmaster et al 1991 rickman and klepper 1991 and the timing of certain developmental stages brooking et al 1995 calderini et al 1996 jamieson et al 1998 robertson et al 1996 therefore many wheat simulation models calculate haun stage hs which is the number of fully expanded leaves added to the ratio of the length of the currently expanding leaf to the length of the most recent fully expanded leaf haun 1973 models also calculate the leaf appearance rate lar the number of leaves added during a time step streck et al 2003 and add it to the hs of the previous time step to simulate the hs of the current time step in light of changing climatic conditions bezner kerr et al 2022 which are likely to influence wheat lar and development it is important to evaluate and improve leaf number simulation methods used in crop models because they are critical decision support tools the major driver of lar in wheat is temperature though other factors such as photoperiod carbon availability plant age and irradiance have also been shown to have an effect baumont et al 2019 bos and neuteboom 1998 cao and moss 1989a 1989b kirby 1995 slafer and rawson 1995a 1997 streck et al 2003 volk and bugbee 1991 temperature is the most common driver used to simulate leaf appearance in crop models ritchie 1991 volk and bugbee 1991 wang and engel 1998 various approaches have been used to model the effect of temperature on lar which can broadly be categorized into linear and nonlinear functions white et al 2012 all temperature functions have a base temperature below which no leaves appear but otherwise they all vary in how lar changes with increasing temperature the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat cropsim ceres cscer wheat model is one of a suite of crop models in the dssat platform hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 dssat cscer uses a three segment linear thermal time function to account for temperature effects once a certain amount of thermal time has been accumulated a new leaf appears the temperatures at the inflection points are known as cardinal temperatures and vary slightly between the vegetative and reproductive stages however the upper limit for the optimal temperature range is consistently set at 50 c this is a high threshold for the optimum range considering negative effects on wheat leaf development have been observed at 30 c rahman et al 2009 the lar function used in dssat cscer also does not account for the lar response to temperature being nonlinear near the base and optimum temperatures or photoperiod affecting lar cao and moss 1989b hotsonyame and hunt 1997 slafer and rawson 1995b studies have shown that the linearity assumption for thermal time accumulation used in many mainstream crop models including dssat cscer is violated under extreme temperatures birch et al 1998 xue et al 2004 which has led to the proposal of multiple nonlinear lar functions for wheat baumont et al 2019 streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 and the adoption of nonlinear beta functions for maize and potato models fleisher et al 2006 kim et al 2012 the parameters used for nonlinear lar functions are also more biologically representative than those used in segmented linear functions streck et al 2003 the goal of this study was to compare the existing dssat cscer leaf number function with two variations of two nonlinear beta functions streck et al 2003 wang and engel 1998 the five functions varied with winter or spring wheat cultivar specific cardinal temperatures the method for simulating air temperature effects and photoperiod and time effects on lar multiple data sets from soil plant atmosphere research spar and free air co2 enrichment face experiments were used to test the functions against a wide range of management and climate conditions for two cultivars the face data consisted of multiple combinations of temperature nitrogen n water availability w and co2 levels to provide a broad data set to evaluate lar submodule performances with respect to a spring wheat cultivar based on the large range of temperatures in the experimental data used to test these functions we anticipate nonlinear functions will more accurately predict lar at the more extreme temperatures the influence of leaf number function choice on simulation accuracy for end of season leaf area index biomass and grain yield was also evaluated the results from this study will provide improved modules for simulating lar under high temperature conditions which can increase confidence in estimating impacts of climate change on wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 dssat cscer leaf number submodule the dssat cscer version 4 8 0 model uses a 3 segment linear thermal time accumulation submodule which increases between a base and an optimum temperature plateaus for an optimum temperature range and decreases from the highest optimum temperature until the maximum temperature the base temperature is 0 c the optimum temperature range is 26 0 to 50 0 c for the vegetative stage and 30 0 to 50 0 c for the reproductive stage the maximum temperature is 60 0 c the temperature used for thermal time calculations is the daily average temperature average of the minimum and maximum daily temperature dssat cscer does not take photoperiod effects into account when calculating leaf number hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 the dssat cscer leaf number submodule is broken into phases to account for the effect of plant age on leaf appearance hoogenboom et al 2019 2021 jones et al 2003 the lengths of the phases are defined in the species and ecotype input files and are set as two leaves for the first phase and 13 leaves for the second phase for the first phase eq 1 the submodule calculates leaf number using eq 1 1 l n u m s d i min l n u m x 1 0 9 l n u m s d i 1 t t i p h i n t i where lnumsdi is the number of leaves per stem at time step i lnumx is the maximum possible number of leaves per stem and is used to limit the leaf number range lnumx is hardcoded to 100 so this part of the equation is generally not called into use during simulations tti is the daily thermal time c days and phinti is the phyllochron interval c days which is calculated using a combination of a cultivar specific user defined standard phyllochron interval called phints and a factor of 0 5 that decreases phinti for the first two leaves resulting in a higher lar earlier in the season in this way the increase in lar for the first two leaves in response to seed reserves is simulated peterson et al 1989 the second phase eq 2 3 uses a slight variation of eq 1 to adjust for the decrease in lar over time 2 t t t m p i t t i p h i n t i l n u m s g i 1 l n u m s d i 1 3 l n u m s d i l n u m s d i 1 t t i t t t m p i p h i n t i t t t m p i p h i n t s where tttmpi is a temporary thermal time value c days phinti is the same as phints as the factor is set to one for the second phase and lnumsgi 1 is the integer value of lnumsdi 1 plus 1 the original dssat leaf number submodule will be referred to as the original submodule for the rest of the paper 2 2 nonlinear leaf number submodules two variations of two nonlinear leaf number submodules were compared with the linear dssat cscer submodule resulting in five leaf number submodules in total the beta function proposed by wang and engel 1998 uses nonlinear functions for both temperature and photoperiod effects on lar eq 4 7 4 r l a r l a m a x f t f p where rla is the daily leaf appearance rate leaves d 1 rla max is the maximum leaf appearance rate under optimum temperature and photoperiod leaves d 1 and f t and f p are unitless functions for the effects of temperature and photoperiod respectively eqs 5 and 7 5 f t 2 t t m i n α t o p t t m i n α t t m i n 2 α t o p t t m i n 2 α for t m i n t t m a x f t 0 for t t m i n o r t t m a x 6 α ln 2 ln t m a x t m i n t o p t t m i n where tmin topt and tmax are the minimum optimum and maximum cardinal temperatures for lar c and t is the daily mean temperature calculated by summing hourly temperatures and dividing by 24 c 7 f p 1 e x p ω p p c where p is the actual photoperiod h pc is the critical photoperiod below which lar is 0 h and ω is the photoperiod sensitivity coefficient h 1 the coefficients pc and ω were set at 0 and 0 2 h 1 respectively based on literature volk and bugbee 1991 xue 2000 the haun stage hs is found by adding rla to the previous time step s hs the lar function proposed by streck et al 2003 is a modified version of the wang and engel 1998 function eqs 5 9 it uses the same f t and f p functions eqs 5 and 7 but adds a chronology function f c eq 9 to the rla equation eq 8 to account for the increase in distance that a primordium must first expand before appearing at the whorl as more leaves are added and the effect of seed reserves on lar for the first two leaves peterson et al 1989 8 r l a r l a m a x f t f p f c 9 f c 1 if h s 2 f c h s 2 b if h s 2 where f c is a unitless chronology function hs is the haun stage and b is a unitless sensitivity coefficient representing the decrease in f c with each unit of increase in hs and was set to 0 3 based on literature streck et al 2003 streck et al 2003 found that cardinal temperatures remained constant across cultivars but only used winter wheat varieties as the yecora rojo and apogee cultivars used for our simulations are spring wheat varieties we ran the wang and engel 1998 and the streck et al 2003 submodules using both the original winter wheat cardinal temperatures used by streck et al 2003 and spring wheat cardinal temperatures the spring wheat cardinal temperatures were taken from white et al 2012 who conducted a different free air co2 enrichment face experiment using yecora rojo at maricopa az than the one used for the simulations in this paper the tmin topt and tmax values for the original winter wheat models were 0 0 22 0 and 35 0 c respectively streck et al 2003 xue 2000 the tmin topt and tmax values for spring wheat were set to 0 0 27 5 and 43 9 c respectively white et al 2012 for the sake of brevity the wang and engel winter wheat leaf number submodule will be referred to as bww beta winter wheat and the wang and engel spring wheat leaf number submodule will be referred to as bsw beta spring wheat the streck et al submodules will be referred to as bww t and bsw t beta winter spring wheat with time function for the winter and spring wheat variations respectively 2 3 observed data the main simulations were based on a multi year free air co2 enrichment face experiment in maricopa az latitude 33 06 longitude 111 98 elevation 361 m kimball et al 2016 soil properties were taken from kimball et al 1992 the experiment had 16 treatments spread across four years 1993 1994 1996 1997 all treatments used yecora rojo a spring wheat cultivar with low photoperiod sensitivity that was grown as a winter wheat the treatments were combinations of high low n wet dry ambient elevated co2 and ambient elevated minimum temperature all treatments received some level of irrigation due to low rainfall conditions but the wet treatments received more irrigation than the dry treatments the total seasonal growing degree days gdd eq 10 were also used to categorize the treatments by temperature table 1 10 g d d i 1 n t m a x t m i n 2 t b a s e where gdd is the total seasonal growing degree days c days n is the number of days in the growing season tmax is the maximum daily temperature c tmin is the minimum daily temperature c and tbase is the temperature below which there is no growth c which for wheat is 0 c treatments were divided between above and below average gdd the average gdd was 1144 days a summary of the climate conditions is shown in table 1 a summary of the management practices is shown in table 2 a further set of simulations were run to test only the leaf number submodules using observed data from soil plant atmosphere research spar chambers in beltsville md fleisher et al 2009 the spar study measured in season leaf number for apogee spring wheat grown under elevated co2 conditions 643 ppm with sufficient water and n the chambers were kept at a constant day night temperature combination of 23 18 c planting occurred on may 2nd 2006 the study was not run until maturity so the simulation included a forced harvest on the last observed day of the study july 13th 2006 water and n stress effects were turned off in the simulation because the experiment provided nonlimiting water and fertilizer the leaf number submodules were also not linked to water or n stress the in season leaf numbers used were the average across twelve chambers each of which consisted of five plants per sample date 2 4 model calibration seven cultivar parameters p1v p1d p5 g1 g2 g3 and phints and two ecotype parameters phl2 and phf3 in the cscer model were calibrated manually using observed data from treatments 902 906 910 and 914 of the face experiment these treatments were picked for calibration due to low stress production conditions and ambient co2 levels parameters were manually changed to minimize normalized root mean squared error nrmse eq 12 the cultivar parameters were calibrated in stages as some parameters have downstream effects on later variables such as length of the reproductive phase effecting yield the p1v p1d and phints parameters were calibrated first via minimizing nrmse for the anthesis day of year next the p5 parameter was calibrated next using the maturity day of year nrmse then the g3 parameter using the biomass nrmse and finally the g1 and g2 parameters using the grain yield nrmse after the cultivar parameters were calibrated the phl2 and phf3 ecotype parameters were calibrated using leaf number nrmse the parameters used are listed in table 3 parameters were re calibrated for each leaf number submodule used but the calibration results were similar across all leaf number submodules so the same cultivar parameters were used throughout for the face simulations using consistent cultivar parameters also allowed for better comparison of the leaf number submodules themselves as results were not being influenced by differences in parameters the leaf appearance rate beta functions were assumed to be cultivar independent other than the difference in cardinal temperature between winter and spring wheat the phints phl2 and phf3 parameters listed in table 3 were not used in the nonlinear leaf number submodules the remaining 12 treatments of the face experiment were used for evaluation the spar experiment used a different spring wheat cultivar named apogee the original dssat leaf number submodule used the phints parameter table 3 therefore the simulations for all datasets were run using a modified version of the yecora rojo parameters table 3 that changed phints from 60 to 67 the new phints value was calculated by averaging the observed phyllochron intervals change in total accumulated thermal time divided by change in leaf number the phl2 and phf3 values used for the face experiments were kept after further calibration runs no additional calibration was run and the cultivar parameters used in table 3 were re used as the other cultivar parameters did not affect leaf number simulations which was the only output examined the cultivar parameters in table 3 are not used by the nonlinear leaf number beta functions so the difference in phints did not affect their outcomes 2 5 statistics all statistics were calculated using r r core team 2022 simulated results were compared to the observed data using the willmott s index of agreement d eq 11 root mean squared error rmse eq 12 and normalized root mean squared error nrmse eq 13 11 d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y y i y 2 12 r m s e i 1 n y i y i 2 n 13 n r m s e r m s e y where i is the day of observation n is the number of observations yi is the observed value on day i ŷi is the simulated value on day i and ӯ is the average observed value to assess whether the model performed better under certain growing conditions the face simulations were also broken down into different categories to see if the accuracy of simulated leaf number lai biomass and grain yield was strongly affected difference in nrmse 0 1 the categories were predominantly based on the treatments used by kimball 2016 ambient versus elevated co2 ambient versus artificially high temperature achieved by heating the fields to increase tmin low versus high n fertilizer application and dry versus wet treatments table 2 since the experiment ran over multiple seasons and the heated treatments did not necessarily correspond to the warmest growing seasons due to annual seasonal weather differences the simulations were also broken down by below or above average total seasonal growing degree days to examine the impact of temperature on model accuracy 3 results for the spar experiment simulations all nonlinear leaf number submodules had a lower in season leaf number nrmse value than the linear calibrated original leaf number submodule fig 1 the original and bww submodules overestimated leaf number the lowest nrmse value was achieved using the bww t submodule nrmse 0 045 the simulations for the face experiment were used to examine multiple model outputs including leaf number leaf area index biomass and yield as the leaf number is not linked to development in the dssat cscer model and all runs used the same cultivar parameters all lar submodules resulted in the same days to anthesis nrmse 0 050 and days to maturity nrmse 0 030 table 4 shows the nrmse values across all the leaf number submodules for the sake of clarity only three of the five leaf number submodules used for the face simulations were selected for further detailed analysis in this paper the submodules chosen were the original submodule the bww submodule because it had the lowest lai and biomass nrmse of the new submodules and the bsw t submodule because it had the lowest final leaf number nrmse table 4 the original submodule vastly overestimated final leaf number fig 2 a the quality of simulation for in season lai was inversely proportional to the quality of final leaf number simulation with the submodules that resulted in the lowest final leaf number nrmse values having the highest in season lai nrmse values all submodules overestimated lai table 4 but the bsw t submodule resulted in the highest overestimations of lai fig 2b the effect of leaf number submodule on in season biomass fig 2c and grain yield fig 2d was small difference in nrmse 0 1 the simulations were also divided by treatment and growing conditions to assess whether these affected simulation accuracy the effect of co2 levels on simulation accuracy for leaf number lai biomass and grain yield was small with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for all leaf number submodules the leaf number nrmse was higher under elevated versus ambient minimum temperatures for the original and bww submodules with a difference in nrmse of 0 121 and 0 128 respectively but not for the bsw t submodule fig 3 a b which only had a difference of 0 05 the effect of temperature treatment on lai and biomass simulation accuracy was small fig 3c 2f with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for all submodules the grain yield nrmse was larger for high temperature treatments fig 3h than for ambient temperature treatments fig 3g with differences of 0 206 0 205 and 0 185 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively the total seasonal growing degree days gdd is another way to look at the impact of temperature on crop development the leaf number nrmse was higher for below average gdd seasons than for above average gdd seasons for the original and bww submodules with a difference of 0 157 and 0 175 for the original and bww submodules respectively though the bww submodule had a smaller absolute nrmse value than the original submodule for all seasonal gdd values the bsw t submodule on the other hand had a small difference in leaf number nrmse 0 085 between the two gdd categories with the above average gdd seasons having the larger nrmse value fig 4 a b above average total seasonal gdd resulted in larger lai nrmse values for all submodules with differences of 0 136 0 276 and 0 596 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively fig 4c d biomass nrmse values for above average seasonal gdd treatments were larger for all submodules though only the bsw t submodule had a difference greater than 0 1 0 158 fig 4e f the difference in grain yield nrmse between below and above average gdd treatments was small 0 1 for all submodules fig 4g h final leaf number nrmse for the original and bww submodules was lower for high n treatments than for low n treatments with differences in nrmse of 0 145 and 0 1 for the original and bww submodules respectively final leaf number nrmse for the bsw t submodule was lower for the low n treatment but the difference between treatments was small 0 1 fig 5 a b lai nrmse was higher for high n treatments than for low n treatments for all submodules though the difference between treatments was 0 1 for the original submodule fig 5c d the differences in lai nrmse between low and high n treatments were 0 035 0 123 and 0 324 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively the effect of n treatment on biomass simulation accuracy was small for all submodules 0 1 fig 5e f grain yield nrmse was lower for high n treatments across all three submodules with differences in nrmse of 0 177 0 164 and 0 134 for the original bww and bsw t submodules

the impact of irrigation levels on lai and biomass nrmse was small with nrmse differences of 0 1 for all leaf number submodules fig 6c d e f grain yield nrmse was larger for wet treatments than for dry treatments fig 6g h with differences of 0 111 0 131 and 0 182 for the original bww and bsw t submodules respectively 4 discussion this study compared five different leaf number submodule variations one linear four nonlinear under a range of growing conditions using the dssat cscer wheat model the nonlinear bww t submodule had the smallest nrmse value for in season leaf number nrmse 0 045 when compared with the observed spar chamber data streck et al 2003 evaluated both their lar function and the wang and engel 1998 lar function using in season winter wheat data they found that the wang and engel function had an in season haun stage hs equivalent to leaf number rmse ranging from 0 7 to 0 9 and the streck et al model had a rmse of 0 2 the in season leaf number rmse for our simulations of the spar experiment was smallest for the bww t submodule rmse 0 243 and is comparable to the rmse value found by streck et al 2003 the in season leaf number rmse values for the spar experiment using the bww and bsw submodules rmse 0 552 and 0 354 respectively were smaller than the range found by streck et al 2003 for the wang and engel function the leaf number rmse for the original submodule was slightly higher than the largest rmse value found by streck et al 2003 suggesting nonlinear models provided a closer fit white et al 2012 evaluated various leaf number functions for yecora rojo the same spring wheat cultivar used for the face simulations in the current study using in season leaf number data from a different face dataset than the one used for the current study they found an rmse of 0 32 leaves plant 1 for both three segment linear similar to that used in dssat and beta function similar to wang and engel and streck et al leaf number submodules when compared to the spar simulations the white et al 2012 in season leaf number rmse was comparable to or larger than the rmse values obtained using the bsw and bww t submodules rmse 0 354 and 0 243 respectively but smaller than the rmse values for the other leaf number submodules the nonlinear bsw t submodule had the smallest nrmse value for final leaf number nrmse 0 100 when compared with the observed face data the face field study did not have in season leaf number data so it is not possible to evaluate the model s ability to simulate leaf number throughout the growing season for that data set the in season leaf number rmse values found by streck et al 2003 were much smaller than final leaf number results we obtained for the face data with the original average rmse 8 86 bww rmse 6 14 and bww t rmse 2 83 submodules when the winter wheat cardinal temperatures were replaced with spring wheat temperatures our results became comparable with those from streck et al 2003 with the bsw submodule having an average final leaf number rmse of 0 89 and the bsw t submodule having an average rmse of 0 83 as the streck et al 2003 study used in season measurements and we used end of season measurements the values are not directly comparable but they do provide a good ballpark estimate of accuracy it is also possible that the kimball et al 2016 data set we used for observed data had more variability than the observed data used by streck et al 2003 as there were more years and n treatments the rmse from white et al 2012 is smaller than the final leaf number rmse values for any of the leaf number submodules we used for the face simulations the face experiment was used for a more extensive analysis beyond leaf number the bsw t submodule had the smallest leaf number nrmse but it also had the largest lai nrmse however all leaf number submodules tended to overestimate lai especially when observed lai values were greater than three this is in agreement with kassie et al 2016 who also found poor lai simulations and a tendency towards overestimation though kassie et al 2016 did not comment on leaf number simulation accuracy biomass nrmse increased as lai nrmse increased but the increase was small though lai is linked to biomass simulation it has been found that once lai exceeds a value of three the impact of increased lai on intercepted solar radiation canopy photosynthesis and therefore biomass is small asseng et al 2004 kassie et al 2016 water and n stress also are more likely to be limiting growth factors than lai so poor lai simulation rarely has large downstream effects kassie et al 2016 however proper accounting for leaf area is important in terms of predicting rate of canopy closure crop respiration n and w use and canopy persistence and senescence rates and thus further work is needed to improve lai simulations the simulations were categorized by treatment to determine if growth conditions influenced simulation accuracy only three of the five leaf number submodules were chosen for this analysis the elevated co2 treatments did not result in a discernable difference in simulation accuracy as compared to ambient co2 treatments with a difference in nrmse 0 1 for leaf number lai biomass and grain yield simulations for all three leaf number submodules this suggests that the overall dssat cscer model was able to account for the effect of elevated co2 on these variables which is promising for future climate change simulation studies the impact of temperature treatment ambient vs artificially elevated tmin on simulation accuracy varied with relevant differences in nrmse seen for leaf number and grain yield end of season measurements like final leaf number and grain yield had a limited sample size which could be skewing the statistics there were fewer ambient temperature treatments used for evaluation than elevated temperature treatments as there were only four regular temperature treatments total and two of those were used for the calibration data set the regular and elevated temperature treatments defined by kimball 2016 did not necessarily correspond to cooler or warmer growing seasons therefore this paper also broke down the simulations by above and below average total seasonal gdd there was not a clear trend across all variables with final leaf number having lower nrmse values for high gdd seasons lai and biomass having lower nrmse values for low gdd seasons and grain yield nrmse showing small difference between low and high gdd seasons as the number of observations was not evenly distributed between the treatments it is possible that some of the treatment effects seen were due to limited sample sizes especially in the case of final leaf number the leaf number nrmse values for the original and bww submodules were also large for both seasonal gdd categories which resulted in the absolute difference between nrmse being large even if the relative difference was not as large schauberger et al 2017 ran a multi model ensemble of nine wheat models including dssat for high temperature conditions they found that crop models were able to accurately simulate the effect of high temperatures 30 36 c on grain yields which is supported by our findings that there was not a large difference in grain yield nrmse between below and above average seasonal gdd simulations however hussain et al 2018 found that crop model accuracy significantly decreased under high temperatures the timing of heat stress determines the severity of its impact ullah et al 2022 for our face simulations the average maximum daily temperatures during the simulated anthesis milk development and dough development stages were 22 3 23 1 and 26 6 c respectively the exact temperature threshold for heat stress varies between studies and developmental phases with 30 c commonly being used as a high temperature treatment ullah et al 2022 so it is possible that the face simulations did not experience substantial temperature stress during critical developmental stages and thus the model s heat stress capacities were never truly tested both lai and biomass simulations tended towards overestimation under above average seasonal gdd conditions suggesting that the model was not capturing the full stress effect further experimentation with a wider range of temperatures especially high temperatures is needed for a more thorough understanding of the model s ability to replicate leaf number under future climate conditions the nrmse values for high n treatments were either lower than or equivalent to those of low n treatments for leaf number biomass and grain yield this is expected as crop models simulate potential production and adjust for stresses such as low n simulating stressed scenarios requires additional steps that can introduce uncertainty the tendency towards underestimation for low n scenarios seen in biomass and grain yield simulations also suggests that the model is overestimating the severity of n stress lai nrmse values are smaller for low n treatments on the other hand because the model overestimates lai under unstressed conditions the addition of excessive n stress for the low n treatments partially counteracts this inherent overestimation of lai resulting in smaller nrmse values wet treatments had either larger or equivalent nrmse values than dry treatments across all variables and leaf number submodules this is possibly due to there being more data points for the wet treatments there was not a clear trend towards over or under estimation across variables overall the nonlinear beta functions more accurately simulated leaf number than the original three segment linear function used by dssat cscer the inverse relationship between leaf number simulation accuracy and lai simulation accuracy suggests however that further research is needed on modeling the relationship between these two variables 5 conclusion using a nonlinear beta function as compared to the original segmented linear function currently used in the dssat cscer wheat model significantly improved leaf number simulations the function proposed by streck et al 2003 implemented using winter wheat variety cardinal temperatures resulted in the lowest leaf number normalized root mean square error nrmse values for a soil plant atmosphere research spar chamber experiment the same function but using the spring wheat cardinal temperatures from white et al 2012 instead of the original winter wheat temperatures also resulted in the lowest leaf number nrmse values for multiple treatments within a free air co2 enrichment face experiment however the improvements in leaf number simulation resulted in degraded leaf area index lai simulation accuracy which in turn had negative effects on biomass simulation accuracy this suggests that further work is needed in addressing knowledge gaps regarding the relationships between leaf number and lai simulation breaking down the simulations by treatment showed that model accuracy was not impacted by co2 levels but varied with seasonal growing degree days gdd suggesting further evaluation of leaf appearance methods across a wider range of temperatures

24169,we built a dymex population dynamics model of the invasive land snail cochlicella acuta and one of its dipteran parasitoids sarcophaga villeneuveana the snail lifecycle consists of different size classes based on shell height as both parasitism and reproduction are influenced by snail height the model reveals the likely role of small cryptic snails in maintaining populations in the face of biological control and suggests that suppression of snail populations may only be possible with unrealistically high parasitism rates and with repeated annual spring releases of flies the current model appears to describe the phenology of both the snail and fly adequately however construction of the model identified numerous knowledge gaps snail control would benefit from a thorough understanding of its basic biology and what drives its population dynamics aspects which surprisingly have been largely ignored otherwise any control measures will likely be unpredictable with no real understanding of how or why management options may or may not work we highlight the importance of modelling preferably at an early stage to synthesise available knowledge and data into a framework

designed to estimate the parasitoid induced mortality rates necessary to suppress snail populations to sub economic impact levels and to examine how to improve the effectiveness of flies in managing snail populations we use the dymex package maywald et al 2007 which has been used in numerous studies to explore pest population dynamics farr 2002 steinbauer et al 2004 yonow et al 2004 hallett et al

stress individual variation in mortality and stage transfer within a cohort can also be simulated resulting in a realistic simulation of a population and capturing a range of responses to different conditions experienced by individuals in the population because it is process based dymex requires information about lifestage processes and the climatic factors that drive population dynamics yonow et al 2004 hulthen and clarke 2006 hallett et al 2009 li et al 2016 gu et al 2018 with relationships between variables and the processes they affect being described by parameters or functions the model then allows the exploration of different management options and can identify those parts of a species lifecycle that are most vulnerable to these management strategies the aim of our model was a to better understand the population dynamics of both snails and flies b to identify why flies are not effective in controlling snail populations on the yorke peninsula and c to examine whether future augmentative fly releases could help control snails in posing and investigating these questions we highlighted deficiencies in previous studies and identified research necessary to better understand the population dynamics of both species thus demonstrating the benefits of incorporating modelling into pest management research preferably at an early stage 2 model 2 1 model development the dymex model operates on a daily time step a timer sets the duration of the simulation area being modelled defines the area being simulated default of 1 ha latitude is used to automatically calculate daylength in a simulation parasitism rate sets the maximum parasitism rate 0 0 5 day 1 of aestivating snails to be used in a simulation metdata reads the daily meteorological data file for a location and defines the variables used daily temperature cycle calculates hourly temperatures using daily minimum and maximum temperatures and daylength and a 10 mm single bucket soil moisture module simulates the plant available water content in the upper soil profile we use two lifecycle modules one each for snails and flies and seven expression modules to calculate values for lifestage state variables e g total active snail number sums the total number of snails in each of the five active lifestages at each time step of the seven expression modules five are used to visualise the results one calculates the density of all active snails to allow density dependant mortality to be applied to small snails and one calculates the ratio of aestivating snails to female flies to enable the daily calculation of fly larviposition rate the snail lifecycle is driven by temperature and surface soil moisture and the fly lifecycle is driven by temperature although there are no data available on the density of snail populations e g maximum density per unit area how or whether snails interact to regulate density the model incorporates density dependant mortality of small snails to prevent populations from growing exponentially this is undoubtedly a simplistic mechanism as density dependant regulation could occur in various ways e g reduced growth rates mortality in larger snails reduced reproduction etc but without any data available we opted for a simple yet biologically plausible mechanism density dependant mortality of flies is not required in the model as simulated fly population growth is regulated by the number of aestivating snails available for parasitism height dependant lifestages are assigned in the snail lifecycle although many lifestage processes are identical in the different lifestages details are provided in supplementary material 1 small snails 5 25 mm are not parasitized by flies baker et al 2010 ruynat 2012 and thus have a separate aestivating lifestage while medium snails 5 25 9 mm can be parasitised but are too small to breed mohamed and ali 2011 fig 2 as there is insufficient information to differentiate between fly larval and pupal stages or to describe them separately they are combined into a single lifestage immature fly all parasitised snails become immature flies fig 2 green arrow which simulates a larger fly population than would occur in the field as not all fly larvae survive in reality but we lack information on fly mortality in aestivating snails fly larviposition involves two interdependent processes larviposition per se and parasitisation of snails since any larviposition results in a parasitised snail once female flies are reproductively active larviposition depends on the user defined maximum parasitism rate and on the ratio of the total number of aestivating snails to the total number of female flies if there are many more aestivating snails than female flies then flies can easily find them and larviposit if there are only a few aestivating snails and many female flies then the larviposition rate per female fly is reduced larviposition is therefore only possible if a host is available with the proportion of aestivating snails in each cohort becoming parasitised on any given day calculated as per eq 1 1 p r o p o r t i o n p a r a s i t i s e d m i n 1 n u m b e r f l y l a r v a e n u m b e r a e s t i v a t i n g s n a i l s hence the number of fly larvae available determines the number of aestivating snails parasitised fig 2 purple arrow for each lifestage of each species information was sought from the literature to describe the lifestage processes this paper does not aim to present the model in detail model details and derivation of the model parameters are presented in supplementary material 1 the model was envisaged to be run at warooka yorke peninsula south australia fig 1 green circle where both snails and flies occur jourdan et al 2019 jourdan et al 2020 as c acuta is potentially the most significant snail pest at mt hope eyre peninsula south australia fig 1 blue circle we also included this site following discussions with grain producers perry et al 2019 when the model was being crafted the fly did not occur at mt hope however we used the model to provide insights into the usefulness of introducing the fly to this location daily weather data from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2020 for both warooka 34 99 137 40 and mt hope 34 15 135 25 were downloaded from the queensland government s silo climate database https www data qld gov au dataset silo climate database initialisation was begun in 1985 to allow time for snail populations to stabilise so we could examine whether the model simulated the same major population peaks observed in 2000 and 2002 baker 2008 is the only data on snail population dynamics available for any model validation simulations were initialised with 400 000 aestivating small snails 100 000 in each of the following height categories 1 7 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 mm 400 000 aestivating snails 100 000 in each of the following height categories 5 3 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 mm and 400 000 at 9 5 mm which can lay seven egg clutches four different height sub categories were used for small and medium snails to ensure a spread of snail heights in the simulation with these numbers at initialisation simulations replicated the maximum density of 80 m 2 recorded in 1985 for snails 5 mm baker 2008 and also provided a maximum density of ca 225 m 2 large snails at warooka slightly above the reported maximum density of 210 m 2 baker 2008 all simulations presented were initialised with these numbers of snails in these nine height categories and all simulations ran from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2020 2 2 model evaluation sensitivity of the model to initialisation was examined for both warooka and mt hope in one simulation we halved the numbers for each height class and in a second we reduced the number of height classes to four initialising with 400 000 3 5 mm snails 200 000 5 3 mm snails 200 000 7 5 mm snails and 400 000 9 5 mm snails with half the number of snails per height class it took an additional two years for the snail population to reach the same level initialising with only four height classes did not change the simulation results these simulations suggested that the model is not very sensitive to the initialisation parameters 2 3 simulations we ran the model for warooka and mt hope with snails only and then examined the impacts of both single and annually repeated fly releases with different parasitism rates and the effects of fly releases in different months mature female flies were always released in simulations on november 15 to ensure that at least some snails were in aestivation prior to mid november most simulated snails were still active thereby preventing flies from larvipositing and causing the simulated fly population to die out we first examined the effects of a single release 15 november 2000 of different numbers of reproductive female flies with different parasitism rates we released 10 000 5 000 1 000 500 and 100 female flies equivalent to 1 0 5 0 1 0 05 or 0 01 of the large snail population both active and aestivating and used maximum daily parasitism rates of 0 01 0 04 0 1 0 2 0 25 0 3 and 0 48 daily parasitism rates should be lower than sampled parasitism proportions the latter are a snapshot of the snail population at a point in time where snails have been aestivating and parasitism has been ongoing at the daily parasitism rate for some period however exposure of snails to parasitism pressure is a cohort specific factor with variability in when aestivation begins and ends reducing the median exposure to parasitism pressure in the simulations aestivation often began at the end of september or in early october but snails moved in and out of aestivation because of cooler and wetter conditions so that it often took until february for all snails to be in aestivation similarly the first active snails in the simulations appeared in march although the last snail did not leave aestivation until may thus the minimum period for all snails to be in aestivation was about two months although snails went in and out of aestivation for about 6 months this makes it difficult to relate a sampled parasitism proportion to a daily rate if the 0 48 of a population of snails sampled in april muirhead and perry 2021 had all been in aestivation for 180 days six months this would require a daily parasitism rate of approximately 0 004 however if most of these snails had only been in aestivation for 60 days 2 months it would equate to a daily parasitism rate of 0 01 higher daily parasitism rates were included when simulations showed that a parasitism rate of 0 01 day 1 did not affect the simulated snail populations to examine the impact of repeated releases of flies we released 5 000 reproductive female flies 0 5 of the total large snail population on 15 november for five consecutive years 2000 2004 using the same parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 to identify optimal timing of fly releases at warooka we used a parasitism rate of 0 3 day 1 identified by previous simulations to impact snail populations we released 5000 reproductive female flies for five consecutive years 2000 2004 on 15 october 15 december or 15 march to compare with the previous five consecutive releases on 15 november to examine the impact of releasing fewer female flies over a longer timeframe we used parasitism rates of 0 3 and 0 48 day 1 identified by previous simulations to impact snail populations we released 1 000 or 2 000 reproductive female flies on november 15 for ten consecutive years 2000 2009 finally we replicated the releases made in 2000 2001 by leyson et al 2003 who released different numbers of flies 230 400 on four different occasions around warooka in this study 200 snails were sampled at various heights on plants on each of three subsequent assessment dates and dissected for evidence of fly parasitism with the results presented only as yes confirmed present or no not confirmed present leyson et al 2003 in these simulations we assumed that leyson et al 2003 released equal numbers of male and female flies leyson et al 2003 only provided the number of flies released with no mention of sex ratio hence we released the same number of female flies as would have been released with a 50 50 sex ratio male flies are irrelevant in our simulations and used maximum parasitism rates of 0 07 0 15 and 0 3 day 1 it should be noted that in leyson et al 2003 there appears to be an error in the stated assessment dates for the first release the second assessment is indicated as having occurred on 29 03 2002 whereas the third assessment is noted as having occurred on 20 02 2002 looking at the assessment dates provided for all the releases we used 29 03 2001 which is the same as the second assessment date for the second release and in keeping with another set of assessment dates for the third and fourth releases there are substantial epistemic issues with comparing the results of leyson et al 2003 and our model results nonetheless we did apply a statistical comparison because the assessment of presence of flies at each sample relied on detecting small numbers of flies in small samples of snails 200 per site and date we adopted a bayesian method with an uninformative jeffreys binomial prior probability for each of the positive and negative assessments and posterior probabilities for positive and negative assessments given samples of 200 snails we then used one sided significance tests using the beta function to assess the likelihood that the proportion of flies that were modelled as parasitised each time the population was sampled in leyson et al 2003 was significantly inconsistent with a positive or negative assessment the code was implemented in r language for statistical computing supplementary material 2 3 results 3 1 snails only with only snails present the simulation for warooka yorke peninsula indicated that the density dependant function regulated snail numbers in most years as expected from a model driven by weather population numbers varied as a function of climatic conditions the model simulated annual numbers of snails equivalent to the very high numbers recorded in field a in 2000 and 2002 baker 2008 although numbers of snails recorded in adjacent field b baker 2008 were about one third lower than both in field a and our simulations thus whilst the model did not replicate the observation of many more snails present in may 2000 and may 2002 than in previous years 1985 1999 or in 2001 and 2003 fig 3 a and b it did simulate a similar number of large active snails per unit area in may 2000 and may 2002 as recorded in those years for field a by baker 2008 snail numbers were anecdotally reported to be high after wet summers in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 following the millennial drought k perry pers comm whilst the model did simulate a greater number of large active and large aestivating snails in 2010 than in each of the previous five years this was not true for 2011 fig 3a and b the simulation for mt hope eyre peninsula showed very different snail population dynamics fig 3c and d with density dependant mortality occurring infrequently a grain producer at mt hope reported that 2010 was an awful year for snails where only a single snail is allowed per 2 25 litre sample of grain exported to china gimaf 2018 there were more than 200 extremely small snails in 0 5 litre of grain j doudle pers comm compared to the three preceding years and all subsequent years the simulation showed a larger small snail population in 2010 fig 3c supporting this producer s observation of a preponderance of small snails in 2010 and fewer snails in subsequent years 3 2 parasitism rates single fly releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 for warooka no single release of female flies with maximum parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 affected the simulated snail population and a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 resulted in very minor and short lived impacts not shown with a parasitism rate of 0 3 day 1 releasing 10 000 female flies had a short term impact on the snail population with flies still present at the end of the simulation supplementary material 3 releasing fewer female flies had less impact on the snail population with the fly populations persisting until the end of the simulations not shown simulations for warooka using a 0 48 day 1 maximum parasitism rate indicated that the model was sensitive to the number of reproductive female flies released however regardless of the number of female flies released the simulated snail populations all recovered partly because many small snails escaped parasitism to contribute to population growth and partly because all large aestivating snails were parasitised thus preventing further fly larvipositions and causing the fly populations to die out supplementary material 3 for mt hope the number of female flies released on single occasion had virtually no effect on the simulated snail population when the parasitism rate was below 0 25 day 1 not shown the snail population decreased marginally after releasing 10 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 but the fly population was not self sustaining and died out within five years supplementary material 4 the model was also sensitive here to the number of reproductive female flies released with a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate reducing the number of flies released extended the longevity of the fly population but more critically the snail population never recovered to the same level as when no flies are present supplementary material 4 these simulations highlight the very different responses of snails and flies to the environmental conditions at warooka and mt hope 3 3 augmentative control five releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 with parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 repeated annual releases of flies had no impact on the simulated snail population at warooka with a 0 25 day 1 parasitism rate releasing 5 000 females annually for five years marginally decreased the snail population until 2007 with the fly population persisting until september 2015 not shown with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 snail numbers were reduced for several years but recovered to the same level as when there are no flies present by 2016 fig 4 due to the very large population of small snails fig 4a escaping parasitism and contributing to population growth the fly population died out two years after the last release table 1 with a 0 48 day 1 maximum parasitism rate the simulated snail population at warooka was quickly decimated with recovery only apparent in 2016 fig 4a and b because all available large snails were parasitised quickly with this rate of parasitism the fly populations died out within months of each release table 1 however the snail population was dramatically decreased since reproduction each autumn winter depended on the remaining small snails growing sufficiently and there were fewer snails able to reproduce each year the number of small snails vastly exceeded that of larger snails fig 4a vs fig 4b reinforcing the significance of these massive numbers of small snails able to escape parasitism and contribute to the recovery of the snail population although the fly population died out several months after the last fly release on 15 november 2004 table 1 the snail population was reduced to such an extent that there were fewer than 15 000 snails ha 1 able to reproduce in the spring of 2005 and it took many years for the population to begin to recover fig 4a and b at mt hope simulations with a parasitism rate below 0 25 day 1 had no impact on the snail population not shown only when the parasitism rate was increased to 0 25 and 0 30 day 1 were any effects seen with a large decrease in the snail population noticeable in the summer of 2004 2005 the last year of fly release fig 4c and d in contrast to the simulations at warooka fig 4a and b the snail populations stabilised at a lower level than in the simulation without flies fig 4c and d with a fly parasitism rate of 0 48 day 1 all large snails at mt hope were parasitised each year causing both the snail and fly populations to die out not shown 3 4 timing augmentative control five releases in different months with a maximum parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 when simulating releases of flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 annually for five years in october december or march at warooka to compare with previous simulations where flies were released in november we found that timing of releases matters fly releases in october or march did not influence the simulated snail population december releases had a very minor and short term impact whilst the november releases had a significant impact fig 4a and b supplementary material 5 timing of the releases influenced the numbers of flies in subsequent seasons and how long the fly populations were self sustaining supplementary material 5 in simulations for mt hope using a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 to not decimate the snail population releasing flies in november also had the greatest impact on the snail population followed by december releases whilst october and march releases had little impact fig 4c and d supplementary material 6 timing of releases also influenced the numbers of flies each season and how long the fly population survived with november releases enabling the fly population to last for almost 7 years longer than when flies were released in the other months supplementary material 6 3 5 extended augmentative control ten releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 30 and 0 48 day 1 for warooka when 1 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 were released for 10 consecutive years it took the full 10 years of releases to see a significant reduction in aestivating snail numbers and the snail population returned to the same level as in the simulation with no flies within five years fig 5 a because the fly population died out by the end of june 2010 supplementary material 7 with 2 000 flies and a 0 30 day 1 parasitism rate the snail population was severely reduced and snail numbers remained low although population recovery had begun by the end of the simulation fig 5b as the fly population died out in may 2010 supplementary material 7 for mt hope the release of 1 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 severely decreased the snail population fig 5c with the fly population persisting until september 2014 supplementary material 7 however when 2 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 were released for 10 consecutive years the snail population died out in january 2010 and the fly population by march 2010 as there were no more snails to be parasitised supplementary material 7 with a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate regardless of the numbers of flies released annually the snail populations at both warooka fig 5a and b and mt hope fig 5c and d died out as the flies parasitised all large aestivating snails virtually every year ultimately depleting the snail population and causing it to die out supplementary material 7 the final fly releases two at warooka and five at mt hope in the simulations were ineffective as with no snails available to be parasitised the fly populations were unable to persist supplementary material 7 3 6 warooka simulating fly releases by leyson et al 2003 when we simulated the four fly releases made by leyson et al 2003 using three different daily parasitism rates we obtained similar results in 0 42 of the instances table 2 an exact binomial test on this result provided a p value of 0 405 indicating that the model only randomly accords with leyson et al 2003 not surprisingly higher parasitisation rates resulted in more flies enabling the fly population to persist for longer table 2 4 discussion simulations at warooka and mt hope indicated that snail populations were suppressed only with repeated fly releases and parasitism rates in excess of 0 25 day 1 figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 3 and 4 vs the less than 4 0 04 generally recorded in the field in australia baker et al 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 as discussed earlier section 2 3 it is important to note that the parasitism rates used in the model were applied daily whereas reported parasitism proportions measured the total level of parasitism over some unknown period of time that snails were in aestivation and available for parasitism because the lowest parasitism rate 0 25 day 1 having any impact on snails in the simulations was inordinately higher than could have resulted in any reported sampling proportions the critical finding is that the fly cannot reduce snail numbers because it was built prior to any information being available on the percentage of aestivating snails that are cryptic i e sheltering under grass tussocks in cracks in the soil under rocks or logs etc muirhead and perry 2021 the model simulated a best case scenario in terms of the proportion of large aestivating snails that could be parasitised whilst a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate caused all large aestivating snails to be parasitised and the fly population to die out table 1 allowing the snail population to then recover it nonetheless maximised the proportion of snails that could be parasitised simulations were a best case scenario in terms of any potentially limiting resources available because the modelled fly population was not limited by the availability of food or refuges although it may theoretically be possible that the fly parasitises alternate hosts in winter building up populations so that more flies are available to parasitise snails in spring this scenario is inconsistent with what is currently known about the life history of the fly and with the low parasitism rates observed in the field baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 because all simulations using parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 had no influence on simulated snail populations the value of alternate hosts in boosting snail control can be discounted host specificity testing done prior to its release unpublished results indicated that the fly was not likely to use other non pest native gastropods in south australia the fly is known to parasitise cochlicella prietocella barbara linnaeus another introduced pest snail species that co occurs with c acuta in australia ruynat 2012 muirhead and perry 2021 with the parasitism rate of c barbara slightly higher 3 39 than that of c acuta 2 85 at fly positive sites on the yorke peninsula muirhead and perry 2021 the use of c barbara as an alternate host may contribute to the low rates of parasitism observed in the field baker et al 2010 jourdan et al 2019 muirhead and perry 2021 however because the model does not allow for the use of alternate hosts to reduce the rate at which simulated c acuta snails are parasitised it simulates a best case scenario in terms of snail control the inability of flies to suppress snail populations in our simulations even with a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 that far exceeds the rate normally seen in the field indicates that flies are unlikely to reduce snail populations in south australia when deployed as a stand alone classical biological control program although the fly was released multiple times leyson et al 2003 and is established on the yorke peninsula it has not reduced snail populations substantially baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 there are several possible explanations for this result firstly a molecular study using coi and 16s genes showed that snails in australia belong to the 3rd lineage found in morocco spain portugal western france and southwest england jourdan et al 2019 in contrast flies found in australia most closely match haplotypes found in southern france jourdan et al 2020 secondly the snails may be better adapted to the climates in southern australia than the flies areas where the fly populations originate match the climate of south australia and south western west australia less well than do areas where the snail populations originate jourdan et al 2019 this reinforces the notion that only by understanding the climatic effects on pest snail populations will we begin to understand management effects including biological control carrière et al 2003 zalucki et al 2017 li et al 2019 thirdly the fly strain imported to australia may not be very effective at biocontrol holling 1965 the low snail parasitism rate 4 in australia thomann et al 2020 muirhead and perry 2021 and france coupland and baker 1994 compared to the much higher rate 0 13 0 25 in southern iberia thomann et al 2020 could be partly due to a genetic bottleneck experienced when the fly was introduced to australia as few individuals were brought to australia and many of these died prior to release g baker pers comm fourthly large scale monoculture farming is usually the norm in australia with limited availability of food sources and fly refuges parasitoids feed on nectar honeydew and pollen which are essential for survival e g see review by benelli et al 2017 the lack of adjacent flowering vegetation in broad scale australian agriculture likely limits fly populations and decreases their ability to regulate snail populations the highest rates of parasitism of both c acuta and c barbara on the yorke peninsula occur at sites adjacent to spring and summer flowering native vegetation muirhead and perry 2021 lastly flies primarily parasitise snails on elevated exposed surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 it was previously reported that no snails recovered from under rocks were parasitised coupland and baker 1994 however a large percentage of aestivating snails are cryptic and hence less available for parasitism only 30 of snails larger than 5 mm were found on elevated substrates whilst 53 were in ground and plant refuges and 17 at ground level muirhead and perry 2021 although it is unknown if there were more smaller snails in the refuges than on the elevated surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 it makes biological sense that smaller snails are better able to find protected nooks and crannies in which to aestivate this is supported by the finding that a larger percentage 76 of the smaller 8 10 mm for a mature snail c barbara population was found in cryptic habitats than the larger up to 18 mm for a mature snail c acuta 53 muirhead and perry 2021 all of the cryptic habitats identified by muirhead and perry 2021 were along roadside verges bordering paddocks various factors remain unknown 1 what happens within the large scale fields where snails are reported to be a major problem 2 whether any refuges are spatially patchy 3 whether snails can burrow underground as no one has reported any attempts to find buried snails of any height and 4 whether cryptic snails remain in aestivation for the duration of summer or are more likely to respond quickly to heavy dews or light rains to forage and grow before finding another refuge to shelter in a more facultative plastic aestivation process in cryptic snails would allow population growth to continue in short duration favourable spells perhaps leading to earlier reproduction the following autumn if all snails have cryptic behaviour then a large proportion of snails may be unavailable for parasitism thereby further reducing any impact of sarcophagid flies however if the cryptic population is biased towards small snails then other forms of management are needed to target these small snails although cryptic behaviour during aestivation does not explain the low parasitism rates of snails on elevated surfaces it may explain the ability of c acuta to maintain high population levels it was noted over three decades ago that there was little information available on the life histories and ecologies of pest snails in australia that factors controlling their distributions and population dynamics were poorly understood and that such information was basic to any future attempts to control them baker 1986 subsequent research has provided information used to model the snail lifecycle and growth rates in the laboratory mohamed and ali 2011 fecundity and reproduction in the laboratory baker and hawke 1991 mohamed and ali 2011 mortality in the laboratory baker and hawke 1991 baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 ruynat 2012 and the minimum height able to be parasitised by flies ruynat 2012 for flies there was some laboratory information on development and larviposition rate coupland and baker 1994 and on mortality baker et al 2010 nonetheless rather than having an abundance of data with which to parameterise the model we had to guess at biologically plausible mechanisms supplementary material 1 to capture anecdotal observations building this model highlighted extensive gaps in the understanding of the basic biology of both the snail and fly supplementary material 8 this lack of knowledge results in obvious issues with the model simulations show very different population dynamics for warooka and mt hope with much smaller snail populations simulated at mt hope however grain producers at mt hope complain of high snail numbers affecting their crops j doudle and p parsons pers comm although producers perspectives on this issue may be subjective and although snail numbers are high i e finding more than 200 conical snails in 0 5 litre of grain when for export purposes only one snail was allowed j doudle pers comm no data are available to allow an objective comparison of snail populations at warooka and mt hope because the model was initialised identically at both locations the same environmental factors drive population dynamics and crop management factors are likely similar the simulations suggest that climatic differences at these locations are crucial to snail population dynamics fig 3a and b vs fig 3c and d whilst the model may be too sensitive to the climatic drivers the paucity of data with which to parameterise it makes it impossible to address this issue decisively if snail numbers are indeed similar on both the eyre and yorke peninsulas then the simulations highlight our lack of understanding of snail population dynamics and the key environmental factors driving them targeted assessments of snail populations at both locations are necessary to assess the model s accuracy model however the entire snail population must be sampled including snails smaller than 5 mm that are ignored in current sampling protocols simulations did not show the same peaks in snail population numbers on the yorke peninsula as was observed baker 2008 there was little to distinguish one year from another in the simulation for warooka fig 3a and b because simulated snail populations regularly reached carrying capacity and so were regulated by density dependant mortality of small active snails simulations did not support anecdotal observations of more snails in the wet years of 2010 and 2011 following the millennial drought k perry pers comm simulated numbers of snails were not lower during the drought years prior to 2010 fig 3a and b the rainfall data for warooka do not indicate a drought in the 2000 s or significant additional moisture due to the la nina events in 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 bom 2012 as rainfall in 2009 2012 was not exceptionally high supplementary material 9 without any data on snail populations over this timeframe it is impossible to verify or validate the anecdotal observations the model did produce a peak in population numbers especially of small snails at mt hope in 2010 fig 3c d in agreement with observations j doudle pers comm rainfall data for mt hope shows that 2006 2008 were the driest years since 2002 supplementary material 9 higher rainfall in 2009 may have increased recruitment that year resulting in the large number of small snails observed in 2010 however although 2010 had the highest rainfall since 1995 and rainfall in 2011 2014 was similar to that in 2009 the simulated snail population remained low fig 3c and d nonetheless these simulations are consistent with the observation that whilst snails are still common they are not as numerous as in 2010 j doudle pers comm the overall conclusion is that the model did not agree with the results of leyson et al 2003 table 2 there were two main problems with the results presented in leyson et al 2003 the first was an incorrect sampling date and the second was a methodological issue likely due to small sampling size only 200 snails parasitised snails were not collected in one or both of the first two assessments in some releases but were collected in the final assessments leyson et al 2003 if parasitised snails were present at the end then flies were necessarily present until then and there should have been parasitised snails in the earlier assessments but not enough snails were sampled to detect the presence of the fly notwithstanding these issues there are other problems whilst we assumed that only aestivating snails were sampled there is nothing to state that this was the case even though snails were collected at various heights on grass stalks i e by implication not mobile or active leyson et al 2003 the simulations indicated that no snails were in aestivation on half six of the assessment dates table 2 the parasitised snails in aestivation on these occasions were in effect zombie snails that could not come out of aestivation all other snails were not in aestivation it was sufficiently cool and wet but fly development in these snails was still incomplete and so these few parasitised snails made up the entire proportion of aestivating snails that were parasitised skewing the analysis on the proportion of aestivating snails that were parasitised to compound this problem leyson et al 2003 sampled parasitised snails in two of these assessments warooka 1a 2nd assessment warooka sth 3 3rd assessment but not in the remaining four warooka 1b second assessment warooka sth 3 2nd assessment warooka sw 5 1st and 2nd assessments table 2 thirdly when the model indicated that all snails were in aestivation but only a small proportion were parasitised leyson et al 2003 sampled parasitised snails in two assessments warooka 1b 1st and 3rd assessments but not in two others warooka 1a 3rd assessment warooka sth 3 1st assessment table 2 as discussed above this suggests that the model is imperfect and does not truly capture the nature of interactions between flies and snails and raising once again the question of whether or not active snails can be parasitised nor their respective interactions with the environment nonetheless simulations for warooka suggest that the fly does little to reduce snail populations consistent with the perception of the situation on the yorke peninsula leyson et al 2003 jourdan et al 2019 thomann et al 2020 muirhead and perry 2021 because small snails cannot be parasitised in the model coupland and baker 1994 ruynat 2012 populations recover simply because of the vast number of small snails able to grow and reproduce in the new season figs 4a b and 5a b decimating the population of large aestivating snails by parasitism reduces the density dependent mortality of small snails allowing more of them to survive and contribute to future population growth laboratory experiments indicate that 5 mm is the minimum height that can be parasitised coupland and baker 1994 ruynat 2012 however c barbara are parasitised at a higher rate 3 39 than c acuta 2 85 on elevated surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 although mature c barbara are smaller 8 10 mm long than mature c acuta up to 18 mm long leonard et al 2003 because c acuta is thinner 4 7 mm wide and c barbara is stouter or broader 5 8 mm wide white mclean 2011a 2011b this may differentially affect their suitability as hosts the size of a snail is paramount to the developing fly larva as the snail is the only resource available for its development snails that are too small may not provide enough resources to the larva or the aperture may be too small for the adult fly to emerge while there is an evolutionary imperative for the female fly to choose adequate snails on which to larviposit it is unclear whether flies actively avoid smaller hosts or larviposition on smaller snails is not successful the recovery of snail populations in simulations at warooka figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 3 makes it clear that a better understanding of the ecology of small snails is necessary if they can be parasitised then reducing their numbers might slow population growth if they cannot be parasitised they represent a robust reservoir of population recruits and other targeted methods of controlling small snails need to be researched to achieve satisfactory population control the vulnerable stages of a pest species cannot be targeted if its biology and ecology are not understood management practices that increase mortality of lifestages where there is strong density dependence are inefficient and likely futile kriticos et al 1999 this model highlights our lack of understanding of what comprises a snail population although direct counting of snails has long been known to underestimate the numbers of small and cryptic snails baker 1986 no other sampling technique has been developed to better estimate snail populations and their age structure recent observations indicate that a large percentage of the snail population is cryptic despite expressly searching for snails none were found in an initial survey although many were found in follow up surveys at the same location in south australia kate muirhead pers comm given that parasitism rates were much higher 5 5 on snails in elevated habitats than in ground 0 9 or plant refuges 2 5 and yet snails on elevated habitats comprised only 30 of the population whereas cryptic snails comprised 53 of the population muirhead and perry 2021 it is clear that critical knowledge on snail populations is lacking snails smaller than 5 mm in height were never considered in any fieldwork surveys or analyses e g baker et al 1991 muirhead and perry 2021 and because they were ignored it is unknown what percentage of the entire population is cryptic if some suppression is better than none then as long as density dependant regulation does not allow the snail populations to grow and make up deficits as they did in all simulations with parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 it may help to ensure that fly populations are self sustaining at levels higher than their current ones the highest level of snail parasitism yet recorded in australia was at a site adjacent to spring and summer flowering native vegetation muirhead and perry 2021 however whilst a parasitism rate of 48 was recorded on a single sampling occasion at this location it only averaged 10 over the two year survey period muirhead and perry 2021 indicating that factors other than food refuges contribute to parasitism this same study showed that over 20 years the maximum distance between a sampled fly population and a release site was 34 km and the second largest distance was 21 km muirhead and perry 2021 this observed limited dispersal behaviour of flies supports the simulations indicating that only targeted releases of large numbers of flies over multiple years figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 5 will help reduce snail populations on the yorke peninsula simulations suggest that timing of fly releases is critical to its successful establishment and impact on snail populations supplementary material 5 and 6 however there are no indications that timing of fly releases on the yorke peninsula leyson et al 2003 or on the eyre peninsula k muirhead and k perry unpublished data aimed to maximise its establishment mass rearing of parasitoids is a notoriously complex process influenced by many factors dindo and grenier 2023 and optimally timed releases may be difficult to plan nonetheless simulations showed that when female flies were released in october many snails had not yet aestivated thereby preventing these flies from larvipositing december releases had little impact on snail populations at warooka supplementary material 5 although snail numbers were decreased at mt hope and remained lower supplementary material 6 releases in march allowed larviposition and successful overwintering of immature fly stages however many of these eclosed as adults in the spring before snails aestivated and died before they could larviposit successful reproduction rarely occurred before the end of october at either location with snail populations largely unaffected supplementary material 5 and 6 it will be interesting to see if flies released on the eyre peninsula become established and how well they succeed it may also help to release flies there in spring november as the model suggested that they have a better chance of establishing in larger numbers and having a greater impact on the snail population supplementary material 6 because the fly parasitises the snail in europe it was assumed that it could help suppress snail populations in australia which is why it was introduced leyson et al 2003 however it is not evident that this fly controls snail populations in europe the highest parasitism rate reported there is 13 25 in southern iberia thomann et al 2020 but no studies have examined whether or not this parasitism rate significantly supresses snail populations simulations suggested an asynchrony between the snail and fly populations in australia whilst many large snails were parasitised during aestivation in the simulations snails had exited aestivation by the end of may this meant that the large numbers of simulated flies present at that time were unable to larviposit and died without being able to reproduce the fact that a species can parasitise a known gastropod host does not make it an effective biological control agent egleton et al 2021 despite its limitations the model suggests that even when all available large snails are parasitised table 1 a large population of small snails remains to ensure that the population continues to grow and that even with parasitism rates greater than 0 25 day 1 it will be difficult to reduce snail populations without repeated fly introductions with no data on the fly phenology on the yorke peninsula we cannot assess whether or not its effectiveness as a biological control agent could be improved sufficiently with targeted augmentative releases or whether the climate there is simply not suitable for it to persist in large numbers jourdan et al 2019 simulations suggest that the fly cannot be an effective biological control agent of the snail in south australia despite known defects the model provides important lessons about pest management model development supplementary material 1 highlighted the lack of data with which to parameterise the lifecycle modules despite over three decades of research and attempts to manage the snail in australia as with bactrocera tryoni yonow et al 2004 this highlights the value of modelling for identifying critical gaps in our understanding of a pest species biology and ecology when the b tryoni model was being constructed there had been more than 50 years of research on this pest scientists and stakeholders alike thought that the data necessary for constructing a model was abundant yet it was only in collating the information in a modelling framework that important knowledge gaps became apparent we cannot emphasise strongly enough that until critical knowledge gaps supplementary material 8 are addressed efforts to manage pest snail populations will likely remain haphazard and ineffective we show that even a model built from scant data can provide important insights into a biological system by examining the sensitivity of the model to different initial snail numbers and height classes fly parasitism rates consecutive annual fly releases and the timing of fly releases we could identify and understand the biological mechanisms producing these results and posit why management of snail populations has not been effective models such as this one can be constructed relatively quickly and each simulation takes less than a minute this clearly makes modelling a far less expensive strategy than conducting time and labour intensive field or laboratory work whilst modelling does not replace field or laboratory studies its ability to inform management and identify the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed by such studies is invaluable we emphasise that a modelling framework should always be considered an essential component of pest management research programs at the outset even the simplest model can help researchers think about problems in a more systematic way if effects of climate on population dynamics can be understood and incorporated into models population changes due to management practices can be identified and interpreted stuart et al 2002 carrière et al 2003 zalucki et al 2017 li et al 2019 only by synthesising information into a modelling framework can information gaps critical to understanding and managing the system effectively be identified had such a framework been used decades ago to collate available data on the snail researchers would have been able to identify many of these knowledge gaps and possibly begun to address them via targeted research projects other gaps would then surely have appeared however understanding of the biology and ecology of the snail would have significantly improved along with the management capacity 5 conclusions a population dynamics model of the land snail c acuta and one of its parasitoids s villeneuveana was built using dymex the model suggests that suppression of snail populations only becomes possible if the parasitism rate is increased well beyond what has ever been recorded and with repeated annual releases of the fly during spring although the current model appears to describe the phenology of both the snail and the fly adequately constructing the model allowed us to identify many knowledge gaps efforts to control the snail must be made with an understanding of its biology and the factors driving its population dynamics otherwise any control measures will likely have mixed results as there will be no real understanding of how or why they may or may not work we highlight the importance of modelling to synthesise available data into a framework that

24169,we built a dymex population dynamics model of the invasive land snail cochlicella acuta and one of its dipteran parasitoids sarcophaga villeneuveana the snail lifecycle consists of different size classes based on shell height as both parasitism and reproduction are influenced by snail height the model reveals the likely role of small cryptic snails in maintaining populations in the face of biological control and suggests that suppression of snail populations may only be possible with unrealistically high parasitism rates and with repeated annual spring releases of flies the current model appears to describe the phenology of both the snail and fly adequately however construction of the model identified numerous knowledge gaps snail control would benefit from a thorough understanding of its basic biology and what drives its population dynamics aspects which surprisingly have been largely ignored otherwise any control measures will likely be unpredictable with no real understanding of how or why management options may or may not work we highlight the importance of modelling preferably at an early stage to synthesise available knowledge and data into a framework

parry et al 2017 here we argue that modelling should be included in pest management research from the outset rather than occurring as an afterthought based on the misconception that preceding decades of research will have provided the necessary biological information and understanding the conical snail cochlicella acuta müller mollusca geomitridae originates from the mediterranean region in australia it was first reported in minlaton on the yorke peninsula in south australia in 1953 and now occurs much more widely ala 2021 fig 1 when temperatures increase in summer snails climb to

designed to estimate the parasitoid induced mortality rates necessary to suppress snail populations to sub economic impact levels and to examine how to improve the effectiveness of flies in managing snail populations we use the dymex package maywald et al 2007 which has been used in numerous studies to explore pest population dynamics farr 2002 steinbauer et al 2004 yonow et al 2004 hallett et al

2002 yonow et al 2004 maywald et al 2007 zalucki et al 2017 at each time step that any individuals enter a lifestage a new cohort of individuals is created in that lifestage all lifestage processes e g development mortality transfer to the next lifestage are tracked on a cohort basis consequently all cohorts in a lifestage are not identical e g some are older or larger or have experienced more stress individual variation in mortality and stage transfer within a cohort can also be simulated resulting in a realistic simulation of a population and capturing a range of responses to different conditions experienced by individuals in the population because it is process based dymex requires information about lifestage processes and the climatic factors that drive population dynamics yonow et al 2004 hulthen and clarke 2006 hallett et al 2009 li et al 2016 gu et al 2018 with relationships between variables and the processes they affect being described by parameters or functions the model then allows the exploration of different management options and can identify those parts of a species lifecycle that are most vulnerable to these management strategies the aim of our model was a to better understand the population dynamics of both snails and flies b to identify why flies are not effective in controlling snail populations on the yorke peninsula and c to examine whether future augmentative fly releases could help control snails in posing and investigating these questions we highlighted deficiencies in previous studies and identified research necessary to better understand the population dynamics of both species thus demonstrating the benefits of incorporating modelling into pest management research preferably at an early stage 2 model 2 1 model development the dymex model operates on a daily time step a timer sets the duration of the simulation area being modelled defines the area being simulated default of 1 ha latitude is used to automatically calculate daylength in a simulation parasitism rate sets the maximum parasitism rate 0 0 5 day 1 of aestivating snails to be used in a simulation metdata reads the daily meteorological data file for a location and defines the variables used daily temperature cycle calculates hourly temperatures using daily minimum and maximum temperatures and daylength and a 10 mm single bucket soil moisture module simulates the plant available water content in the upper soil profile we use two lifecycle modules one each for snails and flies and seven expression modules to calculate values for lifestage state variables e g total active snail number sums the total number of snails in each of the five active lifestages at each time step of the seven expression modules five are used to visualise the results one calculates the density of all active snails to allow density dependant mortality to be applied to small snails and one calculates the ratio of aestivating snails to female flies to enable the daily calculation of fly larviposition rate the snail lifecycle is driven by temperature and surface soil moisture and the fly lifecycle is driven by temperature although there are no data available on the density of snail populations e g maximum density per unit area how or whether snails interact to regulate density the model incorporates density dependant mortality of small snails to prevent populations from growing exponentially this is undoubtedly a simplistic mechanism as density dependant regulation could occur in various ways e g reduced growth rates mortality in larger snails reduced reproduction etc but without any data available we opted for a simple yet biologically plausible mechanism density dependant mortality of flies is not required in the model as simulated fly population growth is regulated by the number of aestivating snails available for parasitism height dependant lifestages are assigned in the snail lifecycle although many lifestage processes are identical in the different lifestages details are provided in supplementary material 1 small snails 5 25 mm are not parasitized by flies baker et al 2010 ruynat 2012 and thus have a separate aestivating lifestage while medium snails 5 25 9 mm can be parasitised but are too small to breed mohamed and ali 2011 fig 2 as there is insufficient information to differentiate between fly larval and pupal stages or to describe them separately they are combined into a single lifestage immature fly all parasitised snails become immature flies fig 2 green arrow which simulates a larger fly population than would occur in the field as not all fly larvae survive in reality but we lack information on fly mortality in aestivating snails fly larviposition involves two interdependent processes larviposition per se and parasitisation of snails since any larviposition results in a parasitised snail once female flies are reproductively active larviposition depends on the user defined maximum parasitism rate and on the ratio of the total number of aestivating snails to the total number of female flies if there are many more aestivating snails than female flies then flies can easily find them and larviposit if there are only a few aestivating snails and many female flies then the larviposition rate per female fly is reduced larviposition is therefore only possible if a host is available with the proportion of aestivating snails in each cohort becoming parasitised on any given day calculated as per eq 1 1 p r o p o r t i o n p a r a s i t i s e d m i n 1 n u m b e r f l y l a r v a e n u m b e r a e s t i v a t i n g s n a i l s hence the number of fly larvae available determines the number of aestivating snails parasitised fig 2 purple arrow for each lifestage of each species information was sought from the literature to describe the lifestage processes this paper does not aim to present the model in detail model details and derivation of the model parameters are presented in supplementary material 1 the model was envisaged to be run at warooka yorke peninsula south australia fig 1 green circle where both snails and flies occur jourdan et al 2019 jourdan et al 2020 as c acuta is potentially the most significant snail pest at mt hope eyre peninsula south australia fig 1 blue circle we also included this site following discussions with grain producers perry et al 2019 when the model was being crafted the fly did not occur at mt hope however we used the model to provide insights into the usefulness of introducing the fly to this location daily weather data from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2020 for both warooka 34 99 137 40 and mt hope 34 15 135 25 were downloaded from the queensland government s silo climate database https www data qld gov au dataset silo climate database initialisation was begun in 1985 to allow time for snail populations to stabilise so we could examine whether the model simulated the same major population peaks observed in 2000 and 2002 baker 2008 is the only data on snail population dynamics available for any model validation simulations were initialised with 400 000 aestivating small snails 100 000 in each of the following height categories 1 7 2 5 3 5 and 4 5 mm 400 000 aestivating snails 100 000 in each of the following height categories 5 3 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 mm and 400 000 at 9 5 mm which can lay seven egg clutches four different height sub categories were used for small and medium snails to ensure a spread of snail heights in the simulation with these numbers at initialisation simulations replicated the maximum density of 80 m 2 recorded in 1985 for snails 5 mm baker 2008 and also provided a maximum density of ca 225 m 2 large snails at warooka slightly above the reported maximum density of 210 m 2 baker 2008 all simulations presented were initialised with these numbers of snails in these nine height categories and all simulations ran from 1 january 1985 to 31 december 2020 2 2 model evaluation sensitivity of the model to initialisation was examined for both warooka and mt hope in one simulation we halved the numbers for each height class and in a second we reduced the number of height classes to four initialising with 400 000 3 5 mm snails 200 000 5 3 mm snails 200 000 7 5 mm snails and 400 000 9 5 mm snails with half the number of snails per height class it took an additional two years for the snail population to reach the same level initialising with only four height classes did not change the simulation results these simulations suggested that the model is not very sensitive to the initialisation parameters 2 3 simulations we ran the model for warooka and mt hope with snails only and then examined the impacts of both single and annually repeated fly releases with different parasitism rates and the effects of fly releases in different months mature female flies were always released in simulations on november 15 to ensure that at least some snails were in aestivation prior to mid november most simulated snails were still active thereby preventing flies from larvipositing and causing the simulated fly population to die out we first examined the effects of a single release 15 november 2000 of different numbers of reproductive female flies with different parasitism rates we released 10 000 5 000 1 000 500 and 100 female flies equivalent to 1 0 5 0 1 0 05 or 0 01 of the large snail population both active and aestivating and used maximum daily parasitism rates of 0 01 0 04 0 1 0 2 0 25 0 3 and 0 48 daily parasitism rates should be lower than sampled parasitism proportions the latter are a snapshot of the snail population at a point in time where snails have been aestivating and parasitism has been ongoing at the daily parasitism rate for some period however exposure of snails to parasitism pressure is a cohort specific factor with variability in when aestivation begins and ends reducing the median exposure to parasitism pressure in the simulations aestivation often began at the end of september or in early october but snails moved in and out of aestivation because of cooler and wetter conditions so that it often took until february for all snails to be in aestivation similarly the first active snails in the simulations appeared in march although the last snail did not leave aestivation until may thus the minimum period for all snails to be in aestivation was about two months although snails went in and out of aestivation for about 6 months this makes it difficult to relate a sampled parasitism proportion to a daily rate if the 0 48 of a population of snails sampled in april muirhead and perry 2021 had all been in aestivation for 180 days six months this would require a daily parasitism rate of approximately 0 004 however if most of these snails had only been in aestivation for 60 days 2 months it would equate to a daily parasitism rate of 0 01 higher daily parasitism rates were included when simulations showed that a parasitism rate of 0 01 day 1 did not affect the simulated snail populations to examine the impact of repeated releases of flies we released 5 000 reproductive female flies 0 5 of the total large snail population on 15 november for five consecutive years 2000 2004 using the same parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 to identify optimal timing of fly releases at warooka we used a parasitism rate of 0 3 day 1 identified by previous simulations to impact snail populations we released 5000 reproductive female flies for five consecutive years 2000 2004 on 15 october 15 december or 15 march to compare with the previous five consecutive releases on 15 november to examine the impact of releasing fewer female flies over a longer timeframe we used parasitism rates of 0 3 and 0 48 day 1 identified by previous simulations to impact snail populations we released 1 000 or 2 000 reproductive female flies on november 15 for ten consecutive years 2000 2009 finally we replicated the releases made in 2000 2001 by leyson et al 2003 who released different numbers of flies 230 400 on four different occasions around warooka in this study 200 snails were sampled at various heights on plants on each of three subsequent assessment dates and dissected for evidence of fly parasitism with the results presented only as yes confirmed present or no not confirmed present leyson et al 2003 in these simulations we assumed that leyson et al 2003 released equal numbers of male and female flies leyson et al 2003 only provided the number of flies released with no mention of sex ratio hence we released the same number of female flies as would have been released with a 50 50 sex ratio male flies are irrelevant in our simulations and used maximum parasitism rates of 0 07 0 15 and 0 3 day 1 it should be noted that in leyson et al 2003 there appears to be an error in the stated assessment dates for the first release the second assessment is indicated as having occurred on 29 03 2002 whereas the third assessment is noted as having occurred on 20 02 2002 looking at the assessment dates provided for all the releases we used 29 03 2001 which is the same as the second assessment date for the second release and in keeping with another set of assessment dates for the third and fourth releases there are substantial epistemic issues with comparing the results of leyson et al 2003 and our model results nonetheless we did apply a statistical comparison because the assessment of presence of flies at each sample relied on detecting small numbers of flies in small samples of snails 200 per site and date we adopted a bayesian method with an uninformative jeffreys binomial prior probability for each of the positive and negative assessments and posterior probabilities for positive and negative assessments given samples of 200 snails we then used one sided significance tests using the beta function to assess the likelihood that the proportion of flies that were modelled as parasitised each time the population was sampled in leyson et al 2003 was significantly inconsistent with a positive or negative assessment the code was implemented in r language for statistical computing supplementary material 2 3 results 3 1 snails only with only snails present the simulation for warooka yorke peninsula indicated that the density dependant function regulated snail numbers in most years as expected from a model driven by weather population numbers varied as a function of climatic conditions the model simulated annual numbers of snails equivalent to the very high numbers recorded in field a in 2000 and 2002 baker 2008 although numbers of snails recorded in adjacent field b baker 2008 were about one third lower than both in field a and our simulations thus whilst the model did not replicate the observation of many more snails present in may 2000 and may 2002 than in previous years 1985 1999 or in 2001 and 2003 fig 3 a and b it did simulate a similar number of large active snails per unit area in may 2000 and may 2002 as recorded in those years for field a by baker 2008 snail numbers were anecdotally reported to be high after wet summers in 2009 2010 and 2010 2011 following the millennial drought k perry pers comm whilst the model did simulate a greater number of large active and large aestivating snails in 2010 than in each of the previous five years this was not true for 2011 fig 3a and b the simulation for mt hope eyre peninsula showed very different snail population dynamics fig 3c and d with density dependant mortality occurring infrequently a grain producer at mt hope reported that 2010 was an awful year for snails where only a single snail is allowed per 2 25 litre sample of grain exported to china gimaf 2018 there were more than 200 extremely small snails in 0 5 litre of grain j doudle pers comm compared to the three preceding years and all subsequent years the simulation showed a larger small snail population in 2010 fig 3c supporting this producer s observation of a preponderance of small snails in 2010 and fewer snails in subsequent years 3 2 parasitism rates single fly releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 for warooka no single release of female flies with maximum parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 affected the simulated snail population and a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 resulted in very minor and short lived impacts not shown with a parasitism rate of 0 3 day 1 releasing 10 000 female flies had a short term impact on the snail population with flies still present at the end of the simulation supplementary material 3 releasing fewer female flies had less impact on the snail population with the fly populations persisting until the end of the simulations not shown simulations for warooka using a 0 48 day 1 maximum parasitism rate indicated that the model was sensitive to the number of reproductive female flies released however regardless of the number of female flies released the simulated snail populations all recovered partly because many small snails escaped parasitism to contribute to population growth and partly because all large aestivating snails were parasitised thus preventing further fly larvipositions and causing the fly populations to die out supplementary material 3 for mt hope the number of female flies released on single occasion had virtually no effect on the simulated snail population when the parasitism rate was below 0 25 day 1 not shown the snail population decreased marginally after releasing 10 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 but the fly population was not self sustaining and died out within five years supplementary material 4 the model was also sensitive here to the number of reproductive female flies released with a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate reducing the number of flies released extended the longevity of the fly population but more critically the snail population never recovered to the same level as when no flies are present supplementary material 4 these simulations highlight the very different responses of snails and flies to the environmental conditions at warooka and mt hope 3 3 augmentative control five releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 01 0 48 day 1 with parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 repeated annual releases of flies had no impact on the simulated snail population at warooka with a 0 25 day 1 parasitism rate releasing 5 000 females annually for five years marginally decreased the snail population until 2007 with the fly population persisting until september 2015 not shown with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 snail numbers were reduced for several years but recovered to the same level as when there are no flies present by 2016 fig 4 due to the very large population of small snails fig 4a escaping parasitism and contributing to population growth the fly population died out two years after the last release table 1 with a 0 48 day 1 maximum parasitism rate the simulated snail population at warooka was quickly decimated with recovery only apparent in 2016 fig 4a and b because all available large snails were parasitised quickly with this rate of parasitism the fly populations died out within months of each release table 1 however the snail population was dramatically decreased since reproduction each autumn winter depended on the remaining small snails growing sufficiently and there were fewer snails able to reproduce each year the number of small snails vastly exceeded that of larger snails fig 4a vs fig 4b reinforcing the significance of these massive numbers of small snails able to escape parasitism and contribute to the recovery of the snail population although the fly population died out several months after the last fly release on 15 november 2004 table 1 the snail population was reduced to such an extent that there were fewer than 15 000 snails ha 1 able to reproduce in the spring of 2005 and it took many years for the population to begin to recover fig 4a and b at mt hope simulations with a parasitism rate below 0 25 day 1 had no impact on the snail population not shown only when the parasitism rate was increased to 0 25 and 0 30 day 1 were any effects seen with a large decrease in the snail population noticeable in the summer of 2004 2005 the last year of fly release fig 4c and d in contrast to the simulations at warooka fig 4a and b the snail populations stabilised at a lower level than in the simulation without flies fig 4c and d with a fly parasitism rate of 0 48 day 1 all large snails at mt hope were parasitised each year causing both the snail and fly populations to die out not shown 3 4 timing augmentative control five releases in different months with a maximum parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 when simulating releases of flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 annually for five years in october december or march at warooka to compare with previous simulations where flies were released in november we found that timing of releases matters fly releases in october or march did not influence the simulated snail population december releases had a very minor and short term impact whilst the november releases had a significant impact fig 4a and b supplementary material 5 timing of the releases influenced the numbers of flies in subsequent seasons and how long the fly populations were self sustaining supplementary material 5 in simulations for mt hope using a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 to not decimate the snail population releasing flies in november also had the greatest impact on the snail population followed by december releases whilst october and march releases had little impact fig 4c and d supplementary material 6 timing of releases also influenced the numbers of flies each season and how long the fly population survived with november releases enabling the fly population to last for almost 7 years longer than when flies were released in the other months supplementary material 6 3 5 extended augmentative control ten releases with maximum parasitism rates of 0 30 and 0 48 day 1 for warooka when 1 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 were released for 10 consecutive years it took the full 10 years of releases to see a significant reduction in aestivating snail numbers and the snail population returned to the same level as in the simulation with no flies within five years fig 5 a because the fly population died out by the end of june 2010 supplementary material 7 with 2 000 flies and a 0 30 day 1 parasitism rate the snail population was severely reduced and snail numbers remained low although population recovery had begun by the end of the simulation fig 5b as the fly population died out in may 2010 supplementary material 7 for mt hope the release of 1 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 severely decreased the snail population fig 5c with the fly population persisting until september 2014 supplementary material 7 however when 2 000 female flies with a parasitism rate of 0 30 day 1 were released for 10 consecutive years the snail population died out in january 2010 and the fly population by march 2010 as there were no more snails to be parasitised supplementary material 7 with a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate regardless of the numbers of flies released annually the snail populations at both warooka fig 5a and b and mt hope fig 5c and d died out as the flies parasitised all large aestivating snails virtually every year ultimately depleting the snail population and causing it to die out supplementary material 7 the final fly releases two at warooka and five at mt hope in the simulations were ineffective as with no snails available to be parasitised the fly populations were unable to persist supplementary material 7 3 6 warooka simulating fly releases by leyson et al 2003 when we simulated the four fly releases made by leyson et al 2003 using three different daily parasitism rates we obtained similar results in 0 42 of the instances table 2 an exact binomial test on this result provided a p value of 0 405 indicating that the model only randomly accords with leyson et al 2003 not surprisingly higher parasitisation rates resulted in more flies enabling the fly population to persist for longer table 2 4 discussion simulations at warooka and mt hope indicated that snail populations were suppressed only with repeated fly releases and parasitism rates in excess of 0 25 day 1 figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 3 and 4 vs the less than 4 0 04 generally recorded in the field in australia baker et al 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 as discussed earlier section 2 3 it is important to note that the parasitism rates used in the model were applied daily whereas reported parasitism proportions measured the total level of parasitism over some unknown period of time that snails were in aestivation and available for parasitism because the lowest parasitism rate 0 25 day 1 having any impact on snails in the simulations was inordinately higher than could have resulted in any reported sampling proportions the critical finding is that the fly cannot reduce snail numbers because it was built prior to any information being available on the percentage of aestivating snails that are cryptic i e sheltering under grass tussocks in cracks in the soil under rocks or logs etc muirhead and perry 2021 the model simulated a best case scenario in terms of the proportion of large aestivating snails that could be parasitised whilst a 0 48 day 1 parasitism rate caused all large aestivating snails to be parasitised and the fly population to die out table 1 allowing the snail population to then recover it nonetheless maximised the proportion of snails that could be parasitised simulations were a best case scenario in terms of any potentially limiting resources available because the modelled fly population was not limited by the availability of food or refuges although it may theoretically be possible that the fly parasitises alternate hosts in winter building up populations so that more flies are available to parasitise snails in spring this scenario is inconsistent with what is currently known about the life history of the fly and with the low parasitism rates observed in the field baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 because all simulations using parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 had no influence on simulated snail populations the value of alternate hosts in boosting snail control can be discounted host specificity testing done prior to its release unpublished results indicated that the fly was not likely to use other non pest native gastropods in south australia the fly is known to parasitise cochlicella prietocella barbara linnaeus another introduced pest snail species that co occurs with c acuta in australia ruynat 2012 muirhead and perry 2021 with the parasitism rate of c barbara slightly higher 3 39 than that of c acuta 2 85 at fly positive sites on the yorke peninsula muirhead and perry 2021 the use of c barbara as an alternate host may contribute to the low rates of parasitism observed in the field baker et al 2010 jourdan et al 2019 muirhead and perry 2021 however because the model does not allow for the use of alternate hosts to reduce the rate at which simulated c acuta snails are parasitised it simulates a best case scenario in terms of snail control the inability of flies to suppress snail populations in our simulations even with a parasitism rate of 0 25 day 1 that far exceeds the rate normally seen in the field indicates that flies are unlikely to reduce snail populations in south australia when deployed as a stand alone classical biological control program although the fly was released multiple times leyson et al 2003 and is established on the yorke peninsula it has not reduced snail populations substantially baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 muirhead and perry 2021 there are several possible explanations for this result firstly a molecular study using coi and 16s genes showed that snails in australia belong to the 3rd lineage found in morocco spain portugal western france and southwest england jourdan et al 2019 in contrast flies found in australia most closely match haplotypes found in southern france jourdan et al 2020 secondly the snails may be better adapted to the climates in southern australia than the flies areas where the fly populations originate match the climate of south australia and south western west australia less well than do areas where the snail populations originate jourdan et al 2019 this reinforces the notion that only by understanding the climatic effects on pest snail populations will we begin to understand management effects including biological control carrière et al 2003 zalucki et al 2017 li et al 2019 thirdly the fly strain imported to australia may not be very effective at biocontrol holling 1965 the low snail parasitism rate 4 in australia thomann et al 2020 muirhead and perry 2021 and france coupland and baker 1994 compared to the much higher rate 0 13 0 25 in southern iberia thomann et al 2020 could be partly due to a genetic bottleneck experienced when the fly was introduced to australia as few individuals were brought to australia and many of these died prior to release g baker pers comm fourthly large scale monoculture farming is usually the norm in australia with limited availability of food sources and fly refuges parasitoids feed on nectar honeydew and pollen which are essential for survival e g see review by benelli et al 2017 the lack of adjacent flowering vegetation in broad scale australian agriculture likely limits fly populations and decreases their ability to regulate snail populations the highest rates of parasitism of both c acuta and c barbara on the yorke peninsula occur at sites adjacent to spring and summer flowering native vegetation muirhead and perry 2021 lastly flies primarily parasitise snails on elevated exposed surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 it was previously reported that no snails recovered from under rocks were parasitised coupland and baker 1994 however a large percentage of aestivating snails are cryptic and hence less available for parasitism only 30 of snails larger than 5 mm were found on elevated substrates whilst 53 were in ground and plant refuges and 17 at ground level muirhead and perry 2021 although it is unknown if there were more smaller snails in the refuges than on the elevated surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 it makes biological sense that smaller snails are better able to find protected nooks and crannies in which to aestivate this is supported by the finding that a larger percentage 76 of the smaller 8 10 mm for a mature snail c barbara population was found in cryptic habitats than the larger up to 18 mm for a mature snail c acuta 53 muirhead and perry 2021 all of the cryptic habitats identified by muirhead and perry 2021 were along roadside verges bordering paddocks various factors remain unknown 1 what happens within the large scale fields where snails are reported to be a major problem 2 whether any refuges are spatially patchy 3 whether snails can burrow underground as no one has reported any attempts to find buried snails of any height and 4 whether cryptic snails remain in aestivation for the duration of summer or are more likely to respond quickly to heavy dews or light rains to forage and grow before finding another refuge to shelter in a more facultative plastic aestivation process in cryptic snails would allow population growth to continue in short duration favourable spells perhaps leading to earlier reproduction the following autumn if all snails have cryptic behaviour then a large proportion of snails may be unavailable for parasitism thereby further reducing any impact of sarcophagid flies however if the cryptic population is biased towards small snails then other forms of management are needed to target these small snails although cryptic behaviour during aestivation does not explain the low parasitism rates of snails on elevated surfaces it may explain the ability of c acuta to maintain high population levels it was noted over three decades ago that there was little information available on the life histories and ecologies of pest snails in australia that factors controlling their distributions and population dynamics were poorly understood and that such information was basic to any future attempts to control them baker 1986 subsequent research has provided information used to model the snail lifecycle and growth rates in the laboratory mohamed and ali 2011 fecundity and reproduction in the laboratory baker and hawke 1991 mohamed and ali 2011 mortality in the laboratory baker and hawke 1991 baker et al 2010 thomann and vitou 2010 ruynat 2012 and the minimum height able to be parasitised by flies ruynat 2012 for flies there was some laboratory information on development and larviposition rate coupland and baker 1994 and on mortality baker et al 2010 nonetheless rather than having an abundance of data with which to parameterise the model we had to guess at biologically plausible mechanisms supplementary material 1 to capture anecdotal observations building this model highlighted extensive gaps in the understanding of the basic biology of both the snail and fly supplementary material 8 this lack of knowledge results in obvious issues with the model simulations show very different population dynamics for warooka and mt hope with much smaller snail populations simulated at mt hope however grain producers at mt hope complain of high snail numbers affecting their crops j doudle and p parsons pers comm although producers perspectives on this issue may be subjective and although snail numbers are high i e finding more than 200 conical snails in 0 5 litre of grain when for export purposes only one snail was allowed j doudle pers comm no data are available to allow an objective comparison of snail populations at warooka and mt hope because the model was initialised identically at both locations the same environmental factors drive population dynamics and crop management factors are likely similar the simulations suggest that climatic differences at these locations are crucial to snail population dynamics fig 3a and b vs fig 3c and d whilst the model may be too sensitive to the climatic drivers the paucity of data with which to parameterise it makes it impossible to address this issue decisively if snail numbers are indeed similar on both the eyre and yorke peninsulas then the simulations highlight our lack of understanding of snail population dynamics and the key environmental factors driving them targeted assessments of snail populations at both locations are necessary to assess the model s accuracy model however the entire snail population must be sampled including snails smaller than 5 mm that are ignored in current sampling protocols simulations did not show the same peaks in snail population numbers on the yorke peninsula as was observed baker 2008 there was little to distinguish one year from another in the simulation for warooka fig 3a and b because simulated snail populations regularly reached carrying capacity and so were regulated by density dependant mortality of small active snails simulations did not support anecdotal observations of more snails in the wet years of 2010 and 2011 following the millennial drought k perry pers comm simulated numbers of snails were not lower during the drought years prior to 2010 fig 3a and b the rainfall data for warooka do not indicate a drought in the 2000 s or significant additional moisture due to the la nina events in 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 bom 2012 as rainfall in 2009 2012 was not exceptionally high supplementary material 9 without any data on snail populations over this timeframe it is impossible to verify or validate the anecdotal observations the model did produce a peak in population numbers especially of small snails at mt hope in 2010 fig 3c d in agreement with observations j doudle pers comm rainfall data for mt hope shows that 2006 2008 were the driest years since 2002 supplementary material 9 higher rainfall in 2009 may have increased recruitment that year resulting in the large number of small snails observed in 2010 however although 2010 had the highest rainfall since 1995 and rainfall in 2011 2014 was similar to that in 2009 the simulated snail population remained low fig 3c and d nonetheless these simulations are consistent with the observation that whilst snails are still common they are not as numerous as in 2010 j doudle pers comm the overall conclusion is that the model did not agree with the results of leyson et al 2003 table 2 there were two main problems with the results presented in leyson et al 2003 the first was an incorrect sampling date and the second was a methodological issue likely due to small sampling size only 200 snails parasitised snails were not collected in one or both of the first two assessments in some releases but were collected in the final assessments leyson et al 2003 if parasitised snails were present at the end then flies were necessarily present until then and there should have been parasitised snails in the earlier assessments but not enough snails were sampled to detect the presence of the fly notwithstanding these issues there are other problems whilst we assumed that only aestivating snails were sampled there is nothing to state that this was the case even though snails were collected at various heights on grass stalks i e by implication not mobile or active leyson et al 2003 the simulations indicated that no snails were in aestivation on half six of the assessment dates table 2 the parasitised snails in aestivation on these occasions were in effect zombie snails that could not come out of aestivation all other snails were not in aestivation it was sufficiently cool and wet but fly development in these snails was still incomplete and so these few parasitised snails made up the entire proportion of aestivating snails that were parasitised skewing the analysis on the proportion of aestivating snails that were parasitised to compound this problem leyson et al 2003 sampled parasitised snails in two of these assessments warooka 1a 2nd assessment warooka sth 3 3rd assessment but not in the remaining four warooka 1b second assessment warooka sth 3 2nd assessment warooka sw 5 1st and 2nd assessments table 2 thirdly when the model indicated that all snails were in aestivation but only a small proportion were parasitised leyson et al 2003 sampled parasitised snails in two assessments warooka 1b 1st and 3rd assessments but not in two others warooka 1a 3rd assessment warooka sth 3 1st assessment table 2 as discussed above this suggests that the model is imperfect and does not truly capture the nature of interactions between flies and snails and raising once again the question of whether or not active snails can be parasitised nor their respective interactions with the environment nonetheless simulations for warooka suggest that the fly does little to reduce snail populations consistent with the perception of the situation on the yorke peninsula leyson et al 2003 jourdan et al 2019 thomann et al 2020 muirhead and perry 2021 because small snails cannot be parasitised in the model coupland and baker 1994 ruynat 2012 populations recover simply because of the vast number of small snails able to grow and reproduce in the new season figs 4a b and 5a b decimating the population of large aestivating snails by parasitism reduces the density dependent mortality of small snails allowing more of them to survive and contribute to future population growth laboratory experiments indicate that 5 mm is the minimum height that can be parasitised coupland and baker 1994 ruynat 2012 however c barbara are parasitised at a higher rate 3 39 than c acuta 2 85 on elevated surfaces muirhead and perry 2021 although mature c barbara are smaller 8 10 mm long than mature c acuta up to 18 mm long leonard et al 2003 because c acuta is thinner 4 7 mm wide and c barbara is stouter or broader 5 8 mm wide white mclean 2011a 2011b this may differentially affect their suitability as hosts the size of a snail is paramount to the developing fly larva as the snail is the only resource available for its development snails that are too small may not provide enough resources to the larva or the aperture may be too small for the adult fly to emerge while there is an evolutionary imperative for the female fly to choose adequate snails on which to larviposit it is unclear whether flies actively avoid smaller hosts or larviposition on smaller snails is not successful the recovery of snail populations in simulations at warooka figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 3 makes it clear that a better understanding of the ecology of small snails is necessary if they can be parasitised then reducing their numbers might slow population growth if they cannot be parasitised they represent a robust reservoir of population recruits and other targeted methods of controlling small snails need to be researched to achieve satisfactory population control the vulnerable stages of a pest species cannot be targeted if its biology and ecology are not understood management practices that increase mortality of lifestages where there is strong density dependence are inefficient and likely futile kriticos et al 1999 this model highlights our lack of understanding of what comprises a snail population although direct counting of snails has long been known to underestimate the numbers of small and cryptic snails baker 1986 no other sampling technique has been developed to better estimate snail populations and their age structure recent observations indicate that a large percentage of the snail population is cryptic despite expressly searching for snails none were found in an initial survey although many were found in follow up surveys at the same location in south australia kate muirhead pers comm given that parasitism rates were much higher 5 5 on snails in elevated habitats than in ground 0 9 or plant refuges 2 5 and yet snails on elevated habitats comprised only 30 of the population whereas cryptic snails comprised 53 of the population muirhead and perry 2021 it is clear that critical knowledge on snail populations is lacking snails smaller than 5 mm in height were never considered in any fieldwork surveys or analyses e g baker et al 1991 muirhead and perry 2021 and because they were ignored it is unknown what percentage of the entire population is cryptic if some suppression is better than none then as long as density dependant regulation does not allow the snail populations to grow and make up deficits as they did in all simulations with parasitism rates below 0 25 day 1 it may help to ensure that fly populations are self sustaining at levels higher than their current ones the highest level of snail parasitism yet recorded in australia was at a site adjacent to spring and summer flowering native vegetation muirhead and perry 2021 however whilst a parasitism rate of 48 was recorded on a single sampling occasion at this location it only averaged 10 over the two year survey period muirhead and perry 2021 indicating that factors other than food refuges contribute to parasitism this same study showed that over 20 years the maximum distance between a sampled fly population and a release site was 34 km and the second largest distance was 21 km muirhead and perry 2021 this observed limited dispersal behaviour of flies supports the simulations indicating that only targeted releases of large numbers of flies over multiple years figs 4 and 5 supplementary material 5 will help reduce snail populations on the yorke peninsula simulations suggest that timing of fly releases is critical to its successful establishment and impact on snail populations supplementary material 5 and 6 however there are no indications that timing of fly releases on the yorke peninsula leyson et al 2003 or on the eyre peninsula k muirhead and k perry unpublished data aimed to maximise its establishment mass rearing of parasitoids is a notoriously complex process influenced by many factors dindo and grenier 2023 and optimally timed releases may be difficult to plan nonetheless simulations showed that when female flies were released in october many snails had not yet aestivated thereby preventing these flies from larvipositing december releases had little impact on snail populations at warooka supplementary material 5 although snail numbers were decreased at mt hope and remained lower supplementary material 6 releases in march allowed larviposition and successful overwintering of immature fly stages however many of these eclosed as adults in the spring before snails aestivated and died before they could larviposit successful reproduction rarely occurred before the end of october at either location with snail populations largely unaffected supplementary material 5 and 6 it will be interesting to see if flies released on the eyre peninsula become established and how well they succeed it may also help to release flies there in spring november as the model suggested that they have a better chance of establishing in larger numbers and having a greater impact on the snail population supplementary material 6 because the fly parasitises the snail in europe it was assumed that it could help suppress snail populations in australia which is why it was introduced leyson et al 2003 however it is not evident that this fly controls snail populations in europe the highest parasitism rate reported there is 13 25 in southern iberia thomann et al 2020 but no studies have examined whether or not this parasitism rate significantly supresses snail populations simulations suggested an asynchrony between the snail and fly populations in australia whilst many large snails were parasitised during aestivation in the simulations snails had exited aestivation by the end of may this meant that the large numbers of simulated flies present at that time were unable to larviposit and died without being able to reproduce the fact that a species can parasitise a known gastropod host does not make it an effective biological control agent egleton et al 2021 despite its limitations the model suggests that even when all available large snails are parasitised table 1 a large population of small snails remains to ensure that the population continues to grow and that even with parasitism rates greater than 0 25 day 1 it will be difficult to reduce snail populations without repeated fly introductions with no data on the fly phenology on the yorke peninsula we cannot assess whether or not its effectiveness as a biological control agent could be improved sufficiently with targeted augmentative releases or whether the climate there is simply not suitable for it to persist in large numbers jourdan et al 2019 simulations suggest that the fly cannot be an effective biological control agent of the snail in south australia despite known defects the model provides important lessons about pest management model development supplementary material 1 highlighted the lack of data with which to parameterise the lifecycle modules despite over three decades of research and attempts to manage the snail in australia as with bactrocera tryoni yonow et al 2004 this highlights the value of modelling for identifying critical gaps in our understanding of a pest species biology and ecology when the b tryoni model was being constructed there had been more than 50 years of research on this pest scientists and stakeholders alike thought that the data necessary for constructing a model was abundant yet it was only in collating the information in a modelling framework that important knowledge gaps became apparent we cannot emphasise strongly enough that until critical knowledge gaps supplementary material 8 are addressed efforts to manage pest snail populations will likely remain haphazard and ineffective we show that even a model built from scant data can provide important insights into a biological system by examining the sensitivity of the model to different initial snail numbers and height classes fly parasitism rates consecutive annual fly releases and the timing of fly releases we could identify and understand the biological mechanisms producing these results and posit why management of snail populations has not been effective models such as this one can be constructed relatively quickly and each simulation takes less than a minute this clearly makes modelling a far less expensive strategy than conducting time and labour intensive field or laboratory work whilst modelling does not replace field or laboratory studies its ability to inform management and identify the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed by such studies is invaluable we emphasise that a modelling framework should always be considered an essential component of pest management research programs at the outset even the simplest model can help researchers think about problems in a more systematic way if effects of climate on population dynamics can be understood and incorporated into models population changes due to management practices can be identified and interpreted stuart et al 2002 carrière et al 2003 zalucki et al 2017 li et al 2019 only by synthesising information into a modelling framework can information gaps critical to understanding and managing the system effectively be identified had such a framework been used decades ago to collate available data on the snail researchers would have been able to identify many of these knowledge gaps and possibly begun to address them via targeted research projects other gaps would then surely have appeared however understanding of the biology and ecology of the snail would have significantly improved along with the management capacity 5 conclusions a population dynamics model of the land snail c acuta and one of its parasitoids s villeneuveana was built using dymex the model suggests that suppression of snail populations only becomes possible if the parasitism rate is increased well beyond what has ever been recorded and with repeated annual releases of the fly during spring although the current model appears to describe the phenology of both the snail and the fly adequately constructing the model allowed us to identify many knowledge gaps efforts to control the snail must be made with an understanding of its biology and the factors driving its population dynamics otherwise any control measures will likely have mixed results as there will be no real understanding of how or why they may or may not work we highlight the importance of modelling to synthesise available data into a framework that
