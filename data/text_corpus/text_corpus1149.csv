5745,the envisat jason 2 and 3 sentinel 3a cryosat 2 and altika satellite altimeters were used to estimate the discharge of two arctic rivers the ob and pur in western siberia the accuracy of the water height estimates from envisat varied with river size from 0 63 m for the ob 2 km in width to 1 1 m for the pur 0 5 km in width a new method for water level estimation combining the cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a altimeters provided better height accuracy 0 49 m for the ob the rating curve method of discharge estimation outperforms the manning formulation on the ob with a root mean square error rmse of 13 vs 20 for daily discharge and 1 vs 5 for annual discharge sensitivity analysis performed on the manning formulation showed high sensitivity to the river depth parameterisation a functional relationship was identified between the depth of rivers in the north of western siberia and their widths and deposits types the combination for the ob of the rating curve method with the multi satellite water level retrieval algorithm provided higher discharge accuracy than previous studies relying on satellite measurements on numerical modelling or on their combination a synthesis of worldwide river altimetry studies supported our finding that the accuracy of altimetric discharge estimations decreases for narrower rivers the rating curve method applied to jason 2 3 height measurements allows estimation of daily discharges with rmse of 18 for the wide ob river but 38 for the narrow pur river keywords altimetry river discharge rating curves manning approach arctic rivers 1 introduction rivers are an important element of the earth s climate system they ensure connection between atmosphere and ocean in many regions of the world rivers are the only water resource supporting local socio economic development quantification and monitoring of river flow is important not only for sustainable management of this valuable resource but also for prediction of future conditions observations of river discharge q have significantly reduced over the last 30 years although many national services continue observations of key rivers at key stations the availability of these observations for the scientific community and for climate research is limited in 2010 the database of the global river data centre contained information gathered from 3562 gauging stations against 9544 known stations prior to 2010 by 2015 the number had reduced by 1000 stations among the rest only 8 are located on big rivers annual flow 10 km3 which are generally the key water resource rivers and the most informative indicators of regional long term hydroclimatic changes alternative methods of estimation and monitoring of river flow modelling and satellite observations have been rapidly developed to fill this gap hydrological modelling is a powerful tool giving insights at regional or basin scales while satellites can provide worldwide observations the main satellite instruments used for river discharge retrieval are optical and radar imaging sensors providing measurements of river width smith and pavelsky 2008 and water velocity tarpanelli et al 2015 beltaos and kääb 2014 and altimetric radar measuring water height zakharova et al 2006 papa et al 2012 tourian et al 2013 through statistical relations or hydraulic equations these observations may be converted to the river discharge decreasing numbers of in situ observations needed for calibration and validation of hydrological models has promoted the development of satellite model coupling methods biancamaria et al 2009 domeneghetti 2016 emery et al 2018 getirana and peters lidard 2013 altimetry provides reliable regular and weather independent measurements of water height h at a river cross section called a virtual station vs over the last decade the number of on going altimetric satellite missions has increased cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a and b jason 2 and 3 allowing for observation of different reaches along a river significant progress has been made during the last 25 years in altimetric instrumentation and in processing of altimetric measurements this progress has resulted in important improvements in the accuracy of water height retrievals over inland waters and in diverse new applications of altimetry in continental hydrology the size of rivers having altimetry built water level time series has decreased from 2 to 3 km birkett 1998 to 300 400 m schwatke et al 2015 and even to 80 m michailovsky et al 2012 the errors of level estimates has also reduced for large rivers to 0 30 m schwatke et al 2015 and for medium size rivers to 0 3 0 7 m using envisat michailovsky et al 2012 or to 0 20 m using jason 2 and jason 3 biancamaria et al 2018 the few studies that have applied altimetry to rivers covered by seasonal ice did not provide any estimation of the accuracy of water heights indeed many studies excluded the winter period because of the negative impact of ice on h estimation nevertheless several studies dedicated to the rivers of the arctic ocean watershed have demonstrated good potential for altimeters in high latitude hydrology kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 sichangi et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 low accuracy of the water level retrievals as a result of winter ice is the main drawback of altimetry based methods of discharge estimation tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 low spatio temporal altimeter resolution also constrains the application of this method in the arctic the polar orbiting altimeters ers envisat saral altika cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 have a poor temporal resolution 27 369 days and the topex jason series altimeters with a 10 day repeat cycle provide measurements only as far north as 66 7 n while the mouths of many arctic rivers are located at higher latitudes a better understanding of the performance of the different altimetric missions and different water height retrieval approaches over rivers with seasonal ice could help to extend the application of altimeters in arctic continental hydrology the application of the satellite altimetry for estimation of the river discharge started with the large world rivers the ob kouraev et al 2004 the amazon zakharova et al 2006 and the ganges brahmaputra system papa et al 2012 as the accuracy of water level retrieval has improved more rivers of smaller size and of challenging fluvial geomorphology have been studied as a rule smaller rivers have greater variability in their water regime shorter duration of flood events and more complex and irregular fluvial geomorphology these factors are important not only for the accuracy of the altimetry retrieved water heights but also for the accuracy of the derived and applied discharge conversions the main methods of discharge estimation based on altimetry rely on establishment of statistical relations rating curves rc between in situ observations at the nearest gauging station and remotely sensed water heights kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 tarpanelli et al 2013 or on hydraulic equations and their parameters width slope height estimated from satellite images lefavour and alsdorf 2005 gleason et al 2014 a particular interest of use of hydraulic equations is their application to ungauged rivers several hydraulics based approaches have been developed recently durand et al 2016 and the performance of these approaches has been evaluated on a number of rivers throughout the world such research seeks to understand the limits of their applicability and to investigate potential improvements bonnema et al 2016 michailovsky et al 2012 sichangi et al 2016 this study evaluated the capacity of the various altimetric satellite missions and associated methods to estimate the discharge of large and medium size rivers in the complex arctic environment in section 2 we describe the study rivers the ob and pur section 3 introduces the satellites auxiliary data and methodology section 4 presents the results of the water level water slope and discharge estimation using envisat jason 2 3 and combination of cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a cs2 s3 water discharge is estimated by two methods for the manning method we began with an ungauged experimental setup where equation parameters were taken from auxiliary sources topographical maps and manuals next the roughness coefficients were optimised allowing comparison with the fully calibrated rating curve approach finally in section 5 we explore the effect of river size on the accuracy of discharge estimates we also discuss the performance of the various altimetric satellites in the context of arctic rivers after demonstration of the sensitivity of estimation accuracy to the parametrisation used and to the altimetric water slope retrievals we reflect on the shortcomings of and potential improvements to the hydraulics based method 2 region of study two rivers of different size located in similar natural conditions on the western siberia plain were selected for this study the wide ob river and the narrow pur river the annual flow of the pur is 14 times less than that of the ob both rivers belong to the arctic ocean watershed they drain boggy areas and have large floodplains natural regulation significantly extends the duration of the spring flood which can last up to 2 months much of the year the watersheds are covered by seasonal snow and the river channels are icebound 2 1 the ob river the ob is the third largest river by discharge flowing to the arctic ocean the catchment s area is 2 926 000 km2 and the annual flow is 406 km3 the main source of water is snow snow cover installs in september in the north or october in the south the melt starts in the middle of may in the south and progresses northward by 2 each 8 days zakharova et al 2014 the western siberian plain is very boggy wet areas occupy up to 70 80 of the area in the central parts the bogs intercept melting water and rain resulting in significant attenuation of the flood peak and an increase in the flood duration at low reaches the flood begins at the end of may and lasts until the end of july the seasonal magnitude of daily discharges q is 35 000 45 000 m3 s with a winter minimum of 2500 4000 m3 s and a spring flood maximum of 38 000 47 000 m3 s from october to may the river is covered by ice in august september several small rain floods of magnitude 2000 4000 m3 s can occur in its lower reaches the ob has numerous branches many of them are of the same width as the principal channel and can be separated by 10 15 km the width of the flood plain can reach 50 km a terminal station providing discharge measurements is located at salekhard city 66 6 n 66 5 e here the water flow from numerous branches is concentrated in the principal channel and the single small secondary channel withdraws a negligible amount of water fig 1 a this reach of 175 km length was selected for water height and water slope retrieval from altimetric satellites a river cross section located 47 km from salekhard line a on fig 3a where information on river depth was available for both the main and the smaller channel was chosen for discharge evaluation using the manning approach the width of the main channel at this cross section is about 2000 m the width of the secondary channel located 22 km to the east is 400 m the floodplain has a width of 25 km here between the main and secondary channels there are several third order branches with widths of 50 100 m as their connectivity is not clear we considered that their contribution to the total discharge is low and can be neglected the channels are surrounded by low density riparian forest while the majority of the floodplain is occupied by bogs or lakes of fluvial or periglacial origin 2 2 the pur river originating on the northern slopes of the sibirskiye uvaly hills located in western siberia the pur flows northward and joins the ob estuary near its centre the territory is part of a discontinued permafrost zone the watershed is covered by frozen bogs wetlands bogs and thermokarst lakes occupy about 55 of the area zakharova et al 2014 the watershed area above the terminal station at samburg is 95 000 km2 and the annual flow there is 28 km3 zakharova et al 2011 as limited data from samburg station was available we used an additional gauging station urengoy located 140 km upstream the drainage area at urengoy is 80 400 km2 and water flow is 24 km3 similar to the ob daily discharges have high seasonal variation the spring flood peak can be 20 times higher than the winter discharge peak discharge varies between dry and wet years ranging from 6390 to 9430 m3 s in autumn rain events can produce floods of lower magnitude the winter low flow period starts at the beginning of october and lasts about 200 days at the end of winter river ice thickness can reach 120 cm 3 data and methods 3 1 data for estimation of the discharge we used the data coming from several sources 1 high resolution landsat 8 images which were used for processing of the water masks and allowed an assessment of the channel width variation 2 water level and water slope time series retrieved from envisat jason 2 and jason 3 satellites as well as from combination of cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a 3 topographic map and 4 in situ water height and discharge at salekhard and urengoy stations 3 1 1 landsat 8 images high resolution landsat 8 multispectral optical images drawn from the us geological service data portal were used for geographical selection of altimetric measurement and for evaluation of the ob river width changes during the flood precise selection of altimetric measurement locations is important for retrieval of high quality water level time series kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 dubey et al 2015 a water mask was defined from level 1 landsat 8 images using the modified differential water index mndwi in previous studies the algorithm has accurately delineated water bodies of different sizes and types at similar latitudes in central siberia and been used in the production of water level time series for both a big arctic river zakharova et al 2019 and small 1 km2 arctic ponds zakharova et al 2018 1 mndwi green swir 1 green swir 1 where green green band 0 53 0 58 µm swir1 short wave infrared band 1 57 1 65 µm the pixels with mndwi 0 were classified as water the water masks derived from august landsat 8 scenes corresponded to the low level period when islands and sand banks are generally easily identified these masks were then used solely for selection of the altimetric measurements used in building water level and slope time series eight further unprocessed landsat 8 images covering different phases of the water regime were also used for manual measurement of the channel width of the ob at different seasonal stages and for determination of the coefficients in equations relating width and altimetric height halti 3 1 2 altimetry five altimetric satellite missions were used for ob river water level estimation envisat jason 2 and its successor jason 3 altika cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a all satellites except for jason 2 and 3 are polar orbiting and cover the lower reaches of all arctic rivers the water level for the pur river was estimated only from envisat and jason 2 3 satellites the envisat satellite with onboard ra 2 altimeter operated from 2002 to 2012 ra 2 measurements up to 2010 before the satellite was moved to the new orbit were used for water level processing the repeat period cycle for envisat is 35 days an 18 hz sampling rate gives an along track resolution of 370 m the jason 2 altimetric satellite operated with a 10 day repeat orbit during 2008 2016 its ku band poseidon instrument provided measurements with a 20 hz sampling rate the orbit inclination was 66 033 n meaning that the northernmost mission track crossed the ob river at 66 13 n 35 km south of the salekhard gauging station the urengoy gauging station on the pur river is located between two jason 2 tracks at 65 97 n in february 2016 jason 3 was launched onto the same orbit in order to ensure continuity of measurements the missions flew in tandem with an 80 s difference for 8 months the jason 3 calibration period was not considered during the discharge analysis nevertheless we used it to assess the continuity of height measurements generated by the instrument in the succeeding period the saral altika altimeter was launched onto the prior envisat orbit in 2013 the saral instrument operates at a frequency of 37 ghz ka band a high sampling rate of 40 hz provides measurements at 180 m along track spatial resolution the enhanced bandwidth allows for better vertical resolution 30 cm instead of 47 cm for envisat and finer waveform sampling since june 2016 altika has been operating in a drifting orbit cryosat 2 launched by esa in 2010 is the first mission to operate in synthetic aperture radar sar and sar interferometric sarin modes compared to the conventional low resolution mode lrm the delay doppler technique makes possible a finer along track resolution of approximately 300 m raney 1998 here we applied the esa level 1b product from baseline c this product contains waveforms with 256 and 1024 bins for sar and sarin respectively as well as the range and geophysical corrections needed to construct a surface elevation model sentinel 3a launched in 2016 operates globally in sar mode the dual frequency sar radar altimeter sral is able to operate in open or closed loops in the open loop the range window is positioned by an on board digital elevation model dem whereas in closed loop the range window is automatically positioned based on the previous measurements after march 2019 the open loop has been applied between 60 s and 60 n to improve the on board dem the user community is encouraged to provide surface elevations at virtual stations through the web page https www altimetry hydro eu here we applied the level 2 product enhanced measurements this product contains waveforms with 128 bins ranges and all necessary geophysical corrections 3 1 3 topographic map topographic mapping of the russian part of the arctic regions at 1 200000 scale was sufficiently precise for our analysis the maps of this series are the basis of the esa due permafrost dem product strozzi and santoro 2011 they also map the relief of the flood plains with a vertical resolution of 1 m and contain information about the type of river deposits and about mean river width and depth during the low level period this mapping was used 1 in our ungauged like experimental setup providing information on initial river depth d0 and 2 for evaluation of the critical water level at which water begins to inundate the floodplain 3 1 4 in situ data the gauging stations salekhard and urengoy operated by russian hydrological service provided both water level and discharge data water level is measured daily and discharge several times per year during the main phases of the hydrological regime in hydrological analysis these instrumental discharge measurements are used for adjustment of the rating curves for each given year daily discharges are calculated by the russian hydrological service from these re adjusted curves for the ob river daily discharge data were available only for two years 2002 and 2003 while the water level measurements covered the whole 2002 2016 period for the pur river discharge at urengoy station was available for 2008 2015 and water level measurements covered the ice free seasons from 2002 to 2016 3 2 methods two approaches to water level estimation were applied in this study the first used the classical virtual station concept where all measurements at a river satellite crossing and within a given satellite cycle are averaged to produce the water height data for a given day the landsat 8 water mask was used to identify points within the river channel as the mask was developed in low level conditions many sand banks and islands were exposed these were excluded from the river mask ensuring less contamination of the altimetric signal by land in the second approach the river level time series were derived from multi mission altimetry observations gathered over a segment of the river 3 2 1 water level retrieval from envisat and jason 2 3 satellites water levels were estimated from the range parameter which are part of the geophysical data records gdr of the envisat ra 2 and jason 2 3 satellites gdrs include the range measurements retrieved from the returned altimetric signal using a number of algorithms retrackers good performance in level estimation for inland waters has been reported for the ice1 retracker provided in both envisat and jason gdrs calmant et al 2013 environmental and geophysical correction of the altimeter range measurements relevant to our study region included ionospheric doris dry ecmwf model and wet cls tropospheric corrections solid earth tide correction and correction for the satellite s centre of gravity and geoid these corrections were applied to the range estimates to calculate water levels the ob river water level time series were retrieved for two envisat virtual stations named for their corresponding satellite track located 3 km south and 16 north of the salekhard gauging station time series were also derived for two more northerly jason 2 3 virtual stations situated 62 and 64 km south of salekhard for the pur river water levels were retrieved for three envisat track locations 326 365 and 784 near to the urengoy gauging station and for seven jason tracks 238 59 162 135 86 211 and 10 based on the satellite revisiting times the envisat water level measurements had a 35 days period while the jason data had a 10 day period 3 2 2 water level and water slope retrievals from multi mission approach water levels from cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a were derived in a similar manner as from jason and envisat except that the range parameter is based on a primary peak 80 threshold retracker the primary peak retracker selects the first peak in the waveform above a specified power threshold as the primary peak retracking is then performed on the corresponding sub waveform a retracking point on the leading edge is identified as the decimal bin corresponding to 80 of the ogog amplitude a detailed description of this retracker is given in jain et al 2015 cryosat 2 operates in sarin mode over the ob river allowing for range correction from off nadir reflections we applied the off nadir range correction described in armitage and davidson 2014 water levels from cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3 were derived from an approximately 175 km river segment within the region 65 6 68 5 e and 66 1 66 6 n the satellite measurements over the river were extracted using the landsat 8 water mask to create the water level time series for the ob river we applied a state space model processed using an auto regressive model of order one ar 1 in the time direction water level observations were taken to be cubic spline functions of distance eq 2 2 h i η t i τ x i α x i β sa t i ε i where η ti ρ ti 1 ξ 1 ρ 1 ξi is an error term of normal distribution n 0 ση 2 β sati are bias parameters related to the different satellite missions εi is the observation noise the splines based on points at equidistant locations respond to the underlying topography α xi and to the variations in the water level with distance τ xi observational noise is assumed to follow a mixture of the gaussian and heavy tailed cauchy distributions as described in nielsen et al 2015 we used 300 time steps in the ar 1 which is equivalent to a temporal resolution of approximately 7 8 days with 5 nodes in the spline functions the model allows for construction of a water level time series at any location along the considered river segment this makes it possible to calculate the river slope at any location and time fig 2 displays the modelled river levels along the river for four dates as an example for a given time the slope is derived from the corresponding spline line as the water level difference between selected two locations divided by the distance between these locations here we selected 20 km segment near salekhard station to derive the slope time series the standard deviation of the river slope is derived using the delta method 3 2 3 discharge and water flow estimation in this study we used two different methods of discharge estimation from altimetric measurements a rating curve method and the manning method the rating curve method was applied for both the ob and pur rivers as multi mission water level retrieval for the pur did not provide satisfactory results and consequently the water slope could not be estimated the manning based estimation of q was performed only for the ob manning based q estimation relies on physical lows which allow its application to ungauged river reaches satellite derived main variables are the inputs to investigate the potential of the manning method for ungauged arctic rivers initially we used parameterisation found in manuals and the topographical map then to compare its performance with that of the rating curve method the parameters were calibrated 3 2 3 1 rating curve model rating curves discharge estimation is a fundamental approach used to obtain daily discharges at gauging stations relations are established between simultaneously measured water heights and water discharges the latter are calculated from instrumentally measured water area and velocity in a given river section these measurements are then used for development of rating curves describing the h q relations daily discharges can then be calculated from the daily measurements of water level the rating curves have a power form and can be approximated by eq 3 3 q h a b where h is water height a and b are parameters of the equation during periods of low variability in the water level a polynomial function eq 4 can produce a better fit between q and h zakharova et al 2019 4 q c n h n c n 1 h n 1 c 0 where h is water level n and cn are parameters of the equation for the winter period we tested both eqs 3 and 4 and selected that which produced better accuracy as water flow is not a stationary process h q relations are rarely uniform especially in the case of boreal or arctic rivers with ice cover or when rivers have large flood plains covered by high vegetation both ice and high vegetation significantly change the roughness conditions resulting in changes of water velocity and in point deviations from the main h q stationary line in kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2019 we demonstrated using in situ measurements for salekhard station on the ob river and for kusur station on the lena river the existence and advantage of multiple h q relations in this study we applied a similar approach and established a set of three rating curves specifically for winter flood rise and flood recession hydrological phases for each virtual station or retrieved altimetric water level time series discharge estimation consisted of three steps 1 selection of the hydrological phase based on the altimetric water level and radar backscatter dynamics 2 establishment of rating curves between altimetric heights and in situ discharge using a calibration data set see section 3 2 4 and fitting of eq 3 or eq 4 if necessary 3 calculation of the altimetry derived discharge for the validation period from the developed halti q rating curves 3 2 3 2 manning method the river discharge is calculated as a product of cross section area and mean water velocity 5 q a v a flow contributing section area m2 v water velocity m s for rivers where the channel width is significantly larger than the depth the area can be approximated by assuming a rectangular cross section 6 a b h where 6a h d0 δ h b channel width m h mean depth m d0 initial depth at minimal water level m δh water height correction m the manning water velocity has following formulation 7 v 1 n r 2 3 s 1 2 where 8 r a p n manning s roughness coefficient r hydraulic radius s water surface slope m m p wetted perimeter m as the channel width b varies with the water level a relation b h was established using the river width manually measured using landsat images and the river height retrieved from altimetry at the moment of the image acquisition 9 bm a m h alti bm and bs a s h alti bs where bm is the main channel width and bs is the smaller channel width the fitting of the points provided the following coefficients for eq 9 am 2042 bm 0 24 as 554 and bs 0 29 one of the important parameters in the manning equation is the river mean water depth h which serves for calculation of the cross section area a the precise water depth can only be determined by in situ profiling water depth information is provided as part of gauging station metadata and it is also recorded on ancient topographic and modern navigation maps for our test aimed simulating an ungauged reach we used the information provided by the topographic map this depth d0 refers to the low flow stage and needs to be corrected for water level changes δh as the shape of the channel section selected for this study is complex we adopted a two block scheme for estimation of the effective area and hydraulic radius of the main branch fig 3 using landsat images altimetric heights and the topographic map providing the topography of the floodplain we estimated that water starts to flood the sandbank at halti 2 5 m and at halti 4 m it exits onto the floodplain the total width of the main branch bm including the main channel and the sandbank was derived using eq 9 the area a at each altimetric water stage was estimated as the sum of the area of main channel and sandbank if inundated using eq 6 considering correction for depth δh in each sub section the hydraulic radius was then estimated using this area and the wetted perimeter p black bold line on fig 3 a roughness coefficient reflects the resistance to flows in channels and over floodplains suggested values for manning s n tabulating the factors that affect roughness can be found in chow 1959 the detailed procedures for determining manning s n values for natural channels and flood plains is described in arcement and schneider 1989 the most important factors affecting channel n are the type and size of the bed bank materials sand gravel cobbles rock etc and the shape of the channel depth irregularities obstructions vegetation meandering etc in winter ice cover creates an additional boundary with associated hydraulic roughness the net result is reduction of the hydraulic radius of the channel and changes in effective channel resistance an existing formulation of composite effective roughness nc of an ice covered river is based on weighting of the individual bed nb and ice ni roughness coefficients using the respective wetted perimeters of the channel bed and the ice cover for this study a more accurate formulation taking into account the vertical distribution of water velocity under the ice and known as the belokon sabaneev equation was adopted as proposed by bruner 2016 10 n c 0 5 n b 3 2 n i 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 calibration of the parameters of the manning equation the manning equation is calibrated by selecting the combination of parameter values that leads to the lowest levels of a multicomponent series of errors when compared with observations these component errors are aggregated into a number of objective functions a solution to the combined objective functions is defined as efficient pareto optimal if by parameter variation no single objective function can be improved without losses elsewhere in the solution set each possible combination of parameters values potential calibration solution leads to a particular set of objective functions values this combination of parameters values and corresponding objective function outcomes can be pareto efficient pareto optimal pareto dominant or it can be within a pareto efficient boundary and thus be sub efficient the set of all pareto optimal objectives combinations is called the pareto frontier pareto front and corresponding calibration solutions form the efficient calibration solution set pareto optimal calibration solutions to find the pareto optimal calibration solutions we used the multi criteria identification sets method kamenev 2016 2018 this method is based on approximation and then visual examination of identification sets these may be represented as a multidimensional graph of the vector objective function its lower dimensional projections or in other forms projections parts sections or slices and may include sets of optimal sub optimal efficient and sub efficient parameter value combinations both bed and ice roughness coefficients were simultaneously calibrated using the multicriteria identification sets method of pareto domination with four objective functions two objective functions root mean square error rmse and bias evaluated differences between simulations and observations during the ice free period and two similar functions were used for winter when both ice and bed coefficients are relevant the possible ranges of nb and ni were limited to values known to occur in natural conditions in large rivers the nb range was 0 015 0 35 while for ni a larger band 0 01 0 04 was applied each combination of nb and ni values calibration solution leads to particular outcomes for the four objective functions 3 2 4 validation approach the altimetric datasets were divided into calibration and validation periods specifically for each mission table 1 using the rating curves established from simultaneous daily in situ h and q for 2002 2003 the daily discharge at salekhard station was estimated for the years 2004 2016 the estimation procedure was based on the set of the rating curves described in detail in kouraev et al 2004 and zakharova et al 2019 the reconstructed set of station data were then used for equation calibration and for validation of discharge estimates the accuracy of the altimetric discharge and flow estimations was evaluated using bias rmse and the nash sutcliff coefficient ns 11 rmse q alti q

in situ or reconstructed discharge at station 4 results 4 1 water level and water slope time series the water level data from different satellites for the ob and pur rivers are presented in fig 4 the envisat 51 track crosses the ob river within 3 km of the gauging station this proximity allows estimation of the error in halti retrievals 0 63 m rmse see table 2 during the low level period the width of the ob in the study reach varies between 1 7 and 2 5 km this width is large enough that the altimetric h average remains valid with low or moderate land contamination effects envisat water level time series for the pur river were produced for three virtual stations the virtual stations 326 and 365 are situated 65 km north of the gauging station while the virtual station 784 is within 2 km of the gauge as the fluvial geometry at envisat 784 virtual and at the gauging station are similar we can assess the accuracy of the water height estimation from envisat for a medium size arctic river with complex fluvial morphology the width of the pur river varies from 0 5 to 1 2 km numerous sand banks and islands reduce the effective width significantly at the end of summer and in winter despite water mask application signal pollution by the banks and islands results in their surface being detected as water surface as a result the altimetric time series had many anomalously high h measurements during flood recession and in the low level period we found that when ice free the rmse between in situ observations and envisat halti is higher for the pur than for the ob river 0 79 m as in situ measurements for winter are unavailable we were unable to evaluate the accuracy of the height estimates over river ice the continuity of measurements from jason 2 and jason 3 was verified during their 8 months of parallel operation on both wide and narrow rivers an average bias between the instruments for the pur river was 0 17 m and 0 01 m on tracks 59 and 162 respectively the highest differences reach 2 m and occurred before or during the ice melt and during the summer minimum at this time the radar footprints are at their most heterogeneous for the ob river the average bias between missions was 0 10 and 0 26 m for tracks 112 and 187 respectively the maximum difference was significantly less than for the narrow pur river and did not exceed 1 m among seven northernmost jason tracks only track 59 and track 162 with few anomalous halti measurements were selected for discharge estimation for the pur river at the crossover locations of these tracks with the river the channel is 500 600 m wide and free of islands a sand bank boarding right side of the channel is oriented such that only part of the return signals can be contaminated suggesting 200 m variation in the altimetric measurements around a mean nominal jason orbit as the tracks are located far from the gauging station we could not determine the water level estimation errors which can also be affected by changes in channel morphology water level time series retrieval from a combination of the cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a instruments allowed altimetric measurements at the gauging station and consequently evaluation of the accuracy of estimated heights without any ambiguities caused by differences in hydraulic or morphometric conditions in the two compared reaches the accuracy was high 0 49 m rmse and 0 18 m bias the difference bias between in situ and satellite observations is low during the flood and in winter 0 04 m and 0 07 m correspondingly the bias increases up to 0 26 m during summer rain floods the highest overestimation 0 79 m occurred in april on the ob river at that time of year water often exits over the ice through polynyas or pressure fractures wet ice or snow changes the return echoes as could be seen in backscatter dynamics and negatively affects the accuracy of the altimetric estimates the cs2 s3 combination similar to the envisat produced reliable estimates of water height during the winter over ice covered surfaces the jason ice 1 algorithm behaved well at the beginning of the ice period but overestimated the ice height during the second part of winter especially before melting the similar problem was noted for the lena river in our previous study zakharova et al 2019 the low reaches of the ob river are characterised by very low slopes leading to development of a wide up to 50 km floodplain with multiple branches the water slope retrieved from the altimetric measurements was 0 01 1 3 cm km fig 4c a similar value 2 7 cm km was found by beltaos and kääb 2014 for another big arctic river the mackenzie in september 2009 the water slope is strongly correlated r 0 95 with the altimetric water height not shown and its response to short term summer and main spring floods is clear the error 2 σ of the slope at a given time ranges between 0 14 cm km and 1 0 cm km this error estimate might be underestimated since the correlation among along track water level measurement is not accounted for an average relative error is 22 more than 80 of the s estimates have errors of less than 35 the highest relative uncertainties were observed during the winters of 2012 and 2016 when the absolute slope values were close to zero 4 2 discharge and water flow retrievals the classical rating curve method was applied to the jason altimeters for both rivers and to envisat and the cs2 altika s3 combination for the ob river only this method was not applied for the envisat time series for the pur river as the number of halti retrievals in the open water period was insufficient to establish reliable rating curves the manning method involving both altimetric water height and water slope was applied only to the ob river 4 2 1 rating curve model the q values reconstructed from in situ water height data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the altimetry simulated discharge for the ob river the accuracy of this reconstructed discharge estimated as rmse relative to the in situ q for 2002 2003 depends on the hydrological phase the lowest accuracy 13 or 1917 m3 s occurred in the flood rise period for other periods the accuracy is very high 6 rmse or 310 m3 s for winter low flow and 7 rmse or 1790 m3 s for summer recession the accuracy of the jason 2 and jason 3 water level estimates deteriorated significantly during the winter critically affecting the halti q relations during this period power fitting eq 3 did not produce reliable results and so we fitted the points by minimization of rmse and bias using a first order polynomial function eq 4 this function also produced more accurate winter rating curves for other satellites table 3 shows the accuracy of the rating curve fitting the number of envisat and cs2 s3 water height estimates during the ob flood rise was not sufficient to establish accurate rating curves as the cs2 s3 water level estimates were relocated to the salekhard station and the envisat tracks are within 16 km of the gauge we decided that the application of the station h q curve instead of the halti q curve would provide better results for this period previous studies have demonstrated the advantage of densification of altimetric observations for the accuracy of discharge retrieval tourian et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 our final qalti time series presented in table 4 for both rivers were obtained by simple combination of the simulated discharges from virtual stations of the same satellite missions this procedure did not take any additional mathematical treatment as the virtual stations observations are not simultaneous and lateral water input is negligible on the pur river during the ice free period the number of the retrieved envisat halti values only 1 3 per year was insufficient for reliable rating curves fitting and the envisat time series were excluded from discharge processing for this river when enough simultaneous in situ discharge and altimetric water heights observations are available and the morphology of the virtual and gauge reaches is similar the rating curve approach allows for estimation of q with very high accuracy fig 5 and table 4 the envisat results had the highest q errors while the multi satellite method had the lowest for daily discharges the error distribution among the missions is in general in agreement with the accuracy of the rating curves established for each virtual station see table 3 integration over time reduces the errors by 3 6 for monthly and by 12 16 for annual flow also in agreement with the rating curves errors the medium size pur river had lower discharge retrieval accuracy than the ob river the difference between simulated and in situ discharge was higher during the dry years 2011 2013 when the annual flow halved the largest differences were during flood recession and in winter for the ob river the frequency of water level measurement by different altimeters is not critical to monthly or annual flow estimation the long flood duration permits adequate sampling even by envisat with its 35 day cycle combining discharges from several virtual stations in the case of envisat altimeter for the ob river and jason altimeters for the pur river increases the temporal sampling frequency and moderately 1 2 improves the accuracy of the monthly and annual flows there was however no accuracy gain from combining q estimates from the jason 112 and 187 virtual stations on the ob 4 2 2 manning method to demonstrate the capacity of the manning method to estimate water discharge for ungauged areas we did not initially perform a calibration and instead used typical tabulated values of ice and bed roughness chow 1959 bykov and vasiliev 1965 bruner 2016 for large rivers with no vegetation and sandy deposits these sources propose an nb value of 0 025 as the freezing of arctic rivers is often characterised by transport and accumulation of frazil ice under the ice edge the lower ice boundary has a very rough surface beltaos and prowse 2009 we chose the highest value 0 03 proposed by bruner 2016 for ice of 30 90 cm thickness in the studied reach the ob river valley is composed of two river branches and a large floodplain the river discharge was estimated separately for each of these elements and then summed water discharge from the flood plain was estimated for conditions in which the water height exceeds a critical level by analysing the topographical map landsat images and halti values a critical altimetric level of 4 m was chosen see fig 3 the roughness coefficient of the flood plains nf is high compared to nb and typically varies between 0 1 and 0 2 we selected a value of 0 13 proposed by bykov and vasiliev 1965 for conditions of dense brushes low density riparian forest the simulated discharges before calibration of parameters were comparable with those obtained using the classical rating curve approach and gave the same high accuracy for annual water flow table 4 the discharge passes mainly through the primary river channel the contribution of the small channel is about 2 6 max and of the floodplain is about 1 5 4 max the manning qalti reproduced well the increased winter discharge of 2014 2016 although the method underestimated discharges in 2011 2013 and overestimated in 2015 and in 2016 fig 6 a flood discharge when the altimetric observations caught the peak in 2013 and in 2016 had low errors of 5 and 12 respectively when the altimetric observations truncate the flood peak and discharge is interpolated peak discharge estimation errors increase up to 35 45 in hydraulics models the roughness coefficient is usually calibrated against in situ discharge observations using the multicriteria identification sets method we found the ideal values of nb and ni to be 0 024 and 0 019 respectively interestingly the optimisation suggested a lower ice roughness coefficient than the bed value according to hec ras model manual bruner 2016 this calibrated value corresponds to rippled ice while our initial thought was that ob river ice ridges during formation and stays rough all winter and we initially set ni to 0 03 as our initial choice for nb 0 025 was close to the calibrated value the overall performance after optimisation did not change significantly the annualized values of the accuracy metrics for daily discharges were 3033 m3 s or 20 from mean annual discharge 172 m3 s and 0 98 for rmse bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively as the seasonal magnitude of the discharge is high qflood qwinter 10 it seems that high uncertainty in ni does not have a critical effect on annual accuracies after calibration the uncertainty in the peak discharge for years 2013 and 2016 with near peak halti measurements reduced to 1 and 8 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 assessment of the performance of altimetric satellites for estimation of discharge of arctic rivers the accuracy of discharge estimation from altimetric satellite observations depends on the accuracy of the satellite retrieved variables water height and water slope the accuracy of the algorithm parameterisation and the degree of simplification generalisation of the hydrological processes within the applied algorithms water level retrievals for seasonally ice covered rivers are rather rare kouraev et al 2004 frappart et al 2010 biancamaria et al 2009 tourian et al 2013 birkinshaw et al 2014 bjerklie et al 2018 zakharova et al 2019 sichangi et al 2016 the ice period is excluded from many studies because of high uncertainty in the water levels on sea ice it is thought that the signal of ku band altimeters penetrates the snow and is reflected from the ice surface in situ measurements of water level are made in ice pits where the water is close to the ice surface due to isostatic equilibrium and ice plasticity a difference 15 cm between in situ and altimetric observations can be expected a higher difference may be observed for the ka band altika altimeter as its signal is reflected primarily from the snow air interface remy et al 1999 guerreiro et al 2016 in practice the accuracy of height retrievals over river ice depends significantly on the instrument design conventional sar altimeter and on the retracker configuration the present study as well as data from the dahiti database for hydrological time series of inland waters database 1 1 https dahiti dgfi tum de en map demonstrated that the water level time series derived from envisat altika and sentinel 3a as well as from their combination better describes the winter recession of arctic rivers in winter the jason satellites often detect the higher surfaces of the flood plain or even terraces zakharova et al 2019 this anomalous detection can last several cycles be reproduced each year be observed over several years or occur only in the second part of the winter before flood the reason of this unstable behaviour is unknown fortunately for estimation of river discharge this anomaly can be handled in part by establishing special winter rating curves when the rating curve method is applied the use of other methods based either on various modifications of the manning equation or on coupling of numeric models with altimetric observations can result in high winter discharge errors in our case the jason 2 and 3 winter anomalies negatively affected the accuracy of the winter rating curves see table 3 our river masks were defined during a low level period when the channel width is minimal and sand islands and banks have maximal visibility we expected the h estimates to be better during high waters as there is less land at the mask border to affect the radar waveforms however analysis of the seasonal distribution of errors from cs2 s3 and envisat found that three validated time series had lower absolute errors in h during winter respectively 0 44 m and 0 10 0 12 m and higher errors during the flood respectively 0 53 m and 0 56 0 87 m the accuracy of the derived altimetric heights and the number of the valid observations used for rating curve definition determined the accuracy of the fitted curves the limited number of available flood measurements due to low sampling frequency did not permit a robust fitting of the flood halti q curves for cs2 s3 and envisat for the ob river we resolved this problem by applying the gauging station equations the cs2 s3 measurements were relocated to the salekhard reaches and the envisat virtual stations are within 3 km and 16 km of the gauge the few envisat observations available for ice free period constrained the application of this mission to the smaller pur river the overall errors in discharge estimation for the ob river demonstrated an improvement in altimetric satellite performance from the earlier envisat to the newer cryosat 2 sentinel 3 missions and in their combination 5 2 effect of river size on the accuracy of altimetrically derived discharges two studies in the amazon basin which coupled numerical models with altimetric measurements emery et al 2018 getirana and peters lidard 2013 reported that the accuracy of their discharge simulations reduced with the river size our results also demonstrated lower discharge accuracy from the jason satellites for the smaller pur river rmse of 38 compared to the ob river rmse of 18 the reduced accuracy is a product of the increasing errors in altimetric height and of the more complex relations between discharge and water level in narrower or geometrically more complex channels resulting in less accurate fits for the rating curves a literature synthesis not exhaustive of the daily q errors obtained using altimetry for rivers of different sizes is provided in table 5 from these cases one can conclude that using radar altimetry only or in combination with other satellites or models daily discharge accuracies of 5 10 for the largest rivers annual flow 1000 km3 10 25 for large rivers annual flow of 200 1000 km3 30 40 for medium size rivers annual flow of 25 100 km3 can be anticipated global earth systems models often combine monthly river discharges with climate projections to anticipate annual river flows our results for altimetric monthly and annual discharge demonstrated decreasing errors comparing to daily values if the altimetric observations coincide with the most important flood events annually the errors were halved for both large and small rivers see table 4 demonstrating the potential of radar altimetry data in climate studies 5 3 assessment of the methods of discharge estimation the two methods used for estimating the discharge of the ob river performed differently the classical rating curve method produced lower errors 13 for daily discharge comparing to the method based on the manning equation 23 the manning formulation requires knowledge of the river depth and of the roughness parameters which in many cases are difficult to determine to estimate the river depth different implicit methods have been tested leon et al 2006 tourian et al 2017 while the roughness evaluation remains largely an expert guess to avoid guessing at the roughness bjerklie et al 2003 suggested a simplified equation where only width depth and slope are used as predictors several studies compared the use of this equation with the rating curve approach tarpanelli et al 2013 michailovsky et al 2012 sichangi et al 2016 and found better performance from the latter furthermore sichangi et al 2016 and tarpanelli et al 2015 have shown that the rating curve method is outperformed only when combined with satellite estimations of the river width the greater accuracy of the rating curve method based on the statistical relationship between just two parameters can be expected when two key conditions are fulfilled the water height satellite retrievals are sufficiently accurate and the river morphology at the gauging and the virtual stations is not radically different the second condition ensures that the q h relation can be approximated by a unique rating curve or by a limited set of rating curves fitting the majority of cases especially when the flow can be considered as quasi stationary otherwise dispersion of the points can either prevent an accurate fitting result in erroneous rejection of satellite retrievals as outliers or introduce uncertainties due to oversight of a relationship branch for example the dumping effect of a tributary located downstream from a virtual station often produces the small loop in the curve the manning equation by definition produces less accurate discharge estimations than rating curves in cases when the above conditions are satisfied as more variables coming with their own errors and more assumptions about parameterisation or the structure of equations are involved error propagation leads to higher uncertainties in simulated discharge several assumptions were considered in our study we treated the shape of the ob river channel as rectangular a trapezoidal approximation changes the simulated discharge by up to 17 the use of the mean depth instead of integrating the bathymetry in the calculation of the section areas often produces an underestimation of the sectional area and consequently underestimation of the discharge another structural error can arise from the use of a fixed value for the roughness coefficient we tried to overcome this problem by introducing ice roughness during the winter and floodplain roughness during the flood this allows for seasonal variability of the effective manning coefficient uncertainty can also be related to simplification of the floodplain flow the maximal flood plain contribution to the discharge was evaluated as 4 this contribution may have been underestimated as a result of setting a high roughness or by overestimating the water height threshold for inundation the altimetry derived water slope for the 20 km ob river reach represents average conditions along this reach while the channel parameters width and depth used in the manning equation pertain to a specific cross section between the available cross sections and using the depth information provided on the topographical map we selected the reach that suits better the requirements for instrumental discharge estimation i e linear channel absence of the islands and vegetation regular form of the banks etc we assumed that local high resolution variability of the water slope along the ob reach was low and that our altimetric water slope was also representative of the cross section a comparison of the altimetric water slope retrieved over a 2 km and over 20 km reach centred at the same cross section showed only a small difference 1 between the two s retrievals not shown nevertheless one should be cautious of local slope variability when calculating discharge using the manning equation and satellite measurements over ungauged rivers the problem is less critical if simultaneous calibration of roughness and depth which can absorb any potential errors arising from a slope discrepancy is performed use of altimetric river heights in numerical hydrological models is a rapidly developing approach to discharge estimation table 5 demonstrates that this method shows good potential generally being only slightly lower in accuracy to rating curves getirana and peters lidard 2013 biancamaria et al 2009 preparations for the swot surface water and ocean topography satellite mission have included an extensive campaign for development of algorithms based on river hydraulic geometry or manning equation simplification an algorithm comparison study on 16 mainly medium size rivers durand et al 2016 demonstrated that for 30 of cases these algorithms provide errors of 40 and for 8 of cases the errors are 20 with the two lowest rmse values being 5 and 6 the best performer was a modified manning algorithm solved for several river reaches metropolis manning the authors argued that incorporation of various auxiliary data into the algorithms is highly beneficial and can result in significantly better discharge accuracy in section 4 2 2 we demonstrated the positive effect of the incorporation of auxiliary data qinsitu during calibration of the manning equation in the next section we discuss the impact of errors arising from uncertainties in variables as well as from parameterisation we suggest a way to obtain auxiliary data on river depth in western siberia 5 4 improving the accuracy of manning altimetry coupling discharge estimates 5 4 1 sensitivity of the manning approach to errors in parametrisation in eq 6 the mean river depth is important for estimation of section area and consequently through eqs 7 and 8 for estimation of the water velocity while combination of the altimetric and optical instruments permits evaluation of river width and water height the initial section mean depth d0 has to be obtained from other sources the most reliable information on d0 is provided by in situ measurements at gauging stations for reaches between stations evaluation of the river depth is not a trivial task the d0 used in this study taken from the topographic map is of unknown accuracy and based on measurements done 40 60 years ago our results indicate that even old cartography data is useful for discharge estimation nevertheless the errors that could originate from uncertain river reach depths are of particular interest in this study river width variations obtained from satellite image analysis were compared to water height changes the limited number of points used for definition of the b f halti function can introduce certain errors the impact of inaccurate river widths on discharge estimates can be evaluated using a sensitivity test the one at a time approach to sensitivity analysis is an easy and established technique daniel 1973 this approach has been successfully applied in conjunction with complex hydrological models van griensven et al 2006 and in our opinion is capable of demonstrating the impact of errors in the d0 and b approximations eq 9 on discharge retrievals an experiment was also performed to assess the sensitivity of the manning method to variations in roughness coefficients and water slopes the error range for altimetric slope retrieval was set to 30 reflecting an estimated mean error of 22 which is seen as sufficiently accurate this range when applied to other parameters under investigation accords with the expected natural variability of manning coefficients in large rivers and is sufficient to cover the potential uncertainties of 3 5 m that might be introduced by using the cartographic value of river depth as slope changes with time each s measurement was independently randomized within the given error range and average scores were calculated over 2000 runs results of the one at a time sensitivity test are presented in fig 7 a and b as already noted the suggested algorithm is not sensitive to the roughness coefficient of river ice nevertheless improvement of winter discharges estimations after optimisation of ni is possible the algorithm has low sensitivity to errors in river width lines corresponding to the coefficients am and bm have low slopes on fig 7a and b this means that the time spent estimating river widths from optical images could be minimised by establishing b h relations from a limited sample of images the slope variable shows higher sensitivity although slope errors within 30 do not significantly affect the daily discharges staying within acceptable values maximum 11 for bias and 30 for rmse the algorithm is more sensitive to the errors in the bed roughness parameter similar impacts on discharge estimation using manning equation from uncertainty in slope and bed roughness have been reported for the amazonian rivers sichangi et al 2016 the highest sensitivity found was for the initial river depth uncertainties of 30 in nb can lead to discharge errors of 40 60 for bias and 25 45 for rmse while the similar variation in initial river depth can increase q errors up to 70 80 and 60 80 respectively discharge errors are lower when nb or d0 are overestimated than when underestimated from eqs 5 and 6 as well as from the fig 7a it is clear that bed roughness and the river depth have opposite effects on discharge estimation an underestimation of river depth could be compensated by underestimated bed resistance or bed roughness to the flow in practice if in situ discharge is available for calibration optimisation of roughness and depth parameters at the same time produces a set of suitable pairs of nb and d0 in model optimisation routines this is known as equifinality between parameters pianosi et al 2016 by performing this test and using the multi criteria identification sets method we found a direct quasi linear relationship between these parameters in the ranges expected for this type of river i e nb 0 018 0 028 13 n b 0 0028 d0 0 008 biancamaria et al 2009 found that for the lower ob river the nb d0 pair of 0 015 10 m produces the best river discharge simulation accuracy when using a coupled isba lisflood fp model this point lies close to the line defined by eq 13 according to this equation at 10 m depth roughness equals 0 018 we hypothesise that if the calibration of lisflood had been done with more discrete iteration steps the optimal solution for nb d0 in the lisflood fp model would have exactly matched our nb d0 relation to roughly evaluate the overall sensitivity of the manning method we simultaneously introduced errors in the relevant parameters using an error grid of enlarged space and reduced density fig 7c this demonstrated that to keep simulated discharge errors within acceptable values the parameters and slope errors should be less than 35 40 if a calibration discharge set is not available other methods of approximation of the river depth have to be implemented tourian et al 2017 reviewed these methods many of which rely on a combination of remote sensing data and empirical geomorphological relations however many of them to a certain extent use information on river discharge or river depth from alternative sources e g in situ q from another river reach modelled discharge in situ quintile discharge birkinshaw et al 2014 durand et al 2008 tourian et al 2017 leon et al 2006 yoon et al 2012 several attempts have been made to retrieve river depths using optical satellite sensors legleiter and roberts 2009 in seeking possible solutions we explored the relationship between the initial river depth and the river width hypothesising that some typical condition might apply on the west siberian plain 5 4 2 estimation of river depth using a regional width depth relation leopold and maddock 1953 proposed a functional power relationship between river channel parameters and discharge since then numerous studies have sought a connection between parameters of these functions at different hydrographical scales from a single river reach to basin wide application miller et al 2014 many works have reported reliable regional generalizations for rivers that have achieved quasi equilibrium states phillips and harlin 1984 singh 2003 in preparation for the swot mission several river databases have been recently developed andreadis et al 2013 allen and pavelsky 2018 the importance of auxiliary information on hydraulic geomorphology which could be included in these databases was clearly demonstrated durand et al 2016 by retrieving river width and depth from topographic maps for several lower reaches of the ob river and adding data for other 8 rivers in north of western siberia 62 68 n 63 84 e we found distinct clustering of the points on a b d0 graph fig 8 several early studies have revealed effects on channel geometry adjustments and the b d0 relationship from various parameters relevant to channel resistance bed deposit diameter vegetation or to flow energy slope hey and thorne 1986 huang and warner 1995 lee and julien 2006 examination of channel deposits made clear that the upper branch of the fig 8 graph in the range of 90 500 m width is mainly channels with higher resistance cobble bolder deposit beds other points on this branch in the width range 500 1200 m correspond to western young secondary channel of the ob river called the small ob river and joining the study reach on the southern border which has a bed of sand deposits or to the upper reaches of small rivers of the region i e potentially higher flow energy systems further analysis showed that the low branch in fig 8 corresponds to the condition of wide braided sand bed reaches with important width variability b 800 m and negligible variation in depth for wider braided channels the depth variability is greater and the braided channel line tend to converge with the main shallow sand bedded meandering channel in a quasi equilibrium state equations corresponding to each channel type are given in table 6 from hydraulic geometry theory the river depth and river width could be related through an equation 14 d0 c a f b b f b where a and b are the coefficient and the power in relation b f q while c and f are the coefficient and the power in relation d0 f q the hydraulic geometry coefficients found in hey and thorne 1986 for gravel bed uk rivers produce following equation 15 d 0 0 12 b 0 78 in the 50 350 m width range the b d0 points of eq 15 lie close to our cobble bed line for the niger river neal et al 2012 found similar coefficients which best agreed with our findings at higher river widths the measurements of b d0 provided in bjerklie et al 2018 for another big arctic river the yukon lie close to our sand bed line and support the use of this type of relationship for estimation of initial depth according to our sensitivity testing the proposed relations for estimation of river discharge in the northern part of the western siberian plain can be justified for straight well developed sand bed river reaches wider than 800 m and for braided rivers wider than 1500 m under these conditions the d0 error of 70 cm see table 6 is less than 10 consequently the discharge errors due to depth uncertainties will not exceed 30 see fig 7 for constrained river channels for which the d0 can be estimated with rmse of 1 21 m acceptable q errors of 30 are expected for channels wider than 1000 m these relations were developed for average water stage conditions during the low level period corrections might be needed if optically derived river widths are used for d0 estimation 6 conclusion the accuracy of river discharge estimates from altimetric satellite observations depends on many factors among them are the accuracy of the water height estimates the parametrisation of the algorithms and the availability of the auxiliary information the accuracy of water height retrievals depends strongly on river fluvial morphology large river width low banks and the absence of the sand islands are the main favourable conditions for precise estimation of water level the presence at virtual stations of sandy banks during the low level period is less critical than islands the accuracy rmse of the h estimates from the envisat mission for the wide ob river was 0 63 m but 1 1 m for the narrower pur river recently developed approaches for water level estimation from a combination of cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a altimeters provided better h accuracy 0 49 m rmse two different methods of the water discharge estimation using different auxiliary information were evaluated in this study the classical rating curves approach and the manning formulation the rating curve approach outperformed the manning formulation with the errors of 13 vs 20 for daily q and 1 vs 5 for annual q the combination of the rating curve method with multi satellite water level retrieval provides the most accurate discharge estimation of the ob river better than previous studies relying on satellite measurements on numerical modelling or on their combination the accuracy of the discharge estimates using the rating curve approach depends on the accuracy of the satellite water height and on the reliability of the built q h relationship for the latter two important factors can be reported the similarity or low difference between the hydraulic geometry at the gauging and virtual stations and a sufficient number of observations used for curve fitting the number of observations available for curve fitting could be constrained by the satellite repeat period in the case of the ob river the lowest discharge accuracy from the rating curve model was found for the envisat altimeter which has the lowest sampling frequency the jason series altimeters with 10 day cycles had better performance finally the multi mission cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a provided the best estimates as a result of 1 better sampling frequency than envisat 2 the highest accuracy of the water level retrievals and 3 the option to relocate the virtual station to the gauged reach and to use the station rating curves when the accuracy of the altimetric rating curves is low the altimetry based discharge accuracy decreases with reducing river size our results and those of other published studies show that using different methods and approaches the accuracy of altimetric daily q estimates is 5 10 for the largest rivers annual flow 1000 km3 10 25 for large rivers annual flow of 200 1000 km3 and 30 40 for medium size rivers annual flow of 25 100 km3 the manning formulation underpins many of the algorithms that have been recently developed in preparation for the swot satellite launch their potential advantage is in application to river reaches where simultaneous altimetric and in situ observations are absent our study demonstrated that the coupling of altimetry with the manning approach permits estimation of ob river daily q with an accuracy of 20 sensitivity analysis showed that the manning method is insensitive to the roughness parameter of river ice altimetry based water slope retrievals with uncertainties less than 30 do not introduce significant errors in discharge estimations the highest uncertainties come from the estimation of the initial river depth any error in parametrisation of initial depth to achieve q errors 30 has to be less than 10 however they can be higher if compensated by the bed roughness parametrisation the use of auxiliary in situ q data for simultaneous calibration of d0 and nb can be beneficial initial depth information on arctic rivers retrieved from topographic maps and used in this study is sufficient for discharge estimations with uncertainty of 20 we also found a functional relation between initial depth and river width we hypothesise that this relation could be applied for rivers in the north of western siberia for swot based

5745,the envisat jason 2 and 3 sentinel 3a cryosat 2 and altika satellite altimeters were used to estimate the discharge of two arctic rivers the ob and pur in western siberia the accuracy of the water height estimates from envisat varied with river size from 0 63 m for the ob 2 km in width to 1 1 m for the pur 0 5 km in width a new method for water level estimation combining the cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a altimeters provided better height accuracy 0 49 m for the ob the rating curve method of discharge estimation outperforms the manning formulation on the ob with a root mean square error rmse of 13 vs 20 for daily discharge and 1 vs 5 for annual discharge sensitivity analysis performed on the manning formulation showed high sensitivity to the river depth parameterisation a functional relationship was identified between the depth of rivers in the north of western siberia and their widths and deposits types the combination for the ob of the rating curve method with the multi satellite water level retrieval algorithm provided higher discharge accuracy than previous studies relying on satellite measurements on numerical modelling or on their combination a synthesis of worldwide river altimetry studies supported our finding that the accuracy of altimetric discharge estimations decreases for narrower rivers the rating curve method applied to jason 2 3 height measurements allows estimation of daily discharges with rmse of 18 for the wide ob river but 38 for the narrow pur river keywords altimetry river discharge rating curves manning approach arctic rivers 1 introduction rivers are an important element of the earth s climate system they ensure connection between atmosphere and ocean in many regions of the world rivers are the only water resource supporting local socio economic development quantification and monitoring of river flow is important not only for sustainable management of this valuable resource but also for prediction of future conditions observations of river discharge q have significantly reduced over the last 30 years although many national services continue observations of key rivers at key stations the availability of these observations for the scientific community and for climate research is limited in 2010 the database of the global river data centre contained information gathered from 3562 gauging stations against 9544 known stations prior to 2010 by 2015 the number had reduced by 1000 stations among the rest only 8 are located on big rivers annual flow 10 km3 which are generally the key water resource rivers and the most informative indicators of regional long term hydroclimatic changes alternative methods of estimation and monitoring of river flow modelling and satellite observations have been rapidly developed to fill this gap hydrological modelling is a powerful tool giving insights at regional or basin scales while satellites can provide worldwide observations the main satellite instruments used for river discharge retrieval are optical and radar imaging sensors providing measurements of river width smith and pavelsky 2008 and water velocity tarpanelli et al 2015 beltaos and kääb 2014 and altimetric radar measuring water height zakharova et al 2006 papa et al 2012 tourian et al 2013 through statistical relations or hydraulic equations these observations may be converted to the river discharge decreasing numbers of in situ observations needed for calibration and validation of hydrological models has promoted the development of satellite model coupling methods biancamaria et al 2009 domeneghetti 2016 emery et al 2018 getirana and peters lidard 2013 altimetry provides reliable regular and weather independent measurements of water height h at a river cross section called a virtual station vs over the last decade the number of on going altimetric satellite missions has increased cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a and b jason 2 and 3 allowing for observation of different reaches along a river significant progress has been made during the last 25 years in altimetric instrumentation and in processing of altimetric measurements this progress has resulted in important improvements in the accuracy of water height retrievals over inland waters and in diverse new applications of altimetry in continental hydrology the size of rivers having altimetry built water level time series has decreased from 2 to 3 km birkett 1998 to 300 400 m schwatke et al 2015 and even to 80 m michailovsky et al 2012 the errors of level estimates has also reduced for large rivers to 0 30 m schwatke et al 2015 and for medium size rivers to 0 3 0 7 m using envisat michailovsky et al 2012 or to 0 20 m using jason 2 and jason 3 biancamaria et al 2018 the few studies that have applied altimetry to rivers covered by seasonal ice did not provide any estimation of the accuracy of water heights indeed many studies excluded the winter period because of the negative impact of ice on h estimation nevertheless several studies dedicated to the rivers of the arctic ocean watershed have demonstrated good potential for altimeters in high latitude hydrology kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 sichangi et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 low accuracy of the water level retrievals as a result of winter ice is the main drawback of altimetry based methods of discharge estimation tourian et al 2013 sichangi et al 2016 low spatio temporal altimeter resolution also constrains the application of this method in the arctic the polar orbiting altimeters ers envisat saral altika cryosat 2 and sentinel 3 have a poor temporal resolution 27 369 days and the topex jason series altimeters with a 10 day repeat cycle provide measurements only as far north as 66 7 n while the mouths of many arctic rivers are located at higher latitudes a better understanding of the performance of the different altimetric missions and different water height retrieval approaches over rivers with seasonal ice could help to extend the application of altimeters in arctic continental hydrology the application of the satellite altimetry for estimation of the river discharge started with the large world rivers the ob kouraev et al 2004 the amazon zakharova et al 2006 and the ganges brahmaputra system papa et al 2012 as the accuracy of water level retrieval has improved more rivers of smaller size and of challenging fluvial geomorphology have been studied as a rule smaller rivers have greater variability in their water regime shorter duration of flood events and more complex and irregular fluvial geomorphology these factors are important not only for the accuracy of the altimetry retrieved water heights but also for the accuracy of the derived and applied discharge conversions the main methods of discharge estimation based on altimetry rely on establishment of statistical relations rating curves rc between in situ observations at the nearest gauging station and remotely sensed water heights kouraev et al 2004 birkinshaw et al 2014 tarpanelli et al 2013 or on hydraulic equations and their parameters width slope height estimated from satellite images lefavour and alsdorf 2005 gleason et al 2014 a particular interest of use of hydraulic equations is their application to ungauged rivers several hydraulics based approaches have been developed recently durand et al 2016 and the performance of these approaches has been evaluated on a number of rivers throughout the world such research seeks to understand the limits of their applicability and to investigate potential improvements bonnema et al 2016 michailovsky et al 2012 sichangi et al 2016 this study evaluated the capacity of the various altimetric satellite missions and associated methods to estimate the discharge of large and medium size rivers in the complex arctic environment in section 2 we describe the study rivers the ob and pur section 3 introduces the satellites auxiliary data and methodology section 4 presents the results of the water level water slope and discharge estimation using envisat jason 2 3 and combination of cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a cs2 s3 water discharge is estimated by two methods for the manning method we began with an ungauged experimental setup where equation parameters were taken from auxiliary sources topographical maps and manuals next the roughness coefficients were optimised allowing comparison with the fully calibrated rating curve approach finally in section 5 we explore the effect of river size on the accuracy of discharge estimates we also discuss the performance of the various altimetric satellites in the context of arctic rivers after demonstration of the sensitivity of estimation accuracy to the parametrisation used and to the altimetric water slope retrievals we reflect on the shortcomings of and potential improvements to the hydraulics based method 2 region of study two rivers of different size located in similar natural conditions on the western siberia plain were selected for this study the wide ob river and the narrow pur river the annual flow of the pur is 14 times less than that of the ob both rivers belong to the arctic ocean watershed they drain boggy areas and have large floodplains natural regulation significantly extends the duration of the spring flood which can last up to 2 months much of the year the watersheds are covered by seasonal snow and the river channels are icebound 2 1 the ob river the ob is the third largest river by discharge flowing to the arctic ocean the catchment s area is 2 926 000 km2 and the annual flow is 406 km3 the main source of water is snow snow cover installs in september in the north or october in the south the melt starts in the middle of may in the south and progresses northward by 2 each 8 days zakharova et al 2014 the western siberian plain is very boggy wet areas occupy up to 70 80 of the area in the central parts the bogs intercept melting water and rain resulting in significant attenuation of the flood peak and an increase in the flood duration at low reaches the flood begins at the end of may and lasts until the end of july the seasonal magnitude of daily discharges q is 35 000 45 000 m3 s with a winter minimum of 2500 4000 m3 s and a spring flood maximum of 38 000 47 000 m3 s from october to may the river is covered by ice in august september several small rain floods of magnitude 2000 4000 m3 s can occur in its lower reaches the ob has numerous branches many of them are of the same width as the principal channel and can be separated by 10 15 km the width of the flood plain can reach 50 km a terminal station providing discharge measurements is located at salekhard city 66 6 n 66 5 e here the water flow from numerous branches is concentrated in the principal channel and the single small secondary channel withdraws a negligible amount of water fig 1 a this reach of 175 km length was selected for water height and water slope retrieval from altimetric satellites a river cross section located 47 km from salekhard line a on fig 3a where information on river depth was available for both the main and the smaller channel was chosen for discharge evaluation using the manning approach the width of the main channel at this cross section is about 2000 m the width of the secondary channel located 22 km to the east is 400 m the floodplain has a width of 25 km here between the main and secondary channels there are several third order branches with widths of 50 100 m as their connectivity is not clear we considered that their contribution to the total discharge is low and can be neglected the channels are surrounded by low density riparian forest while the majority of the floodplain is occupied by bogs or lakes of fluvial or periglacial origin 2 2 the pur river originating on the northern slopes of the sibirskiye uvaly hills located in western siberia the pur flows northward and joins the ob estuary near its centre the territory is part of a discontinued permafrost zone the watershed is covered by frozen bogs wetlands bogs and thermokarst lakes occupy about 55 of the area zakharova et al 2014 the watershed area above the terminal station at samburg is 95 000 km2 and the annual flow there is 28 km3 zakharova et al 2011 as limited data from samburg station was available we used an additional gauging station urengoy located 140 km upstream the drainage area at urengoy is 80 400 km2 and water flow is 24 km3 similar to the ob daily discharges have high seasonal variation the spring flood peak can be 20 times higher than the winter discharge peak discharge varies between dry and wet years ranging from 6390 to 9430 m3 s in autumn rain events can produce floods of lower magnitude the winter low flow period starts at the beginning of october and lasts about 200 days at the end of winter river ice thickness can reach 120 cm 3 data and methods 3 1 data for estimation of the discharge we used the data coming from several sources 1 high resolution landsat 8 images which were used for processing of the water masks and allowed an assessment of the channel width variation 2 water level and water slope time series retrieved from envisat jason 2 and jason 3 satellites as well as from combination of cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a 3 topographic map and 4 in situ water height and discharge at salekhard and urengoy stations 3 1 1 landsat 8 images high resolution landsat 8 multispectral optical images drawn from the us geological service data portal were used for geographical selection of altimetric measurement and for evaluation of the ob river width changes during the flood precise selection of altimetric measurement locations is important for retrieval of high quality water level time series kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2006 dubey et al 2015 a water mask was defined from level 1 landsat 8 images using the modified differential water index mndwi in previous studies the algorithm has accurately delineated water bodies of different sizes and types at similar latitudes in central siberia and been used in the production of water level time series for both a big arctic river zakharova et al 2019 and small 1 km2 arctic ponds zakharova et al 2018 1 mndwi green swir 1 green swir 1 where green green band 0 53 0 58 µm swir1 short wave infrared band 1 57 1 65 µm the pixels with mndwi 0 were classified as water the water masks derived from august landsat 8 scenes corresponded to the low level period when islands and sand banks are generally easily identified these masks were then used solely for selection of the altimetric measurements used in building water level and slope time series eight further unprocessed landsat 8 images covering different phases of the water regime were also used for manual measurement of the channel width of the ob at different seasonal stages and for determination of the coefficients in equations relating width and altimetric height halti 3 1 2 altimetry five altimetric satellite missions were used for ob river water level estimation envisat jason 2 and its successor jason 3 altika cryosat 2 and sentinel 3a all satellites except for jason 2 and 3 are polar orbiting and cover the lower reaches of all arctic rivers the water level for the pur river was estimated only from envisat and jason 2 3 satellites the envisat satellite with onboard ra 2 altimeter operated from 2002 to 2012 ra 2 measurements up to 2010 before the satellite was moved to the new orbit were used for water level processing the repeat period cycle for envisat is 35 days an 18 hz sampling rate gives an along track resolution of 370 m the jason 2 altimetric satellite operated with a 10 day repeat orbit during 2008 2016 its ku band poseidon instrument provided measurements with a 20 hz sampling rate the orbit inclination was 66 033 n meaning that the northernmost mission track crossed the ob river at 66 13 n 35 km south of the salekhard gauging station the urengoy gauging station on the pur river is located between two jason 2 tracks at 65 97 n in february 2016 jason 3 was launched onto the same orbit in order to ensure continuity of measurements the missions flew in tandem with an 80 s difference for 8 months the jason 3 calibration period was not considered during the discharge analysis nevertheless we used it to assess the continuity of height measurements generated by the instrument in the succeeding period the saral altika altimeter was launched onto the prior envisat orbit in 2013 the saral instrument operates at a frequency of 37 ghz ka band a high sampling rate of 40 hz provides measurements at 180 m along track spatial resolution the enhanced bandwidth allows for better vertical resolution 30 cm instead of 47 cm for envisat and finer waveform sampling since june 2016 altika has been operating in a drifting orbit cryosat 2 launched by esa in 2010 is the first mission to operate in synthetic aperture radar sar and sar interferometric sarin modes compared to the conventional low resolution mode lrm the delay doppler technique makes possible a finer along track resolution of approximately 300 m raney 1998 here we applied the esa level 1b product from baseline c this product contains waveforms with 256 and 1024 bins for sar and sarin respectively as well as the range and geophysical corrections needed to construct a surface elevation model sentinel 3a launched in 2016 operates globally in sar mode the dual frequency sar radar altimeter sral is able to operate in open or closed loops in the open loop the range window is positioned by an on board digital elevation model dem whereas in closed loop the range window is automatically positioned based on the previous measurements after march 2019 the open loop has been applied between 60 s and 60 n to improve the on board dem the user community is encouraged to provide surface elevations at virtual stations through the web page https www altimetry hydro eu here we applied the level 2 product enhanced measurements this product contains waveforms with 128 bins ranges and all necessary geophysical corrections 3 1 3 topographic map topographic mapping of the russian part of the arctic regions at 1 200000 scale was sufficiently precise for our analysis the maps of this series are the basis of the esa due permafrost dem product strozzi and santoro 2011 they also map the relief of the flood plains with a vertical resolution of 1 m and contain information about the type of river deposits and about mean river width and depth during the low level period this mapping was used 1 in our ungauged like experimental setup providing information on initial river depth d0 and 2 for evaluation of the critical water level at which water begins to inundate the floodplain 3 1 4 in situ data the gauging stations salekhard and urengoy operated by russian hydrological service provided both water level and discharge data water level is measured daily and discharge several times per year during the main phases of the hydrological regime in hydrological analysis these instrumental discharge measurements are used for adjustment of the rating curves for each given year daily discharges are calculated by the russian hydrological service from these re adjusted curves for the ob river daily discharge data were available only for two years 2002 and 2003 while the water level measurements covered the whole 2002 2016 period for the pur river discharge at urengoy station was available for 2008 2015 and water level measurements covered the ice free seasons from 2002 to 2016 3 2 methods two approaches to water level estimation were applied in this study the first used the classical virtual station concept where all measurements at a river satellite crossing and within a given satellite cycle are averaged to produce the water height data for a given day the landsat 8 water mask was used to identify points within the river channel as the mask was developed in low level conditions many sand banks and islands were exposed these were excluded from the river mask ensuring less contamination of the altimetric signal by land in the second approach the river level time series were derived from multi mission altimetry observations gathered over a segment of the river 3 2 1 water level retrieval from envisat and jason 2 3 satellites water levels were estimated from the range parameter which are part of the geophysical data records gdr of the envisat ra 2 and jason 2 3 satellites gdrs include the range measurements retrieved from the returned altimetric signal using a number of algorithms retrackers good performance in level estimation for inland waters has been reported for the ice1 retracker provided in both envisat and jason gdrs calmant et al 2013 environmental and geophysical correction of the altimeter range measurements relevant to our study region included ionospheric doris dry ecmwf model and wet cls tropospheric corrections solid earth tide correction and correction for the satellite s centre of gravity and geoid these corrections were applied to the range estimates to calculate water levels the ob river water level time series were retrieved for two envisat virtual stations named for their corresponding satellite track located 3 km south and 16 north of the salekhard gauging station time series were also derived for two more northerly jason 2 3 virtual stations situated 62 and 64 km south of salekhard for the pur river water levels were retrieved for three envisat track locations 326 365 and 784 near to the urengoy gauging station and for seven jason tracks 238 59 162 135 86 211 and 10 based on the satellite revisiting times the envisat water level measurements had a 35 days period while the jason data had a 10 day period 3 2 2 water level and water slope retrievals from multi mission approach water levels from cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a were derived in a similar manner as from jason and envisat except that the range parameter is based on a primary peak 80 threshold retracker the primary peak retracker selects the first peak in the waveform above a specified power threshold as the primary peak retracking is then performed on the corresponding sub waveform a retracking point on the leading edge is identified as the decimal bin corresponding to 80 of the ogog amplitude a detailed description of this retracker is given in jain et al 2015 cryosat 2 operates in sarin mode over the ob river allowing for range correction from off nadir reflections we applied the off nadir range correction described in armitage and davidson 2014 water levels from cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3 were derived from an approximately 175 km river segment within the region 65 6 68 5 e and 66 1 66 6 n the satellite measurements over the river were extracted using the landsat 8 water mask to create the water level time series for the ob river we applied a state space model processed using an auto regressive model of order one ar 1 in the time direction water level observations were taken to be cubic spline functions of distance eq 2 2 h i η t i τ x i α x i β sa t i ε i where η ti ρ ti 1 ξ 1 ρ 1 ξi is an error term of normal distribution n 0 ση 2 β sati are bias parameters related to the different satellite missions εi is the observation noise the splines based on points at equidistant locations respond to the underlying topography α xi and to the variations in the water level with distance τ xi observational noise is assumed to follow a mixture of the gaussian and heavy tailed cauchy distributions as described in nielsen et al 2015 we used 300 time steps in the ar 1 which is equivalent to a temporal resolution of approximately 7 8 days with 5 nodes in the spline functions the model allows for construction of a water level time series at any location along the considered river segment this makes it possible to calculate the river slope at any location and time fig 2 displays the modelled river levels along the river for four dates as an example for a given time the slope is derived from the corresponding spline line as the water level difference between selected two locations divided by the distance between these locations here we selected 20 km segment near salekhard station to derive the slope time series the standard deviation of the river slope is derived using the delta method 3 2 3 discharge and water flow estimation in this study we used two different methods of discharge estimation from altimetric measurements a rating curve method and the manning method the rating curve method was applied for both the ob and pur rivers as multi mission water level retrieval for the pur did not provide satisfactory results and consequently the water slope could not be estimated the manning based estimation of q was performed only for the ob manning based q estimation relies on physical lows which allow its application to ungauged river reaches satellite derived main variables are the inputs to investigate the potential of the manning method for ungauged arctic rivers initially we used parameterisation found in manuals and the topographical map then to compare its performance with that of the rating curve method the parameters were calibrated 3 2 3 1 rating curve model rating curves discharge estimation is a fundamental approach used to obtain daily discharges at gauging stations relations are established between simultaneously measured water heights and water discharges the latter are calculated from instrumentally measured water area and velocity in a given river section these measurements are then used for development of rating curves describing the h q relations daily discharges can then be calculated from the daily measurements of water level the rating curves have a power form and can be approximated by eq 3 3 q h a b where h is water height a and b are parameters of the equation during periods of low variability in the water level a polynomial function eq 4 can produce a better fit between q and h zakharova et al 2019 4 q c n h n c n 1 h n 1 c 0 where h is water level n and cn are parameters of the equation for the winter period we tested both eqs 3 and 4 and selected that which produced better accuracy as water flow is not a stationary process h q relations are rarely uniform especially in the case of boreal or arctic rivers with ice cover or when rivers have large flood plains covered by high vegetation both ice and high vegetation significantly change the roughness conditions resulting in changes of water velocity and in point deviations from the main h q stationary line in kouraev et al 2004 zakharova et al 2019 we demonstrated using in situ measurements for salekhard station on the ob river and for kusur station on the lena river the existence and advantage of multiple h q relations in this study we applied a similar approach and established a set of three rating curves specifically for winter flood rise and flood recession hydrological phases for each virtual station or retrieved altimetric water level time series discharge estimation consisted of three steps 1 selection of the hydrological phase based on the altimetric water level and radar backscatter dynamics 2 establishment of rating curves between altimetric heights and in situ discharge using a calibration data set see section 3 2 4 and fitting of eq 3 or eq 4 if necessary 3 calculation of the altimetry derived discharge for the validation period from the developed halti q rating curves 3 2 3 2 manning method the river discharge is calculated as a product of cross section area and mean water velocity 5 q a v a flow contributing section area m2 v water velocity m s for rivers where the channel width is significantly larger than the depth the area can be approximated by assuming a rectangular cross section 6 a b h where 6a h d0 δ h b channel width m h mean depth m d0 initial depth at minimal water level m δh water height correction m the manning water velocity has following formulation 7 v 1 n r 2 3 s 1 2 where 8 r a p n manning s roughness coefficient r hydraulic radius s water surface slope m m p wetted perimeter m as the channel width b varies with the water level a relation b h was established using the river width manually measured using landsat images and the river height retrieved from altimetry at the moment of the image acquisition 9 bm a m h alti bm and bs a s h alti bs where bm is the main channel width and bs is the smaller channel width the fitting of the points provided the following coefficients for eq 9 am 2042 bm 0 24 as 554 and bs 0 29 one of the important parameters in the manning equation is the river mean water depth h which serves for calculation of the cross section area a the precise water depth can only be determined by in situ profiling water depth information is provided as part of gauging station metadata and it is also recorded on ancient topographic and modern navigation maps for our test aimed simulating an ungauged reach we used the information provided by the topographic map this depth d0 refers to the low flow stage and needs to be corrected for water level changes δh as the shape of the channel section selected for this study is complex we adopted a two block scheme for estimation of the effective area and hydraulic radius of the main branch fig 3 using landsat images altimetric heights and the topographic map providing the topography of the floodplain we estimated that water starts to flood the sandbank at halti 2 5 m and at halti 4 m it exits onto the floodplain the total width of the main branch bm including the main channel and the sandbank was derived using eq 9 the area a at each altimetric water stage was estimated as the sum of the area of main channel and sandbank if inundated using eq 6 considering correction for depth δh in each sub section the hydraulic radius was then estimated using this area and the wetted perimeter p black bold line on fig 3 a roughness coefficient reflects the resistance to flows in channels and over floodplains suggested values for manning s n tabulating the factors that affect roughness can be found in chow 1959 the detailed procedures for determining manning s n values for natural channels and flood plains is described in arcement and schneider 1989 the most important factors affecting channel n are the type and size of the bed bank materials sand gravel cobbles rock etc and the shape of the channel depth irregularities obstructions vegetation meandering etc in winter ice cover creates an additional boundary with associated hydraulic roughness the net result is reduction of the hydraulic radius of the channel and changes in effective channel resistance an existing formulation of composite effective roughness nc of an ice covered river is based on weighting of the individual bed nb and ice ni roughness coefficients using the respective wetted perimeters of the channel bed and the ice cover for this study a more accurate formulation taking into account the vertical distribution of water velocity under the ice and known as the belokon sabaneev equation was adopted as proposed by bruner 2016 10 n c 0 5 n b 3 2 n i 3 2 2 3 3 2 3 3 calibration of the parameters of the manning equation the manning equation is calibrated by selecting the combination of parameter values that leads to the lowest levels of a multicomponent series of errors when compared with observations these component errors are aggregated into a number of objective functions a solution to the combined objective functions is defined as efficient pareto optimal if by parameter variation no single objective function can be improved without losses elsewhere in the solution set each possible combination of parameters values potential calibration solution leads to a particular set of objective functions values this combination of parameters values and corresponding objective function outcomes can be pareto efficient pareto optimal pareto dominant or it can be within a pareto efficient boundary and thus be sub efficient the set of all pareto optimal objectives combinations is called the pareto frontier pareto front and corresponding calibration solutions form the efficient calibration solution set pareto optimal calibration solutions to find the pareto optimal calibration solutions we used the multi criteria identification sets method kamenev 2016 2018 this method is based on approximation and then visual examination of identification sets these may be represented as a multidimensional graph of the vector objective function its lower dimensional projections or in other forms projections parts sections or slices and may include sets of optimal sub optimal efficient and sub efficient parameter value combinations both bed and ice roughness coefficients were simultaneously calibrated using the multicriteria identification sets method of pareto domination with four objective functions two objective functions root mean square error rmse and bias evaluated differences between simulations and observations during the ice free period and two similar functions were used for winter when both ice and bed coefficients are relevant the possible ranges of nb and ni were limited to values known to occur in natural conditions in large rivers the nb range was 0 015 0 35 while for ni a larger band 0 01 0 04 was applied each combination of nb and ni values calibration solution leads to particular outcomes for the four objective functions 3 2 4 validation approach the altimetric datasets were divided into calibration and validation periods specifically for each mission table 1 using the rating curves established from simultaneous daily in situ h and q for 2002 2003 the daily discharge at salekhard station was estimated for the years 2004 2016 the estimation procedure was based on the set of the rating curves described in detail in kouraev et al 2004 and zakharova et al 2019 the reconstructed set of station data were then used for equation calibration and for validation of discharge estimates the accuracy of the altimetric discharge and flow estimations was evaluated using bias rmse and the nash sutcliff coefficient ns 11 rmse q alti q

in situ or reconstructed discharge at station 4 results 4 1 water level and water slope time series the water level data from different satellites for the ob and pur rivers are presented in fig 4 the envisat 51 track crosses the ob river within 3 km of the gauging station this proximity allows estimation of the error in halti retrievals 0 63 m rmse see table 2 during the low level period the width of the ob in the study reach varies between 1 7 and 2 5 km this width is large enough that the altimetric h average remains valid with low or moderate land contamination effects envisat water level time series for the pur river were produced for three virtual stations the virtual stations 326 and 365 are situated 65 km north of the gauging station while the virtual station 784 is within 2 km of the gauge as the fluvial geometry at envisat 784 virtual and at the gauging station are similar we can assess the accuracy of the water height estimation from envisat for a medium size arctic river with complex fluvial morphology the width of the pur river varies from 0 5 to 1 2 km numerous sand banks and islands reduce the effective width significantly at the end of summer and in winter despite water mask application signal pollution by the banks and islands results in their surface being detected as water surface as a result the altimetric time series had many anomalously high h measurements during flood recession and in the low level period we found that when ice free the rmse between in situ observations and envisat halti is higher for the pur than for the ob river 0 79 m as in situ measurements for winter are unavailable we were unable to evaluate the accuracy of the height estimates over river ice the continuity of measurements from jason 2 and jason 3 was verified during their 8 months of parallel operation on both wide and narrow rivers an average bias between the instruments for the pur river was 0 17 m and 0 01 m on tracks 59 and 162 respectively the highest differences reach 2 m and occurred before or during the ice melt and during the summer minimum at this time the radar footprints are at their most heterogeneous for the ob river the average bias between missions was 0 10 and 0 26 m for tracks 112 and 187 respectively the maximum difference was significantly less than for the narrow pur river and did not exceed 1 m among seven northernmost jason tracks only track 59 and track 162 with few anomalous halti measurements were selected for discharge estimation for the pur river at the crossover locations of these tracks with the river the channel is 500 600 m wide and free of islands a sand bank boarding right side of the channel is oriented such that only part of the return signals can be contaminated suggesting 200 m variation in the altimetric measurements around a mean nominal jason orbit as the tracks are located far from the gauging station we could not determine the water level estimation errors which can also be affected by changes in channel morphology water level time series retrieval from a combination of the cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a instruments allowed altimetric measurements at the gauging station and consequently evaluation of the accuracy of estimated heights without any ambiguities caused by differences in hydraulic or morphometric conditions in the two compared reaches the accuracy was high 0 49 m rmse and 0 18 m bias the difference bias between in situ and satellite observations is low during the flood and in winter 0 04 m and 0 07 m correspondingly the bias increases up to 0 26 m during summer rain floods the highest overestimation 0 79 m occurred in april on the ob river at that time of year water often exits over the ice through polynyas or pressure fractures wet ice or snow changes the return echoes as could be seen in backscatter dynamics and negatively affects the accuracy of the altimetric estimates the cs2 s3 combination similar to the envisat produced reliable estimates of water height during the winter over ice covered surfaces the jason ice 1 algorithm behaved well at the beginning of the ice period but overestimated the ice height during the second part of winter especially before melting the similar problem was noted for the lena river in our previous study zakharova et al 2019 the low reaches of the ob river are characterised by very low slopes leading to development of a wide up to 50 km floodplain with multiple branches the water slope retrieved from the altimetric measurements was 0 01 1 3 cm km fig 4c a similar value 2 7 cm km was found by beltaos and kääb 2014 for another big arctic river the mackenzie in september 2009 the water slope is strongly correlated r 0 95 with the altimetric water height not shown and its response to short term summer and main spring floods is clear the error 2 σ of the slope at a given time ranges between 0 14 cm km and 1 0 cm km this error estimate might be underestimated since the correlation among along track water level measurement is not accounted for an average relative error is 22 more than 80 of the s estimates have errors of less than 35 the highest relative uncertainties were observed during the winters of 2012 and 2016 when the absolute slope values were close to zero 4 2 discharge and water flow retrievals the classical rating curve method was applied to the jason altimeters for both rivers and to envisat and the cs2 altika s3 combination for the ob river only this method was not applied for the envisat time series for the pur river as the number of halti retrievals in the open water period was insufficient to establish reliable rating curves the manning method involving both altimetric water height and water slope was applied only to the ob river 4 2 1 rating curve model the q values reconstructed from in situ water height data were used to evaluate the accuracy of the altimetry simulated discharge for the ob river the accuracy of this reconstructed discharge estimated as rmse relative to the in situ q for 2002 2003 depends on the hydrological phase the lowest accuracy 13 or 1917 m3 s occurred in the flood rise period for other periods the accuracy is very high 6 rmse or 310 m3 s for winter low flow and 7 rmse or 1790 m3 s for summer recession the accuracy of the jason 2 and jason 3 water level estimates deteriorated significantly during the winter critically affecting the halti q relations during this period power fitting eq 3 did not produce reliable results and so we fitted the points by minimization of rmse and bias using a first order polynomial function eq 4 this function also produced more accurate winter rating curves for other satellites table 3 shows the accuracy of the rating curve fitting the number of envisat and cs2 s3 water height estimates during the ob flood rise was not sufficient to establish accurate rating curves as the cs2 s3 water level estimates were relocated to the salekhard station and the envisat tracks are within 16 km of the gauge we decided that the application of the station h q curve instead of the halti q curve would provide better results for this period previous studies have demonstrated the advantage of densification of altimetric observations for the accuracy of discharge retrieval tourian et al 2016 zakharova et al 2019 our final qalti time series presented in table 4 for both rivers were obtained by simple combination of the simulated discharges from virtual stations of the same satellite missions this procedure did not take any additional mathematical treatment as the virtual stations observations are not simultaneous and lateral water input is negligible on the pur river during the ice free period the number of the retrieved envisat halti values only 1 3 per year was insufficient for reliable rating curves fitting and the envisat time series were excluded from discharge processing for this river when enough simultaneous in situ discharge and altimetric water heights observations are available and the morphology of the virtual and gauge reaches is similar the rating curve approach allows for estimation of q with very high accuracy fig 5 and table 4 the envisat results had the highest q errors while the multi satellite method had the lowest for daily discharges the error distribution among the missions is in general in agreement with the accuracy of the rating curves established for each virtual station see table 3 integration over time reduces the errors by 3 6 for monthly and by 12 16 for annual flow also in agreement with the rating curves errors the medium size pur river had lower discharge retrieval accuracy than the ob river the difference between simulated and in situ discharge was higher during the dry years 2011 2013 when the annual flow halved the largest differences were during flood recession and in winter for the ob river the frequency of water level measurement by different altimeters is not critical to monthly or annual flow estimation the long flood duration permits adequate sampling even by envisat with its 35 day cycle combining discharges from several virtual stations in the case of envisat altimeter for the ob river and jason altimeters for the pur river increases the temporal sampling frequency and moderately 1 2 improves the accuracy of the monthly and annual flows there was however no accuracy gain from combining q estimates from the jason 112 and 187 virtual stations on the ob 4 2 2 manning method to demonstrate the capacity of the manning method to estimate water discharge for ungauged areas we did not initially perform a calibration and instead used typical tabulated values of ice and bed roughness chow 1959 bykov and vasiliev 1965 bruner 2016 for large rivers with no vegetation and sandy deposits these sources propose an nb value of 0 025 as the freezing of arctic rivers is often characterised by transport and accumulation of frazil ice under the ice edge the lower ice boundary has a very rough surface beltaos and prowse 2009 we chose the highest value 0 03 proposed by bruner 2016 for ice of 30 90 cm thickness in the studied reach the ob river valley is composed of two river branches and a large floodplain the river discharge was estimated separately for each of these elements and then summed water discharge from the flood plain was estimated for conditions in which the water height exceeds a critical level by analysing the topographical map landsat images and halti values a critical altimetric level of 4 m was chosen see fig 3 the roughness coefficient of the flood plains nf is high compared to nb and typically varies between 0 1 and 0 2 we selected a value of 0 13 proposed by bykov and vasiliev 1965 for conditions of dense brushes low density riparian forest the simulated discharges before calibration of parameters were comparable with those obtained using the classical rating curve approach and gave the same high accuracy for annual water flow table 4 the discharge passes mainly through the primary river channel the contribution of the small channel is about 2 6 max and of the floodplain is about 1 5 4 max the manning qalti reproduced well the increased winter discharge of 2014 2016 although the method underestimated discharges in 2011 2013 and overestimated in 2015 and in 2016 fig 6 a flood discharge when the altimetric observations caught the peak in 2013 and in 2016 had low errors of 5 and 12 respectively when the altimetric observations truncate the flood peak and discharge is interpolated peak discharge estimation errors increase up to 35 45 in hydraulics models the roughness coefficient is usually calibrated against in situ discharge observations using the multicriteria identification sets method we found the ideal values of nb and ni to be 0 024 and 0 019 respectively interestingly the optimisation suggested a lower ice roughness coefficient than the bed value according to hec ras model manual bruner 2016 this calibrated value corresponds to rippled ice while our initial thought was that ob river ice ridges during formation and stays rough all winter and we initially set ni to 0 03 as our initial choice for nb 0 025 was close to the calibrated value the overall performance after optimisation did not change significantly the annualized values of the accuracy metrics for daily discharges were 3033 m3 s or 20 from mean annual discharge 172 m3 s and 0 98 for rmse bias and nash sutcliffe efficiency respectively as the seasonal magnitude of the discharge is high qflood qwinter 10 it seems that high uncertainty in ni does not have a critical effect on annual accuracies after calibration the uncertainty in the peak discharge for years 2013 and 2016 with near peak halti measurements reduced to 1 and 8 respectively 5 discussion 5 1 assessment of the performance of altimetric satellites for estimation of discharge of arctic rivers the accuracy of discharge estimation from altimetric satellite observations depends on the accuracy of the satellite retrieved variables water height and water slope the accuracy of the algorithm parameterisation and the degree of simplification generalisation of the hydrological processes within the applied algorithms water level retrievals for seasonally ice covered rivers are rather rare kouraev et al 2004 frappart et al 2010 biancamaria et al 2009 tourian et al 2013 birkinshaw et al 2014 bjerklie et al 2018 zakharova et al 2019 sichangi et al 2016 the ice period is excluded from many studies because of high uncertainty in the water levels on sea ice it is thought that the signal of ku band altimeters penetrates the snow and is reflected from the ice surface in situ measurements of water level are made in ice pits where the water is close to the ice surface due to isostatic equilibrium and ice plasticity a difference 15 cm between in situ and altimetric observations can be expected a higher difference may be observed for the ka band altika altimeter as its signal is reflected primarily from the snow air interface remy et al 1999 guerreiro et al 2016 in practice the accuracy of height retrievals over river ice depends significantly on the instrument design conventional sar altimeter and on the retracker configuration the present study as well as data from the dahiti database for hydrological time series of inland waters database 1 1 https dahiti dgfi tum de en map demonstrated that the water level time series derived from envisat altika and sentinel 3a as well as from their combination better describes the winter recession of arctic rivers in winter the jason satellites often detect the higher surfaces of the flood plain or even terraces zakharova et al 2019 this anomalous detection can last several cycles be reproduced each year be observed over several years or occur only in the second part of the winter before flood the reason of this unstable behaviour is unknown fortunately for estimation of river discharge this anomaly can be handled in part by establishing special winter rating curves when the rating curve method is applied the use of other methods based either on various modifications of the manning equation or on coupling of numeric models with altimetric observations can result in high winter discharge errors in our case the jason 2 and 3 winter anomalies negatively affected the accuracy of the winter rating curves see table 3 our river masks were defined during a low level period when the channel width is minimal and sand islands and banks have maximal visibility we expected the h estimates to be better during high waters as there is less land at the mask border to affect the radar waveforms however analysis of the seasonal distribution of errors from cs2 s3 and envisat found that three validated time series had lower absolute errors in h during winter respectively 0 44 m and 0 10 0 12 m and higher errors during the flood respectively 0 53 m and 0 56 0 87 m the accuracy of the derived altimetric heights and the number of the valid observations used for rating curve definition determined the accuracy of the fitted curves the limited number of available flood measurements due to low sampling frequency did not permit a robust fitting of the flood halti q curves for cs2 s3 and envisat for the ob river we resolved this problem by applying the gauging station equations the cs2 s3 measurements were relocated to the salekhard reaches and the envisat virtual stations are within 3 km and 16 km of the gauge the few envisat observations available for ice free period constrained the application of this mission to the smaller pur river the overall errors in discharge estimation for the ob river demonstrated an improvement in altimetric satellite performance from the earlier envisat to the newer cryosat 2 sentinel 3 missions and in their combination 5 2 effect of river size on the accuracy of altimetrically derived discharges two studies in the amazon basin which coupled numerical models with altimetric measurements emery et al 2018 getirana and peters lidard 2013 reported that the accuracy of their discharge simulations reduced with the river size our results also demonstrated lower discharge accuracy from the jason satellites for the smaller pur river rmse of 38 compared to the ob river rmse of 18 the reduced accuracy is a product of the increasing errors in altimetric height and of the more complex relations between discharge and water level in narrower or geometrically more complex channels resulting in less accurate fits for the rating curves a literature synthesis not exhaustive of the daily q errors obtained using altimetry for rivers of different sizes is provided in table 5 from these cases one can conclude that using radar altimetry only or in combination with other satellites or models daily discharge accuracies of 5 10 for the largest rivers annual flow 1000 km3 10 25 for large rivers annual flow of 200 1000 km3 30 40 for medium size rivers annual flow of 25 100 km3 can be anticipated global earth systems models often combine monthly river discharges with climate projections to anticipate annual river flows our results for altimetric monthly and annual discharge demonstrated decreasing errors comparing to daily values if the altimetric observations coincide with the most important flood events annually the errors were halved for both large and small rivers see table 4 demonstrating the potential of radar altimetry data in climate studies 5 3 assessment of the methods of discharge estimation the two methods used for estimating the discharge of the ob river performed differently the classical rating curve method produced lower errors 13 for daily discharge comparing to the method based on the manning equation 23 the manning formulation requires knowledge of the river depth and of the roughness parameters which in many cases are difficult to determine to estimate the river depth different implicit methods have been tested leon et al 2006 tourian et al 2017 while the roughness evaluation remains largely an expert guess to avoid guessing at the roughness bjerklie et al 2003 suggested a simplified equation where only width depth and slope are used as predictors several studies compared the use of this equation with the rating curve approach tarpanelli et al 2013 michailovsky et al 2012 sichangi et al 2016 and found better performance from the latter furthermore sichangi et al 2016 and tarpanelli et al 2015 have shown that the rating curve method is outperformed only when combined with satellite estimations of the river width the greater accuracy of the rating curve method based on the statistical relationship between just two parameters can be expected when two key conditions are fulfilled the water height satellite retrievals are sufficiently accurate and the river morphology at the gauging and the virtual stations is not radically different the second condition ensures that the q h relation can be approximated by a unique rating curve or by a limited set of rating curves fitting the majority of cases especially when the flow can be considered as quasi stationary otherwise dispersion of the points can either prevent an accurate fitting result in erroneous rejection of satellite retrievals as outliers or introduce uncertainties due to oversight of a relationship branch for example the dumping effect of a tributary located downstream from a virtual station often produces the small loop in the curve the manning equation by definition produces less accurate discharge estimations than rating curves in cases when the above conditions are satisfied as more variables coming with their own errors and more assumptions about parameterisation or the structure of equations are involved error propagation leads to higher uncertainties in simulated discharge several assumptions were considered in our study we treated the shape of the ob river channel as rectangular a trapezoidal approximation changes the simulated discharge by up to 17 the use of the mean depth instead of integrating the bathymetry in the calculation of the section areas often produces an underestimation of the sectional area and consequently underestimation of the discharge another structural error can arise from the use of a fixed value for the roughness coefficient we tried to overcome this problem by introducing ice roughness during the winter and floodplain roughness during the flood this allows for seasonal variability of the effective manning coefficient uncertainty can also be related to simplification of the floodplain flow the maximal flood plain contribution to the discharge was evaluated as 4 this contribution may have been underestimated as a result of setting a high roughness or by overestimating the water height threshold for inundation the altimetry derived water slope for the 20 km ob river reach represents average conditions along this reach while the channel parameters width and depth used in the manning equation pertain to a specific cross section between the available cross sections and using the depth information provided on the topographical map we selected the reach that suits better the requirements for instrumental discharge estimation i e linear channel absence of the islands and vegetation regular form of the banks etc we assumed that local high resolution variability of the water slope along the ob reach was low and that our altimetric water slope was also representative of the cross section a comparison of the altimetric water slope retrieved over a 2 km and over 20 km reach centred at the same cross section showed only a small difference 1 between the two s retrievals not shown nevertheless one should be cautious of local slope variability when calculating discharge using the manning equation and satellite measurements over ungauged rivers the problem is less critical if simultaneous calibration of roughness and depth which can absorb any potential errors arising from a slope discrepancy is performed use of altimetric river heights in numerical hydrological models is a rapidly developing approach to discharge estimation table 5 demonstrates that this method shows good potential generally being only slightly lower in accuracy to rating curves getirana and peters lidard 2013 biancamaria et al 2009 preparations for the swot surface water and ocean topography satellite mission have included an extensive campaign for development of algorithms based on river hydraulic geometry or manning equation simplification an algorithm comparison study on 16 mainly medium size rivers durand et al 2016 demonstrated that for 30 of cases these algorithms provide errors of 40 and for 8 of cases the errors are 20 with the two lowest rmse values being 5 and 6 the best performer was a modified manning algorithm solved for several river reaches metropolis manning the authors argued that incorporation of various auxiliary data into the algorithms is highly beneficial and can result in significantly better discharge accuracy in section 4 2 2 we demonstrated the positive effect of the incorporation of auxiliary data qinsitu during calibration of the manning equation in the next section we discuss the impact of errors arising from uncertainties in variables as well as from parameterisation we suggest a way to obtain auxiliary data on river depth in western siberia 5 4 improving the accuracy of manning altimetry coupling discharge estimates 5 4 1 sensitivity of the manning approach to errors in parametrisation in eq 6 the mean river depth is important for estimation of section area and consequently through eqs 7 and 8 for estimation of the water velocity while combination of the altimetric and optical instruments permits evaluation of river width and water height the initial section mean depth d0 has to be obtained from other sources the most reliable information on d0 is provided by in situ measurements at gauging stations for reaches between stations evaluation of the river depth is not a trivial task the d0 used in this study taken from the topographic map is of unknown accuracy and based on measurements done 40 60 years ago our results indicate that even old cartography data is useful for discharge estimation nevertheless the errors that could originate from uncertain river reach depths are of particular interest in this study river width variations obtained from satellite image analysis were compared to water height changes the limited number of points used for definition of the b f halti function can introduce certain errors the impact of inaccurate river widths on discharge estimates can be evaluated using a sensitivity test the one at a time approach to sensitivity analysis is an easy and established technique daniel 1973 this approach has been successfully applied in conjunction with complex hydrological models van griensven et al 2006 and in our opinion is capable of demonstrating the impact of errors in the d0 and b approximations eq 9 on discharge retrievals an experiment was also performed to assess the sensitivity of the manning method to variations in roughness coefficients and water slopes the error range for altimetric slope retrieval was set to 30 reflecting an estimated mean error of 22 which is seen as sufficiently accurate this range when applied to other parameters under investigation accords with the expected natural variability of manning coefficients in large rivers and is sufficient to cover the potential uncertainties of 3 5 m that might be introduced by using the cartographic value of river depth as slope changes with time each s measurement was independently randomized within the given error range and average scores were calculated over 2000 runs results of the one at a time sensitivity test are presented in fig 7 a and b as already noted the suggested algorithm is not sensitive to the roughness coefficient of river ice nevertheless improvement of winter discharges estimations after optimisation of ni is possible the algorithm has low sensitivity to errors in river width lines corresponding to the coefficients am and bm have low slopes on fig 7a and b this means that the time spent estimating river widths from optical images could be minimised by establishing b h relations from a limited sample of images the slope variable shows higher sensitivity although slope errors within 30 do not significantly affect the daily discharges staying within acceptable values maximum 11 for bias and 30 for rmse the algorithm is more sensitive to the errors in the bed roughness parameter similar impacts on discharge estimation using manning equation from uncertainty in slope and bed roughness have been reported for the amazonian rivers sichangi et al 2016 the highest sensitivity found was for the initial river depth uncertainties of 30 in nb can lead to discharge errors of 40 60 for bias and 25 45 for rmse while the similar variation in initial river depth can increase q errors up to 70 80 and 60 80 respectively discharge errors are lower when nb or d0 are overestimated than when underestimated from eqs 5 and 6 as well as from the fig 7a it is clear that bed roughness and the river depth have opposite effects on discharge estimation an underestimation of river depth could be compensated by underestimated bed resistance or bed roughness to the flow in practice if in situ discharge is available for calibration optimisation of roughness and depth parameters at the same time produces a set of suitable pairs of nb and d0 in model optimisation routines this is known as equifinality between parameters pianosi et al 2016 by performing this test and using the multi criteria identification sets method we found a direct quasi linear relationship between these parameters in the ranges expected for this type of river i e nb 0 018 0 028 13 n b 0 0028 d0 0 008 biancamaria et al 2009 found that for the lower ob river the nb d0 pair of 0 015 10 m produces the best river discharge simulation accuracy when using a coupled isba lisflood fp model this point lies close to the line defined by eq 13 according to this equation at 10 m depth roughness equals 0 018 we hypothesise that if the calibration of lisflood had been done with more discrete iteration steps the optimal solution for nb d0 in the lisflood fp model would have exactly matched our nb d0 relation to roughly evaluate the overall sensitivity of the manning method we simultaneously introduced errors in the relevant parameters using an error grid of enlarged space and reduced density fig 7c this demonstrated that to keep simulated discharge errors within acceptable values the parameters and slope errors should be less than 35 40 if a calibration discharge set is not available other methods of approximation of the river depth have to be implemented tourian et al 2017 reviewed these methods many of which rely on a combination of remote sensing data and empirical geomorphological relations however many of them to a certain extent use information on river discharge or river depth from alternative sources e g in situ q from another river reach modelled discharge in situ quintile discharge birkinshaw et al 2014 durand et al 2008 tourian et al 2017 leon et al 2006 yoon et al 2012 several attempts have been made to retrieve river depths using optical satellite sensors legleiter and roberts 2009 in seeking possible solutions we explored the relationship between the initial river depth and the river width hypothesising that some typical condition might apply on the west siberian plain 5 4 2 estimation of river depth using a regional width depth relation leopold and maddock 1953 proposed a functional power relationship between river channel parameters and discharge since then numerous studies have sought a connection between parameters of these functions at different hydrographical scales from a single river reach to basin wide application miller et al 2014 many works have reported reliable regional generalizations for rivers that have achieved quasi equilibrium states phillips and harlin 1984 singh 2003 in preparation for the swot mission several river databases have been recently developed andreadis et al 2013 allen and pavelsky 2018 the importance of auxiliary information on hydraulic geomorphology which could be included in these databases was clearly demonstrated durand et al 2016 by retrieving river width and depth from topographic maps for several lower reaches of the ob river and adding data for other 8 rivers in north of western siberia 62 68 n 63 84 e we found distinct clustering of the points on a b d0 graph fig 8 several early studies have revealed effects on channel geometry adjustments and the b d0 relationship from various parameters relevant to channel resistance bed deposit diameter vegetation or to flow energy slope hey and thorne 1986 huang and warner 1995 lee and julien 2006 examination of channel deposits made clear that the upper branch of the fig 8 graph in the range of 90 500 m width is mainly channels with higher resistance cobble bolder deposit beds other points on this branch in the width range 500 1200 m correspond to western young secondary channel of the ob river called the small ob river and joining the study reach on the southern border which has a bed of sand deposits or to the upper reaches of small rivers of the region i e potentially higher flow energy systems further analysis showed that the low branch in fig 8 corresponds to the condition of wide braided sand bed reaches with important width variability b 800 m and negligible variation in depth for wider braided channels the depth variability is greater and the braided channel line tend to converge with the main shallow sand bedded meandering channel in a quasi equilibrium state equations corresponding to each channel type are given in table 6 from hydraulic geometry theory the river depth and river width could be related through an equation 14 d0 c a f b b f b where a and b are the coefficient and the power in relation b f q while c and f are the coefficient and the power in relation d0 f q the hydraulic geometry coefficients found in hey and thorne 1986 for gravel bed uk rivers produce following equation 15 d 0 0 12 b 0 78 in the 50 350 m width range the b d0 points of eq 15 lie close to our cobble bed line for the niger river neal et al 2012 found similar coefficients which best agreed with our findings at higher river widths the measurements of b d0 provided in bjerklie et al 2018 for another big arctic river the yukon lie close to our sand bed line and support the use of this type of relationship for estimation of initial depth according to our sensitivity testing the proposed relations for estimation of river discharge in the northern part of the western siberian plain can be justified for straight well developed sand bed river reaches wider than 800 m and for braided rivers wider than 1500 m under these conditions the d0 error of 70 cm see table 6 is less than 10 consequently the discharge errors due to depth uncertainties will not exceed 30 see fig 7 for constrained river channels for which the d0 can be estimated with rmse of 1 21 m acceptable q errors of 30 are expected for channels wider than 1000 m these relations were developed for average water stage conditions during the low level period corrections might be needed if optically derived river widths are used for d0 estimation 6 conclusion the accuracy of river discharge estimates from altimetric satellite observations depends on many factors among them are the accuracy of the water height estimates the parametrisation of the algorithms and the availability of the auxiliary information the accuracy of water height retrievals depends strongly on river fluvial morphology large river width low banks and the absence of the sand islands are the main favourable conditions for precise estimation of water level the presence at virtual stations of sandy banks during the low level period is less critical than islands the accuracy rmse of the h estimates from the envisat mission for the wide ob river was 0 63 m but 1 1 m for the narrower pur river recently developed approaches for water level estimation from a combination of cryosat 2 altika and sentinel 3a altimeters provided better h accuracy 0 49 m rmse two different methods of the water discharge estimation using different auxiliary information were evaluated in this study the classical rating curves approach and the manning formulation the rating curve approach outperformed the manning formulation with the errors of 13 vs 20 for daily q and 1 vs 5 for annual q the combination of the rating curve method with multi satellite water level retrieval provides the most accurate discharge estimation of the ob river better than previous studies relying on satellite measurements on numerical modelling or on their combination the accuracy of the discharge estimates using the rating curve approach depends on the accuracy of the satellite water height and on the reliability of the built q h relationship for the latter two important factors can be reported the similarity or low difference between the hydraulic geometry at the gauging and virtual stations and a sufficient number of observations used for curve fitting the number of observations available for curve fitting could be constrained by the satellite repeat period in the case of the ob river the lowest discharge accuracy from the rating curve model was found for the envisat altimeter which has the lowest sampling frequency the jason series altimeters with 10 day cycles had better performance finally the multi mission cryosat 2 altika sentinel 3a provided the best estimates as a result of 1 better sampling frequency than envisat 2 the highest accuracy of the water level retrievals and 3 the option to relocate the virtual station to the gauged reach and to use the station rating curves when the accuracy of the altimetric rating curves is low the altimetry based discharge accuracy decreases with reducing river size our results and those of other published studies show that using different methods and approaches the accuracy of altimetric daily q estimates is 5 10 for the largest rivers annual flow 1000 km3 10 25 for large rivers annual flow of 200 1000 km3 and 30 40 for medium size rivers annual flow of 25 100 km3 the manning formulation underpins many of the algorithms that have been recently developed in preparation for the swot satellite launch their potential advantage is in application to river reaches where simultaneous altimetric and in situ observations are absent our study demonstrated that the coupling of altimetry with the manning approach permits estimation of ob river daily q with an accuracy of 20 sensitivity analysis showed that the manning method is insensitive to the roughness parameter of river ice altimetry based water slope retrievals with uncertainties less than 30 do not introduce significant errors in discharge estimations the highest uncertainties come from the estimation of the initial river depth any error in parametrisation of initial depth to achieve q errors 30 has to be less than 10 however they can be higher if compensated by the bed roughness parametrisation the use of auxiliary in situ q data for simultaneous calibration of d0 and nb can be beneficial initial depth information on arctic rivers retrieved from topographic maps and used in this study is sufficient for discharge estimations with uncertainty of 20 we also found a functional relation between initial depth and river width we hypothesise that this relation could be applied for rivers in the north of western siberia for swot based

5746,we propose an efficient analytical upscaling method to compute the equivalent conductivity tensor for elliptic equations in three dimensional space our approach uses perturbation expansion and fourier analysis and considers heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry of coarse gridblocks through low order approximation the derived analytical solution accurately approximates the central difference numerical solution with periodic boundary conditions numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the capability and efficiency of this analytical approach in upscaling fluid flow in heterogeneous formations we test the method in synthetic examples and benchmark cases with both gaussian random fields and channelized non gaussian fields in addition we examine the impact of each parameter on the upscaled conductivity and investigate the sensitivity of the variance and correlation lengths to the coefficients we also indicate how to extend this approach to multiphase flow problems keywords upscaling conductivity tensor equivalent conductivity heterogeneity anisotropy 1 introduction accurate and efficient modeling of flow and transport problems is fundamental for groundwater flow oil gas recovery and carbon sequestration numerical simulation of the associated physical processes can be challenging due to heterogeneity anisotropy and uncertainty of porous media parameters it can also be computationally prohibitive to directly simulate flow and transport problems based on fine scale parameters coarse scale models are therefore needed to reduce computational burden and development of an upscaling method that preserves solution accuracy constitutes a demanding task a significant number of upscaling techniques have been presented in the extant literature including various approaches

marsily 1997 durlofsky 1991 sanchez vila et al 2006 numerous works were presented for estimating effective or equivalent conductivity e g self consistent approximation jankovic et al 2013 suribhatla et al 2011 these two concepts are also related the equivalent conductivity coincides with the effective conductivity when the averaging volume is very large compared to the integral scale as implied by ergodicity in this study we focus on the equivalent conductivity and upscaling techniques which integrate fine scale properties into a coarse scale equivalent the analytical methods can be straightforward e g simple averages including the arithmetic harmonic geometric and power average approaches wen and gómez hernández 1996 in particular the power average is attractive due to its simplicity the bounded range of power value between 1 and 1 and its applicability in both two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d spaces however the power value is case dependent and is a function of heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry i e block shape and size cardwell and parsons 1945 and le loc h 1987 demonstrated that the equivalent conductivity is bounded by the upper bound harmonic arithmetic mean and the lower bound arithmetic harmonic mean which can be used via averaging with a proper weight guerillot et al 1990 this approach was introduced to 3d and anisotropic media by lemouzy 1991 and duquerroix et al 1993 some researchers later presented empirical formulas to determine the weight value li et al 1999 renard et al 2000 maschio and schiozer 2003 however these approaches are not sufficiently general for heterogeneous reservoirs e g the axes of the covariance ellipse are not aligned with the cartesian coordinates and only account for diagonal terms without generating a full tensorial conductivity another similar idea is the so called renormalization technique and is based on successive computation with a hierarchical structure as a pyramid king 1989 it is extremely fast and is not limited to the domain size or the variance of block conductivities this technique was later extended to 3d and provides excellent results for isotropic fields shah and ottino 1986 mohanty and sharma 1990 wu et al 2013 however it was reported that the boundary conditions applied to the sub blocks can be unrealistic and may cause severe errors in the final estimation and may be inaccurate for non gaussian e g sand shale or checkerboard log conductivity field malick 1995 yeo and zimmerman 2001 in addition the standard renormalization tends to underestimate the conductivity renard and de marsily 1997 which could be improved by the modifications presented in gautier and noetinger 1997 due to strong heterogeneity and anisotropy the complexity of simple analytical treatment permits few precise analytical results for general cases and thus numerical simulations are required for many situations among various numerical algorithms the most popular one is probably the second order central finite difference scheme on a five point stencil for 2d and a seven point stencil for 3d problems with periodic boundary conditions durlofsky 1991 2005 the benefit of this algorithm is that it yields a conductivity permeability tensor which is proven to be always symmetric and positive definite moreover it can be quite accurate and robust even when periodic boundary conditions do not strictly apply pickup et al 1994 however to obtain an accurate equivalent conductivity permeability the coarse gridblock should be sufficiently refined and then solved to determine the flow pattern inside if a reservoir or field contains millions of coarse gridblocks which is currently quite common the fluid flow problem has to be solved millions of times i e one for each gridblock therefore the efficiency of solving the local upscaling problem is crucial in modern practice it would be desirable to estimate the equivalent conductivity permeability as accurately as the numerical method and as efficiently as the analytical method such as simple averaging romeu and noetinger 1995 developed analytical expressions to approximate numerical results with periodic boundary conditions for isotropic media following their framework liao et al 2019 presented the solution for anisotropic media in 2d space then combined it with the weighting average of upper and lower bounds and derived the solution for off diagonal terms in the conductivity tensor in this study we further extend the method to 3d space propose another algorithm using the power average and determine the power coefficient analytically in other words a simple way to predict the exponent value exists without resorting to numerical simulations we also adjust the formulas for the off diagonal components to ensure positive definiteness of the conductivity tensor in addition we perform sensitivity analysis for the input parameters on the coefficients and test the applicability of the proposed method in non gaussian random fields we also discuss possible extensions for upscaling relative permeability and capillary pressure in multiphase flow problems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equation and some existing methods section 3 proposes the new analytical method section 4 demonstrates the feasibility of our method using synthetic examples and the realistic spe10 benchmark case christie and blunt 2001 section 5 verifies the proposed method under various conditions and provides discussions on the parameter sensitivity and extensions to multiphase flow finally section 6 summarizes and concludes this work 2 governing equation and methodology 2 1 governing equation in this study we consider the following elliptic equation which can be used in incompressible single phase fluid flow problems bear 1972 1 k x h x f x x ω c 1 h x c 2 h x n g x x ω where x x y z ω r 3 is a cuboid domain with boundary ω k is a symmetric positive definite tensor referred to as conductivity or permeability and h indicates the hydraulic head or pressure eq 1 is usually coupled with darcy s law as v k h called darcy velocity the equivalent conductivity for the coarse block is defined as renard and de marsily 1997 2 1 v ω v x d x k eq 1 v ω h x d x where v is the total volume here the fine scale conductivity is assumed to be diagonal and the upscaled conductivity is treated as a full tensor since the tensorial nature is partially a consequence of the anisotropic spatial correlation 3 k kx ky kz k eq kxx kxy kxz kyx kyy

cos θ cos φ 0 sin φ 0 1 0 sin φ 0 cos φ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 x y z in which θ φ and ψ are the counter clockwise rotation angles specifically let x y z be the orthogonal axes of a cartesian coordinate system the new coordinate x y z is obtained by first rotating about the z axis by angle ψ then rotating about the y axis by angle φ and finally rotating about the x axis by angle θ note that the exponential covariance σ y 2 exp d and gaussian covariance σ y 2 exp d are two special cases of the matérn covariance when ν 1 2 and respectively in some anisotropic cases the properties of the fine gridblock e g conductivity or length may not be the same in different directions for example the vertical conductivity is usually less than the horizontal one and the shape of the fine scale gridblock of size δx δy δz can be a cuboid instead of a cube i e δ x δ y δ z we denote the anisotropy ratio of size for fine scale gridblock as a ly δ y δ x and a lz δ z δ x and the anisotropy ratio of conductivity as a ky k y k x and a kz k z k x which will be used in derivations in section 3 1 2 3 numerical methods the numerical method for local upscaling of conductivity can be

k y x fd a ly σ y 2 γ yx exp σ y 2 γ yx e k x x fd e k y y fd similarly we can derive other diagonal and off diagonal terms e kyyfd e kzzfd e kzxfd e kxyfd e kzyfd e kxzfd and e kyzfd we note that the upscaling methods presented above assume gaussian random fields for the log conductivity but are not limited to any specific covariance function below we use matérn covariance including exponential and gaussian covariance and spherical covariance functions to illustrate this point 4 case studies 4 1 synthetic case exponential covariance the proposed analytical method is first tested in a synthetic case we consider that a 3d space contains 60 50 50 15 000 fine grid cells which is upscaled to 6 5 5 150 coarse gridblocks each consisting of 10 10 10 1 000 fine grid cells fig 1 a the boundary conditions are set to be constant heads h 1 at left and h 0 at right while no flow at the other four directions we assume that the random log conductivity field has a zero mean and follows an exponential covariance function with σ y 2 1 0 ηx 40 ηy 20 ηz 10 ψ 30 φ 20 and θ 10 the grid size is set to be cubic with isotropic property i e aky akz aly alz 1 fig 1a shows one scenario in fine scale randomly generated using the above statistical information fig 1b depicts the coarse scale result upscaled by the numerical method fig 1c illustrates the coarse scale result upscaled by the analytical method using upper and lower boundaries with the weight α hereafter referred to as the analytical α method fig 1d presents the coarse scale log conductivity upscaled by the analytical method using the power average with the coefficient ω hereafter referred to as the analytical ω method the fine scale conductivity field fig 1a is substituted in a numerical solver to compute the true fine scale hydraulic head for this realization fig 2 a which is then averaged to generate the coarse scale hydraulic head fig 2b the upscaled log conductivities fig 1b d are also substituted in a numerical solver to obtain the hydraulic heads fig 2c e and velocities we can see that there is no visible difference between the numerical results the analytical results and the true reference here we use the multipoint flux approximation mpfa algorithm aavatsmark 2002 in the matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst lie 2014 as the numerical solver to deal with the upscaled conductivity tensor fig 3 presents scatter diagrams for the hydraulic head and velocities for the hydraulic head both numerical and analytical results match the exact values quite well regarding velocity the x velocity has a better match than the y and z velocity since the main flow direction is along the x axis we can see that the patterns are fairly similar between the first row and the second third row to further compare the numerical results and the analytical results we plot the scatter diagrams for these two results as in fig 4 it is seen that the analytical method is able to reproduce the numerical results accurately to test the capability of the proposed methods for the cases in which the correlation lengths are smaller than the size of the coarse gridblock we consider another example by setting the correlation lengths to be ηx 6 ηy 4 ηz 2 as illustrated in fig 5 we can see that the variation of fine scale conductivity in each coarse block increases compared to the previous example however the variation of the equivalent conductivity for all coarse blocks decreases thus the simulated hydraulic head and velocity have smaller variance fig 6 in general the analytical methods still generate good results compared to the numerical results 4 2 spe10 upper layers spherical covariance we then test the proposed method in an spe 10 comparative project christie and blunt 2001 which is widely employed for reservoir upscaling the fine scale geological model is described on a regular cartesian grid with a domain size of 1 200 2 200 170 l it has 60 220 85 cells and each size is 20 10 2 l the top 35 layers exhibit gaussianity in log permeability data whereas the bottom 50 layers are clearly channelized in this example we select the top 35 layers since the type of covariance function is not known we performed variogram analysis and found that the spherical covariance provides the best fit with the parameters as σ y 2 5 0 ηx 600 ηy 600 and ηz 10 as no obvious rotation is observed we assume ψ φ θ 0 from the log permeability data in the x y and z directions as well as the size of the grid block we set aky 1 akz 0 3 aly 0 5 and alz 0 1 we set four wells two injectors at constant head h 1 and two producers at constant head h 0 as a quarter of a five spot pattern in the four corners connected to all layers using an upscaling ratio of 5 5 5 the fine scale model is upscaled to 12 44 7 coarse gridblocks the log permeability field is presented in fig 7 with a very large variance it appears that a discrepancy exists between the fine scale model in fig 7a and the upscaled results in fig 7b d this is because fig 7a only illustrates the top layer of the fine scale model if we observe the top five layers since we set the upscaling ratio to be 5 5 5 as in fig 8 we see that the log permeability values in layers 3 5 are greater than those in layers 1 2 for y 50 which is consistent with the upscaled results in fig 7b d figs 8 11 show the hydraulic head and velocity it can be seen that the numerical results and analytical results have negligible differences both of which are close to the true values from the fine scale simulations for the numerical method the cpu time of computing the equivalent permeabilities in all coarse gridblocks i e upscaling step is 15 6 s for the analytical method the cpu time for the analytical α and analytical ω methods are 0 52 s and 0 32 s respectively and the time for computing the coefficients α and ω is 0 11 s it can be seen that the time for computing the coefficients is just a small portion of the analytical method since the coefficients need to be computed only once actually as the number of coarse blocks increases the time for computing the coefficients can be negligible compared to the total time in the analytical method the tests are programmed by matlab on a desktop pc with i7 6700k cpu 4 00 ghz in this example the analytical method is 20 40 times more efficient than the numerical one although the multiple summations in eqs 46 and 51 appear to be complex they are actually easy to compute and just need to be computed once for all coarse grids 4 3 spe10 bottom layers non gaussian field in the above examples we can see that the proposed method works quite well for gaussian random fields in this section we will test it in non gaussian fields albeit the analytical derivation is based on the gaussian assumption we consider the bottom 50 layers in the spe 10 comparative project with the same model setup as above specifically the 60 220 50 fine cells are upscaled to 12 44 10 coarse grids with an upscaling ratio of 5 5 5 the log permeability field is channelized and clearly non gaussian fig 12 a precisely the mean and covariance function are not sufficient to describe this random field and multipoint statistics are required instead of two point statistics nevertheless we use the same parameters for the gaussian field as in section 4 2 just to see the performance in the non gaussian field figs 12 15 show the results of log permeability hydraulic head and velocity in general it can be seen that the velocity is more difficult to match than the log permeability and hydraulic head even the numerical method may have nontrivial error for the z velocity as shown in fig 14 indicating that a more advanced method e g non local upscaling is required in addition the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method actually the analytical α method and the numerical method generate almost identical results as can be seen from the first row of fig 15 the reasons behind this will be discussed in sections 5 3 and 5 4 the cpu time for the numerical upscaling is 21 9 s and the times for the analytical α and analytical ω methods are 0 73 s and 0 48 s respectively in the case of non gaussian field the analytical method is also 20 40 times faster than the numerical method 5 discussion 5 1 verification under various conditions in this section we compare upscaled coarse block conductivities from the proposed methods and the numerical method under various conditions including heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry table 1 we use the matérn covariance function with a variance of 1 0 the effect of variance will be tested in section 5 3 we set up a base case change the parameters one at a time and investigate 15 cases in total for example the parameter v varies between 0 01 and 10 in case 1 the correlation lengths ηx is from 1 to 100 in case 2 fig 16 shows 10 000 random scenarios of the upscaled kxx in case 2 considering the numerical results as reference in general the mismatch between the analytical methods and numerical method becomes smaller with a larger correlation lengths as the variation of conductivity in each coarse block reduces we then use a relative root mean square error to analyze the performance quantitatively for cases 1 15 as in fig 17 it can be seen that the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method which is consistent with previous observations fig 17a shows the effect of coefficient v in matérn covariance function as v increases the integral scale increases thus it is easier to upscale the fine scale model the largest error occurs in case 12 when nx becomes very large fig 17l there are two reasons first a larger nx leads to increased variation in a coarse block with fixed correlation lengths secondly a larger nx results in an anisotropic ratio farther away from unity in geometry with fixed ny and nz both effects make it more challenging for upscaling to distinguish the individual effects we consider case 15 fig 17o where nx ny and nz change simultaneously we can see that the error is clearly reduced compared to case 12 indicating the effect of geometric anisotropy is more significant than the effect of variability in a coarse block in this example actually setting very different lengths for different directions in a coarse block is not suggested in upscaling fig 18 illustrate the results computed from the mean of 10 000 random scenarios it is seen that the analytical results match the numerical results very well and thus can be used to investigate the effect of each parameter conveniently 5 2 effect of upscaling ratio an important practical problem in upscaling is the determination of the optimal upscaling ratio which is related to the balance between accuracy and efficiency boschan and noetinger 2012 preux 2016 preux et al 2016 in this context we study the accuracy of the head and velocity computed from the equivalent conductivity and their dependence on the coarsening scale first we focus on lognormal stationary isotropic media we consider a fine scale model of 32 32 32 grids subject to the exponential covariance function with a variance of 1 0 and the correlation lengths ηx ηy ηz 4 0 for log conductivity four upscaling ratios 2 4 8 and 16 for all directions are tested then we test another two anisotropic cases ηx 32 ηy ηz 4 0 and ηx ηy 32 ηz 4 0 the results are illustrated in fig 19 we can see that as the upscaling ratio grows the head error increases whereas the x velocity error first increases and then decreases this is because the boundary condition is constant heads at left right while no flow at other bounds which is different from the periodic boundary in upscaling algorithms if we use the periodic boundary condition for the whole physical space the head error will behave similar to the x velocity error the maximum error for x velocity occurs when the upscaling ratio is close to the integral scale the explanation is if the upscaling ratio is very small it is similar to solving the fine scale model or if the upscaling ratio is very large it is similar to considering the whole physical space as one coarse block and the error in both cases will be relatively small we can also see that the effect of the upscaling ratio is related to the geostatistics e g correlation structure in general the analytical methods can assist in investigating the effect of upscaling ratio as they generate almost the same results as the numerical method does 5 3 effect of large variance large variance always constitutes an important and challenging problem here we compute various including arithmetic harmonic upper and lower bounds and equivalent coarse scale conductivity normalized by the geometric mean from 10 10 10 fine grids both analytically and numerically the log conductivity field is assumed to be isotropic and gaussian distributed with zero mean and exponential covariance fig 20 shows that the arithmetic means from the analytical method and the numerical method are overlapped this is because although the derivation of the analytical method adopts low order approximation it is exact for the arithmetic mean the harmonic mean using the analytical method mismatches that using the numerical method when the variance is greater than three and similar phenomena are observed for the upper and lower bounds due to the low order approximation the equivalent conductivity using the analytical α method matches that using the numerical method very well however the analytical ω method starts to deviate when the variance is greater than one these can be explained by the effect of the variance on coefficients α and ω fig 21 specifically the real ω from the numerical method increases along with the variance and hence the analytical ω method is no longer accurate for large variance on the other hand the real α does not change much as the variance increases indicating that the ratio between kxmax kxeq and kxeq kxmin is not sensitive to the variance therefore the analytical α method using low order approximation is still quite accurate for large variance in general the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method as can be seen in the previous examples in sections 4 2 and 4 3 5 4 effect of correlation lengths it is noted that the statistics of the log conductivity field are required to compute the coefficients in the proposed method usually this is not a problem since the statistics are obtained before the scenarios realizations are randomly generated nevertheless in some cases the statistics might be difficult to obtain accurately due to limited information under these circumstances it would be better if the coefficients α and ω are not sensitive to the heterogeneity parameters e g correlation lengths this problem can be analyzed by setting an isotropic field initially and then changing one of the correlation lengths in the x y and z directions at a time figs 22 and 23 show the effect of correlation lengths normalized by the size of the coarse grid block on coefficient α specifically we set the ratio between 1 8 and 8 for each direction we can see that the coefficient α increases as the correlation length of the corresponding direction increases this is because in a certain direction as the correlation length grows the equivalent conductivity keq is closer to the upper limit kmax and farther away from the lower limit kmin consequently the coefficient α increases and meanwhile the coefficient α decreases in the other two directions considering that the physical range of α is from 0 to 1 we can see that α is not very sensitive to the correlation lengths with a relatively small range between 0 3 and 0 6 for a large variation of ratio between 1 8 and 8 we note that this does not mean that α is a constant in all cases actually α varies significantly if the coarse block shape and size change however these parameters can be determined easily during the discretization step in sum the low volatility of α makes this approach relatively stable even when the heterogeneity is not known exactly figs 24 and 25 show the effect of correlation lengths on coefficient ω one can see that the coefficient ω also increases as the correlation length of the corresponding direction increases considering that the physical range of ω is from 1 to 1 it can be seen that ω is more sensitive to the correlation lengths than α this partially explains the reason why the analytical α method performs better than the analytical ω method in general and particularly in the non gaussian model in which multi point statistics are required 5 5 relation to some previous results we may derive the formula for k x med 1 in equation 16 similar to k x max and k x min as in eqs 42 45 54 k x med 1 μ a y μ h x μ a z κ 1 β 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y β i j 2 1 n y j 1 n y β j 2 β i j 1 n z k 1 n z β i j k β j 1 n y i 1 n x k 1

uncorrelated media ρ xyz 0 59 k x eq κ a 2 3 κ h 1 3 κ g exp σ y 2 6 consequently the analytical derivation in this study can be viewed as the generalized form of some previous works considering coarse block geometry heterogeneity and anisotropy 5 6 extension to two phase problems in oil and gas recovery as well as geological carbon sequestration two or more fluid phases may be present it is therefore important that the analytical method can be extended to two phase flow problems steady state methods serve as convenient approaches for upscaling relative permeabilities and capillary pressures in viscous or capillary limit which are used as approximations to make the computation of pseudo functions easier and faster than that using dynamic methods in the capillary dominated state when the flow rate is very low the phase saturation is determined by the constant capillary force whereas in the viscous dominated state with high flow rates the phase saturation is determined by the constant fractional flow in both cases the fine scale relative permeability can be obtained from the saturation and used to compute the coarse scale relative permeability in some cases neither capillary nor viscous dominated assumptions are valid and the upscaled parameters vary between those limits a simple idea to calculate the relative permeabilities based on interpolation between the capillary and viscous limits has been reported in kumar et al 1997 later virnovsky et al 2004 presented a more general model for computing rate dependent parameters by solving the two phase flow with periodic boundary conditions similar to the above approaches we can use the proposed analytical method to compute the upscaled relative permeabilities and capillary forces which is currently being developed by the authors actually we can produce relative permeability tensors as tensor functions of the fluid saturation which will depend on the ratio of viscous capillary forces 6 conclusions in this work we introduce an analytical upscaling approach to obtain the equivalent conductivity tensor for elliptic equations in three dimensional 3d anisotropic heterogeneous porous media using perturbation theory and fourier analysis this method accurately reproduces the results from the finite difference numerical method with periodic boundary conditions the derivations are similar to those reported in romeu and noetinger 1995 who presented an analytical method for isotropic media and liao et al 2019 who recently extended it to a 2d anisotropic field here we further extend the method to 3d space and propose another algorithm using the power average and determine the power coefficient analytically we also update the formulas for the off diagonal components to ensure positive definiteness of the conductivity tensor and discuss applicability in non gaussian fields and multiphase flow problems we test the proposed method in three examples considering not only the constant head impervious boundary condition but also a quarter of a five spot pattern we compared the analytical methods and the numerical method for quantification of tensorial conductivity hydraulic head and velocity in coarse gridblocks using a weighted average of the upper and lower bounds the analytical α method and the numerical method are in good agreement in all cases it replicated the results from the numerical method successfully even with a large variance and in the case of non gaussian random field on the other hand using a power average the analytical ω method is less accurate and suggested to be applied to gaussian random fields with moderate variance we verified the proposed method in various heterogeneous anisotropic cases we also analyzed the dependence of the coefficients α and ω on the variance and correlation lengths and found that α is not very sensitive to these factors as a benefit the computing resources become much more powerful nowadays than a few decades ago nevertheless efficient upscaling is still very important for large scale problems especially with multiple realizations e g in sensitivity analysis or optimization in various tests the analytical method is found to be as accurate as the numerical method and 10 100 times faster than the numerical method hence can be used as an efficient substitute for the numerical method the proposed method is valid for general heterogeneous elliptic equations including not only fluid flow in porous media but also some other physical problems e g estimation of equivalent electronic resistivity conductivity it should also be extendable to multiphase problems via pseudo relative permeability functions in a steady state upscaling manner which is an ongoing process credit authorship contribution statement qinzhuo

5746,we propose an efficient analytical upscaling method to compute the equivalent conductivity tensor for elliptic equations in three dimensional space our approach uses perturbation expansion and fourier analysis and considers heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry of coarse gridblocks through low order approximation the derived analytical solution accurately approximates the central difference numerical solution with periodic boundary conditions numerical tests are performed to demonstrate the capability and efficiency of this analytical approach in upscaling fluid flow in heterogeneous formations we test the method in synthetic examples and benchmark cases with both gaussian random fields and channelized non gaussian fields in addition we examine the impact of each parameter on the upscaled conductivity and investigate the sensitivity of the variance and correlation lengths to the coefficients we also indicate how to extend this approach to multiphase flow problems keywords upscaling conductivity tensor equivalent conductivity heterogeneity anisotropy 1 introduction accurate and efficient modeling of flow and transport problems is fundamental for groundwater flow oil gas recovery and carbon sequestration numerical simulation of the associated physical processes can be challenging due to heterogeneity anisotropy and uncertainty of porous media parameters it can also be computationally prohibitive to directly simulate flow and transport problems based on fine scale parameters coarse scale models are therefore needed to reduce computational burden and development of an upscaling method that preserves solution accuracy constitutes a demanding task a significant number of upscaling techniques have been presented in the extant literature including various approaches e g extended local wen et al 2003 local global chen et al 2003 chen and durlofsky 2006 global holden and nielsen 2000 and covering many aspects e g single phase ababou et al 1989 indelman and dagan 1993 zhou et al 2010 multiphase jenny et al 2005 compositional li and durlofsky 2016 thermal reactive li et al 2016 dual porosity evazi and jessen 2014 and near well effects li et al 2014 detailed discussions can be found in review articles farmer 2002 noetinger et al 2005 sanchez vila et al 2006 dagan et al 2013 there are two different concepts effective conductivity which is an intrinsic property of the medium based on averaging over the ensemble of realizations and equivalent conductivity which varies under different flow conditions based on averaging in physical space renard and de marsily 1997 durlofsky 1991 sanchez vila et al 2006 numerous works were presented for estimating effective or equivalent conductivity e g self consistent approximation jankovic et al 2013 suribhatla et al 2011 these two concepts are also related the equivalent conductivity coincides with the effective conductivity when the averaging volume is very large compared to the integral scale as implied by ergodicity in this study we focus on the equivalent conductivity and upscaling techniques which integrate fine scale properties into a coarse scale equivalent the analytical methods can be straightforward e g simple averages including the arithmetic harmonic geometric and power average approaches wen and gómez hernández 1996 in particular the power average is attractive due to its simplicity the bounded range of power value between 1 and 1 and its applicability in both two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d spaces however the power value is case dependent and is a function of heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry i e block shape and size cardwell and parsons 1945 and le loc h 1987 demonstrated that the equivalent conductivity is bounded by the upper bound harmonic arithmetic mean and the lower bound arithmetic harmonic mean which can be used via averaging with a proper weight guerillot et al 1990 this approach was introduced to 3d and anisotropic media by lemouzy 1991 and duquerroix et al 1993 some researchers later presented empirical formulas to determine the weight value li et al 1999 renard et al 2000 maschio and schiozer 2003 however these approaches are not sufficiently general for heterogeneous reservoirs e g the axes of the covariance ellipse are not aligned with the cartesian coordinates and only account for diagonal terms without generating a full tensorial conductivity another similar idea is the so called renormalization technique and is based on successive computation with a hierarchical structure as a pyramid king 1989 it is extremely fast and is not limited to the domain size or the variance of block conductivities this technique was later extended to 3d and provides excellent results for isotropic fields shah and ottino 1986 mohanty and sharma 1990 wu et al 2013 however it was reported that the boundary conditions applied to the sub blocks can be unrealistic and may cause severe errors in the final estimation and may be inaccurate for non gaussian e g sand shale or checkerboard log conductivity field malick 1995 yeo and zimmerman 2001 in addition the standard renormalization tends to underestimate the conductivity renard and de marsily 1997 which could be improved by the modifications presented in gautier and noetinger 1997 due to strong heterogeneity and anisotropy the complexity of simple analytical treatment permits few precise analytical results for general cases and thus numerical simulations are required for many situations among various numerical algorithms the most popular one is probably the second order central finite difference scheme on a five point stencil for 2d and a seven point stencil for 3d problems with periodic boundary conditions durlofsky 1991 2005 the benefit of this algorithm is that it yields a conductivity permeability tensor which is proven to be always symmetric and positive definite moreover it can be quite accurate and robust even when periodic boundary conditions do not strictly apply pickup et al 1994 however to obtain an accurate equivalent conductivity permeability the coarse gridblock should be sufficiently refined and then solved to determine the flow pattern inside if a reservoir or field contains millions of coarse gridblocks which is currently quite common the fluid flow problem has to be solved millions of times i e one for each gridblock therefore the efficiency of solving the local upscaling problem is crucial in modern practice it would be desirable to estimate the equivalent conductivity permeability as accurately as the numerical method and as efficiently as the analytical method such as simple averaging romeu and noetinger 1995 developed analytical expressions to approximate numerical results with periodic boundary conditions for isotropic media following their framework liao et al 2019 presented the solution for anisotropic media in 2d space then combined it with the weighting average of upper and lower bounds and derived the solution for off diagonal terms in the conductivity tensor in this study we further extend the method to 3d space propose another algorithm using the power average and determine the power coefficient analytically in other words a simple way to predict the exponent value exists without resorting to numerical simulations we also adjust the formulas for the off diagonal components to ensure positive definiteness of the conductivity tensor in addition we perform sensitivity analysis for the input parameters on the coefficients and test the applicability of the proposed method in non gaussian random fields we also discuss possible extensions for upscaling relative permeability and capillary pressure in multiphase flow problems the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equation and some existing methods section 3 proposes the new analytical method section 4 demonstrates the feasibility of our method using synthetic examples and the realistic spe10 benchmark case christie and blunt 2001 section 5 verifies the proposed method under various conditions and provides discussions on the parameter sensitivity and extensions to multiphase flow finally section 6 summarizes and concludes this work 2 governing equation and methodology 2 1 governing equation in this study we consider the following elliptic equation which can be used in incompressible single phase fluid flow problems bear 1972 1 k x h x f x x ω c 1 h x c 2 h x n g x x ω where x x y z ω r 3 is a cuboid domain with boundary ω k is a symmetric positive definite tensor referred to as conductivity or permeability and h indicates the hydraulic head or pressure eq 1 is usually coupled with darcy s law as v k h called darcy velocity the equivalent conductivity for the coarse block is defined as renard and de marsily 1997 2 1 v ω v x d x k eq 1 v ω h x d x where v is the total volume here the fine scale conductivity is assumed to be diagonal and the upscaled conductivity is treated as a full tensor since the tensorial nature is partially a consequence of the anisotropic spatial correlation 3 k kx ky kz k eq kxx kxy kxz kyx kyy

cartesian coordinate system the new coordinate x y z is obtained by first rotating about the z axis by angle ψ then rotating about the y axis by angle φ and finally rotating about the x axis by angle θ note that the exponential covariance σ y 2 exp d and gaussian covariance σ y 2 exp d are two special cases of the matérn covariance when ν 1 2 and respectively in some anisotropic cases the properties of the fine gridblock e g conductivity or length may not be the same in different directions for example the vertical conductivity is usually less than the horizontal one and the shape of the fine scale gridblock of size δx δy δz can be a cuboid instead of a cube i e δ x δ y δ z we denote the anisotropy ratio of size for fine scale gridblock as a ly δ y δ x and a lz δ z δ x and the anisotropy ratio of conductivity as a ky k y k x and a kz k z k x which will be used in derivations in section 3 1 2 3 numerical methods the numerical method for local upscaling of conductivity can be

upscaling methods presented above assume gaussian random fields for the log conductivity but are not limited to any specific covariance function below we use matérn covariance including exponential and gaussian covariance and spherical covariance functions to illustrate this point 4 case studies 4 1 synthetic case exponential covariance the proposed analytical method is first tested in a synthetic case we consider that a 3d space contains 60 50 50 15 000 fine grid cells which is upscaled to 6 5 5 150 coarse gridblocks each consisting of 10 10 10 1 000 fine grid cells fig 1 a the boundary conditions are set to be constant heads h 1 at left and h 0 at right while no flow at the other four directions we assume that the random log conductivity field has a zero mean and follows an exponential covariance function with σ y 2 1 0 ηx 40 ηy 20 ηz 10 ψ 30 φ 20 and θ 10 the grid size is set to be cubic with isotropic property i e aky akz aly alz 1 fig 1a shows one scenario in fine scale randomly generated using the above statistical information fig 1b depicts the coarse scale result upscaled by the numerical method fig 1c illustrates the coarse scale result upscaled by the analytical method using upper and lower boundaries with the weight α hereafter referred to as the analytical α method fig 1d presents the coarse scale log conductivity upscaled by the analytical method using the power average with the coefficient ω hereafter referred to as the analytical ω method the fine scale conductivity field fig 1a is substituted in a numerical solver to compute the true fine scale hydraulic head for this realization fig 2 a which is then averaged to generate the coarse scale hydraulic head fig 2b the upscaled log conductivities fig 1b d are also substituted in a numerical solver to obtain the hydraulic heads fig 2c e and velocities we can see that there is no visible difference between the numerical results the analytical results and the true reference here we use the multipoint flux approximation mpfa algorithm aavatsmark 2002 in the matlab reservoir simulation toolbox mrst lie 2014 as the numerical solver to deal with the upscaled conductivity tensor fig 3 presents scatter diagrams for the hydraulic head and velocities for the hydraulic head both numerical and analytical results match the exact values quite well regarding velocity the x velocity has a better match than the y and z velocity since the main flow direction is along the x axis we can see that the patterns are fairly similar between the first row and the second third row to further compare the numerical results and the analytical results we plot the scatter diagrams for these two results as in fig 4 it is seen that the analytical method is able to reproduce the numerical results accurately to test the capability of the proposed methods for the cases in which the correlation lengths are smaller than the size of the coarse gridblock we consider another example by setting the correlation lengths to be ηx 6 ηy 4 ηz 2 as illustrated in fig 5 we can see that the variation of fine scale conductivity in each coarse block increases compared to the previous example however the variation of the equivalent conductivity for all coarse blocks decreases thus the simulated hydraulic head and velocity have smaller variance fig 6 in general the analytical methods still generate good results compared to the numerical results 4 2 spe10 upper layers spherical covariance we then test the proposed method in an spe 10 comparative project christie and blunt 2001 which is widely employed for reservoir upscaling the fine scale geological model is described on a regular cartesian grid with a domain size of 1 200 2 200 170 l it has 60 220 85 cells and each size is 20 10 2 l the top 35 layers exhibit gaussianity in log permeability data whereas the bottom 50 layers are clearly channelized in this example we select the top 35 layers since the type of covariance function is not known we performed variogram analysis and found that the spherical covariance provides the best fit with the parameters as σ y 2 5 0 ηx 600 ηy 600 and ηz 10 as no obvious rotation is observed we assume ψ φ θ 0 from the log permeability data in the x y and z directions as well as the size of the grid block we set aky 1 akz 0 3 aly 0 5 and alz 0 1 we set four wells two injectors at constant head h 1 and two producers at constant head h 0 as a quarter of a five spot pattern in the four corners connected to all layers using an upscaling ratio of 5 5 5 the fine scale model is upscaled to 12 44 7 coarse gridblocks the log permeability field is presented in fig 7 with a very large variance it appears that a discrepancy exists between the fine scale model in fig 7a and the upscaled results in fig 7b d this is because fig 7a only illustrates the top layer of the fine scale model if we observe the top five layers since we set the upscaling ratio to be 5 5 5 as in fig 8 we see that the log permeability values in layers 3 5 are greater than those in layers 1 2 for y 50 which is consistent with the upscaled results in fig 7b d figs 8 11 show the hydraulic head and velocity it can be seen that the numerical results and analytical results have negligible differences both of which are close to the true values from the fine scale simulations for the numerical method the cpu time of computing the equivalent permeabilities in all coarse gridblocks i e upscaling step is 15 6 s for the analytical method the cpu time for the analytical α and analytical ω methods are 0 52 s and 0 32 s respectively and the time for computing the coefficients α and ω is 0 11 s it can be seen that the time for computing the coefficients is just a small portion of the analytical method since the coefficients need to be computed only once actually as the number of coarse blocks increases the time for computing the coefficients can be negligible compared to the total time in the analytical method the tests are programmed by matlab on a desktop pc with i7 6700k cpu 4 00 ghz in this example the analytical method is 20 40 times more efficient than the numerical one although the multiple summations in eqs 46 and 51 appear to be complex they are actually easy to compute and just need to be computed once for all coarse grids 4 3 spe10 bottom layers non gaussian field in the above examples we can see that the proposed method works quite well for gaussian random fields in this section we will test it in non gaussian fields albeit the analytical derivation is based on the gaussian assumption we consider the bottom 50 layers in the spe 10 comparative project with the same model setup as above specifically the 60 220 50 fine cells are upscaled to 12 44 10 coarse grids with an upscaling ratio of 5 5 5 the log permeability field is channelized and clearly non gaussian fig 12 a precisely the mean and covariance function are not sufficient to describe this random field and multipoint statistics are required instead of two point statistics nevertheless we use the same parameters for the gaussian field as in section 4 2 just to see the performance in the non gaussian field figs 12 15 show the results of log permeability hydraulic head and velocity in general it can be seen that the velocity is more difficult to match than the log permeability and hydraulic head even the numerical method may have nontrivial error for the z velocity as shown in fig 14 indicating that a more advanced method e g non local upscaling is required in addition the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method actually the analytical α method and the numerical method generate almost identical results as can be seen from the first row of fig 15 the reasons behind this will be discussed in sections 5 3 and 5 4 the cpu time for the numerical upscaling is 21 9 s and the times for the analytical α and analytical ω methods are 0 73 s and 0 48 s respectively in the case of non gaussian field the analytical method is also 20 40 times faster than the numerical method 5 discussion 5 1 verification under various conditions in this section we compare upscaled coarse block conductivities from the proposed methods and the numerical method under various conditions including heterogeneity anisotropy and geometry table 1 we use the matérn covariance function with a variance of 1 0 the effect of variance will be tested in section 5 3 we set up a base case change the parameters one at a time and investigate 15 cases in total for example the parameter v varies between 0 01 and 10 in case 1 the correlation lengths ηx is from 1 to 100 in case 2 fig 16 shows 10 000 random scenarios of the upscaled kxx in case 2 considering the numerical results as reference in general the mismatch between the analytical methods and numerical method becomes smaller with a larger correlation lengths as the variation of conductivity in each coarse block reduces we then use a relative root mean square error to analyze the performance quantitatively for cases 1 15 as in fig 17 it can be seen that the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method which is consistent with previous observations fig 17a shows the effect of coefficient v in matérn covariance function as v increases the integral scale increases thus it is easier to upscale the fine scale model the largest error occurs in case 12 when nx becomes very large fig 17l there are two reasons first a larger nx leads to increased variation in a coarse block with fixed correlation lengths secondly a larger nx results in an anisotropic ratio farther away from unity in geometry with fixed ny and nz both effects make it more challenging for upscaling to distinguish the individual effects we consider case 15 fig 17o where nx ny and nz change simultaneously we can see that the error is clearly reduced compared to case 12 indicating the effect of geometric anisotropy is more significant than the effect of variability in a coarse block in this example actually setting very different lengths for different directions in a coarse block is not suggested in upscaling fig 18 illustrate the results computed from the mean of 10 000 random scenarios it is seen that the analytical results match the numerical results very well and thus can be used to investigate the effect of each parameter conveniently 5 2 effect of upscaling ratio an important practical problem in upscaling is the determination of the optimal upscaling ratio which is related to the balance between accuracy and efficiency boschan and noetinger 2012 preux 2016 preux et al 2016 in this context we study the accuracy of the head and velocity computed from the equivalent conductivity and their dependence on the coarsening scale first we focus on lognormal stationary isotropic media we consider a fine scale model of 32 32 32 grids subject to the exponential covariance function with a variance of 1 0 and the correlation lengths ηx ηy ηz 4 0 for log conductivity four upscaling ratios 2 4 8 and 16 for all directions are tested then we test another two anisotropic cases ηx 32 ηy ηz 4 0 and ηx ηy 32 ηz 4 0 the results are illustrated in fig 19 we can see that as the upscaling ratio grows the head error increases whereas the x velocity error first increases and then decreases this is because the boundary condition is constant heads at left right while no flow at other bounds which is different from the periodic boundary in upscaling algorithms if we use the periodic boundary condition for the whole physical space the head error will behave similar to the x velocity error the maximum error for x velocity occurs when the upscaling ratio is close to the integral scale the explanation is if the upscaling ratio is very small it is similar to solving the fine scale model or if the upscaling ratio is very large it is similar to considering the whole physical space as one coarse block and the error in both cases will be relatively small we can also see that the effect of the upscaling ratio is related to the geostatistics e g correlation structure in general the analytical methods can assist in investigating the effect of upscaling ratio as they generate almost the same results as the numerical method does 5 3 effect of large variance large variance always constitutes an important and challenging problem here we compute various including arithmetic harmonic upper and lower bounds and equivalent coarse scale conductivity normalized by the geometric mean from 10 10 10 fine grids both analytically and numerically the log conductivity field is assumed to be isotropic and gaussian distributed with zero mean and exponential covariance fig 20 shows that the arithmetic means from the analytical method and the numerical method are overlapped this is because although the derivation of the analytical method adopts low order approximation it is exact for the arithmetic mean the harmonic mean using the analytical method mismatches that using the numerical method when the variance is greater than three and similar phenomena are observed for the upper and lower bounds due to the low order approximation the equivalent conductivity using the analytical α method matches that using the numerical method very well however the analytical ω method starts to deviate when the variance is greater than one these can be explained by the effect of the variance on coefficients α and ω fig 21 specifically the real ω from the numerical method increases along with the variance and hence the analytical ω method is no longer accurate for large variance on the other hand the real α does not change much as the variance increases indicating that the ratio between kxmax kxeq and kxeq kxmin is not sensitive to the variance therefore the analytical α method using low order approximation is still quite accurate for large variance in general the analytical α method is more accurate than the analytical ω method as can be seen in the previous examples in sections 4 2 and 4 3 5 4 effect of correlation lengths it is noted that the statistics of the log conductivity field are required to compute the coefficients in the proposed method usually this is not a problem since the statistics are obtained before the scenarios realizations are randomly generated nevertheless in some cases the statistics might be difficult to obtain accurately due to limited information under these circumstances it would be better if the coefficients α and ω are not sensitive to the heterogeneity parameters e g correlation lengths this problem can be analyzed by setting an isotropic field initially and then changing one of the correlation lengths in the x y and z directions at a time figs 22 and 23 show the effect of correlation lengths normalized by the size of the coarse grid block on coefficient α specifically we set the ratio between 1 8 and 8 for each direction we can see that the coefficient α increases as the correlation length of the corresponding direction increases this is because in a certain direction as the correlation length grows the equivalent conductivity keq is closer to the upper limit kmax and farther away from the lower limit kmin consequently the coefficient α increases and meanwhile the coefficient α decreases in the other two directions considering that the physical range of α is from 0 to 1 we can see that α is not very sensitive to the correlation lengths with a relatively small range between 0 3 and 0 6 for a large variation of ratio between 1 8 and 8 we note that this does not mean that α is a constant in all cases actually α varies significantly if the coarse block shape and size change however these parameters can be determined easily during the discretization step in sum the low volatility of α makes this approach relatively stable even when the heterogeneity is not known exactly figs 24 and 25 show the effect of correlation lengths on coefficient ω one can see that the coefficient ω also increases as the correlation length of the corresponding direction increases considering that the physical range of ω is from 1 to 1 it can be seen that ω is more sensitive to the correlation lengths than α this partially explains the reason why the analytical α method performs better than the analytical ω method in general and particularly in the non gaussian model in which multi point statistics are required 5 5 relation to some previous results we may derive the formula for k x med 1 in equation 16 similar to k x max and k x min as in eqs 42 45 54 k x med 1 μ a y μ h x μ a z κ 1 β 1 n x n y i 1 n x j 1 n y β i j 2 1 n y j 1 n y β j 2 β i j 1 n z k 1 n z β i j k β j 1 n y i 1 n x k 1

coarse block geometry heterogeneity and anisotropy 5 6 extension to two phase problems in oil and gas recovery as well as geological carbon sequestration two or more fluid phases may be present it is therefore important that the analytical method can be extended to two phase flow problems steady state methods serve as convenient approaches for upscaling relative permeabilities and capillary pressures in viscous or capillary limit which are used as approximations to make the computation of pseudo functions easier and faster than that using dynamic methods in the capillary dominated state when the flow rate is very low the phase saturation is determined by the constant capillary force whereas in the viscous dominated state with high flow rates the phase saturation is determined by the constant fractional flow in both cases the fine scale relative permeability can be obtained from the saturation and used to compute the coarse scale relative permeability in some cases neither capillary nor viscous dominated assumptions are valid and the upscaled parameters vary between those limits a simple idea to calculate the relative permeabilities based on interpolation between the capillary and viscous limits has been reported in kumar et al 1997 later virnovsky et al 2004 presented a more general model for computing rate dependent parameters by solving the two phase flow with periodic boundary conditions similar to the above approaches we can use the proposed analytical method to compute the upscaled relative permeabilities and capillary forces which is currently being developed by the authors actually we can produce relative permeability tensors as tensor functions of the fluid saturation which will depend on the ratio of viscous capillary forces 6 conclusions in this work we introduce an analytical upscaling approach to obtain the equivalent conductivity tensor for elliptic equations in three dimensional 3d anisotropic heterogeneous porous media using perturbation theory and fourier analysis this method accurately reproduces the results from the finite difference numerical method with periodic boundary conditions the derivations are similar to those reported in romeu and noetinger 1995 who presented an analytical method for isotropic media and liao et al 2019 who recently extended it to a 2d anisotropic field here we further extend the method to 3d space and propose another algorithm using the power average and determine the power coefficient analytically we also update the formulas for the off diagonal components to ensure positive definiteness of the conductivity tensor and discuss applicability in non gaussian fields and multiphase flow problems we test the proposed method in three examples considering not only the constant head impervious boundary condition but also a quarter of a five spot pattern we compared the analytical methods and the numerical method for quantification of tensorial conductivity hydraulic head and velocity in coarse gridblocks using a weighted average of the upper and lower bounds the analytical α method and the numerical method are in good agreement in all cases it replicated the results from the numerical method successfully even with a large variance and in the case of non gaussian random field on the other hand using a power average the analytical ω method is less accurate and suggested to be applied to gaussian random fields with moderate variance we verified the proposed method in various heterogeneous anisotropic cases we also analyzed the dependence of the coefficients α and ω on the variance and correlation lengths and found that α is not very sensitive to these factors as a benefit the computing resources become much more powerful nowadays than a few decades ago nevertheless efficient upscaling is still very important for large scale problems especially with multiple realizations e g in sensitivity analysis or optimization in various tests the analytical method is found to be as accurate as the numerical method and 10 100 times faster than the numerical method hence can be used as an efficient substitute for the numerical method the proposed method is valid for general heterogeneous elliptic equations including not only fluid flow in porous media but also some other physical problems e g estimation of equivalent electronic resistivity conductivity it should also be extendable to multiphase problems via pseudo relative permeability functions in a steady state upscaling manner which is an ongoing process credit authorship contribution statement qinzhuo

5747,tropical cyclones are extreme perturbations that can affect the biogeochemical cycles in tropical and temperate coastal ecosystems yet whether typhoon events would affect the magnitude of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from shallow aquaculture ponds in the subtropical coastal regions is still poorly understood in this study we estimated and compared the diffusive fluxes of co2 ch4 and n2o in the mariculture ponds at a subtropical estuary in southeast china before during and after the passage of three typhoons our results indicate that the average diffusive co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes during typhoon passage were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed during both the pre typhoon and post typhoon periods we estimated conservatively that the estuarine aquaculture ponds emitted ghgs at a rate of about 3145 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 into the atmosphere during the passage of typhoons which was substantially higher than the average emission rates of 30 8 and 35 2 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 observed during the pre and post typhoon periods respectively our findings demonstrated that the typhoon passage period can be a hot moment of ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds in the subtropical estuaries and highlight the importance of capturing short term disturbance events such as typhoons to accurately assess the annual ghg balance and hence the climatic impacts on these shallow water ecosystems keywords tropical cyclones greenhouse gas agricultural ecosystem aquaculture ponds subtropical estuary china 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are three important greenhouse gases ghgs and together contribute a large share of the global radiative forcing mosier 1998 a better understanding of the magnitude and controls of ghg emissions from different ecosystems is needed to address climate change and their impacts tong et al 2010 aquatic ecosystems are being increasingly recognized as important sources of ghgs bastviken et al 2011 holgerson and raymond 2016 raymond et al 2013 previous studies estimated that inland freshwater systems could emit ghgs in the order of 3 9 pg c yr 1 which is similar in magnitude to the terrestrial carbon sink drake et al 2018 however obtaining an accurate estimate of regional and global ghg budgets remains a challenge owing to the limited amount of in situ measurements addressing the large uncertainty of aquatic ghg emission estimates there can be great variability between water bodies and aquaculture ponds have recently been suggested as key hotspots of ghg emissions grinham et al 2018 holgerson and raymond 2016 yang et al 2017 there is also a high degree of uncertainty associated with variability in time and regarding the magnitude and controlling processes of ghg fluxes in aquatic ecosystems one potentially important aspect of the temporal variability of aquatic ghg fluxes regards extreme weather events such as storms heat waves and droughts tropical cyclones which are often called typhoons in the northwest pacific and hurricanes on the eastern side of the dateline occur frequently in the summer and greatly affect coastal wetlands and the adjacent marine zones lévy et al 2012 wang et al 2016 tropical cyclones induce large currents that can heavily disturb various biogeochemical processes including the production and emission of ghgs crosswell et al 2014 paerl et al 2001 wang et al 2016 in recent decades some studies quantified the effect of tropical cyclones on co2 fluxes in marine ecosystems it has been suggested that the passage of tropical cyclones causes large efflux of co2 from the ocean to the atmosphere bates 2007 crosswell et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 perrie 2004 sun et al 2014 yet the majority of these studies of typhoon impacts were conducted using satellite remote sensing data with few in situ observations being made in inland water bodies hence the effects of typhoon passage on co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes from potential ghg emission hotspots such as aquaculture ponds and other shallow aquatic environments remain largely unknown aquaculture ponds form an important component of global shallow water ecosystems fao 2016 the global total area of freshwater and brackish aquaculture ponds is approximately 110 832 km2 and approximately 90 of the world s aquaculture production occur in the asia pacific region verdegem and bosma 2009 china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds by country approximately 25 700 km2 23 of the global total with many of them being located along subtropical coasts where typhoons are common chen et al 2017 ye et al 2017 yang et al 2018 in this study we estimated the effects of typhoon events on diffusive ghg fluxes from the subtropical coastal aquaculture ponds in the min river estuary in southeastern china from concentrations of dissolved ghgs co2 ch4 and n2o before during and after the passage of three typhoons typhoons nesat haitang and hato and modelled gas transfer velocities 2 materials and

vegetation types in this wetland are the native cyperus malaccensis and phragmites australis and the invasive spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass a semidiurnal tide dominates this area with a large

estuarine zones yang et al 2017 2018 2 2 sampling strategy the min river estuary is typically struck by multiple typhoons every year in 2017 three significant typhoon events occurred including the typhoons nesat haitang and hato fig 1 typhoons nesat and haitang occurred within a very short time interval and were treated as one combined event in this study typhoon nesat first formed in the sea near palau on july 21 2017 fig 1 reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 40 m s 1 category 2 and landed at ilan in northeastern taiwan at approximately 1940 utc on july 29 it continued crossing the main island and taiwan strait and landed again on the fuqing coast of fujian in china at approximately 0600 utc on july 30 with a maximum wind speed of 33 m s 1 after nesat passed over the fuqing

coast at approximately 0250 utc on july 31 based on the temporal evolution of wind speed five sampling campaigns were conducted on the following dates july 28 representing the pre typhoon period

philippines sea at 1700 utc on august 20 2017 and reached zhuhai city in guangdong province in china at approximately 1250 utc on august 23 with a minimum central pressure of 950 hpa and a maximum wind speed of 45 m s 1 according to the temporal evolution of typhoon hato five sampling campaigns were conducted on the following dates august 20 pre typhoon august 22 and 23 typhoon passage and august 24 and 26 post typhoon 2 3 collection and analysis of water samples we collected water samples from three commercial shrimp ponds in the shanyutan wetland fig 1 during each campaign water from three replicate locations in each pond were sampled for measurement of chemical properties surface water samples were collected at a depth of 10 cm using a 5 l niskin water sampler and transferred into 250 ml polyethylene bottles approximately 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to each bottle to inhibit microbial activities taipale and sonninen 2009 zhang et al 2013 the water samples

japan after filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter biotrans nylon membranes the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was measured using a flow injection analyzer skalar analytical san the netherlands the detection limits for toc and tdn were 4 and 3 μg l 1 respectively the relative standard deviations of toc and tdn analyses were 1 0 and 2 0 respectively 2 4 ghg concentrations and fluxes at each sampling location dissolved ghg co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations in the surface water 10 cm depth were measured following the headspace equilibration method described by yu et al 2013 2017 the water samples were collected using a niskin water sampler and transferred into a 55 ml gas tight glass serum bottle the bottles were flushed with the collected water thoroughly for two to three times before being completely filled with samples about 0 2 ml of saturated mercuric chloride was added to each bottle to inhibit microbial activities the glass bottles were then quickly sealed with an open topped screw cap equipped with a halobutyl rubber septum to exclude any air bubbles all the water samples were stored in an ice packed cooler transported back to the laboratory and analyzed within two days in the laboratory 25 ml of ultra high purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the glass bottle to create a 25 ml headspace the n2 gas entered the bottle via a syringe inserted in the rubber stopper and 25 ml of water was removed from the bottle via a second syringe inserted in the stopper xiao et al 2017 the samples were then shaken vigorously for 0 5 h to achieve an equilibrium between the air and water phases cotovicz et al 2016 the concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o in the headspace air were determined with a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector a methanizer and an electron capture detector the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were then calculated taking into account the volume of water and headspace air in the vial and the gas solubility coefficients as a function of temperature and salinity wanninkhof 1992 because direct measurements of gas fluxes by flux chambers were not possible during the strong typhoon winds the diffusive gas fluxes across the water air interface were calculated based on the fick s law of diffusion equation 1 blees et al 2015 musenze et al

passage 2 5 measurement of meteorological variables and water physicochemical properties meteorological variables including air temperature atmospheric pressure a p wind speed and precipitation were measured by the automatic weather station at the min river estuary ecological station in the shanyutan wetland the precision for air temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed and precipitation were

significant differences in mean physicochemical variables dissolved gas concentrations and gas fluxes between the three periods i e pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon were tested using one way analysis of variance anova spearman correlation coefficients was conducted to estimate the relationships between 1 the different environmental variables and 2 dissolved ghgs concentrations or diffusive ghgs fluxes and various environmental variables principal component analysis pca was also performed to analyze relationships between the diffusive greenhouse gas fluxes and observed environmental parameters statistical results were considered significant at p 0 05 the results were presented as mean 1 standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of typhoon events on environmental variables fig s1 fig s2 and fig 2 show the environmental variables before during and after the passage of typhoons nesat haitang and hato the relationships between the different environmental variables are also shown in table s1 significantly lower mean a p w t and ph were observed during typhoon passage as compared to both the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 previous studies have shown that typhoons could exert a considerable influence on marine ecosystems through a decrease in surface water temperature bond et al 2011 sun et al 2014 and an increase in water acidity arising from the upwelling of low ph water from the deep ocean wada et al 2011 in the studied shrimp ponds the decrease in ph was likely associated with the typhoon associated acidic precipitation ph as low as about 4 0 cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 contributing large volumes of rain water having low ph previous studies in the oceans observed a positive influence of typhoons on do concentrations attributed to a decrease in water temperature and a corresponding increase in oxygen solubility lin et al 2014 in contrast the do concentrations in the aquaculture ponds were significantly lower during typhoon passage range from 6 2 to 7 4 mg l 1 than both the pre typhoon range from 10 2 to 11 0 mg l 1 and post typhoon range from 8 7 to 9 3 mg l 1 periods p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 this might be caused by an upwelling of oxygen poor water from deep water layers or sediments and algal photosynthesis is hampered by the cloud cover and low light level during the occurrence of typhoons zheng and wang 2007 the tdn concentrations in the aquaculture ponds before during and after the typhoons varied over ranges of 0 6 1 4 0 4 1 1 and 0 4 1 3 mg l 1 fig 2 respectively the toc concentrations in the ponds during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods also varied 2 fold across ranges of 13 3 29 5 12 2 19 9 and 12 5 23 8 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 the effects of typhoon on tdn and toc were inconsistent with a reduction in tdn observed during typhoon nesat and haitang but not by hato while the opposite pattern was observed for toc fig 2 and fig s2 possible typhoon effects could include dilution due to heavy rainfall associated with the typhoon events fig s1c and s1f wang et al 2016 the precipitation not only dramatically increased water depth in the aquaculture ponds but also increased inflow of soil and water pushed into the ponds by rain falling on surrounding land ultimately causing a dilution effect for many of the pond s biological and chemical parameters holgerson 2015 also observed that precipitation events could affect many physiochemical and biological parameters e g dissolved organic carbon chlorophyll a total dissolved phosphorus tdn in pond water through dilution however the inconsistent patterns for tdn and toc indicates a more complex regulations of these levels during the studied typhoons fig 2 3 2 effects of typhoon events on dissolved ghg concentrations the dissolved ghg concentrations in the water column varied substantially over the course of the typhoon events with significantly higher levels observed during typhoon passage than during the post and pre typhoon periods fig 3 across all the typhoon events examined the mean dissolved co2 concentrations in the pond water were 97 6 3 6 156 6 7 4 and 113 4 9 6 µmol l 1 during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods respectively fig 3a and 3b the mean dissolved ch4 concentrations in the ponds before during and after the typhoon were 1 6 0 2 2 7 0 2 and 2 4 0 2 µmol l 1 respectively fig 3e and 3f the mean dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations in the shrimp ponds during typhoon passage were significantly higher than those during the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 table s3 we also found that the mean dissolved n2o concentration in the pond water was significantly lower during the pre typhoon period 4 8 0 1 nmol l 1 than during both the typhoon passage 5 9 0 3 nmol l 1 and the post typhoon periods 6 1 0 4 nmol l 1 p 0 01 table s3 fig 4 i and j generally the co2 concentration in aquaculture ponds is governed by the balance between the photosynthesis and the respiration algal photosynthesis plays an important role in co2 uptake in the presence of sufficient solar radiation kuzyakov and gavrichkova 2010 during typhoon passage the extensive cloud cover would considerably reduce sunlight penetration which could in turn hamper algal photosynthesis and reduce co2 uptake the increase in dissolved co2 levels might also be attributed to enhanced release of co2 rich sediment pore water into the water column by wind induced turbulence or an increase in co2 supply from soil water and groundwater induced by precipitation the enhanced co2 concentrations during typhoon events could also partly be linked to the reduction in ph and its associated effects on the carbonate equilibrium the ch4 concentration in the water represents a balance between production oxidation and efflux rates ch4 is mainly generated by the decomposition of organic matter in sediments under anaerobic conditions hu et al 2018 the dissolved ch4 concentrations are typically lower in the water column than those in the sediment pore water because a considerable part of the ch4 is oxidized to co2 by bacteria in the surface millimeters of the sediments or the water column before reaching the surface bastviken et al 2008 the efficiency of ch4 oxidation depends on the duration of ch4 transport through the layer where ch4 oxidation happen i e where both the ch4 substrate and oxygen or other suitable electron acceptors e g no3 fe3 and so4 2 are readily available typhoon passages induce extensive turbulent mixing which may result in rapid ch4 transfer from the sediments to the surface water and subsequently a reduction in time available for ch4 oxidation to occur the large amount of precipitation during typhoon events could also help flush the potentially anoxic and ch4 rich soil water and groundwater into the ponds moreover as a typhoon approaches the decrease in atmospheric pressure and increase in wind speed could trigger ch4 ebullition from sediments which would lead to elevated ch4 concentrations in the pond water as some of the ch4 in the bubbles will dissolve into the water upon the passage mcginnis et al 2006 similarly the sediment pore water soil water and groundwater could be important stores and contributors of co2 and n2o too typhoon induced turbulence of air and water could therefore also promote the release of co2 and n2o from the sediments to the overlying water which was supported by the observed reduction in do during typhoon passage fig 2 and fig s2 the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations in the ponds showed a significantly negative relationship with water do concentrations r 2 0 31 0 21 and 0 34 p 0 01 table s4 respectively which further supports the above hypothesis similar relationship between the do and dissolved ghgs concentrations was also found in river studies hu et al 2018 3 3 effects of typhoon events on gas transfer velocity fig 4 shows the gas transfer velocities k before during and after the passage of typhoons nesat haitang and hato estimated from the four used models based on the formula described by liss and merlivat 1986 the mean k for co2 during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods were 0 29 0 02 22 5 0 5 and 0 30 0 01 cm h 1 respectively while the mean k for n2o during the three periods were 0 34 0 03 28 1 1 2 and 0 41 0 01 respectively overall the mean kx in the shrimp ponds during typhoon passage was significantly higher than that in both the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 although the estimated k values varied among different models they consistently reached the highest value during the typhoon passage period across all the models examined fig 4 we only report the k values for the four models and do not derive the ghg flux estimates from all different k models because the fluxes would simply vary linearly as a function of k according to equation 1 the ghg flux estimates reported below were estimated from the liss and merlivat 1986 k model considering typhooe range wind speeds and yielding the second lowest k values compared to the other models fig 4 none of the models fully considers the influence of rain forcing nor the interactions between rain and wind on k the results of a rain and gas exchange experiment conducted at the biosphere 2 center demonstrated that rain induced turbulence can substantially influence the air sea gas transfer velocity zappa et al 2009 developing k models that take into account the influence of wind and rain can further improve the accuracy of k estimates for assessing typhoon induced effects on aquatic ghg emissions hence it is possible that the k values derived from the models and thereby the ghg fluxes are underestimated 3 4 effects of typhoon events on ghg fluxes across the water air interface across all the typhoon events the mean co2 fluxes in the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods were 0 3 0 1 32 3 1 7 and 0 3 0 1 mmol m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3c and 3d while the mean diffusive ch4 fluxes during these three periods were 4 3 0 5 571 51 and 6 3 0 4 µmol m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3e and 3f over the study period the mean of co2 or ch4 emission fluxes in the typhoon passage period were 11535 or 13279 and 9500 or 9063 greater than those the pre typhoon and post typhoon periods respectively thus the average fluxes of co2 and ch4 during typhoon passage were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 fig 3 similar patterns of co2 fluxes have been observed in some marine ecosystems bates et al 1998 bates 2007 crosswell et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 perrie 2004 sun et al 2014 ye et al 2017 which were attributed to an increase in gas transfer velocity and thus co2 efflux in response to the high winds during typhoon passage bates et al 1998 nemoto et al 2009 in this study the wind induced increase in gas transfer velocity accounted for most of the increase in co2 and ch4 fluxes during typhoon passage approximately 50 fold fig 4 while the typhoon induced enhancement of dissolved ghg concentrations in pond water accounted for another two fold increase in gas fluxes fig 3 the dissolved ghg concentrations in surface water would vary depending on the balance between gas inputs and outputs since the co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water were largely unchanged during the typhoon event this implied that the significant increase in ghg emissions from the ponds into the atmosphere was likely supported by a corresponding increase in the supply of ghgs from the sediments and groundwater the mean n2o flux in the aquaculture ponds was significantly higher during typhoon passage 0 3 0 1 µmol m 2 h 1 while a net uptake 0 004 0 001 µmol m 2 h 1 and a small net release 0 002 0 001 µmol m 2 h 1 were observed during the pre and post typhoon periods respectively p 0 01 fig 3j if the sediment pore water has a large store of n2o this could support n2o release into the water column under turbulent conditions similar to the case of co2 and ch4 as described previously since n2o is predominantly produced under a highly dynamic environment with frequent fluctuations between oxic and anoxic conditions the increased n2o fluxes observed during typhoon passage might also partly be caused by turbulence induced disturbance of sediment redox potential resulting in higher n2o production in contrast low turbulence and less input of potentially o2 rich water through rain wind mixing during the pre and post typhoon periods can cause a lower sediment redox potential ultimately resulting in a large amount of n2o is reduced to n2 and the subsequent n2o emission decreases obviously overall typhoon passage can lead to great changes in hydrology nutrient cycling characteristics sediment water physicochemical properties fig 2 and overall ecosystem function which could substantially influence greenhouse gases emissions fig 2 spearman correlation analysis table s5 and pca analysis fig 5 was also performed to screen the most influential environmental factors for ghgs emissions from the mariculture shrimp ponds during typhoons nesat haitang and hato spearman correlation analysis showed that the changes in ghgs emissions was significantly positively related to wind speed p 0 01 table s5 and negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure water temperature ph value and do p 0 01 table s5 our pca results suggested that the first two principal components pc i and pc ii explained 60 2 97 1 and 1 7 33 9 respectively of the total variability fig 5 ghgs fluxes and wind speed displayed positive pc i loading while other environmental variables showed negative pc ii loading fig 5 3 5 implications by using sustained flux global warming potential sgwp for gas emissions models over a 100 year period neubauer and megonigal 2015 tangen et al 2016 the effect of typhoons on ghg fluxes in the subtropical estuarine aquaculture ponds was quantified in this study table 1 the mean co2 eq flux in the min river estuary mariculture ponds studied during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods was estimated to 15 2 1922 9 and 19 4 mg co2 eq m2 h 1 respectively with co2 ch4 and n2o comprising 77 8 21 9 and 0 3 of the total co2 eq emissions respectively table 1 this means that the flux during one typhoon day corresponded to approximately 100 days of non typhoon flux and that two typhoon passage days could cause a flux similar to half a year of diffusive ghg flux under non typhoon conditions in addition such hot moment emissions of trace gases could influence other atmospheric processes than the greenhouse gas effect e g ozone depletion by n2o regarding co2 eq emissions from the aquaculture ponds during the typhoon passage the magnitude observed in our ponds were substantially higher than the average of 310 lakes 843 6 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 and 153 reservoirs 1009 9 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 in china summarized by li et al 2018 the mean co2 eq emissions from the mariculture ponds during the typhoon passage was approximately 3 1 times higher than the average of 627 1 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 found in global reservoirs deemer et al 2016 this means that ghg emissions during the period of typhoon passage should not be ignored when assessing the carbon and ghg budgets in mariculture ponds or other aquatic environments 3 6 limitation and future outlook as in most studies there are limitations in the current study the ghg fluxes reported here represent estimates affected by uncertainties in the k models owing to the logistical difficulty and danger of field sampling during ongoing typhoons the limited number of measurement periods and locations given the above the flux values should be interpreted with care nevertheless consistent results were obtained during two independent typhoon events and the result that typhoon events can increase diffusive fluxes 10 to 100 fold orders of magnitude seems clear regardless of which k model was used due to the difficulty of sampling ghgs flux measurements were conducted in only one estuary across a limited period future work with increasing sampling frequency in multiple estuaries will further increase our understanding of the effect of typhoon on biogeochemical cycle in this kind of ecosystem tdn and toc were analyzed in the current study while other chemical and biological variables for example total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc and n species n nh4 n no3 don can also influence the carbon and nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystem e g chung et al 2012 pan et al 2017 tsuchiya et al 2014 typhoons also transport n rich air e g n nh4 n no3 from other areas depositing it as rain on the ponds therefore more physiochemical and biological variables merit attention in the future studies it is worth to note that ch4 ebullition could not be in the present study because of measurement challenges during the typhoon previous studies have suggested that ch4 ebullition is significant in shallow and nutrient rich ponds and lakes holgerson 2015 natchimuthu et al 2014 some studies also showed that ebullition events coincided with low air pressure mattson and likens 1990 natchimuthu et al 2014 it is therefore likely that typhoons also trigger substantial ebullition therefore it is important to advance the measurement technologies to allow quantification of ebullition during the period of typhoon passage in coastal aquatic environments 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that three to four single typhoon days doubled the magnitude of annual diffusive ghg fluxes and co2 eq emissions from the subtropical aquaculture ponds in order to project the effects of global climate change on the biogeochemical dynamics and carbon storage capacity of coastal ecosystems it is imperative that the effects of tropical cyclones on ghg fluxes are accurately quantified various climate models have predicted that tropical cyclones will become more intense as the climate warms in the future although the total number of tropical cyclones may decrease our results implied that such changes in the frequency and intensity of typhoons could have considerable impacts on ghg emissions future studies should be conducted to cover a range of typhoon tracks frequencies and intensities along with improved spatial and temporal coverage of ghg flux measurements in typhoon impacted areas to improve our knowledge of the influence of extreme weather events on the global ghg

5747,tropical cyclones are extreme perturbations that can affect the biogeochemical cycles in tropical and temperate coastal ecosystems yet whether typhoon events would affect the magnitude of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from shallow aquaculture ponds in the subtropical coastal regions is still poorly understood in this study we estimated and compared the diffusive fluxes of co2 ch4 and n2o in the mariculture ponds at a subtropical estuary in southeast china before during and after the passage of three typhoons our results indicate that the average diffusive co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes during typhoon passage were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed during both the pre typhoon and post typhoon periods we estimated conservatively that the estuarine aquaculture ponds emitted ghgs at a rate of about 3145 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 into the atmosphere during the passage of typhoons which was substantially higher than the average emission rates of 30 8 and 35 2 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 observed during the pre and post typhoon periods respectively our findings demonstrated that the typhoon passage period can be a hot moment of ghg emissions from aquaculture ponds in the subtropical estuaries and highlight the importance of capturing short term disturbance events such as typhoons to accurately assess the annual ghg balance and hence the climatic impacts on these shallow water ecosystems keywords tropical cyclones greenhouse gas agricultural ecosystem aquaculture ponds subtropical estuary china 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o are three important greenhouse gases ghgs and together contribute a large share of the global radiative forcing mosier 1998 a better understanding of the magnitude and controls of ghg emissions from different ecosystems is needed to address climate change and their impacts tong et al 2010 aquatic ecosystems are being increasingly recognized as important sources of ghgs bastviken et al 2011 holgerson and raymond 2016 raymond et al 2013 previous studies estimated that inland freshwater systems could emit ghgs in the order of 3 9 pg c yr 1 which is similar in magnitude to the terrestrial carbon sink drake et al 2018 however obtaining an accurate estimate of regional and global ghg budgets remains a challenge owing to the limited amount of in situ measurements addressing the large uncertainty of aquatic ghg emission estimates there can be great variability between water bodies and aquaculture ponds have recently been suggested as key hotspots of ghg emissions grinham et al 2018 holgerson and raymond 2016 yang et al 2017 there is also a high degree of uncertainty associated with variability in time and regarding the magnitude and controlling processes of ghg fluxes in aquatic ecosystems one potentially important aspect of the temporal variability of aquatic ghg fluxes regards extreme weather events such as storms heat waves and droughts tropical cyclones which are often called typhoons in the northwest pacific and hurricanes on the eastern side of the dateline occur frequently in the summer and greatly affect coastal wetlands and the adjacent marine zones lévy et al 2012 wang et al 2016 tropical cyclones induce large currents that can heavily disturb various biogeochemical processes including the production and emission of ghgs crosswell et al 2014 paerl et al 2001 wang et al 2016 in recent decades some studies quantified the effect of tropical cyclones on co2 fluxes in marine ecosystems it has been suggested that the passage of tropical cyclones causes large efflux of co2 from the ocean to the atmosphere bates 2007 crosswell et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 perrie 2004 sun et al 2014 yet the majority of these studies of typhoon impacts were conducted using satellite remote sensing data with few in situ observations being made in inland water bodies hence the effects of typhoon passage on co2 ch4 and n2o fluxes from potential ghg emission hotspots such as aquaculture ponds and other shallow aquatic environments remain largely unknown aquaculture ponds form an important component of global shallow water ecosystems fao 2016 the global total area of freshwater and brackish aquaculture ponds is approximately 110 832 km2 and approximately 90 of the world s aquaculture production occur in the asia pacific region verdegem and bosma 2009 china has the largest area of aquaculture ponds by country approximately 25 700 km2 23 of the global total with many of them being located along subtropical coasts where typhoons are common chen et al 2017 ye et al 2017 yang et al 2018 in this study we estimated the effects of typhoon events on diffusive ghg fluxes from the subtropical coastal aquaculture ponds in the min river estuary in southeastern china from concentrations of dissolved ghgs co2 ch4 and n2o before during and after the passage of three typhoons typhoons nesat haitang and hato and modelled gas transfer velocities 2 materials and

fig 1 the study region has a subtropical monsoonal climate with an annual precipitation of 1350 mm and an annual mean temperature of 19 6 c the summer is hot and wet tong et al 2010 the main vegetation types in this wetland are the native cyperus malaccensis and phragmites australis and the invasive spartina alterniflora smooth cordgrass a semidiurnal tide dominates this area with a large tidal range of approximately 2 5 6 m the shallow aquaculture ponds that were created by the removal of original marsh vegetation have currently become one of the main landscape features in the estuarine zones yang et al 2017 2018 2 2 sampling strategy the min river estuary is typically struck by multiple typhoons every year in 2017 three significant typhoon events occurred including the typhoons nesat haitang and hato fig 1 typhoons nesat and haitang occurred within a very short time interval and were treated as one combined event in this study typhoon nesat first formed in the sea near palau on july 21 2017 fig 1 reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 40 m s 1 category 2 and landed at ilan in northeastern taiwan at approximately 1940 utc on july 29 it continued crossing the main island and taiwan strait and landed again on the fuqing coast of fujian in china at approximately 0600 utc on july 30 with a maximum wind speed of 33 m s 1 after nesat passed over the fuqing coast another tropical depression developed into typhoon haitang at 1000 utc on july 30 reaching a minimum central pressure of 992 hpa and a maximum wind speed of 20 m s 1 haitang landed on the fuqing coast at approximately 0250 utc on july 31 based on the temporal evolution of wind speed five sampling campaigns were conducted on the following dates july 28 representing the pre typhoon period before typhoon passage july 30 and 31 representing the typhoon passage period and august 1 and 3 representing the post typhoon period following typhoon passage typhoon hato developed over the philippines sea at 1700 utc on august 20 2017 and reached zhuhai city in guangdong province in china at approximately 1250 utc on august 23 with a minimum central pressure of 950 hpa and a maximum wind speed of 45 m s 1 according to the temporal evolution of typhoon hato five sampling campaigns were conducted on the following dates august 20 pre typhoon august 22 and 23 typhoon passage and august 24 and 26 post typhoon 2 3 collection and analysis of water samples we collected water samples from three commercial shrimp ponds in the shanyutan wetland fig 1 during each campaign water from three replicate locations in each pond were sampled for measurement of chemical properties surface water samples were collected at a depth of 10 cm using a 5 l niskin water sampler and transferred into 250 ml polyethylene bottles approximately 2 ml of saturated hgcl2 solution was added to each bottle to inhibit microbial activities taipale and sonninen 2009 zhang et al 2013 the water samples were subsequently stored in an ice box transported to the laboratory and analyzed within 48 h total organic carbon toc was analyzed using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcph cpn shimadzu kyoto japan after filtering the samples through a 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filter biotrans nylon membranes the concentration of total dissolved nitrogen tdn was measured using a flow injection analyzer skalar analytical san the netherlands the detection limits for toc and tdn were 4 and 3 μg l 1 respectively the relative standard deviations of toc and tdn analyses were 1 0 and 2 0 respectively 2 4 ghg concentrations and fluxes at each sampling location dissolved ghg co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations in the surface water 10 cm depth were measured following the headspace equilibration method described by yu et al 2013 2017 the water samples were collected using a niskin water sampler and transferred into a 55 ml gas tight glass serum bottle the bottles were flushed with the collected water thoroughly for two to three times before being completely filled with samples about 0 2 ml of saturated mercuric chloride was added to each bottle to inhibit microbial activities the glass bottles were then quickly sealed with an open topped screw cap equipped with a halobutyl rubber septum to exclude any air bubbles all the water samples were stored in an ice packed cooler transported back to the laboratory and analyzed within two days in the laboratory 25 ml of ultra high purity n2 gas 99 999 was injected into the glass bottle to create a 25 ml headspace the n2 gas entered the bottle via a syringe inserted in the rubber stopper and 25 ml of water was removed from the bottle via a second syringe inserted in the stopper xiao et al 2017 the samples were then shaken vigorously for 0 5 h to achieve an equilibrium between the air and water phases cotovicz et al 2016 the concentrations of co2 ch4 and n2o in the headspace air were determined with a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu kyoto japan equipped with a flame ionization detector a methanizer and an electron capture detector the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations were then calculated taking into account the volume of water and headspace air in the vial and the gas solubility coefficients as a function of temperature and salinity wanninkhof 1992 because direct measurements of gas fluxes by flux chambers were not possible during the strong typhoon winds the diffusive gas fluxes across the water air interface were calculated based on the fick s law of diffusion equation 1 blees et al 2015 musenze et al

merlivat 1986 was chosen as the primary example for our k estimation since it was developed considering a range of wind speeds that were representative of the conditions encountered during typhoon passage 2 5 measurement of meteorological variables and water physicochemical properties meteorological variables including air temperature atmospheric pressure a p wind speed and precipitation were measured by the automatic weather station at the min river estuary ecological station in the shanyutan wetland the precision for air temperature atmospheric pressure wind speed and precipitation were 0 2 c 1 5 hpa 0 3 m s 1 and 0 4 mm min 1 respectively in addition water temperature w t salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do in the surface water were measured in situ at each sampling site during each sampling campaign water temperature and ph were determined using a portable ph mv temp meter iq150 iq scientific instruments usa the salinity and do were measured using a salinity meter eutech instruments salt6 usa and a multi parameter water quality meter horiba japan respectively the detection limits for salinity ph and do were 0 1 ppt 0 01 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively the relative standard deviations of salinity ph and do analyses were 1 0 1 0 and 2 0 respectively 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were conducted using spss version 22 0 ibm armonk ny usa significant differences in mean physicochemical variables dissolved gas concentrations and gas fluxes between the three periods i e pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon were tested using one way analysis of variance anova spearman correlation coefficients was conducted to estimate the relationships between 1 the different environmental variables and 2 dissolved ghgs concentrations or diffusive ghgs fluxes and various environmental variables principal component analysis pca was also performed to analyze relationships between the diffusive greenhouse gas fluxes and observed environmental parameters statistical results were considered significant at p 0 05 the results were presented as mean 1 standard error 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of typhoon events on environmental variables fig s1 fig s2 and fig 2 show the environmental variables before during and after the passage of typhoons nesat haitang and hato the relationships between the different environmental variables are also shown in table s1 significantly lower mean a p w t and ph were observed during typhoon passage as compared to both the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 previous studies have shown that typhoons could exert a considerable influence on marine ecosystems through a decrease in surface water temperature bond et al 2011 sun et al 2014 and an increase in water acidity arising from the upwelling of low ph water from the deep ocean wada et al 2011 in the studied shrimp ponds the decrease in ph was likely associated with the typhoon associated acidic precipitation ph as low as about 4 0 cheng et al 2016 wang et al 2018 contributing large volumes of rain water having low ph previous studies in the oceans observed a positive influence of typhoons on do concentrations attributed to a decrease in water temperature and a corresponding increase in oxygen solubility lin et al 2014 in contrast the do concentrations in the aquaculture ponds were significantly lower during typhoon passage range from 6 2 to 7 4 mg l 1 than both the pre typhoon range from 10 2 to 11 0 mg l 1 and post typhoon range from 8 7 to 9 3 mg l 1 periods p 0 05 fig 2 and table s2 this might be caused by an upwelling of oxygen poor water from deep water layers or sediments and algal photosynthesis is hampered by the cloud cover and low light level during the occurrence of typhoons zheng and wang 2007 the tdn concentrations in the aquaculture ponds before during and after the typhoons varied over ranges of 0 6 1 4 0 4 1 1 and 0 4 1 3 mg l 1 fig 2 respectively the toc concentrations in the ponds during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods also varied 2 fold across ranges of 13 3 29 5 12 2 19 9 and 12 5 23 8 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 the effects of typhoon on tdn and toc were inconsistent with a reduction in tdn observed during typhoon nesat and haitang but not by hato while the opposite pattern was observed for toc fig 2 and fig s2 possible typhoon effects could include dilution due to heavy rainfall associated with the typhoon events fig s1c and s1f wang et al 2016 the precipitation not only dramatically increased water depth in the aquaculture ponds but also increased inflow of soil and water pushed into the ponds by rain falling on surrounding land ultimately causing a dilution effect for many of the pond s biological and chemical parameters holgerson 2015 also observed that precipitation events could affect many physiochemical and biological parameters e g dissolved organic carbon chlorophyll a total dissolved phosphorus tdn in pond water through dilution however the inconsistent patterns for tdn and toc indicates a more complex regulations of these levels during the studied typhoons fig 2 3 2 effects of typhoon events on dissolved ghg concentrations the dissolved ghg concentrations in the water column varied substantially over the course of the typhoon events with significantly higher levels observed during typhoon passage than during the post and pre typhoon periods fig 3 across all the typhoon events examined the mean dissolved co2 concentrations in the pond water were 97 6 3 6 156 6 7 4 and 113 4 9 6 µmol l 1 during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods respectively fig 3a and 3b the mean dissolved ch4 concentrations in the ponds before during and after the typhoon were 1 6 0 2 2 7 0 2 and 2 4 0 2 µmol l 1 respectively fig 3e and 3f the mean dissolved co2 and ch4 concentrations in the shrimp ponds during typhoon passage were significantly higher than those during the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 table s3 we also found that the mean dissolved n2o concentration in the pond water was significantly lower during the pre typhoon period 4 8 0 1 nmol l 1 than during both the typhoon passage 5 9 0 3 nmol l 1 and the post typhoon periods 6 1 0 4 nmol l 1 p 0 01 table s3 fig 4 i and j generally the co2 concentration in aquaculture ponds is governed by the balance between the photosynthesis and the respiration algal photosynthesis plays an important role in co2 uptake in the presence of sufficient solar radiation kuzyakov and gavrichkova 2010 during typhoon passage the extensive cloud cover would considerably reduce sunlight penetration which could in turn hamper algal photosynthesis and reduce co2 uptake the increase in dissolved co2 levels might also be attributed to enhanced release of co2 rich sediment pore water into the water column by wind induced turbulence or an increase in co2 supply from soil water and groundwater induced by precipitation the enhanced co2 concentrations during typhoon events could also partly be linked to the reduction in ph and its associated effects on the carbonate equilibrium the ch4 concentration in the water represents a balance between production oxidation and efflux rates ch4 is mainly generated by the decomposition of organic matter in sediments under anaerobic conditions hu et al 2018 the dissolved ch4 concentrations are typically lower in the water column than those in the sediment pore water because a considerable part of the ch4 is oxidized to co2 by bacteria in the surface millimeters of the sediments or the water column before reaching the surface bastviken et al 2008 the efficiency of ch4 oxidation depends on the duration of ch4 transport through the layer where ch4 oxidation happen i e where both the ch4 substrate and oxygen or other suitable electron acceptors e g no3 fe3 and so4 2 are readily available typhoon passages induce extensive turbulent mixing which may result in rapid ch4 transfer from the sediments to the surface water and subsequently a reduction in time available for ch4 oxidation to occur the large amount of precipitation during typhoon events could also help flush the potentially anoxic and ch4 rich soil water and groundwater into the ponds moreover as a typhoon approaches the decrease in atmospheric pressure and increase in wind speed could trigger ch4 ebullition from sediments which would lead to elevated ch4 concentrations in the pond water as some of the ch4 in the bubbles will dissolve into the water upon the passage mcginnis et al 2006 similarly the sediment pore water soil water and groundwater could be important stores and contributors of co2 and n2o too typhoon induced turbulence of air and water could therefore also promote the release of co2 and n2o from the sediments to the overlying water which was supported by the observed reduction in do during typhoon passage fig 2 and fig s2 the dissolved co2 ch4 and n2o concentrations in the ponds showed a significantly negative relationship with water do concentrations r 2 0 31 0 21 and 0 34 p 0 01 table s4 respectively which further supports the above hypothesis similar relationship between the do and dissolved ghgs concentrations was also found in river studies hu et al 2018 3 3 effects of typhoon events on gas transfer velocity fig 4 shows the gas transfer velocities k before during and after the passage of typhoons nesat haitang and hato estimated from the four used models based on the formula described by liss and merlivat 1986 the mean k for co2 during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods were 0 29 0 02 22 5 0 5 and 0 30 0 01 cm h 1 respectively while the mean k for n2o during the three periods were 0 34 0 03 28 1 1 2 and 0 41 0 01 respectively overall the mean kx in the shrimp ponds during typhoon passage was significantly higher than that in both the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 although the estimated k values varied among different models they consistently reached the highest value during the typhoon passage period across all the models examined fig 4 we only report the k values for the four models and do not derive the ghg flux estimates from all different k models because the fluxes would simply vary linearly as a function of k according to equation 1 the ghg flux estimates reported below were estimated from the liss and merlivat 1986 k model considering typhooe range wind speeds and yielding the second lowest k values compared to the other models fig 4 none of the models fully considers the influence of rain forcing nor the interactions between rain and wind on k the results of a rain and gas exchange experiment conducted at the biosphere 2 center demonstrated that rain induced turbulence can substantially influence the air sea gas transfer velocity zappa et al 2009 developing k models that take into account the influence of wind and rain can further improve the accuracy of k estimates for assessing typhoon induced effects on aquatic ghg emissions hence it is possible that the k values derived from the models and thereby the ghg fluxes are underestimated 3 4 effects of typhoon events on ghg fluxes across the water air interface across all the typhoon events the mean co2 fluxes in the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods were 0 3 0 1 32 3 1 7 and 0 3 0 1 mmol m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3c and 3d while the mean diffusive ch4 fluxes during these three periods were 4 3 0 5 571 51 and 6 3 0 4 µmol m 2 h 1 respectively fig 3e and 3f over the study period the mean of co2 or ch4 emission fluxes in the typhoon passage period were 11535 or 13279 and 9500 or 9063 greater than those the pre typhoon and post typhoon periods respectively thus the average fluxes of co2 and ch4 during typhoon passage were one to two orders of magnitude higher than those observed in the pre and post typhoon periods p 0 01 fig 3 similar patterns of co2 fluxes have been observed in some marine ecosystems bates et al 1998 bates 2007 crosswell et al 2014 nemoto et al 2009 perrie 2004 sun et al 2014 ye et al 2017 which were attributed to an increase in gas transfer velocity and thus co2 efflux in response to the high winds during typhoon passage bates et al 1998 nemoto et al 2009 in this study the wind induced increase in gas transfer velocity accounted for most of the increase in co2 and ch4 fluxes during typhoon passage approximately 50 fold fig 4 while the typhoon induced enhancement of dissolved ghg concentrations in pond water accounted for another two fold increase in gas fluxes fig 3 the dissolved ghg concentrations in surface water would vary depending on the balance between gas inputs and outputs since the co2 and ch4 concentrations in surface water were largely unchanged during the typhoon event this implied that the significant increase in ghg emissions from the ponds into the atmosphere was likely supported by a corresponding increase in the supply of ghgs from the sediments and groundwater the mean n2o flux in the aquaculture ponds was significantly higher during typhoon passage 0 3 0 1 µmol m 2 h 1 while a net uptake 0 004 0 001 µmol m 2 h 1 and a small net release 0 002 0 001 µmol m 2 h 1 were observed during the pre and post typhoon periods respectively p 0 01 fig 3j if the sediment pore water has a large store of n2o this could support n2o release into the water column under turbulent conditions similar to the case of co2 and ch4 as described previously since n2o is predominantly produced under a highly dynamic environment with frequent fluctuations between oxic and anoxic conditions the increased n2o fluxes observed during typhoon passage might also partly be caused by turbulence induced disturbance of sediment redox potential resulting in higher n2o production in contrast low turbulence and less input of potentially o2 rich water through rain wind mixing during the pre and post typhoon periods can cause a lower sediment redox potential ultimately resulting in a large amount of n2o is reduced to n2 and the subsequent n2o emission decreases obviously overall typhoon passage can lead to great changes in hydrology nutrient cycling characteristics sediment water physicochemical properties fig 2 and overall ecosystem function which could substantially influence greenhouse gases emissions fig 2 spearman correlation analysis table s5 and pca analysis fig 5 was also performed to screen the most influential environmental factors for ghgs emissions from the mariculture shrimp ponds during typhoons nesat haitang and hato spearman correlation analysis showed that the changes in ghgs emissions was significantly positively related to wind speed p 0 01 table s5 and negatively correlated with atmospheric pressure water temperature ph value and do p 0 01 table s5 our pca results suggested that the first two principal components pc i and pc ii explained 60 2 97 1 and 1 7 33 9 respectively of the total variability fig 5 ghgs fluxes and wind speed displayed positive pc i loading while other environmental variables showed negative pc ii loading fig 5 3 5 implications by using sustained flux global warming potential sgwp for gas emissions models over a 100 year period neubauer and megonigal 2015 tangen et al 2016 the effect of typhoons on ghg fluxes in the subtropical estuarine aquaculture ponds was quantified in this study table 1 the mean co2 eq flux in the min river estuary mariculture ponds studied during the pre typhoon typhoon passage and post typhoon periods was estimated to 15 2 1922 9 and 19 4 mg co2 eq m2 h 1 respectively with co2 ch4 and n2o comprising 77 8 21 9 and 0 3 of the total co2 eq emissions respectively table 1 this means that the flux during one typhoon day corresponded to approximately 100 days of non typhoon flux and that two typhoon passage days could cause a flux similar to half a year of diffusive ghg flux under non typhoon conditions in addition such hot moment emissions of trace gases could influence other atmospheric processes than the greenhouse gas effect e g ozone depletion by n2o regarding co2 eq emissions from the aquaculture ponds during the typhoon passage the magnitude observed in our ponds were substantially higher than the average of 310 lakes 843 6 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 and 153 reservoirs 1009 9 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 in china summarized by li et al 2018 the mean co2 eq emissions from the mariculture ponds during the typhoon passage was approximately 3 1 times higher than the average of 627 1 mg co2 eq m 2 h 1 found in global reservoirs deemer et al 2016 this means that ghg emissions during the period of typhoon passage should not be ignored when assessing the carbon and ghg budgets in mariculture ponds or other aquatic environments 3 6 limitation and future outlook as in most studies there are limitations in the current study the ghg fluxes reported here represent estimates affected by uncertainties in the k models owing to the logistical difficulty and danger of field sampling during ongoing typhoons the limited number of measurement periods and locations given the above the flux values should be interpreted with care nevertheless consistent results were obtained during two independent typhoon events and the result that typhoon events can increase diffusive fluxes 10 to 100 fold orders of magnitude seems clear regardless of which k model was used due to the difficulty of sampling ghgs flux measurements were conducted in only one estuary across a limited period future work with increasing sampling frequency in multiple estuaries will further increase our understanding of the effect of typhoon on biogeochemical cycle in this kind of ecosystem tdn and toc were analyzed in the current study while other chemical and biological variables for example total phosphorus tp dissolved organic carbon doc and n species n nh4 n no3 don can also influence the carbon and nitrogen cycle in aquatic ecosystem e g chung et al 2012 pan et al 2017 tsuchiya et al 2014 typhoons also transport n rich air e g n nh4 n no3 from other areas depositing it as rain on the ponds therefore more physiochemical and biological variables merit attention in the future studies it is worth to note that ch4 ebullition could not be in the present study because of measurement challenges during the typhoon previous studies have suggested that ch4 ebullition is significant in shallow and nutrient rich ponds and lakes holgerson 2015 natchimuthu et al 2014 some studies also showed that ebullition events coincided with low air pressure mattson and likens 1990 natchimuthu et al 2014 it is therefore likely that typhoons also trigger substantial ebullition therefore it is important to advance the measurement technologies to allow quantification of ebullition during the period of typhoon passage in coastal aquatic environments 4 conclusions the results of this study showed that three to four single typhoon days doubled the magnitude of annual diffusive ghg fluxes and co2 eq emissions from the subtropical aquaculture ponds in order to project the effects of global climate change on the biogeochemical dynamics and carbon storage capacity of coastal ecosystems it is imperative that the effects of tropical cyclones on ghg fluxes are accurately quantified various climate models have predicted that tropical cyclones will become more intense as the climate warms in the future although the total number of tropical cyclones may decrease our results implied that such changes in the frequency and intensity of typhoons could have considerable impacts on ghg emissions future studies should be conducted to cover a range of typhoon tracks frequencies and intensities along with improved spatial and temporal coverage of ghg flux measurements in typhoon impacted areas to improve our knowledge of the influence of extreme weather events on the global ghg

5748,in a recent study a tree ring oxygen isotope record 1800 2013 was used as a proxy for amazon river discharge in order to investigate a solar influence on this river here we reinterpreted the results from this study by improving the analyses of tree ring data and by considering the recommendations made by authors critical of sun climate link studies we found that strong 1915 2018 evidences of a causal sunspot amazon link were previously misinterpreted as weak causation is supported by the persistence of a sunspot amazon flow anticorrelation over the ten consecutive sunspot cycles of 1915 2018 we also noticed that the 1915 onset of the sun amazon link could have been associated with changes in the background states of solar forcing and amazon climate keywords amazon river sunspot cycles tree ring data oxygen isotopes in a previous study we presented a link between sunspots and amazon river flow based on an instrumental discharge record from 1903 2013 antico and torres 2015 hereafter at15 recently baker et al 2018 hereafter b18 extended this study further back in time using a 1800 2013 record of tree ring oxygen isotopes δ 18 o tr as a proxy for amazon discharge in agreement with our previous results b18 found evidence of a negative correlation between sunspots and decadal discharge cycles during the last century however they also found that these discharge cycles appeared to be positively correlated with sunspots during the 19th century because of this early 20th century change in correlation sign b18 suggested that any post 1900 sun amazon link was due to chance rather than causation however here we found that the empirical evidences for the last century strongly support causation as we explain below we found this by improving the b18 analyses of proxy data and by considering the recommendations made by authors critical of sun climate link studies below we also discuss possible causes of the observed change in correlation sign although the b18 δ 18 o tr record reflects changes in the amazon wet season november april rainfall b18 compared this record with annual means of amazon discharge to improve the proxy instrumental data comparison we considered the annual maximum discharge at óbidos city qmax because while it occurs in may july it is generated by november april rainfall this delay is due to the time needed for runoff to reach the mainstream see at15 and references therein for this note the 1903 2013 at15 record of qmax was updated up to 2018 values of b18 δ 18 o tr were considered for 1851 2013 unless stated otherwise in general we did not consider older values because as noted by b18 they contain considerable dating errors that preclude accurate analyses of decadal hydrological variability as indicated in the erratum of b18 we increased the original δ 18 o tr dates by one year to make them consistent with discharge dates decadal cycles of δ 18 o tr and qmax were obtained as in at15 and b18 using the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd technique see the obtained decadal cycles in fig 1 top we notice that the overall correlation between these two cycles is r 0 72 see fig 1 top and that between decadal cycles of δ 18 o tr and annual mean discharge is r 0 61 see erratum of b18 this confirms that at decadal scales δ 18 o tr is a better proxy for qmax than for annual mean discharge hence in this note we consider that decadal cycles of δ 18 o tr reflect changes in qmax b18 detected an early 20th century change in the sign of the sun amazon correlation by obtaining overall correlations over 53 or more years between sunspots a given hydrological variable discharge or δ 18 o tr here we conducted a more detailed analysis by obtaining sliding correlations on a 15 year moving window between sunspots and hydrological variables note that sunspot cycles last 9 to 14 years the obtained sliding correlations are shown in fig 1 bottom and reveal that the sunspot amazon correlation experienced an abrupt sign change in 1915 and became persistent after this change note in bottom of fig 1 that while a positive negative correlation between sunspots and δ 18 o tr qmax persisted from 1915 until 2018 an intermittent negative correlation between sunspots and δ 18 o tr occurred before 1915 correlation vanished in 1875 1890 according to the discussion of previous paragraph the same intermittent correlation but with opposite sign must have existed between sunspots and qmax during 1851 1915 based on the above described 1915 change in correlation sign b18 suggested that the sun amazon link observed after this change may be due to chance and thus analogous to a broken clock that tells the right time twice a day however as we explain next this analogy is not clearly applicable in this case decadal solar and climate cycles have oscillatory periods that vary with time around a mean value this frequency modulation implies that an accidental correlation between unrelated solar and climate cycles can be found by chance but typically over few two or three consecutive cycles for this reason since the 1970s authors critical of sun climate link studies have advised paying attention to observed relationships between climate records and sunspots only when the link persists for at least five or six consecutive sunspot cycles see pittock 1978 1983 2009 and works referenced therein as shown above the same sun amazon relation persisted over the ten consecutive sunspot cycles of 1915 2018 and therefore this persistence constitutes a strong empirical evidence of a solar influence on amazon climate thus going back to the clock analogy the persistent sun amazon link observed after 1915 is more analogous to a working clock than to a broken one as shown previously a sun amazon correlation existed before 1915 but only during two separate short periods 1851 1875 and 1890 1915 each of which spans only about two consecutive sunspot cycles see fig 1 therefore for the reasons already stated this sporadic correlation does not support causation we summarize the above discussions as follows the sun amazon correlation experienced an abrupt sign change in 1915 and while the post 1915 evidences strongly support causation the pre 1915 evidences suggest an accidental relation therefore our results suggest that the causation between sunspots and amazon climate started around 1915 interestingly such an onset of a solar influence on climate can result from nonlinear responses of climate to solar forcing see the review by versteegh 2005 immediately below we discuss how such climate responses may explain the 1915 onset of the sun amazon link fig 2 top curve shows that the intensity of the solar forcing as described by the total solar irradiance tsi significantly increased from 1900 to 1950 and remained high afterwards if the amazon climate becomes sensitive to sunspot cycles when tsi exceeds a certain threshold then it is possible that the tsi enhancement of the early 20th century might have caused the 1915 onset of a sunspot amazon link such a threshold response is plausible in nature versteegh 2005 on the other hand as discussed next this onset might have also been caused by a change in the background state of amazon climate fig 2 bottom thick curve reveals that the b18 δ 18 o tr record has a secular trend characterized by a gradual increase from 1800 to the mid 20th century the causes of this positive trend are not fully understood although it was interpreted as an increase of air temperature and as an amazon basin drying it was also attributed to an enhancement of the water vapor flux into the basin see discussion in brienen et al 2012 in any case the observed secular trend of δ 18 o tr suggests that the amazon climate experienced a regime shift at the beginning of the 20th century we speculate that around 1915 the amazon climate shifted from a regime that is not influenced by sunspot cycles to a regime that is sensitive to these cycles see versteegh 2005 for a discussion on how climate shifts can modify sun climate links thus this could have been a cause of the 1915 onset of the sun amazon link future climate modelling studies will be valuable to investigate this and other possible causes finally to end this note we highlight that the solar related decadal cycle of amazon discharge accounts for about 20 of the year to year variance of discharge variability at15 as noticed by pittock 1978 1983 2009 this percentage is large enough to consider a sun amazon link to be of practical importance e g this link would be relevant for water management clearly this constitutes a strong motivation for continuing investigations of solar effects on the amazon the largest river on earth and a key element

5749,the characterization of groundwater gw and surface water sw interaction in riparian zones is of decisive importance for purifying and maintaining the water quality and for protecting the riverine ecosystem through intensive monitoring using a combination of hydrochemical and biological analyses of the riparian gw and sw in the liuxi river basin china the spatial temporal patterns and extent of gw sw interactions were qualitatively and quantitatively identified the similarity of dynamic changes in the river water and gw levels reflected the hydrological connectivity between the river water and riparian gw the discontinuity of the concentration in the majority of water chemistry parameters delineated the gw sw interaction chemical boundaries as being within a distance of 2 and 0 5 m from the river in the wet and dry seasons respectively the gw in the gw sw interaction zone was characterized as having lower levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrate moderate levels of electrical conductivity and major ions and higher total organic carbon values the percentage of river water in riparian gw increased with the proximity to the river from 9 0 to 68 8 in the wet season ws to 6 0 23 1 in the dry season ds the extent of gw sw interactions was quantitatively identified by the chloride mass balance to be within 2 and 0 5 m from the river in the ws and ds respectively based on the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the exchange width of river water and gw was calculated to be 0 52 m in the ds as well the analyses of microbial data demonstrated that gw samples within a distance of 2 m in the ws and 0 5 m in the ds exhibited a unique microbial community structure that contained a mixture of microbial components in the river water and background gw indicative of the gw sw mixing the gw sw interaction microbial boundaries were consistent with the chemical boundaries in both seasons this study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and microbial community structure for the determination of gw sw interactions keywords groundwater surface water interactions microbial communities principal coordinates analysis liuxi river 1 introduction surface water sw and groundwater gw are two interconnected components in a river basin system wang et al 2018b the exchange of water solute and energy between a river and a riparian aquifer frequently occurs in the hyporheic zone hz a subsurface area below and adjacent to the stream channel where gw mixes with sw through lateral vertical and longitudinal flows kumar et al 2009 merill and tonjes 2014 gw sw interactions in the hz create distinct physical chemical and biological gradients danczak et al 2016 harjung et al 2019 making the hz to be a reactive zone with high biogeochemical activity and chemical transformation rates fellows et al 2001 shen et al 2019 water pollution caused by heavy metals nutrients and organic compounds can be attenuated through adsorption on the sediment soil solid phase and chemical and biological degradation or transformation coupled with the high biogeochemical activity in the aquifers of the hz gandy et al 2007 roley et al 2012 weatherill et al 2018 consequently the hz is regarded as the liver of the river fischer et al 2005 gw sw interactions generally represent a high temporal and spatial variability mainly due to such factors as the geomorphology song et al 2019 subsurface hydraulic properties siergieiev et al 2015 song et al 2017 precipitation regimes dudley southern and binley 2015 and stream and gw flow patterns malzone et al 2016 in addition changes in the precipitation regimes resulting from recent global climate change and intensive human activities such as domestic water consumption and hydraulic construction have a pronounced impact on the water level of various water bodies in a basin leading to more frequent complex and drastic gw sw interaction patterns and imposing considerable stress on the hz and river ecosystems hancock 2002 sawyer et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 previous research indicated that the migration transformation and fate of chemicals in the hz were closely related to the magnitude timescale location and timing of the gw sw interactions byrne et al 2015 lautz and fanelli 2008 thus the investigation of the patterns and extent of gw sw interactions is of great importance for understanding the biogeochemical cycling of substances and the natural attenuation of artificial pollutants in the hz krause et al 2011 and for providing a scientific management strategy for the water resources in a river basin various methods including those based on darcy s law zhu et al 2019b numerical modeling lautz and siegel 2006 hydrochemical analysis martinez et al 2015 and multivariate statistics kumar et al 2009 have been developed to investigate the gw sw interaction patterns certain assumptions must be made when applying these methods and the methods differ in resolution sampled volume and time scale kalbus et al 2006 therefore a combination of multiple approaches which can considerably reduce their individual uncertainties is strongly recommended and highlighted in recent studies kong et al 2019 menció et al 2014 however the majority of studies have mainly focused on the physical and hydrochemical methods martinez et al 2015 with little available information on the application of microbiological analysis to characterize the gw sw interactions and stream aquifer connectivity van driezum et al 2018 microbes as a sensitive indicator of the variation of hydrodynamic conditions and physicochemical parameters lin et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 have been proposed for characterizing the dynamic processes of gw sw interactions febria et al 2011 nogaro et al 2013 more importantly microorganisms are extensively involved in many of the biogeochemical and attenuation processes occurring in the hz therefore the integration of microbial analysis and hydrochemical approaches will provide new insight into the dynamics of gw sw interactions the liuxi river is located in guangzhou city one of the most economically developed areas in china the river provides 60 of the potable water supply for the city in recent decades however the liuxi river basin has experienced rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural and tourist development leading to the deterioration of the water quality and varying degrees of damage in the riparian zones ji et al 2015 water pollution induced by the continually increasing concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus was responsible for the abandonment of drinking water sources in 2010 jiang et al 2014 the water resource shortage has created a bottleneck to the further social and economic development of guangzhou moreover with the dramatic increase in the construction of water conservancy projects e g dams and hydropower stations in recent years both the patterns and the fluxes of gw sw exchange in the basin have undergone considerable changes yang et al 2019 under such circumstances the guangzhou municipal government issued conservation regulations for the liuxi river basin to protect the water bodies and riparian areas from eco environmental deterioration however few explicit studies on the gw sw interaction patterns and extent in the liuxi river basin are available to support the relevant policymaking therefore the objectives of the present study were to integrate the hydrochemical and microbial analyses to 1 characterize the spatial temporal signatures of the hydrochemistry and microorganisms of the sw and gw 2 identify the spatial temporal patterns of the gw sw interactions and 3 quantitatively determine the boundary of the hz at the study site the research results can provide scientific support for the control of water pollution and the rational allocation of land resources as well as for maintaining the ecosystem health of the liuxi river 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the liuxi river with a length of 171 km and a basin area of 2300 km2 is located in guangzhou city southern china fig 1 a it has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 20 3 c and precipitation of 2143 8 mm due to the effect of the east asian monsoonal circulation the majority of the rainfall approximately 80 occurs during the wet season from april to september the main land use type is forest which covers approximately 59 4 of the total area followed by cultivated land with 31 3 coverage the remainder is occupied by built up areas wang 2018 the soil parent rocks are primarily granite in the presence of quartzite and shale the gw in the study area is classified into three types phreatic karst and fissure water zhang et al 2017b the aquifers of both the phreatic and fissure gw consist mainly of fine sandstone silt sandstone and clay sandstone from the holocene and quaternary periods precipitation is the primary recharge source for the gw and river water since the 1960s hydraulic engineering such as reservoir and diversion projects has been conducted in the upstream area periodically affecting the river water table due to the discharge li 2007 the study site 113 37 e 23 34 n is located in a riparian zone of the liuxi river fig 1 the width of the river cross section is approximately 210 m around the study site the riparian zone at the study site is relatively flat and surrounded by longan trees the grain size analysis of core samples from the riparian zone showed that the sediment at the study transect consisted mainly of sand and silt 2 2 monitoring methods five piezometers a b c d and e were installed along a transect perpendicular to the liuxi river fig 1 b the distances of piezometers a e from the river were 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively the piezometers were made of pvc pipes 7 5 cm diameter several holes 0 5 mm diameter were drilled within 50 cm from the bottom of the pvc pipes and wrapped with nylon mesh 0 22 mm for the gw percolation the bottom of the pvc pipes was sealed with a lid to collect gw a portable gps combined with a laser tachymeter trimble gps was used to record the geographical location and elevation of each sampling site the piezometer at each site was extended to 1 6 m below the ground surface a 47 cm horizontal line below the ground surface was identified as the reference level 0 m the pressure in both the river and the piezometers was automatically recorded by cdt sensors at 5 min intervals and was calibrated to the air pressure to reflect dynamic changes in the water table of the varied water bodies the precipitation was recorded at 1 min intervals by a portable weather station wxt520 vaisala corp germany during the installation of the piezometers samples of undisturbed soil were collected using 100 cm3 cutting rings at 10 cm vertical intervals to determine the soil porosity n e and hydraulic conductivity k the resulting average n e and k values were approximately 0 35 and 1 69 10 4 m s 1 respectively the soil grain size distribution was analyzed using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical malvern uk 2 3 water sample collection and analysis 2 3 1 water sample collection water samples were collected from each piezometer and the liuxi river every 6 h for 48 h in the wet season ws 07 23 07 25 and the dry season ds 11 13 11 15 of 2018 to ensure the collection of new groundwater stagnant water in each piezometer was pumped out by a peristaltic pump prior to sampling water samples were then collected into separate 1l polythene plastic bottles to minimize contact between the groundwater and air as well as prevent air bubbles from becoming trapped in the bottles groundwater was pumped directly through a tube ending at the bottom of a bottle at a low flow rate 1 l min 1 while allowing water to flow into bottle for several seconds river samples were taken at 1 m from the riverbank a total of 80 gw samples and 16 river water samples were collected electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured in situ using hach portable meters hq40d samples of both the gw and river water were filtered through a 0 45 mm cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter for the analysis of major ions a portion of the filtered

biomarker technologies sequences were analyzed using qiime and uparse software with the default settings to obtain effective tags and operational taxonomic units otus caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2013 the uparse pipeline was then used for taxonomic assignment at the 97 similarity level via the ribosomal database project naïve bayesian classifier v 2 2 wang et al 2007 trained on the silva database version 123 using a 0 8 confidence level as the cutoff point quast et al 2013 the mothur package was used to calculate the abundance based coverage estimator ace and shannon s index of diversity schloss et al 2009 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 linear mixing model chloride cl was used as a conservative tracer to assess the mixing ratio of river water and gw within the hyporheic zone specifically the proportion of river water in each piezometer f riv was calculated at each sampling period using a linear mixing model as follows danczak et al 2016 trauth et al 2018 1 f riv c i c g c r c g where c i c r and c g are the cl concentrations in the piezometers river and gw end members respectively in the present study the hyporheic zone was characterized as a transitional area that contains more than 10 river water triska et al 1993 2 4 2 one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law a one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law was conducted to determine how far a water parcel would infiltrate the riverbank gerecht et al 2011 liu et al 2018 according to gerecht et al 2011 and liu et al 2018 the maximum infiltration distance of river water into the riparian aquifer during downward flow hereafter referred to as the exchange width can be calculated as follows 2 l t 1 t 2 k h x t n e x d t where l is the exchange width m δ t t 2 t 1 is the river infiltration period d h is the hydraulic head m x is the distance from the river m t is the time d and n e is the porosity dimensionless 2 4 3 statistical analysis differences in the values of the hydrochemical parameters between the sampling sites and periods were determined using duncan s multiple range tests with p 0 05 indicating a statistical significance hierarchical cluster analyses hca with euclidean distances were employed to quantitatively investigate the relationships between the hydrochemical datasets of the sampling sites gogoi et al 2016 all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed to phylogenetically cluster the normalized 16s rrna sequences set among the water samples based on the unweighted unifrac algorithm lozupone and knight 2005 redundancy analysis rda was applied to elucidate the relationship between the microbial community and the environmental factors pcoa and rda were conducted with the r software package v 3 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 field survey parameters and chemistry 3 1 1 hydrological conditions the observed water levels for the liuxi river r and the piezometers a e in the ws and ds are illustrated in fig 2 a and b respectively regarding the ws three precipitation events differing in amount intensity and duration were observed table 1 during precipitation events 1 2 and 3 the river water levels respectively increased by 20 4 6 4 and 16 4 cm at the peak flow accompanied by fluctuations of 4 5 17 6 cm in the gw levels of piezometers a d table 1 in the ds the river water level also showed a pronouncedly fluctuating trend with no rainfall events during the investigated period this is considered to be closely associated with the upstream discharge of the liuxi river reservoir as previous research reported a dam induced hyporheic exchange and subsequent frequent and periodic oscillations of the shoreside gw levels sawyer et al 2009 it was obvious that the river water table increased by 10 3 cm during the period of 11 14 6 00 to 11 14 20 00 and the corresponding increase in the gw levels reached 5 2 6 5 cm at piezometers a d implying a distinct hydrological connectivity between piezometers a d and the river additionally due to the damping effect of the riparian aquifer cloutier et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2009 the amplitude of the gw fluctuations decreased with an increasing distance from the river regardless of the season fig 2 a b and table 1 the water table at piezometer e remained the lowest level throughout the two investigated periods which might be related to its unique geological conditions furthermore as shown in fig 2 a and b the damping effect induced a delayed response of the gw table to the river water stage the time lag of the gw fluctuations increased from approximately 20 100 min at piezometers a d with an increasing distance to the riverbank fig 2 c and d show the hydraulic gradients between the piezometers and the river in principle river water infiltrates the gw when a negative hydraulic gradient is established conversely a positive hydraulic gradient drives the gw into the river fig 2 c and d show whether infiltration or exfiltration occurs but not the volume of water passing the sediment water interface as it is well known that the amount of water infiltration or exfiltration depends not only on the hydraulic gradient but also on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment lewandowski et al 2009 during the ws two short periods of infiltration piezometers a d occurred in the investigated two day period after an increase in the river water levels caused by precipitation event 1 and 3 precipitation event 2 with a low magnitude 1 9 mm table 1 produced an increase of 6 4 cm in the river water level which was not sufficient to reverse the gradient between the piezometers and the river and thus no infiltration occurred during the ds only one short period of infiltration piezometer a occurred moreover as shown in fig 2 c and d infiltration events were usually of short duration and exfiltration predominated overall the river at this section was a gaining stream additionally the amplitudes of the hydraulic gradient were damped with an increasing distance from the river in particular the hydraulic gradient between piezometer d and the river water remained relatively more stable 3 1 2 hydrochemistry characteristics table 2 presents the statistical values for the major chemical components of the river water and gw in different seasons the ph values of the river water and gw ranged from 5 5 to 7 9 with a higher average value found in the river water 7 2 compared to that in gw 6 4 and no significant seasonal variations were observed in either the river water or the gw the temperatures in the river water and gw were higher in the ws mean range 27 9 28 9 than in the ds 23 6 4 2 the river water had the highest do concentrations with a range of 6 43 8 90 mg l 1 the do levels in the river water were higher in the ds than in the ws due to the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in water unlike the river water the gw showed a slight seasonal variation table 2 the average concentrations of do in the gw varied between 3 69 and 4 95 mg l 1 in the ws while it ranged from 4 11 to 4 39 mg l 1 in the ds as the river water had much higher do levels than the gw downwelling river water that infiltrated the aquifer can supply do for the gw theoretically the gw from piezometers a b close to the river should have higher do concentrations than that from other piezometers due to the impact of river water infiltration however the do values of the gw at these two piezometers were significantly lower compared to the values at other piezometers in the ws as the temperature of the gw at each piezometer was similar the lower do concentrations at these sites cannot be explained by the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen while indicating significant do consumption by community respiration in fact studies have shown that riparian zones are active areas for microbial respiration due to the gw sw interactions fellows et al 2001 mader et al 2018 the mean ec value in the river water 62 3 μs cm 1 was much lower than that in the gw 165 0 μs cm 1 no significant seasonal variation was observed in the mean ec values of the river water however the mean ec values of the gw in the ws were significantly lower than that in the ds due to the dilution effect of precipitation ec is a relatively conservative tracer by observing the change in ec in a piezometer during the short 48 h sampling period it is possible to infer whether or not gw sw mixing has occurred at that site briody et al 2016 the coefficient of variation cv represents the degree of change in a parameter across a sampling period providing an indication of the degree to which river water has been introduced into the riparian gw briody et al 2016 based on the cv values mixing was most pronounced at piezometers a c and at piezometer a during the ws and ds respectively in both seasons the cvs of d and e were relatively low 6 indicating that the ec values of these two sites were relatively stable and not influenced by the fluctuations of gw sw mixing furthermore the ec values of the gw at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds were between that of the river water and piezometer e demonstrating that the riparian aquifer at a distance of up to 2 and 0 5 m had been influenced by dilution from the infiltrating river water during the ws and ds respectively a piper diagram based on the major ion concentrations is plotted in fig s1 to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics of the water samples the dominant hydrochemical type of both the river water and gw was identified as hco3 ca which may be mainly associated with the calcite and dolomite dissolution in the river basin yang et al 2019 on the other hand the proportion of several major ions exhibited differences among the sites in general the concentrations of major ions at piezometers a c exhibited intermediate characteristics between the river water and piezometers d e fig s2 furthermore the magnitude of the chemical gradients varied significantly taking cl as an example similar to the variation observed in ec the concentrations of cl at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds had higher cv values than that of other piezometers whereas the values were relatively constant at piezometer e additionally the cl concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds exhibited significant differences between the river water and piezometer e as well these observations are consistent with the dilution effects of the river water with river water infiltration being particularly marked at piezometers a c and a during the ws and ds respectively due to the relatively stable and higher ec values and major ion concentrations at piezometer e during the investigated periods of both seasons piezometer e was assumed to be the localized background gw site in the present study hca was performed to identify the similarity of sampling locations based on the hydrochemical parameters such as ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 hco3 cl t ph and do as shown in fig s2 three groups of sites were found in both seasons in the ws group i consisted of sites d and e which were located relatively far from the river and exhibited significant dissimilarities with all other samples group iii comprised sites a c that linked to group ii representing only the river water this suggested that sites a c were likely predominantly influenced by the river water in the ds group i represented the river water whereas group iii consisted of sites a d and showed a close relationship with group ii comprising only site e probably indicating a dominate effect of the background gw piezometer e on piezometers a d 3 1 3 c and n characteristics the toc values in the river water and gw ranged from 1 61 to 25 2 mg l 1 obvious seasonal variations of the toc values were observed at piezometers a c but not at the river water and piezometers d e table 2 the average toc concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws 9 45 mg l 1 were significantly higher than that in the ds 2 93 mg l 1 in addition the toc concentrations at piezometers a c showed greater variability and were significantly higher than those at the river water and piezometers d e during the ws whereas they showed no significant differences p 0 05 among the investigated sites with little changes in their cv values during the ds table 2 shen et al 2019 reported similar results and revealed that the river water infiltration into the riparian aquifer carried exogenous organic carbon from the overlying clay into the gw thus the spatial temporal variation of the toc values at the study site indicated that the river water infiltration was remarkably significant at piezometers a c in the ws the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in all water samples were in the range of 0 04 3 11 mg l 1 and 0 01 1 42 mg l 1 respectively high no3 n concentrations mean of 0 68 mg l 1 and low nh4 n concentrations mean of 0 32 mg l were observed in the aerobic river water with high do concentrations mean of 7 75 mg l 1 implying that the oxidation of ammonium was occurring in the river water contrary to the river water low no3 n concentrations mean of 0 42 mg l 1 and high nh4 n concentrations mean of 1 00 mg l 1 were found in the gw samples with low concentrations of do mean of 4 22 mg l 1 table 2 likely indicating an anaerobic and reduced environment within the gw significant seasonal variations of nh4 concentrations were displayed in both the river water and gw the nh4 concentrations of the river water in the ws were much higher than that in the ds because of the larger amount of nh4 inputs from non point sources yan et al 1999 while the nh4 concentrations of the gw demonstrated the opposite seasonal variation due to the dilution effect of the larger rainfall in the ws wang 2018 spatially no obvious differences were observed in the gw during both seasons in contrast the no3 concentrations exhibited no distinct seasonal variations in either the river water or gw however in terms of the spatial distribution the no3 concentration at piezometer a was significantly lower than that at the river water and the other piezometers in the ds while there were no significant differences among the sites in the ws although no significant differences existed we still detected slightly lower no3 n concentrations at piezometers a c compared to that at the river water and piezometer d in the ws gw sw interactions have proven to be a key control in the occurrence of denitrification and no3 removal in riparian zones roley et al 2012 trauth et al 2018 as reported by briody et al 2016 if denitrification occurs one can expect to observe a removal trend in which high no3 concentrations and the values of no3 cl decrease with the assumption that cl is conservative briody et al 2016 therefore to examine whether or not no3 is removed the no3 cl values were further analyzed and are shown in table 2 the no3 concentrations and the values of no3 cl were found to decrease within a distance of 2 and 0 5 m from the river during the ws and ds table 2 respectively furthermore abundant organic carbon a suboxic redox environment and a number of denitrifiers present at piezometers a c table 2 and fig 4 were favorable for denitrification therefore the lower no3 concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws and piezometer a in the ds indicated that denitrification occurred at those sites in view of the environmental and human health risks the no3 concentrations in the river water and gw were all below the maximum contaminant levels mcl 10 mg l 1n set by the world health organization who while the nh4 n concentrations exceeded the mcl of who 0 16 mg l 1 in 6 and 81 of the river water and gw samples respectively the degree of nh4 pollution was higher in the gw than in the river water and high nh4 persisted within the aquifer over the two sampling periods considering that the study site was surrounded by longan trees the application of ammonium fertilizer was the main reason for the high nh4 concentrations in the gw and the gw represents a potential source of nh4 in this river system 3 2 gw sw interactions analysis with the linear mixing model and one dimensional numerical particle tracking method 3 2 1 quantitative analysis with the linear mixing model the linear mixing model based on the chloride mass balance eq 1 is used to identify and quantify the gw sw interaction as discussed in section 3 1 2 the hydrochemical parameters in piezometer e during the 48 h sampling campaigns in both seasons were relatively stable and could be considered as the background gw therefore in this study the average cl concentrations at sites r and e are regarded as the river water c r and gw end member values c g respectively the calculated proportions of river water in the riparian gw f riv for each sampling period are presented in fig 3 the f riv values ranged from 7 7 to 85 1 with a mean value of 49 2 in the ws fig 3 a while they fluctuated from 1 7 to 37 2 with an average value of 11 6 in the ds fig 3 b the higher f riv values in the ws were mainly due to the large amounts of precipitation that raised the river water levels resulting in an increase in the river water table and the subsequent infiltration of the aquifers in terms of the spatial variation the percentage of river water decreased with an increasing distance from the river in both seasons fig 3 the mean values of f riv at sites a b c and d with a distance of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 m from the river were 68 8 64 6 54 8 and 9 0 in the ws and 23 1 9 4 7 7 and 6 0 in the ds respectively showing a distinct heterogeneity in the gw sw interaction over time with the interaction zone being within a distance of 2 0 and 0 5 m 3 2 2 simple calculation of gw sw exchange width using the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law was applied to calculate the gw sw exchange width at the study site the soil porosity n e and hydraulic conductivity k were determined to be 0 35 and 1 69 10 4 m s 1 respectively as shown in fig 2 the infiltration duration of the river water caused by the peak stages is approximately 5 h in the ws and 6 h in the ds and the maximum hydraulic gradients were determined to be 0 09 and 0 05 respectively based on the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the maximum exchange width l was calculated to be 0 78 and 0 52 m during the ws and ds respectively during the ds the maximum exchange width of 0 52 m was similar to that calculated from the linear mixing model l 0 50 m however during the ws the maximum exchange width of 0 78 m was much lower than that calculated from the linear mixing model within 2 m from the river there are errors with the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method because the calculations are based on a couple of simplifications such as not considering the mixing at the boundary of the infiltrating sw and retreating gw therefore it is reasonable to assume that the maximum exchange width of the gw sw interaction is within 2 0 m from the river during the investigated periods 3 3 interpretation for gw sw interactions with microbial data 3 3 1 microbial community structure the observed richness chao1 indices ranged from 536 to 1083 and from 401 to 570 during the ws and ds respectively fig s3 a the diversity of the microbial community was estimated using the shannon index zhu et al 2019a which varied from 3 81 to 5 51 and from 3 56 to 4 46 respectively fig s3 b all samples except e from the ds exhibited lower diversities compared with those from the ws this is considered to be closely related to the wetter conditions higher toc and higher temperatures in the ws which promote the growth of bacteria zhu et al 2019a additionally exogenous microbes carried by precipitation and runoff in the ws might be another important cause spatially the gw had a relatively higher richness and diversity than that of the river water in both seasons fig s3 it is notable that the relatively high nh4 concentrations and toc in the gw table 2 might favor the growth of microorganisms the sequence tags of the dominant phyla in each sample are presented in fig 4 a and fig 4 b for the river water three phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes collectively contained 93 of the successfully identified phyla tags for the gw samples proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum with a relative abundance of 50 7 and the following top nine phyla were actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes deinococcus thermus acidobacteria nitrospirae cyanobacteria chloroflexi and gemmatimonadetes these bacteria are broadly similar to other freshwater communities as 90 of the sequence tags from other freshwater aquatic environments have been classified within the proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in other studies zhu et al 2019a overall proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples except r1 and the abundance of proteobacteria ranked as piezometers d e piezometers a c r along the lateral direction in both seasons for a more detailed analysis of the composition of microbial communities all tags assigned to the phylum species were further classified into the genus level in the river water samples hgci clade exhibited the highest abundances in both seasons fig 4 c and d which was likely associated with the eutrophication of water bodies as the sporadic coverage of hyacinth was found around the study site this can be supported by a previous report that hgci clade is related to the development of water eutrophication positively correlated with chlorophyll a zhang et al 2017a unlike river water the distribution of microbes in the gw samples was more complex during the ws the following genera were identified as the dominant bacteria including acinetobacter cupriavidus massilia methylobacterium pseudogulbenkiania pseudomonas sphingomonas and vogesella with the mean relative abundance ranging from 2 2 to 6 0 during the ds aquabacterium comamonas cupriavidus dechloromonas deinococcus massilia methylobacterium pseudogulbenkiania sphingomonas and vogesella were the dominant genera and the mean relative abundances of these genera were within the range of 1 6 8 7 more importantly the genera such as acinetobacter aquabacterium comamonas dechloromonas methylobacterium pseudomonas pseudogulbenkiania sphingomonas and vogesella have been reported as potential denitrifiers guo et al 2018 heylen et al 2006 patureau et al 2000 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 3 3 2 statistical comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequences among water samples pcoa based on an unweighted unifrac algorithm was applied to analyze the similarity of microbial communities at different sites as shown in fig 5 the bacterial communities of the samples formed three distinct clusters in both two seasons in the ws group i was composed of river water samples r1 and r2 with a relatively high abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroides group iii contained samples from piezometers d e that were chemically dominated by background gw and had a relatively high abundance of firmicutes nitrospirae acidobacteria chloroflex and deinococcus thermus the samples from piezometers a c were clustered into an independent group ii as shown in fig 4 a the bacterial structure of piezometers a c was similar to that of the river water r1 and r2 but the relative abundances of several bacteria such as firmicutes nitrospirae acidobacteria and deinococcus thermus were much greater in the gw of these piezometers than in the river water group ii had characteristics intermediate between groups i and iii indicative of the mixing of river water and gw regarding the ds similar to group i in the ws the river water r1 and r2 was clustered into a group group i with a relatively high abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroides almost all gw samples with the exception of samples a1 that had a relatively high abundance of deinococcus thermus and nitrospirae constituted group iii however samples a1 were separated into the independent groups ii samples a1 contained mixtures of microbial components in the river water r and background gw d e suggesting that piezometer a was affected by gw sw mixing the results of the cluster analysis revealed that gw sw mixing occurred at piezometers a c and piezometer a with a distance of 2 m and 0 5 m from the river during the ws and ds respectively which is consistent with the results obtained from the hydrochemical analysis and the linear mixing model rda was used to elucidate the effects of environmental factors on the microbial communities consistent with previous reports lin et al 2012 zhu et al 2019a the main influencing factors in shaping the microbial community structure varied with the seasonal changes due to the fact that there were different spatial differences in the hydrochemical parameters between the different seasons table 2 during the ws the first two axes rda 1 and rda 2 explained 45 99 and 21 69 of the total microbial community variation while they explained 67 29 and 10 65 during the ds fig s4 a among all the environmental factors analyzed ph cl hco3 ec and toc were significant drivers of the composition and distribution of the bacterial community during the ws in contrast during the ds the microbial communities were significantly correlated with the do cl and ec values but showed no significant correlations with other environmental factors fig s4 b these identified major environmental variables that acted as the dominant drivers to determine the microbial community composition in lotic freshwater ecosystems have also been demonstrated by a number of other studies gao et al 2017 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2012 as they reported that changes in these variables would force the microbial communities to adjust the substrate use efficiency through the alteration of enzyme activities gene expression and physiological reactions which ultimately affects species competition and success and leads to changes in species dominance 4 conclusions hydrochemical data and microbial community analyses were combined to investigate the gw sw interactions in the hz of the liuxi river basin southern china the results demonstrated that the river at this study site was a gaining stream with river water infiltration events of short durations hydrochemical and biological analyses together with the results of the linear mixing model revealed a distinct temporal heterogeneity in the gw sw interactions with the interaction zone being within a distance of 2 0 and 0 5 m from the river in the ws and ds respectively the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method also revealed that the infiltration distance of river water into the riparian aquifer was to be 0 52 m in the ds the concentrations of major ions and ec in the gw within the gw sw interaction zone exhibited intermediate characteristics between that of the river water and the localized background gw in addition the gw within the gw sw interaction zone contained mixtures of microbial components in the river water and background gw denitrification was observed at the gw sw interaction zone this study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and the microbial community structure for the determination of gw sw interactions more importantly the extent of the gw sw interactions identified here can provide data support for decisionmakers to design a more scientific and safe space distance for maintaining the security of the liuxi river ecosystem despite these good results there are still some limitations such as the 2 day monitoring periods in the ws and ds were somewhat short on the time scales in future studies the monitoring periods must be extended to month and annual scales in order to obtain more information about the patterns and extent of sw gw interactions credit authorship contribution

5749,the characterization of groundwater gw and surface water sw interaction in riparian zones is of decisive importance for purifying and maintaining the water quality and for protecting the riverine ecosystem through intensive monitoring using a combination of hydrochemical and biological analyses of the riparian gw and sw in the liuxi river basin china the spatial temporal patterns and extent of gw sw interactions were qualitatively and quantitatively identified the similarity of dynamic changes in the river water and gw levels reflected the hydrological connectivity between the river water and riparian gw the discontinuity of the concentration in the majority of water chemistry parameters delineated the gw sw interaction chemical boundaries as being within a distance of 2 and 0 5 m from the river in the wet and dry seasons respectively the gw in the gw sw interaction zone was characterized as having lower levels of dissolved oxygen and nitrate moderate levels of electrical conductivity and major ions and higher total organic carbon values the percentage of river water in riparian gw increased with the proximity to the river from 9 0 to 68 8 in the wet season ws to 6 0 23 1 in the dry season ds the extent of gw sw interactions was quantitatively identified by the chloride mass balance to be within 2 and 0 5 m from the river in the ws and ds respectively based on the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the exchange width of river water and gw was calculated to be 0 52 m in the ds as well the analyses of microbial data demonstrated that gw samples within a distance of 2 m in the ws and 0 5 m in the ds exhibited a unique microbial community structure that contained a mixture of microbial components in the river water and background gw indicative of the gw sw mixing the gw sw interaction microbial boundaries were consistent with the chemical boundaries in both seasons this study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and microbial community structure for the determination of gw sw interactions keywords groundwater surface water interactions microbial communities principal coordinates analysis liuxi river 1 introduction surface water sw and groundwater gw are two interconnected components in a river basin system wang et al 2018b the exchange of water solute and energy between a river and a riparian aquifer frequently occurs in the hyporheic zone hz a subsurface area below and adjacent to the stream channel where gw mixes with sw through lateral vertical and longitudinal flows kumar et al 2009 merill and tonjes 2014 gw sw interactions in the hz create distinct physical chemical and biological gradients danczak et al 2016 harjung et al 2019 making the hz to be a reactive zone with high biogeochemical activity and chemical transformation rates fellows et al 2001 shen et al 2019 water pollution caused by heavy metals nutrients and organic compounds can be attenuated through adsorption on the sediment soil solid phase and chemical and biological degradation or transformation coupled with the high biogeochemical activity in the aquifers of the hz gandy et al 2007 roley et al 2012 weatherill et al 2018 consequently the hz is regarded as the liver of the river fischer et al 2005 gw sw interactions generally represent a high temporal and spatial variability mainly due to such factors as the geomorphology song et al 2019 subsurface hydraulic properties siergieiev et al 2015 song et al 2017 precipitation regimes dudley southern and binley 2015 and stream and gw flow patterns malzone et al 2016 in addition changes in the precipitation regimes resulting from recent global climate change and intensive human activities such as domestic water consumption and hydraulic construction have a pronounced impact on the water level of various water bodies in a basin leading to more frequent complex and drastic gw sw interaction patterns and imposing considerable stress on the hz and river ecosystems hancock 2002 sawyer et al 2009 zhou et al 2014 previous research indicated that the migration transformation and fate of chemicals in the hz were closely related to the magnitude timescale location and timing of the gw sw interactions byrne et al 2015 lautz and fanelli 2008 thus the investigation of the patterns and extent of gw sw interactions is of great importance for understanding the biogeochemical cycling of substances and the natural attenuation of artificial pollutants in the hz krause et al 2011 and for providing a scientific management strategy for the water resources in a river basin various methods including those based on darcy s law zhu et al 2019b numerical modeling lautz and siegel 2006 hydrochemical analysis martinez et al 2015 and multivariate statistics kumar et al 2009 have been developed to investigate the gw sw interaction patterns certain assumptions must be made when applying these methods and the methods differ in resolution sampled volume and time scale kalbus et al 2006 therefore a combination of multiple approaches which can considerably reduce their individual uncertainties is strongly recommended and highlighted in recent studies kong et al 2019 menció et al 2014 however the majority of studies have mainly focused on the physical and hydrochemical methods martinez et al 2015 with little available information on the application of microbiological analysis to characterize the gw sw interactions and stream aquifer connectivity van driezum et al 2018 microbes as a sensitive indicator of the variation of hydrodynamic conditions and physicochemical parameters lin et al 2012 zhou et al 2012 have been proposed for characterizing the dynamic processes of gw sw interactions febria et al 2011 nogaro et al 2013 more importantly microorganisms are extensively involved in many of the biogeochemical and attenuation processes occurring in the hz therefore the integration of microbial analysis and hydrochemical approaches will provide new insight into the dynamics of gw sw interactions the liuxi river is located in guangzhou city one of the most economically developed areas in china the river provides 60 of the potable water supply for the city in recent decades however the liuxi river basin has experienced rapid urbanization and intensive agricultural and tourist development leading to the deterioration of the water quality and varying degrees of damage in the riparian zones ji et al 2015 water pollution induced by the continually increasing concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus was responsible for the abandonment of drinking water sources in 2010 jiang et al 2014 the water resource shortage has created a bottleneck to the further social and economic development of guangzhou moreover with the dramatic increase in the construction of water conservancy projects e g dams and hydropower stations in recent years both the patterns and the fluxes of gw sw exchange in the basin have undergone considerable changes yang et al 2019 under such circumstances the guangzhou municipal government issued conservation regulations for the liuxi river basin to protect the water bodies and riparian areas from eco environmental deterioration however few explicit studies on the gw sw interaction patterns and extent in the liuxi river basin are available to support the relevant policymaking therefore the objectives of the present study were to integrate the hydrochemical and microbial analyses to 1 characterize the spatial temporal signatures of the hydrochemistry and microorganisms of the sw and gw 2 identify the spatial temporal patterns of the gw sw interactions and 3 quantitatively determine the boundary of the hz at the study site the research results can provide scientific support for the control of water pollution and the rational allocation of land resources as well as for maintaining the ecosystem health of the liuxi river 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the liuxi river with a length of 171 km and a basin area of 2300 km2 is located in guangzhou city southern china fig 1 a it has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature of 20 3 c and precipitation of 2143 8 mm due to the effect of the east asian monsoonal circulation the majority of the rainfall approximately 80 occurs during the wet season from april to september the main land use type is forest which covers approximately 59 4 of the total area followed by cultivated land with 31 3 coverage the remainder is occupied by built up areas wang 2018 the soil parent rocks are primarily granite in the presence of quartzite and shale the gw in the study area is classified into three types phreatic karst and fissure water zhang et al 2017b the aquifers of both the phreatic and fissure gw consist mainly of fine sandstone silt sandstone and clay sandstone from the holocene and quaternary periods precipitation is the primary recharge source for the gw and river water since the 1960s hydraulic engineering such as reservoir and diversion projects has been conducted in the upstream area periodically affecting the river water table due to the discharge li 2007 the study site 113 37 e 23 34 n is located in a riparian zone of the liuxi river fig 1 the width of the river cross section is approximately 210 m around the study site the riparian zone at the study site is relatively flat and surrounded by longan trees the grain size analysis of core samples from the riparian zone showed that the sediment at the study transect consisted mainly of sand and silt 2 2 monitoring methods five piezometers a b c d and e were installed along a transect perpendicular to the liuxi river fig 1 b the distances of piezometers a e from the river were 0 5 1 0 2 0 5 0 and 10 0 m respectively the piezometers were made of pvc pipes 7 5 cm diameter several holes 0 5 mm diameter were drilled within 50 cm from the bottom of the pvc pipes and wrapped with nylon mesh 0 22 mm for the gw percolation the bottom of the pvc pipes was sealed with a lid to collect gw a portable gps combined with a laser tachymeter trimble gps was used to record the geographical location and elevation of each sampling site the piezometer at each site was extended to 1 6 m below the ground surface a 47 cm horizontal line below the ground surface was identified as the reference level 0 m the pressure in both the river and the piezometers was automatically recorded by cdt sensors at 5 min intervals and was calibrated to the air pressure to reflect dynamic changes in the water table of the varied water bodies the precipitation was recorded at 1 min intervals by a portable weather station wxt520 vaisala corp germany during the installation of the piezometers samples of undisturbed soil were collected using 100 cm3 cutting rings at 10 cm vertical intervals to determine the soil porosity n e and hydraulic conductivity k the resulting average n e and k values were approximately 0 35 and 1 69 10 4 m s 1 respectively the soil grain size distribution was analyzed using a laser particle analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern panalytical malvern uk 2 3 water sample collection and analysis 2 3 1 water sample collection water samples were collected from each piezometer and the liuxi river every 6 h for 48 h in the wet season ws 07 23 07 25 and the dry season ds 11 13 11 15 of 2018 to ensure the collection of new groundwater stagnant water in each piezometer was pumped out by a peristaltic pump prior to sampling water samples were then collected into separate 1l polythene plastic bottles to minimize contact between the groundwater and air as well as prevent air bubbles from becoming trapped in the bottles groundwater was pumped directly through a tube ending at the bottom of a bottle at a low flow rate 1 l min 1 while allowing water to flow into bottle for several seconds river samples were taken at 1 m from the riverbank a total of 80 gw samples and 16 river water samples were collected electrical conductivity ec ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature t were measured in situ using hach portable meters hq40d samples of both the gw and river water were filtered through a 0 45 mm cellulose acetate membrane syringe filter for the analysis of major ions a portion of the filtered water samples was acidified with 1 m hno3 for the analysis of cations the remaining water samples were stored at 4 c under dark conditions upon arrival at the laboratory in addition a 1 l volume of water samples was filtered through polycarbonate filters with a pore size of 0 2 μm millipore billerica usa and then quickly transported to the laboratory and frozen at 20 c until dna extraction all experimental materials used for the microbial analysis were sterilized in an autoclave prior to the collection of water samples 2 3 2 water chemistry measurements major anions cl so4 2 and no3 were

the quality of the extracted dna was checked using standard agarose gel electrophoresis and the dna was stored at 20 c dna concentrations were determined using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer the v4 region of bacterial 16s rrna was amplified using a primer set 515f and 806r targeting this sequence kozich et al 2013 zhu et al 2019a pcr amplicons were sequenced on the illumina miseq platform at beijing biomarker technologies sequences were analyzed using qiime and uparse software with the default settings to obtain effective tags and operational taxonomic units otus caporaso et al 2010 edgar 2013 the uparse pipeline was then used for taxonomic assignment at the 97 similarity level via the ribosomal database project naïve bayesian classifier v 2 2 wang et al 2007 trained on the silva database version 123 using a 0 8 confidence level as the cutoff point quast et al 2013 the mothur package was used to calculate the abundance based coverage estimator ace and shannon s index of diversity schloss et al 2009 2 4 analysis methods 2 4 1 linear mixing model chloride cl was used as a conservative tracer to assess the mixing ratio of river water and gw within the hyporheic zone specifically the proportion of river water in each piezometer f riv was calculated at each sampling period using a linear mixing model as follows danczak et al 2016 trauth et al 2018 1 f riv c i c g c r c g where c i c r and c g are the cl concentrations in the piezometers river and gw end members respectively in the present study the hyporheic zone was characterized as a transitional area that contains more than 10 river water triska et al 1993 2 4 2 one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law a one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law was conducted to determine how far a water parcel would infiltrate the riverbank gerecht et al 2011 liu et al 2018 according to gerecht et al 2011 and liu et al 2018 the maximum infiltration distance of river water into the riparian aquifer during downward flow hereafter referred to as the exchange width can be calculated as follows 2 l t 1 t 2 k h x t n e x d t where l is the exchange width m δ t t 2 t 1 is the river infiltration period d h is the hydraulic head m x is the distance from the river m t is the time d and n e is the porosity dimensionless 2 4 3 statistical analysis differences in the values of the hydrochemical parameters between the sampling sites and periods were determined using duncan s multiple range tests with p 0 05 indicating a statistical significance hierarchical cluster analyses hca with euclidean distances were employed to quantitatively investigate the relationships between the hydrochemical datasets of the sampling sites gogoi et al 2016 all statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss software principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed to phylogenetically cluster the normalized 16s rrna sequences set among the water samples based on the unweighted unifrac algorithm lozupone and knight 2005 redundancy analysis rda was applied to elucidate the relationship between the microbial community and the environmental factors pcoa and rda were conducted with the r software package v 3 4 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 field survey parameters and chemistry 3 1 1 hydrological conditions the observed water levels for the liuxi river r and the piezometers a e in the ws and ds are illustrated in fig 2 a and b respectively regarding the ws three precipitation events differing in amount intensity and duration were observed table 1 during precipitation events 1 2 and 3 the river water levels respectively increased by 20 4 6 4 and 16 4 cm at the peak flow accompanied by fluctuations of 4 5 17 6 cm in the gw levels of piezometers a d table 1 in the ds the river water level also showed a pronouncedly fluctuating trend with no rainfall events during the investigated period this is considered to be closely associated with the upstream discharge of the liuxi river reservoir as previous research reported a dam induced hyporheic exchange and subsequent frequent and periodic oscillations of the shoreside gw levels sawyer et al 2009 it was obvious that the river water table increased by 10 3 cm during the period of 11 14 6 00 to 11 14 20 00 and the corresponding increase in the gw levels reached 5 2 6 5 cm at piezometers a d implying a distinct hydrological connectivity between piezometers a d and the river additionally due to the damping effect of the riparian aquifer cloutier et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2009 the amplitude of the gw fluctuations decreased with an increasing distance from the river regardless of the season fig 2 a b and table 1 the water table at piezometer e remained the lowest level throughout the two investigated periods which might be related to its unique geological conditions furthermore as shown in fig 2 a and b the damping effect induced a delayed response of the gw table to the river water stage the time lag of the gw fluctuations increased from approximately 20 100 min at piezometers a d with an increasing distance to the riverbank fig 2 c and d show the hydraulic gradients between the piezometers and the river in principle river water infiltrates the gw when a negative hydraulic gradient is established conversely a positive hydraulic gradient drives the gw into the river fig 2 c and d show whether infiltration or exfiltration occurs but not the volume of water passing the sediment water interface as it is well known that the amount of water infiltration or exfiltration depends not only on the hydraulic gradient but also on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment lewandowski et al 2009 during the ws two short periods of infiltration piezometers a d occurred in the investigated two day period after an increase in the river water levels caused by precipitation event 1 and 3 precipitation event 2 with a low magnitude 1 9 mm table 1 produced an increase of 6 4 cm in the river water level which was not sufficient to reverse the gradient between the piezometers and the river and thus no infiltration occurred during the ds only one short period of infiltration piezometer a occurred moreover as shown in fig 2 c and d infiltration events were usually of short duration and exfiltration predominated overall the river at this section was a gaining stream additionally the amplitudes of the hydraulic gradient were damped with an increasing distance from the river in particular the hydraulic gradient between piezometer d and the river water remained relatively more stable 3 1 2 hydrochemistry characteristics table 2 presents the statistical values for the major chemical components of the river water and gw in different seasons the ph values of the river water and gw ranged from 5 5 to 7 9 with a higher average value found in the river water 7 2 compared to that in gw 6 4 and no significant seasonal variations were observed in either the river water or the gw the temperatures in the river water and gw were higher in the ws mean range 27 9 28 9 than in the ds 23 6 4 2 the river water had the highest do concentrations with a range of 6 43 8 90 mg l 1 the do levels in the river water were higher in the ds than in the ws due to the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen in water unlike the river water the gw showed a slight seasonal variation table 2 the average concentrations of do in the gw varied between 3 69 and 4 95 mg l 1 in the ws while it ranged from 4 11 to 4 39 mg l 1 in the ds as the river water had much higher do levels than the gw downwelling river water that infiltrated the aquifer can supply do for the gw theoretically the gw from piezometers a b close to the river should have higher do concentrations than that from other piezometers due to the impact of river water infiltration however the do values of the gw at these two piezometers were significantly lower compared to the values at other piezometers in the ws as the temperature of the gw at each piezometer was similar the lower do concentrations at these sites cannot be explained by the temperature dependent solubility of oxygen while indicating significant do consumption by community respiration in fact studies have shown that riparian zones are active areas for microbial respiration due to the gw sw interactions fellows et al 2001 mader et al 2018 the mean ec value in the river water 62 3 μs cm 1 was much lower than that in the gw 165 0 μs cm 1 no significant seasonal variation was observed in the mean ec values of the river water however the mean ec values of the gw in the ws were significantly lower than that in the ds due to the dilution effect of precipitation ec is a relatively conservative tracer by observing the change in ec in a piezometer during the short 48 h sampling period it is possible to infer whether or not gw sw mixing has occurred at that site briody et al 2016 the coefficient of variation cv represents the degree of change in a parameter across a sampling period providing an indication of the degree to which river water has been introduced into the riparian gw briody et al 2016 based on the cv values mixing was most pronounced at piezometers a c and at piezometer a during the ws and ds respectively in both seasons the cvs of d and e were relatively low 6 indicating that the ec values of these two sites were relatively stable and not influenced by the fluctuations of gw sw mixing furthermore the ec values of the gw at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds were between that of the river water and piezometer e demonstrating that the riparian aquifer at a distance of up to 2 and 0 5 m had been influenced by dilution from the infiltrating river water during the ws and ds respectively a piper diagram based on the major ion concentrations is plotted in fig s1 to investigate the hydrochemical characteristics of the water samples the dominant hydrochemical type of both the river water and gw was identified as hco3 ca which may be mainly associated with the calcite and dolomite dissolution in the river basin yang et al 2019 on the other hand the proportion of several major ions exhibited differences among the sites in general the concentrations of major ions at piezometers a c exhibited intermediate characteristics between the river water and piezometers d e fig s2 furthermore the magnitude of the chemical gradients varied significantly taking cl as an example similar to the variation observed in ec the concentrations of cl at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds had higher cv values than that of other piezometers whereas the values were relatively constant at piezometer e additionally the cl concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws and a in the ds exhibited significant differences between the river water and piezometer e as well these observations are consistent with the dilution effects of the river water with river water infiltration being particularly marked at piezometers a c and a during the ws and ds respectively due to the relatively stable and higher ec values and major ion concentrations at piezometer e during the investigated periods of both seasons piezometer e was assumed to be the localized background gw site in the present study hca was performed to identify the similarity of sampling locations based on the hydrochemical parameters such as ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 hco3 cl t ph and do as shown in fig s2 three groups of sites were found in both seasons in the ws group i consisted of sites d and e which were located relatively far from the river and exhibited significant dissimilarities with all other samples group iii comprised sites a c that linked to group ii representing only the river water this suggested that sites a c were likely predominantly influenced by the river water in the ds group i represented the river water whereas group iii consisted of sites a d and showed a close relationship with group ii comprising only site e probably indicating a dominate effect of the background gw piezometer e on piezometers a d 3 1 3 c and n characteristics the toc values in the river water and gw ranged from 1 61 to 25 2 mg l 1 obvious seasonal variations of the toc values were observed at piezometers a c but not at the river water and piezometers d e table 2 the average toc concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws 9 45 mg l 1 were significantly higher than that in the ds 2 93 mg l 1 in addition the toc concentrations at piezometers a c showed greater variability and were significantly higher than those at the river water and piezometers d e during the ws whereas they showed no significant differences p 0 05 among the investigated sites with little changes in their cv values during the ds table 2 shen et al 2019 reported similar results and revealed that the river water infiltration into the riparian aquifer carried exogenous organic carbon from the overlying clay into the gw thus the spatial temporal variation of the toc values at the study site indicated that the river water infiltration was remarkably significant at piezometers a c in the ws the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n in all water samples were in the range of 0 04 3 11 mg l 1 and 0 01 1 42 mg l 1 respectively high no3 n concentrations mean of 0 68 mg l 1 and low nh4 n concentrations mean of 0 32 mg l were observed in the aerobic river water with high do concentrations mean of 7 75 mg l 1 implying that the oxidation of ammonium was occurring in the river water contrary to the river water low no3 n concentrations mean of 0 42 mg l 1 and high nh4 n concentrations mean of 1 00 mg l 1 were found in the gw samples with low concentrations of do mean of 4 22 mg l 1 table 2 likely indicating an anaerobic and reduced environment within the gw significant seasonal variations of nh4 concentrations were displayed in both the river water and gw the nh4 concentrations of the river water in the ws were much higher than that in the ds because of the larger amount of nh4 inputs from non point sources yan et al 1999 while the nh4 concentrations of the gw demonstrated the opposite seasonal variation due to the dilution effect of the larger rainfall in the ws wang 2018 spatially no obvious differences were observed in the gw during both seasons in contrast the no3 concentrations exhibited no distinct seasonal variations in either the river water or gw however in terms of the spatial distribution the no3 concentration at piezometer a was significantly lower than that at the river water and the other piezometers in the ds while there were no significant differences among the sites in the ws although no significant differences existed we still detected slightly lower no3 n concentrations at piezometers a c compared to that at the river water and piezometer d in the ws gw sw interactions have proven to be a key control in the occurrence of denitrification and no3 removal in riparian zones roley et al 2012 trauth et al 2018 as reported by briody et al 2016 if denitrification occurs one can expect to observe a removal trend in which high no3 concentrations and the values of no3 cl decrease with the assumption that cl is conservative briody et al 2016 therefore to examine whether or not no3 is removed the no3 cl values were further analyzed and are shown in table 2 the no3 concentrations and the values of no3 cl were found to decrease within a distance of 2 and 0 5 m from the river during the ws and ds table 2 respectively furthermore abundant organic carbon a suboxic redox environment and a number of denitrifiers present at piezometers a c table 2 and fig 4 were favorable for denitrification therefore the lower no3 concentrations at piezometers a c in the ws and piezometer a in the ds indicated that denitrification occurred at those sites in view of the environmental and human health risks the no3 concentrations in the river water and gw were all below the maximum contaminant levels mcl 10 mg l 1n set by the world health organization who while the nh4 n concentrations exceeded the mcl of who 0 16 mg l 1 in 6 and 81 of the river water and gw samples respectively the degree of nh4 pollution was higher in the gw than in the river water and high nh4 persisted within the aquifer over the two sampling periods considering that the study site was surrounded by longan trees the application of ammonium fertilizer was the main reason for the high nh4 concentrations in the gw and the gw represents a potential source of nh4 in this river system 3 2 gw sw interactions analysis with the linear mixing model and one dimensional numerical particle tracking method 3 2 1 quantitative analysis with the linear mixing model the linear mixing model based on the chloride mass balance eq 1 is used to identify and quantify the gw sw interaction as discussed in section 3 1 2 the hydrochemical parameters in piezometer e during the 48 h sampling campaigns in both seasons were relatively stable and could be considered as the background gw therefore in this study the average cl concentrations at sites r and e are regarded as the river water c r and gw end member values c g respectively the calculated proportions of river water in the riparian gw f riv for each sampling period are presented in fig 3 the f riv values ranged from 7 7 to 85 1 with a mean value of 49 2 in the ws fig 3 a while they fluctuated from 1 7 to 37 2 with an average value of 11 6 in the ds fig 3 b the higher f riv values in the ws were mainly due to the large amounts of precipitation that raised the river water levels resulting in an increase in the river water table and the subsequent infiltration of the aquifers in terms of the spatial variation the percentage of river water decreased with an increasing distance from the river in both seasons fig 3 the mean values of f riv at sites a b c and d with a distance of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 5 0 m from the river were 68 8 64 6 54 8 and 9 0 in the ws and 23 1 9 4 7 7 and 6 0 in the ds respectively showing a distinct heterogeneity in the gw sw interaction over time with the interaction zone being within a distance of 2 0 and 0 5 m 3 2 2 simple calculation of gw sw exchange width using the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method based on darcy s law was applied to calculate the gw sw exchange width at the study site the soil porosity n e and hydraulic conductivity k were determined to be 0 35 and 1 69 10 4 m s 1 respectively as shown in fig 2 the infiltration duration of the river water caused by the peak stages is approximately 5 h in the ws and 6 h in the ds and the maximum hydraulic gradients were determined to be 0 09 and 0 05 respectively based on the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method the maximum exchange width l was calculated to be 0 78 and 0 52 m during the ws and ds respectively during the ds the maximum exchange width of 0 52 m was similar to that calculated from the linear mixing model l 0 50 m however during the ws the maximum exchange width of 0 78 m was much lower than that calculated from the linear mixing model within 2 m from the river there are errors with the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method because the calculations are based on a couple of simplifications such as not considering the mixing at the boundary of the infiltrating sw and retreating gw therefore it is reasonable to assume that the maximum exchange width of the gw sw interaction is within 2 0 m from the river during the investigated periods 3 3 interpretation for gw sw interactions with microbial data 3 3 1 microbial community structure the observed richness chao1 indices ranged from 536 to 1083 and from 401 to 570 during the ws and ds respectively fig s3 a the diversity of the microbial community was estimated using the shannon index zhu et al 2019a which varied from 3 81 to 5 51 and from 3 56 to 4 46 respectively fig s3 b all samples except e from the ds exhibited lower diversities compared with those from the ws this is considered to be closely related to the wetter conditions higher toc and higher temperatures in the ws which promote the growth of bacteria zhu et al 2019a additionally exogenous microbes carried by precipitation and runoff in the ws might be another important cause spatially the gw had a relatively higher richness and diversity than that of the river water in both seasons fig s3 it is notable that the relatively high nh4 concentrations and toc in the gw table 2 might favor the growth of microorganisms the sequence tags of the dominant phyla in each sample are presented in fig 4 a and fig 4 b for the river water three phyla proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes collectively contained 93 of the successfully identified phyla tags for the gw samples proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum with a relative abundance of 50 7 and the following top nine phyla were actinobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes deinococcus thermus acidobacteria nitrospirae cyanobacteria chloroflexi and gemmatimonadetes these bacteria are broadly similar to other freshwater communities as 90 of the sequence tags from other freshwater aquatic environments have been classified within the proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and firmicutes in other studies zhu et al 2019a overall proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in all samples except r1 and the abundance of proteobacteria ranked as piezometers d e piezometers a c r along the lateral direction in both seasons for a more detailed analysis of the composition of microbial communities all tags assigned to the phylum species were further classified into the genus level in the river water samples hgci clade exhibited the highest abundances in both seasons fig 4 c and d which was likely associated with the eutrophication of water bodies as the sporadic coverage of hyacinth was found around the study site this can be supported by a previous report that hgci clade is related to the development of water eutrophication positively correlated with chlorophyll a zhang et al 2017a unlike river water the distribution of microbes in the gw samples was more complex during the ws the following genera were identified as the dominant bacteria including acinetobacter cupriavidus massilia methylobacterium pseudogulbenkiania pseudomonas sphingomonas and vogesella with the mean relative abundance ranging from 2 2 to 6 0 during the ds aquabacterium comamonas cupriavidus dechloromonas deinococcus massilia methylobacterium pseudogulbenkiania sphingomonas and vogesella were the dominant genera and the mean relative abundances of these genera were within the range of 1 6 8 7 more importantly the genera such as acinetobacter aquabacterium comamonas dechloromonas methylobacterium pseudomonas pseudogulbenkiania sphingomonas and vogesella have been reported as potential denitrifiers guo et al 2018 heylen et al 2006 patureau et al 2000 yao et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 3 3 2 statistical comparison of the 16s rrna gene sequences among water samples pcoa based on an unweighted unifrac algorithm was applied to analyze the similarity of microbial communities at different sites as shown in fig 5 the bacterial communities of the samples formed three distinct clusters in both two seasons in the ws group i was composed of river water samples r1 and r2 with a relatively high abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroides group iii contained samples from piezometers d e that were chemically dominated by background gw and had a relatively high abundance of firmicutes nitrospirae acidobacteria chloroflex and deinococcus thermus the samples from piezometers a c were clustered into an independent group ii as shown in fig 4 a the bacterial structure of piezometers a c was similar to that of the river water r1 and r2 but the relative abundances of several bacteria such as firmicutes nitrospirae acidobacteria and deinococcus thermus were much greater in the gw of these piezometers than in the river water group ii had characteristics intermediate between groups i and iii indicative of the mixing of river water and gw regarding the ds similar to group i in the ws the river water r1 and r2 was clustered into a group group i with a relatively high abundance of actinobacteria and bacteroides almost all gw samples with the exception of samples a1 that had a relatively high abundance of deinococcus thermus and nitrospirae constituted group iii however samples a1 were separated into the independent groups ii samples a1 contained mixtures of microbial components in the river water r and background gw d e suggesting that piezometer a was affected by gw sw mixing the results of the cluster analysis revealed that gw sw mixing occurred at piezometers a c and piezometer a with a distance of 2 m and 0 5 m from the river during the ws and ds respectively which is consistent with the results obtained from the hydrochemical analysis and the linear mixing model rda was used to elucidate the effects of environmental factors on the microbial communities consistent with previous reports lin et al 2012 zhu et al 2019a the main influencing factors in shaping the microbial community structure varied with the seasonal changes due to the fact that there were different spatial differences in the hydrochemical parameters between the different seasons table 2 during the ws the first two axes rda 1 and rda 2 explained 45 99 and 21 69 of the total microbial community variation while they explained 67 29 and 10 65 during the ds fig s4 a among all the environmental factors analyzed ph cl hco3 ec and toc were significant drivers of the composition and distribution of the bacterial community during the ws in contrast during the ds the microbial communities were significantly correlated with the do cl and ec values but showed no significant correlations with other environmental factors fig s4 b these identified major environmental variables that acted as the dominant drivers to determine the microbial community composition in lotic freshwater ecosystems have also been demonstrated by a number of other studies gao et al 2017 liao et al 2019 wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2012 as they reported that changes in these variables would force the microbial communities to adjust the substrate use efficiency through the alteration of enzyme activities gene expression and physiological reactions which ultimately affects species competition and success and leads to changes in species dominance 4 conclusions hydrochemical data and microbial community analyses were combined to investigate the gw sw interactions in the hz of the liuxi river basin southern china the results demonstrated that the river at this study site was a gaining stream with river water infiltration events of short durations hydrochemical and biological analyses together with the results of the linear mixing model revealed a distinct temporal heterogeneity in the gw sw interactions with the interaction zone being within a distance of 2 0 and 0 5 m from the river in the ws and ds respectively the one dimensional numerical particle tracking method also revealed that the infiltration distance of river water into the riparian aquifer was to be 0 52 m in the ds the concentrations of major ions and ec in the gw within the gw sw interaction zone exhibited intermediate characteristics between that of the river water and the localized background gw in addition the gw within the gw sw interaction zone contained mixtures of microbial components in the river water and background gw denitrification was observed at the gw sw interaction zone this study demonstrated the effectiveness of an integrated approach combining hydrochemical data and the microbial community structure for the determination of gw sw interactions more importantly the extent of the gw sw interactions identified here can provide data support for decisionmakers to design a more scientific and safe space distance for maintaining the security of the liuxi river ecosystem despite these good results there are still some limitations such as the 2 day monitoring periods in the ws and ds were somewhat short on the time scales in future studies the monitoring periods must be extended to month and annual scales in order to obtain more information about the patterns and extent of sw gw interactions credit authorship contribution
