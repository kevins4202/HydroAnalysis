15430,contamination through per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas have occurred globally in soil and groundwater systems at military airport and industrial sites due to the often decades long periodic application of firefighting foams at pfas contaminated sites the unsaturated soil horizon often serves as a long term source for sustained pfas contamination for both groundwater and surface water runoff an understanding of the processes controlling future mass loading rates to the saturated zone from these source zones is imperative to design efficient remediation measures in the present study hydrochemical data from a site where pfas transport was observed as a result of the decades long application of afff were used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models that determine pfas mobility across the vadose zone under realistic field scale conditions the simulation results demonstrate that the climate driven physical flow processes within the vadose zone exert a dominating control on the retention of pfas prolonged periods of evapotranspiration exceeding rainfall under the semi arid conditions trigger periods of upward flux and evapoconcentration leading to the observed persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 metres of the vadose zone despite cessation of afff application to soils since more than a decade physico chemical retention mechanisms namely sorption to the air water interface awi and sediment surfaces contribute further to pfas retention the simulations demonstrate how pfas downward transport is effectively confined to short periods following discrete rain events when soils display a high degree of saturation during these periods awi sorption is at a minimum in addition high pfas concentrations measured and simulated below the source zone reduce the effect of the awi further due to a decrease in surface tension associated with elevated pfas concentrations consequently time integrated pfas migration and retardation illuminates that the field relevant pfas transport rates are predominantly controlled by the physical flow processes with a lower relative importance of awi and sediment sorption adding to pfas retention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas leaching vadose zone sorption air water interface numerical modelling 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of manufactured chemicals that have been widely used in australia and elsewhere since the 1950s in a range of industrial applications such as in textiles and leather in electronics food packaging and for fire fighting where pfas is used as an ingredient in aqueous film forming foams afff particularly over the past decade large scale soil and groundwater contamination has been reported and pfas have emerged as contaminants of critical concern significant impacts on soil and groundwater systems have occurred globally from civilian and military airports and industrial sites due to the often decades long periodic application of afff during training exercises to date remediation of affected sites for example in australia has often focussed on discrete afff source zones which serve as long term contaminant sources for vadose zones and groundwater brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 adamson et al 2020 recent studies into the behaviour of pfas within source zones have highlighted the important role of the unsaturated zone as a long term source for sustained pfas contamination for both groundwater and surface water runoff for instance høisæter et al 2019 reported 96 of total pfos to be retained within the upper 2 m of afff impacted soils at a firefighting training facility in norway 15 years after pfos use was terminated at a former fire training area on cape cod massachusetts the unsaturated zone was also shown to act as a continuous source for pfas mass transfer into the saturated zone more than 18 years after pfas surface application had ceased weber et al 2017 field data from source zones affected by afff in australia support this observation fig 1 given the low sorption affinity and therefore typically high mobility of pfas compounds the frequently documented persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 m of vadose zones despite cessation of pfas application to soils since many years davis et al 2021 is surprising and puzzling to better understand pfas retention and transport in source zones and to support the planning of effective and economical remediation efforts a range of potential physical and chemical retention mechanisms that act upon pfas compounds in the vadose zone have been closely studied over the past decade many of these studies focused on determining the extent of sorption of pfas onto common mineral surfaces such as ferrihydrite campos pereira et al 2020 goethite uwayezu et al 2019 and aluminium oxides wang et al 2011 as well as clay particles under controlled laboratory conditions zhao et al 2014 xiao et al 2011 based on the collected data distribution coefficients kd for the most common pfas compounds were established for example li et al 2018 provided a comprehensive review which concluded that laboratory derived median kd values for pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfhxa were 15 49 1 48 0 95 and 0 26 l kg respectively more recently several additional retention mechanisms have been uncovered most importantly the partitioning of pfas compounds to the air water interface awi within the vadose zone and also to nonaqueous phase liquids napls at sites where cross contamination exists several studies have attempted to quantify the impact of these retention mechanisms on pfas mobility for instance brusseau et al 2019 found a doubling of pfos retardation in water unsaturated soils compared to saturated soils due to air water interfacial adsorption guelfo and higgins 2013 observed in batch sorption experiments that the presence of napls decreased the sorption of pfos at low pfos concentrations 1 µg l but caused an increase in sorption at higher concentrations 500 ug l chen et al 2009 measured enhanced sorption of pfos in the presence of crude oil in an air dried soil in batch experiments the freundlich sorption coefficient rose from log kf 1 3 to log kf 2 24 when the amount of oil within the investigated soil was increased from 0 g kg 1 to 8 7 g kg 1 all the above sorption mechanisms were also found to be influenced by the pfas chain length e g campos pereira et al 2018 and solution chemistry especially the ionic strength the valence of cations and the ph tang et al 2010 brusseau and van glubt 2019 cai et al 2022 lyu and brusseau 2020 while elevated pfas concentration itself may reduce surface tension leading to enhanced surfactant induced flow sif e g costanza robinson and henry 2017 zeng and guo 2021 understandably most research addressing pfas mobility to date has been performed at the laboratory scale through column or batch experiments that provide homogeneous and or well mixed conditions many of these studies have benefited from additional quantification of observed processes through mathematical model frameworks e g silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 brusseau and guo 2022 which have greatly advanced the ability to describe pfas sorption behaviour mechanistically however comparatively little is still known about the field scale reactive transport behaviour of pfas compounds as they migrate across the vadose zone and how this affects the temporal evolution of the mass transfer into the saturated zone obviously in natural and therefore more heterogeneous systems it is much more difficult to discern which of the lab identified retention mechanisms are affecting pfas transport behaviour and to disentangle which processes exert a major control on the fate of the various pfas compounds clearly beyond sorption processes the fate of pfas compounds is also strongly affected by the physical flow and transport processes that persist within the vadose zone highly dynamic rainwater infiltration drainage evapotranspiration and particularly subsurface heterogeneities lead to complex transport behaviour for instance zeng and guo 2021 were able to demonstrate on the basis of synthetic soil profiles that inhomogeneities significantly influenced the pfas transport behaviour within the considered profiles preferential flow enhanced the saturation along pathways which consequently reduced the air water interfacial area and therefore pfas sorption leading to greatly enhance pfas travel times silva et al 2020 demonstrated on the basis of model simulations of synthetic 1d layered soil profiles how temporal soil moisture changes driven by infiltrating rain events led to temporal change in the air water interfacial area the latter was amplified under soil texture inhomogeneities we hypothesize that understanding hydraulic flow processes is crucial as they could at the field scale be equally or more important for determining pfas transport rates within and across the vadose zone than the physico chemical retention mechanisms currently however the relative importance of physical transport versus chemical retention processes on the overall pfas fate and transport within the vadose zone is a critical knowledge gap for source zones where afff has been applied numerical modelling has been shown to provide a useful framework to integrate quantify and ultimately better understand complex solute and reactive transport processes and their interactions across multiple scales e g siade et al 2021 in the present study hydrochemical data from an afff affected source zone where pfas transport was observed as a result of the application of afff over several decades were used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models quantifying pfas mobility across the vadose zone under realistic field scale conditions this will underpin a better understanding of the historic pfas fate predictions of future mass loading rates to the saturated zone and it will greatly aid the design of efficient remediation measures we use laboratory determined sorption parameters and measured pfas concentration depth profiles as constraints to guide the development and calibration of a vadose zone numerical model that simulates the long term evolution of pfas transport across the vadose zone the results are used to assess the relative importance of physical flow and transport processes on the overall pfas mobility and mass loading rates 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the selected study site is representative of many other similarly pfas impacted sites it is located on australian commonwealth land where training with afff occurred over several decades usage of 3m light watertm started in the 1970 s and continued until approximately 2005 on the site when light watertm was phased out and replaced with ansulite over several years although ansulite also contains pfas the chemistry is based on fluorotelomers rather than perfluoroalkyl sulfonates thus the signature of residual pfas is distinctly different and concentrations of pfos and pfhxs can be attributed confidently to the earlier use of light watertm details of afff usage over this time were however not recorded and similar to many other sites worldwide no robust estimates for the rates of pfas mass inputs into the vadose zone are therefore available sampling campaigns starting in 2008 and in subsequent years revealed that pfas contaminated soils and groundwater were widespread across the site pfas concentrations in soils ranged up to 164 mg kg pfos pfhxs at different afff source zones while groundwater concentrations of up to 11 6 mg l pfos pfhxs were recorded on site defence esdat database accessed 13 03 2019 the unsaturated zone at the study site is composed of quaternary aged sediments that comprise a sequence of fluvial and alluvial deposits clay and silt deposits predominate however interbedded are lenses and layers of sand gravel pebbles and up to boulder size sediments consequently the hydraulic permeability of the subsurface is highly variable a core drilled at the site documents a generally clay rich soil 31 to 55 clay within the 2 mm fraction with a low organic carbon content average of 0 1 the depth to groundwater is about 4 to 10 m across the site temporal groundwater table variations are generally low with standard deviation of groundwater head data remaining below 0 5 m in 85 of bores the climate is mediterranean with mild wet winters and hot dry summers long term records of climate data are available through a weather station located at the field site operated by the bureau of meteorology the median yearly precipitation is 426 9 mm yr 1972 2021 while the mean potential a pan yearly evaporation is 2080 mm yr 1972 1999 the average yearly minimum and maximum air temperature is 11 2 and 22 7 c respectively 1972 2021 2 2 hydrochemical data collection as part of a detailed site investigation defence 2018 vertical pfas concentration profiles were determined in soils below several source zones fig 1 one of those source zones that exhibited a typical pfas depth profile was selected for the present numerical modelling study it is characterised by a maximum pfas soil concentration of about 5 000 μg kg at a depth of about 0 5 1 m and a depth to the water table of approximately 7 m the electrical conductivities of the porewaters in the vadose zone were measured in an uncontaminated core from the same field site and ranged between 230 and 1050 ms cm 2 3 numerical model simulator to elucidate and quantify the physical controls on the transport behaviour of pfas within the vadose zone we integrated and interpreted the detailed field observations that were collected at a selected source zone these data guided the development of numerical unsaturated zone models of pfas mobilisation and transport we apply the public domain numerical model leachm leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson 2003 leachm is a widely used unsaturated zone simulator e g sogbedji et al 2001a asada et al 2013 that has been extensively benchmarked against similar codes such as hydrus e g nolan et al 2005 sarmah et al 2006 ogorzalek et al 2008 it is a process based model that uses a finite difference approximation of the richards equation to solve for water flow and the convection dispersion equation to simulate solute transport in variably water saturated soils flow of water and solutes through the unsaturated zone is simulated in response to time varying precipitation evaporation transpiration temperature and runoff solutes are transported by advection dispersion and diffusion and may be retarded by sorption onto soil particles and or soil organic matter for this work leachm was extended to include sorption of pfas compounds to the air water interface awi following largely the approach of guo et al 2020 awi adsorption coefficients are calculated on the basis of surface tension which in turn is a function of soil temperature and solution composition equilibrium sorption was assumed for both solid phase and awi sorption the maximum air water interfacial area is thereby assumed to be the surface area of dry soil particles calculated from a geometric mean particle diameter soil particle size and textural class classification is usually based on clay and silt contents determined by sedimentation the australian size classification defines the upper limits of the clay fraction as 0 002 mm and the silt fraction 0 02 mm however laser diffraction analysis is more likely to reflect particle volume and fisher et al 2017 found that laser diffraction thresholds corresponding to sedimentation analysis thresholds of 0 002 mm and 0 2 mm were 0 009 mm and 0 026 mm these values along with an upper limit for sand of 2 mm are used to estimate geometric mean particle diameter dg mm 1 d g m i ln d i where mi is the mass fraction and di the arithmetic mean diameter of size class i the surface area of the dry bulk soil amax dm2 dm3 is estimated from geometric mean particle diameter mm soil bulk density σb kg dm3 and particle density σs kg dm3 is 2 a m a x 600 σ b d g σ s the awi area per unit soil volume aaw is assumed to vary linearly from zero at saturation s 1 to amax when the soil approaches dryness s 0 following the approach by kim et al 1997 3 a a w a m a x 1 s the air water interfacial adsorption coefficient using a temperature and solute dependent surface tension is calculated using the procedure described by guo et al 2020 surface tension γ n m is a function of temperature t c 4 γ 7 572 e 4 1 515 e 4 t the linear awi sorption coefficient kaw m3 m2 guo et al 2020 is 5 k a w 1 r t γ b a c o n c where r is

isotherms for the pfas compound of interest zeng et al 2021 the amount of chemical sorbed at the interface will depend on both kaw and the current awi area aaw the overall dimensionless retardation coefficient r will depend on both solid phase and awi sorption 6 r 1 σ b k d k a w a a w θ where kd is the solid phase sorption coefficient l kg 1 thus the effective kd value kdeff for solute transport calculated for each segment i at the start of each time step is 7 k d e f f i r θ i θ i ρ b i the awi sorption capability of the extended leachm code has been successfully benchmarked against guo et al 2020 and zeng et al 2021 supporting information a c it should be noted however that some of the model capabilities in guo et al 2020 are not replicated within the extended leachm code the approach taken in leachm was driven by the need to numerically describe field scale vadose zone systems with their inherent variability in textures accordingly a formulation that allows quantification of awi pfas sorption processes over a wide range of soil properties based on readily available soil survey data was chosen to ensure utility for actual site applications where measured data is often scarce this includes the quantification of the maximum air water interfacial area based on modified geometric mean particle diameters soil bulk and particle densities this provided maximum surface areas which are in general agreement with those reported in the relevant literature fig 6 and e g silva et al 2020 zeng and guo 2021 and which compared well against two frequently used surface area quantification methods i e the ethylene glycol and bet isotherm method evaluated on the basis of 21 different soils supporting information a however direct measurements of the soil surface area through e g aqueous phase interfacial partitioning tracer tests or synchrotron x ray microtomography may provide more accurate estimate of soil surface areas brusseau et al 2007 but this data would rarely be available for field scale settings in addition it also needs to be acknowledged that significant variability exists in the magnitude of soil surface areas depending on the measurement method employed costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 silva et al 2020 this inadvertently will impact on model accuracy in addition the modified leachm code does not take surfactant induced flow sif into account this simplification was based on results by zeng and guo 2021 who demonstrated that acceleration of vertical leaching and lateral spreading of pfas resulting from sif was minimal even under strongly elevated pfas porewater concentrations of up to 10 mg l silva et al 2020 derived at similar findings stating that pfas solution concentrations in excess of 10 mg l are needed before effects of surface tension on unsaturated flow would be noticeable we acknowledge that the approach taken is approximate recognising that the procedure and calculations can be refined for specific soils and chemicals evaluating simplifying numerical model approaches in the face of inherent field scale soil and porewater variability is considered an important area of future research 2 4 model approach decades long reactive transport of pfas compounds was studied for a one dimensional vertical soil profile model simulations were undertaken for a 50 year simulation period extending between the 1st january 1970 and the 31st december 2019 the temporal discretisation was variable throughout the simulation period decreasing with increasing flow rate with the maximum time step length set to 0 1 days the computed transient water fluxes served as the basis for the subsequent pfas transport simulations history matching for the pfas flow and transport model was achieved by comparing the measured total pfas concentration depth profiles with those simulated in 2020 as well as the groundwater recharge rates with previous recharge estimates that were based on a chloride mass balance the history matching process relied on a trial and error approach that involved the adjustment i of sediment sorption coefficients within the range of the laboratory measured kd values and ii of the water retention depths within plausible ranges to successively reduce discrepancies between simulated and observed pfas concentrations and groundwater recharge rates table 1 2 5 source zone model the simulated soil profile spanned over a depth interval of 7 m corresponding to the thickness of the unsaturated zone below the selected source zone the upper profile boundary condition was defined on the basis of daily climate data fig 2 silo daily rainfall mm temperature and potential evapotranspiration mm were obtained from the weather station located on the field site http www longpaddock qld gov au silo the lower boundary condition of the simulated soil profile was defined as a unit gradient boundary or free drainage this allowed drainage water to exit at a rate equal to the current hydraulic conductivity at the base of the model the fractions of clay silt and sand within the studied soil profile were obtained by sedimentation and sieve analysis from a soil core that was collected at the site fig 3 the measured organic matter content within that core was low throughout the entire profile ranging between 0 and 1 fig 3 the crop cover at the site was simulated as a grass species with a maximum root depth of 300 mm gras cover growth was set to start each year in april reaching a maximum cover at the end of june and ceasing growth in october actual evapotranspiration was calculated based on daily plant growth the soil moisture at the current rooting depth and the crop specific potential evapotranspiration soil bulk density was set at 1 6 kg dm3 and a porosity of 0 4 was assumed a slope of 0 5 was applied across the soil surface representative of the low surface gradient at the study site the profile was discretised into 100 mm thick model segments 2 6 pfas distribution coefficients and pfas application history to simulate pfas movement through the unsaturated zone linear equilibrium sorption was assumed the employed distribution coefficient koc was based on site specific data available through sorption experiments conducted on a soil core from the site table 1 navarro et al 2021 while individual depth profiles of pfhxs and pfos are available for the site which demonstrate a chromatographic effect due to compound specific sorption affinities fig 3 for the purposes of this study the pfas transport model applied an average koc representative of the cumulative movement of the total pfas mass through the vadose zone as for the vast majority of pfas affected sites detailed records of the pfas application history were not available instead a continuous annual application of pfas was assumed for the period between 1970 and 1995 in the model simulations a diluted afff solution was applied once per month to represent the regularly recurring fire training events during each event 10 mm of water per m2 were applied to the surface with the total pfas at concentrations of 8 mg l the applied pfas mass was based on the total pfas mass observed in the soil profile 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas migration characteristics the history matching process resulted in model simulations that provide a process based explanation of the field observations while employing highly plausible model parameter values a comparison between simulated and observed pfas concentration depth profiles which served as main model calibration constraint is shown in fig 3 the comparison illustrates a good agreement between the simulated and the observed pfas depth profiles with total pfas concentrations of 5 10 mg kg dominating the top 1 m of the soil profile before declining with depth the simulations reveal an overall slow movement of pfas through the unsaturated zone importantly the simulations provide a first mechanistic explanation as to why the main mass of pfas still resides in the upper 2 m of the unsaturated zone profile in 2020 despite afff application having ceased for more than 10 years fig 3 under the simulated conditions pfas mass discharge from the vadose zone into groundwater remains negligible even at the end of the simulation period at this time the simulated total pfas mass residing within the vadose zone profile has accumulated to 28 6 g m2 which compares well with the corresponding mass that was observed at the field site 27 g m2 the history matching process for the flow and pfas transport model determined an average groundwater recharge rate of 9 8 mm yr the simulated drainage rate from the vadose zone compares well to groundwater recharge rates that were estimates based on the chloride mass balance approach the latter established a range between 1 1 and 9 4 mm yr for the regional quaternary aquifer system which encompasses the field site bresciani et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the average groundwater recharge rate during the simulation period 1970 2020 accounts for only 5 of the recorded rainfall the majority of water loss from the vadose zone occurs through evaporation 51 of rainfall while transpiration accounts for 36 of the computed water loss with the remainder accounting for surface runoff fig 2 secondly the history matching determined that a composite koc value for the total pfas mass of 90 l kg was a reasonable approximation this value aligns well with both the experimentally determined kd values on the soil core obtained from the field site and literature values for the prevailing types of australian soils see table 1 3 2 evapo concentration key process for retaining pfas mass in shallow soil horizons the model simulation demonstrate that the slow downward migration is partly a consequence of the clay heavy lithology of the soils at the study site however the model additionally reveals that the pfas mass is retained within the shallow soil horizon due to upward migration of water and solutes during periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration these periods are frequent under the local climatic conditions illustrated in fig 4 a for an example period of 2 5 years between april 2003 and october 2005 the hydraulic regime induced by these climatic conditions leads to a persistently high pfas mass within the soil as well as within the porewater in the first ca 1 m of the soil profile comparative model simulations with and without evaporation and vegetation cover reveal that the retention of pfas within the shallow soil horizon is primarily related to the evapotranspiration process and the temporary upward water flux that is induced by it in fact the model simulations which omit the evapotranspiration process completely but include awi and sediment sorption show that over 60 of the pfas mass would have exited the vadose zone and entered groundwater by the year 2020 i e 50 years after cessation of afff application this compares to no loss of pfas to groundwater when evapotranspiration induced water fluxes are taken into account fig 4b the retention of pfas mass through those temporary upward fluxes and the significant evapo concentration that occurs under these circumstances allows the porewater to reach concentrations of several tens of mg l total pfas within the shallow soil horizons fig 5 the model results illustrate how such high concentrations are maintained over prolonged periods and decline only gradually it can be seen that pfas porewaters within the shallow soil horizon underneath the simulated source zone are still at 25 of their maximum concentration even 75 yrs after cessation of afff surface application fig 5 in contrast model simulations which omit evapotranspiration show an immediate reduction in pfas concentrations after termination of the afff application due the downward water flux and solute transport that is induced under those hypothetical conditions the model results reflect closely the observed consistently high pfas porewater concentrations in the shallow sections of the vadose zone these high concentrations can also explain the high pfas concentrations in surface runoff following rain events as regularly observed at a number of pfas affected australian commonwealth sites davis et al 2021 3 3 the role of the air water interface and sediment sorption on pfas migration and retention while evapo concentration and upward flux during periods of excess evapotranspiration contribute to the persistently high concentrations in shallow soil horizons pfas sorption to soil particles as well as the awi were also expected to influence pfas mobility while the impact of sorption to the awi is negligible under nearly saturated conditions as a result of the reduced available awi anwar et al 2000 sorption to the awi increasingly affect the partitioning between dissolved and sorbed phases as water saturation declines fig 6 a b in fully dried soils the air water interfacial area approaches the surface area of the porous media peng and brusseau 2005 therefore dry clay heavy soils exhibit the highest awi sorption potential while on the other hand well sorted sandy soils have a lower impact on pfas partitioning for the same degree of saturation under dry conditions the increased awi can theoretically cause retarded pfas transport that is several hundreds of times slower than that of water fig 6b however the awi induced retardation is also a function of pfas concentrations under increasing pfas concentrations surface tension along the awi decreases which in turn decreases any retardation on the awi anwar et al 2000 fig 6b d while the impact of dry near static hydraulic condition on pfas mobility are significant the model simulations reveal that the overall field scale pfas transport is much less affected by the awi induced retention for our field site the model simulation shows that pfas downward transport occurs largely in periods of highly water saturated conditions with the majority of the downward water flux occurring in direct conjunction with rain events at other times flow conditions are either characterised by evapotranspiration induced upward water fluxes and pfas movement or stagnant conditions fig 4 and 7 the figures illustrate that the periods of enhanced and relevant downward movement strongly coincide with the periods at which the soils are close to or at saturation consequently during those times the awi is at a minimum and the impact of sorption to the awi is greatly reduced this is further illustrated in fig 7a which shows the highly dynamic nature of the awi induced effective retardation the constantly changing degree of water saturation that occurs in response to i periodic rainfall events and ii evapotranspiration leads to the effective r varying widely importantly awi induced sorption approaches zero during times of maximum pfas transport following rain events 3 4 time integrated field scale pfas retardation ultimately the risks and rates of pfas groundwater contamination under the type of investigated climatic and lithological conditions depends on the time averaged pfas migration rates across the vadose zone therefore we determine time integrated retardation coefficients we quantify these on the basis of the simulated temporally and spatially varying pfas mass distribution relative to the corresponding mass distribution that occurs for a synthetic conservative tracer that is applied at the same rate and concentration as pfas the latter is per definition migrating at the rate of the infiltrating water retardation 1 in this case 48 of the tracer mass would have moved beyond the shallow soil horizon here defined as the zone between 0 and 2 m below the ground surface by 1995 when the 3m light watertm application was simulated to have ceased at the source zone fig 8 light grey line furthermore 50 years later year 2045 95 of the total pfas mass would have egressed the shallow soil horizon with the 50th percentile of pfas mass located at a depth of 4 6 m in contrast to the tracer results the observed and simulated total pfas mass distribution at the field site both demonstrate a much slower movement fig 8 black line in 1995 pfas is simulated to still reside to 95 within the top 2 m of the profile due to the earlier discussed combined retention processes of evapotranspiration awi and sediment sorption the 50th percentile of the pfas mass is at a depth of 51 cm below surface 50 years later 28 of the pfas mass is predicted to have leached into deeper soil horizons with the 50th percentile of pfas mass now located at 1 58 m depth this translates into a time integrated retardation factor based on pfas mass of r 3 4 without awi induced pfas retention over 60 of pfas mass is simulated to pass the shallow soil horizon in the year 2045 with the 50th percentile of pfas mass located at 2 6 m below the surface fig 8 dark grey line based on the downward movement of the 50 percentile of pfas mass sediment sorption accounts for a reduction in transport velocity of 40 at the field site to date while sorption to the awi is halving this velocity again to about one third of the velocity of water however the largest reduction in pfas transport can be attributed to the evapotranspiration induced upward flux comparative model simulations which omit evapotranspiration show that over 75 of pfas mass would have migrated across the shallow soil horizon by the time the application of 3m light watertm ceased about 5 years thereafter the total applied pfas mass would have migrated beyond 2 m depth while over 95 of pfas mass would have migrated across the entire 7 m thick unsaturated zone and entered groundwater by the year 2020 the comparison between the time integrated retardation coefficients and the coefficients computed from the static matric potentials fig 6b illustrates that the consideration of realistic physical flow and transport processes leads to substantially enhanced pfas transport rates across the vadose zone at our field site the time integrated retardation coefficients r do not exceed a factor of 4 where theoretically derived coefficients suggest that retardation may exceed 100 under low moisture and low pfas concentrations figs 6b and 8 4 conclusions our study provides a detailed model based analysis of the physical flow and transport mechanisms controlling the spatio temporal mass and concentration changes that occurred at a typical defence site where decades long afff application occurred importantly our analysis provides a mechanistic and highly plausible explanation for the persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 m of the vadose zone a non intuitive but common occurrence reported across many afff affected sites given that pfas applications ceased many years ago in explaining pfas persistence the simulation results demonstrate that the climate driven physical flow processes within the vadose zone exerted the greatest control on the retention of pfas at the study site prolonged periods of evapotranspiration exceeding rainfall triggered periods of upward flux thereby retaining pfas within the upper soil horizons the dramatically reduced pfas mobility in combination with evapo concentration explains why porewaters exhibit total pfas concentrations in the mg l range and why these high concentrations are expected to persist over the next decades these insights can now also explain the often observed high concentrations in surface runoff following rain events as documented for a number of pfas affected australian commonwealth sites physico chemical retention mechanisms namely sorption to the awi and sediment surfaces contributed further to pfas retention interestingly however our model results indicated that the impact of sorption to the awi was significantly reduced compared to the predicted theoretical awi retention determined under static matric potentials i e without considering the highly transient hydraulic regime that evolves within vadose zones the simulations illustrate that pfas downward transport is confined to short periods following discrete rain events when soils display a high degree of saturation with awi sorption being at a minimum under high matric potentials the periods of enhanced physical pfas downward movement coincide with a low retention by sorption to the awi which is an interesting and novel finding in addition the high pfas concentrations measured and simulated below the source zone reduces the effect of the awi further due to a decrease in surface tension under elevated pfas concentrations consequently time integrated pfas retardation quantified on the basis of the simulated pfas depth profiles demonstrated that the field relevant retention of pfas was generally lower than suggested based on awi retention calculated under static matric potentials and low pfas concentrations compared to the velocity of water these time integrated retardation coefficients attributed a 40 reduction in pfas transport to pfas sorption onto sediment surfaces at the field site a further reduction to one third of the velocity of water was ascribed to pfas retention on the awi the current analysis considered unsaturated physical flow and pfas transport processes that were driven by a semi arid climate while these conditions are representative for many other afff affected sites in australia and other arid to semi arid regions worldwide differences in climate porewater solution composition e g ionic strength and ph lithology including soil organic matter concentrations and potential co contamination by napl compounds will determine the extent to which the model results are transferrable to other sites the most pronounced differences would be expected for sites that are organic rich and sites under more humid climates with increasing organic carbon content pfas retention due to surface sorption onto the solid phase would gain in importance while higher degrees of soil saturation under more humid conditions would further reduce the importance of awi induced retention and expand the control exerted by physical flow on the fate of pfas compounds including a reduction of evaporation induced upward flux it is worth highlighting that the current analysis is conceptually valid for pfas vadose zone behaviour that is mostly unaffected by the occurrence of preferential flow and solute transport pathways where such preferential pathways exist for example due to fractures or windows in low permeability strata solute transport will be dominated along fingers of high or complete water saturation flow and transport along such pathways will occur at rates several orders of magnitudes faster than predicted under the assumption of uniform matrix flow this may have severe implications on the overall mass transfer into groundwater also very typical for pfas affected sites the model simulations can effectively only be constrained by two soil profile concentration snapshots in time i e zero initial mass in the 1970 and a recent pfas mass distribution in our case from 2020 due to the paucity of historic pfas analysis therefore the simulation model suffers from some practically unavoidable non uniqueness in addition it should be noted that the current model was constrained on the basis of total pfas concentration depth profiles with the observed plume containing overwhelmingly pfos model simulations can be regarded largely reflective of pfos fate the same model framework can be applied to simulate the fate of other single compounds if compound specific awi and sediment sorption parameters are employed the above shortcomings do not distract from the value of the presented model analysis which provides valuable insights into the coupled flow solute transport and retention patterns that govern pfas fate in the unsaturated zone below afff source zones under mediterranean climate conditions the developed model framework has proven capable of describing field scale vadose zone systems with their inherent variability of soil textures and their tightly coupled feedback

15430,contamination through per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas have occurred globally in soil and groundwater systems at military airport and industrial sites due to the often decades long periodic application of firefighting foams at pfas contaminated sites the unsaturated soil horizon often serves as a long term source for sustained pfas contamination for both groundwater and surface water runoff an understanding of the processes controlling future mass loading rates to the saturated zone from these source zones is imperative to design efficient remediation measures in the present study hydrochemical data from a site where pfas transport was observed as a result of the decades long application of afff were used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models that determine pfas mobility across the vadose zone under realistic field scale conditions the simulation results demonstrate that the climate driven physical flow processes within the vadose zone exert a dominating control on the retention of pfas prolonged periods of evapotranspiration exceeding rainfall under the semi arid conditions trigger periods of upward flux and evapoconcentration leading to the observed persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 metres of the vadose zone despite cessation of afff application to soils since more than a decade physico chemical retention mechanisms namely sorption to the air water interface awi and sediment surfaces contribute further to pfas retention the simulations demonstrate how pfas downward transport is effectively confined to short periods following discrete rain events when soils display a high degree of saturation during these periods awi sorption is at a minimum in addition high pfas concentrations measured and simulated below the source zone reduce the effect of the awi further due to a decrease in surface tension associated with elevated pfas concentrations consequently time integrated pfas migration and retardation illuminates that the field relevant pfas transport rates are predominantly controlled by the physical flow processes with a lower relative importance of awi and sediment sorption adding to pfas retention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pfas leaching vadose zone sorption air water interface numerical modelling 1 introduction per and poly fluoroalkyl substances pfas are a group of manufactured chemicals that have been widely used in australia and elsewhere since the 1950s in a range of industrial applications such as in textiles and leather in electronics food packaging and for fire fighting where pfas is used as an ingredient in aqueous film forming foams afff particularly over the past decade large scale soil and groundwater contamination has been reported and pfas have emerged as contaminants of critical concern significant impacts on soil and groundwater systems have occurred globally from civilian and military airports and industrial sites due to the often decades long periodic application of afff during training exercises to date remediation of affected sites for example in australia has often focussed on discrete afff source zones which serve as long term contaminant sources for vadose zones and groundwater brusseau 2018 lyu et al 2018 adamson et al 2020 recent studies into the behaviour of pfas within source zones have highlighted the important role of the unsaturated zone as a long term source for sustained pfas contamination for both groundwater and surface water runoff for instance høisæter et al 2019 reported 96 of total pfos to be retained within the upper 2 m of afff impacted soils at a firefighting training facility in norway 15 years after pfos use was terminated at a former fire training area on cape cod massachusetts the unsaturated zone was also shown to act as a continuous source for pfas mass transfer into the saturated zone more than 18 years after pfas surface application had ceased weber et al 2017 field data from source zones affected by afff in australia support this observation fig 1 given the low sorption affinity and therefore typically high mobility of pfas compounds the frequently documented persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 m of vadose zones despite cessation of pfas application to soils since many years davis et al 2021 is surprising and puzzling to better understand pfas retention and transport in source zones and to support the planning of effective and economical remediation efforts a range of potential physical and chemical retention mechanisms that act upon pfas compounds in the vadose zone have been closely studied over the past decade many of these studies focused on determining the extent of sorption of pfas onto common mineral surfaces such as ferrihydrite campos pereira et al 2020 goethite uwayezu et al 2019 and aluminium oxides wang et al 2011 as well as clay particles under controlled laboratory conditions zhao et al 2014 xiao et al 2011 based on the collected data distribution coefficients kd for the most common pfas compounds were established for example li et al 2018 provided a comprehensive review which concluded that laboratory derived median kd values for pfos pfoa pfhxs and pfhxa were 15 49 1 48 0 95 and 0 26 l kg respectively more recently several additional retention mechanisms have been uncovered most importantly the partitioning of pfas compounds to the air water interface awi within the vadose zone and also to nonaqueous phase liquids napls at sites where cross contamination exists several studies have attempted to quantify the impact of these retention mechanisms on pfas mobility for instance brusseau et al 2019 found a doubling of pfos retardation in water unsaturated soils compared to saturated soils due to air water interfacial adsorption guelfo and higgins 2013 observed in batch sorption experiments that the presence of napls decreased the sorption of pfos at low pfos concentrations 1 µg l but caused an increase in sorption at higher concentrations 500 ug l chen et al 2009 measured enhanced sorption of pfos in the presence of crude oil in an air dried soil in batch experiments the freundlich sorption coefficient rose from log kf 1 3 to log kf 2 24 when the amount of oil within the investigated soil was increased from 0 g kg 1 to 8 7 g kg 1 all the above sorption mechanisms were also found to be influenced by the pfas chain length e g campos pereira et al 2018 and solution chemistry especially the ionic strength the valence of cations and the ph tang et al 2010 brusseau and van glubt 2019 cai et al 2022 lyu and brusseau 2020 while elevated pfas concentration itself may reduce surface tension leading to enhanced surfactant induced flow sif e g costanza robinson and henry 2017 zeng and guo 2021 understandably most research addressing pfas mobility to date has been performed at the laboratory scale through column or batch experiments that provide homogeneous and or well mixed conditions many of these studies have benefited from additional quantification of observed processes through mathematical model frameworks e g silva et al 2020 guo et al 2020 zeng et al 2021 brusseau and guo 2022 which have greatly advanced the ability to describe pfas sorption behaviour mechanistically however comparatively little is still known about the field scale reactive transport behaviour of pfas compounds as they migrate across the vadose zone and how this affects the temporal evolution of the mass transfer into the saturated zone obviously in natural and therefore more heterogeneous systems it is much more difficult to discern which of the lab identified retention mechanisms are affecting pfas transport behaviour and to disentangle which processes exert a major control on the fate of the various pfas compounds clearly beyond sorption processes the fate of pfas compounds is also strongly affected by the physical flow and transport processes that persist within the vadose zone highly dynamic rainwater infiltration drainage evapotranspiration and particularly subsurface heterogeneities lead to complex transport behaviour for instance zeng and guo 2021 were able to demonstrate on the basis of synthetic soil profiles that inhomogeneities significantly influenced the pfas transport behaviour within the considered profiles preferential flow enhanced the saturation along pathways which consequently reduced the air water interfacial area and therefore pfas sorption leading to greatly enhance pfas travel times silva et al 2020 demonstrated on the basis of model simulations of synthetic 1d layered soil profiles how temporal soil moisture changes driven by infiltrating rain events led to temporal change in the air water interfacial area the latter was amplified under soil texture inhomogeneities we hypothesize that understanding hydraulic flow processes is crucial as they could at the field scale be equally or more important for determining pfas transport rates within and across the vadose zone than the physico chemical retention mechanisms currently however the relative importance of physical transport versus chemical retention processes on the overall pfas fate and transport within the vadose zone is a critical knowledge gap for source zones where afff has been applied numerical modelling has been shown to provide a useful framework to integrate quantify and ultimately better understand complex solute and reactive transport processes and their interactions across multiple scales e g siade et al 2021 in the present study hydrochemical data from an afff affected source zone where pfas transport was observed as a result of the application of afff over several decades were used to develop and evaluate conceptual and numerical models quantifying pfas mobility across the vadose zone under realistic field scale conditions this will underpin a better understanding of the historic pfas fate predictions of future mass loading rates to the saturated zone and it will greatly aid the design of efficient remediation measures we use laboratory determined sorption parameters and measured pfas concentration depth profiles as constraints to guide the development and calibration of a vadose zone numerical model that simulates the long term evolution of pfas transport across the vadose zone the results are used to assess the relative importance of physical flow and transport processes on the overall pfas mobility and mass loading rates 2 material and methods 2 1 study site the selected study site is representative of many other similarly pfas impacted sites it is located on australian commonwealth land where training with afff occurred over several decades usage of 3m light watertm started in the 1970 s and continued until approximately 2005 on the site when light watertm was phased out and replaced with ansulite over several years although ansulite also contains pfas the chemistry is based on fluorotelomers rather than perfluoroalkyl sulfonates thus the signature of residual pfas is distinctly different and concentrations of pfos and pfhxs can be attributed confidently to the earlier use of light watertm details of afff usage over this time were however not recorded and similar to many other sites worldwide no robust estimates for the rates of pfas mass inputs into the vadose zone are therefore available sampling campaigns starting in 2008 and in subsequent years revealed that pfas contaminated soils and groundwater were widespread across the site pfas concentrations in soils ranged up to 164 mg kg pfos pfhxs at different afff source zones while groundwater concentrations of up to 11 6 mg l pfos pfhxs were recorded on site defence esdat database accessed 13 03 2019 the unsaturated zone at the study site is composed of quaternary aged sediments that comprise a sequence of fluvial and alluvial deposits clay and silt deposits predominate however interbedded are lenses and layers of sand gravel pebbles and up to boulder size sediments consequently the hydraulic permeability of the subsurface is highly variable a core drilled at the site documents a generally clay rich soil 31 to 55 clay within the 2 mm fraction with a low organic carbon content average of 0 1 the depth to groundwater is about 4 to 10 m across the site temporal groundwater table variations are generally low with standard deviation of groundwater head data remaining below 0 5 m in 85 of bores the climate is mediterranean with mild wet winters and hot dry summers long term records of climate data are available through a weather station located at the field site operated by the bureau of meteorology the median yearly precipitation is 426 9 mm yr 1972 2021 while the mean potential a pan yearly evaporation is 2080 mm yr 1972 1999 the average yearly minimum and maximum air temperature is 11 2 and 22 7 c respectively 1972 2021 2 2 hydrochemical data collection as part of a detailed site investigation defence 2018 vertical pfas concentration profiles were determined in soils below several source zones fig 1 one of those source zones that exhibited a typical pfas depth profile was selected for the present numerical modelling study it is characterised by a maximum pfas soil concentration of about 5 000 μg kg at a depth of about 0 5 1 m and a depth to the water table of approximately 7 m the electrical conductivities of the porewaters in the vadose zone were measured in an uncontaminated core from the same field site and ranged between 230 and 1050 ms cm 2 3 numerical model simulator to elucidate and quantify the physical controls on the transport behaviour of pfas within the vadose zone we integrated and interpreted the detailed field observations that were collected at a selected source zone these data guided the development of numerical unsaturated zone models of pfas mobilisation and transport we apply the public domain numerical model leachm leaching estimation and chemistry model hutson 2003 leachm is a widely used unsaturated zone simulator e g sogbedji et al 2001a asada et al 2013 that has been extensively benchmarked against similar codes such as hydrus e g nolan et al 2005 sarmah et al 2006 ogorzalek et al 2008 it is a process based model that uses a finite difference approximation of the richards equation to solve for water flow and the convection dispersion equation to simulate solute transport in variably water saturated soils flow of water and solutes through the unsaturated zone is simulated in response to time varying precipitation evaporation transpiration temperature and runoff solutes are transported by advection dispersion and diffusion and may be retarded by sorption onto soil particles and or soil organic matter for this work leachm was extended to include sorption of pfas compounds to the air water interface awi following largely the approach of guo et al 2020 awi adsorption coefficients are calculated on the basis of surface tension which in turn is a function of soil temperature and solution composition equilibrium sorption was assumed for both solid phase and awi sorption the maximum air water interfacial area is thereby assumed to be the surface area of dry soil particles calculated from a geometric mean particle diameter soil particle size and textural class classification is usually based on clay and silt contents determined by sedimentation the australian size classification defines the upper limits of the clay fraction as 0 002 mm and the silt fraction 0 02 mm however laser diffraction analysis is more likely to reflect particle volume and fisher et al 2017 found that laser diffraction thresholds corresponding to sedimentation analysis thresholds of 0 002 mm and 0 2 mm were 0 009 mm and 0 026 mm these values along with an upper limit for sand of 2 mm are used to estimate geometric mean particle diameter dg mm 1 d g m i ln d i where mi is the mass fraction and di the arithmetic mean diameter of size class i the surface area of the dry bulk soil amax dm2 dm3 is estimated from geometric mean particle diameter mm soil bulk density σb kg dm3 and particle density σs kg dm3 is 2 a m a x 600 σ b d g σ s the awi area per unit soil volume aaw is assumed to vary linearly from zero at saturation s 1 to amax when the soil approaches dryness s 0 following the approach by kim et al 1997 3 a a w a m a x 1 s the air water interfacial adsorption coefficient using a temperature and solute dependent surface tension is calculated using the procedure described by

against guo et al 2020 and zeng et al 2021 supporting information a c it should be noted however that some of the model capabilities in guo et al 2020 are not replicated within the extended leachm code the approach taken in leachm was driven by the need to numerically describe field scale vadose zone systems with their inherent variability in textures accordingly a formulation that allows quantification of awi pfas sorption processes over a wide range of soil properties based on readily available soil survey data was chosen to ensure utility for actual site applications where measured data is often scarce this includes the quantification of the maximum air water interfacial area based on modified geometric mean particle diameters soil bulk and particle densities this provided maximum surface areas which are in general agreement with those reported in the relevant literature fig 6 and e g silva et al 2020 zeng and guo 2021 and which compared well against two frequently used surface area quantification methods i e the ethylene glycol and bet isotherm method evaluated on the basis of 21 different soils supporting information a however direct measurements of the soil surface area through e g aqueous phase interfacial partitioning tracer tests or synchrotron x ray microtomography may provide more accurate estimate of soil surface areas brusseau et al 2007 but this data would rarely be available for field scale settings in addition it also needs to be acknowledged that significant variability exists in the magnitude of soil surface areas depending on the measurement method employed costanza robinson and brusseau 2002 silva et al 2020 this inadvertently will impact on model accuracy in addition the modified leachm code does not take surfactant induced flow sif into account this simplification was based on results by zeng and guo 2021 who demonstrated that acceleration of vertical leaching and lateral spreading of pfas resulting from sif was minimal even under strongly elevated pfas porewater concentrations of up to 10 mg l silva et al 2020 derived at similar findings stating that pfas solution concentrations in excess of 10 mg l are needed before effects of surface tension on unsaturated flow would be noticeable we acknowledge that the approach taken is approximate recognising that the procedure and calculations can be refined for specific soils and chemicals evaluating simplifying numerical model approaches in the face of inherent field scale soil and porewater variability is considered an important area of future research 2 4 model approach decades long reactive transport of pfas compounds was studied for a one dimensional vertical soil profile model simulations were undertaken for a 50 year simulation period extending between the 1st january 1970 and the 31st december 2019 the temporal discretisation was variable throughout the simulation period decreasing with increasing flow rate with the maximum time step length set to 0 1 days the computed transient water fluxes served as the basis for the subsequent pfas transport simulations history matching for the pfas flow and transport model was achieved by comparing the measured total pfas concentration depth profiles with those simulated in 2020 as well as the groundwater recharge rates with previous recharge estimates that were based on a chloride mass balance the history matching process relied on a trial and error approach that involved the adjustment i of sediment sorption coefficients within the range of the laboratory measured kd values and ii of the water retention depths within plausible ranges to successively reduce discrepancies between simulated and observed pfas concentrations and groundwater recharge rates table 1 2 5 source zone model the simulated soil profile spanned over a depth interval of 7 m corresponding to the thickness of the unsaturated zone below the selected source zone the upper profile boundary condition was defined on the basis of daily climate data fig 2 silo daily rainfall mm temperature and potential evapotranspiration mm were obtained from the weather station located on the field site http www longpaddock qld gov au silo the lower boundary condition of the simulated soil profile was defined as a unit gradient boundary or free drainage this allowed drainage water to exit at a rate equal to the current hydraulic conductivity at the base of the model the fractions of clay silt and sand within the studied soil profile were obtained by sedimentation and sieve analysis from a soil core that was collected at the site fig 3 the measured organic matter content within that core was low throughout the entire profile ranging between 0 and 1 fig 3 the crop cover at the site was simulated as a grass species with a maximum root depth of 300 mm gras cover growth was set to start each year in april reaching a maximum cover at the end of june and ceasing growth in october actual evapotranspiration was calculated based on daily plant growth the soil moisture at the current rooting depth and the crop specific potential evapotranspiration soil bulk density was set at 1 6 kg dm3 and a porosity of 0 4 was assumed a slope of 0 5 was applied across the soil surface representative of the low surface gradient at the study site the profile was discretised into 100 mm thick model segments 2 6 pfas distribution coefficients and pfas application history to simulate pfas movement through the unsaturated zone linear equilibrium sorption was assumed the employed distribution coefficient koc was based on site specific data available through sorption experiments conducted on a soil core from the site table 1 navarro et al 2021 while individual depth profiles of pfhxs and pfos are available for the site which demonstrate a chromatographic effect due to compound specific sorption affinities fig 3 for the purposes of this study the pfas transport model applied an average koc representative of the cumulative movement of the total pfas mass through the vadose zone as for the vast majority of pfas affected sites detailed records of the pfas application history were not available instead a continuous annual application of pfas was assumed for the period between 1970 and 1995 in the model simulations a diluted afff solution was applied once per month to represent the regularly recurring fire training events during each event 10 mm of water per m2 were applied to the surface with the total pfas at concentrations of 8 mg l the applied pfas mass was based on the total pfas mass observed in the soil profile 3 results and discussion 3 1 pfas migration characteristics the history matching process resulted in model simulations that provide a process based explanation of the field observations while employing highly plausible model parameter values a comparison between simulated and observed pfas concentration depth profiles which served as main model calibration constraint is shown in fig 3 the comparison illustrates a good agreement between the simulated and the observed pfas depth profiles with total pfas concentrations of 5 10 mg kg dominating the top 1 m of the soil profile before declining with depth the simulations reveal an overall slow movement of pfas through the unsaturated zone importantly the simulations provide a first mechanistic explanation as to why the main mass of pfas still resides in the upper 2 m of the unsaturated zone profile in 2020 despite afff application having ceased for more than 10 years fig 3 under the simulated conditions pfas mass discharge from the vadose zone into groundwater remains negligible even at the end of the simulation period at this time the simulated total pfas mass residing within the vadose zone profile has accumulated to 28 6 g m2 which compares well with the corresponding mass that was observed at the field site 27 g m2 the history matching process for the flow and pfas transport model determined an average groundwater recharge rate of 9 8 mm yr the simulated drainage rate from the vadose zone compares well to groundwater recharge rates that were estimates based on the chloride mass balance approach the latter established a range between 1 1 and 9 4 mm yr for the regional quaternary aquifer system which encompasses the field site bresciani et al 2015 it is noteworthy that the average groundwater recharge rate during the simulation period 1970 2020 accounts for only 5 of the recorded rainfall the majority of water loss from the vadose zone occurs through evaporation 51 of rainfall while transpiration accounts for 36 of the computed water loss with the remainder accounting for surface runoff fig 2 secondly the history matching determined that a composite koc value for the total pfas mass of 90 l kg was a reasonable approximation this value aligns well with both the experimentally determined kd values on the soil core obtained from the field site and literature values for the prevailing types of australian soils see table 1 3 2 evapo concentration key process for retaining pfas mass in shallow soil horizons the model simulation demonstrate that the slow downward migration is partly a consequence of the clay heavy lithology of the soils at the study site however the model additionally reveals that the pfas mass is retained within the shallow soil horizon due to upward migration of water and solutes during periods of low rainfall and high evapotranspiration these periods are frequent under the local climatic conditions illustrated in fig 4 a for an example period of 2 5 years between april 2003 and october 2005 the hydraulic regime induced by these climatic conditions leads to a persistently high pfas mass within the soil as well as within the porewater in the first ca 1 m of the soil profile comparative model simulations with and without evaporation and vegetation cover reveal that the retention of pfas within the shallow soil horizon is primarily related to the evapotranspiration process and the temporary upward water flux that is induced by it in fact the model simulations which omit the evapotranspiration process completely but include awi and sediment sorption show that over 60 of the pfas mass would have exited the vadose zone and entered groundwater by the year 2020 i e 50 years after cessation of afff application this compares to no loss of pfas to groundwater when evapotranspiration induced water fluxes are taken into account fig 4b the retention of pfas mass through those temporary upward fluxes and the significant evapo concentration that occurs under these circumstances allows the porewater to reach concentrations of several tens of mg l total pfas within the shallow soil horizons fig 5 the model results illustrate how such high concentrations are maintained over prolonged periods and decline only gradually it can be seen that pfas porewaters within the shallow soil horizon underneath the simulated source zone are still at 25 of their maximum concentration even 75 yrs after cessation of afff surface application fig 5 in contrast model simulations which omit evapotranspiration show an immediate reduction in pfas concentrations after termination of the afff application due the downward water flux and solute transport that is induced under those hypothetical conditions the model results reflect closely the observed consistently high pfas porewater concentrations in the shallow sections of the vadose zone these high concentrations can also explain the high pfas concentrations in surface runoff following rain events as regularly observed at a number of pfas affected australian commonwealth sites davis et al 2021 3 3 the role of the air water interface and sediment sorption on pfas migration and retention while evapo concentration and upward flux during periods of excess evapotranspiration contribute to the persistently high concentrations in shallow soil horizons pfas sorption to soil particles as well as the awi were also expected to influence pfas mobility while the impact of sorption to the awi is negligible under nearly saturated conditions as a result of the reduced available awi anwar et al 2000 sorption to the awi increasingly affect the partitioning between dissolved and sorbed phases as water saturation declines fig 6 a b in fully dried soils the air water interfacial area approaches the surface area of the porous media peng and brusseau 2005 therefore dry clay heavy soils exhibit the highest awi sorption potential while on the other hand well sorted sandy soils have a lower impact on pfas partitioning for the same degree of saturation under dry conditions the increased awi can theoretically cause retarded pfas transport that is several hundreds of times slower than that of water fig 6b however the awi induced retardation is also a function of pfas concentrations under increasing pfas concentrations surface tension along the awi decreases which in turn decreases any retardation on the awi anwar et al 2000 fig 6b d while the impact of dry near static hydraulic condition on pfas mobility are significant the model simulations reveal that the overall field scale pfas transport is much less affected by the awi induced retention for our field site the model simulation shows that pfas downward transport occurs largely in periods of highly water saturated conditions with the majority of the downward water flux occurring in direct conjunction with rain events at other times flow conditions are either characterised by evapotranspiration induced upward water fluxes and pfas movement or stagnant conditions fig 4 and 7 the figures illustrate that the periods of enhanced and relevant downward movement strongly coincide with the periods at which the soils are close to or at saturation consequently during those times the awi is at a minimum and the impact of sorption to the awi is greatly reduced this is further illustrated in fig 7a which shows the highly dynamic nature of the awi induced effective retardation the constantly changing degree of water saturation that occurs in response to i periodic rainfall events and ii evapotranspiration leads to the effective r varying widely importantly awi induced sorption approaches zero during times of maximum pfas transport following rain events 3 4 time integrated field scale pfas retardation ultimately the risks and rates of pfas groundwater contamination under the type of investigated climatic and lithological conditions depends on the time averaged pfas migration rates across the vadose zone therefore we determine time integrated retardation coefficients we quantify these on the basis of the simulated temporally and spatially varying pfas mass distribution relative to the corresponding mass distribution that occurs for a synthetic conservative tracer that is applied at the same rate and concentration as pfas the latter is per definition migrating at the rate of the infiltrating water retardation 1 in this case 48 of the tracer mass would have moved beyond the shallow soil horizon here defined as the zone between 0 and 2 m below the ground surface by 1995 when the 3m light watertm application was simulated to have ceased at the source zone fig 8 light grey line furthermore 50 years later year 2045 95 of the total pfas mass would have egressed the shallow soil horizon with the 50th percentile of pfas mass located at a depth of 4 6 m in contrast to the tracer results the observed and simulated total pfas mass distribution at the field site both demonstrate a much slower movement fig 8 black line in 1995 pfas is simulated to still reside to 95 within the top 2 m of the profile due to the earlier discussed combined retention processes of evapotranspiration awi and sediment sorption the 50th percentile of the pfas mass is at a depth of 51 cm below surface 50 years later 28 of the pfas mass is predicted to have leached into deeper soil horizons with the 50th percentile of pfas mass now located at 1 58 m depth this translates into a time integrated retardation factor based on pfas mass of r 3 4 without awi induced pfas retention over 60 of pfas mass is simulated to pass the shallow soil horizon in the year 2045 with the 50th percentile of pfas mass located at 2 6 m below the surface fig 8 dark grey line based on the downward movement of the 50 percentile of pfas mass sediment sorption accounts for a reduction in transport velocity of 40 at the field site to date while sorption to the awi is halving this velocity again to about one third of the velocity of water however the largest reduction in pfas transport can be attributed to the evapotranspiration induced upward flux comparative model simulations which omit evapotranspiration show that over 75 of pfas mass would have migrated across the shallow soil horizon by the time the application of 3m light watertm ceased about 5 years thereafter the total applied pfas mass would have migrated beyond 2 m depth while over 95 of pfas mass would have migrated across the entire 7 m thick unsaturated zone and entered groundwater by the year 2020 the comparison between the time integrated retardation coefficients and the coefficients computed from the static matric potentials fig 6b illustrates that the consideration of realistic physical flow and transport processes leads to substantially enhanced pfas transport rates across the vadose zone at our field site the time integrated retardation coefficients r do not exceed a factor of 4 where theoretically derived coefficients suggest that retardation may exceed 100 under low moisture and low pfas concentrations figs 6b and 8 4 conclusions our study provides a detailed model based analysis of the physical flow and transport mechanisms controlling the spatio temporal mass and concentration changes that occurred at a typical defence site where decades long afff application occurred importantly our analysis provides a mechanistic and highly plausible explanation for the persistence of pfas compounds in the upper ca 2 m of the vadose zone a non intuitive but common occurrence reported across many afff affected sites given that pfas applications ceased many years ago in explaining pfas persistence the simulation results demonstrate that the climate driven physical flow processes within the vadose zone exerted the greatest control on the retention of pfas at the study site prolonged periods of evapotranspiration exceeding rainfall triggered periods of upward flux thereby retaining pfas within the upper soil horizons the dramatically reduced pfas mobility in combination with evapo concentration explains why porewaters exhibit total pfas concentrations in the mg l range and why these high concentrations are expected to persist over the next decades these insights can now also explain the often observed high concentrations in surface runoff following rain events as documented for a number of pfas affected australian commonwealth sites physico chemical retention mechanisms namely sorption to the awi and sediment surfaces contributed further to pfas retention interestingly however our model results indicated that the impact of sorption to the awi was significantly reduced compared to the predicted theoretical awi retention determined under static matric potentials i e without considering the highly transient hydraulic regime that evolves within vadose zones the simulations illustrate that pfas downward transport is confined to short periods following discrete rain events when soils display a high degree of saturation with awi sorption being at a minimum under high matric potentials the periods of enhanced physical pfas downward movement coincide with a low retention by sorption to the awi which is an interesting and novel finding in addition the high pfas concentrations measured and simulated below the source zone reduces the effect of the awi further due to a decrease in surface tension under elevated pfas concentrations consequently time integrated pfas retardation quantified on the basis of the simulated pfas depth profiles demonstrated that the field relevant retention of pfas was generally lower than suggested based on awi retention calculated under static matric potentials and low pfas concentrations compared to the velocity of water these time integrated retardation coefficients attributed a 40 reduction in pfas transport to pfas sorption onto sediment surfaces at the field site a further reduction to one third of the velocity of water was ascribed to pfas retention on the awi the current analysis considered unsaturated physical flow and pfas transport processes that were driven by a semi arid climate while these conditions are representative for many other afff affected sites in australia and other arid to semi arid regions worldwide differences in climate porewater solution composition e g ionic strength and ph lithology including soil organic matter concentrations and potential co contamination by napl compounds will determine the extent to which the model results are transferrable to other sites the most pronounced differences would be expected for sites that are organic rich and sites under more humid climates with increasing organic carbon content pfas retention due to surface sorption onto the solid phase would gain in importance while higher degrees of soil saturation under more humid conditions would further reduce the importance of awi induced retention and expand the control exerted by physical flow on the fate of pfas compounds including a reduction of evaporation induced upward flux it is worth highlighting that the current analysis is conceptually valid for pfas vadose zone behaviour that is mostly unaffected by the occurrence of preferential flow and solute transport pathways where such preferential pathways exist for example due to fractures or windows in low permeability strata solute transport will be dominated along fingers of high or complete water saturation flow and transport along such pathways will occur at rates several orders of magnitudes faster than predicted under the assumption of uniform matrix flow this may have severe implications on the overall mass transfer into groundwater also very typical for pfas affected sites the model simulations can effectively only be constrained by two soil profile concentration snapshots in time i e zero initial mass in the 1970 and a recent pfas mass distribution in our case from 2020 due to the paucity of historic pfas analysis therefore the simulation model suffers from some practically unavoidable non uniqueness in addition it should be noted that the current model was constrained on the basis of total pfas concentration depth profiles with the observed plume containing overwhelmingly pfos model simulations can be regarded largely reflective of pfos fate the same model framework can be applied to simulate the fate of other single compounds if compound specific awi and sediment sorption parameters are employed the above shortcomings do not distract from the value of the presented model analysis which provides valuable insights into the coupled flow solute transport and retention patterns that govern pfas fate in the unsaturated zone below afff source zones under mediterranean climate conditions the developed model framework has proven capable of describing field scale vadose zone systems with their inherent variability of soil textures and their tightly coupled feedback mechanisms between highly dynamic physical flow processes and chemical pfas retention in future applications the developed model can aid with the evaluation and optimization of remediation options

15431,the computational limitations of complex numerical models have led to adoption of statistical emulators across a variety of problems in science and engineering disciplines to circumvent the high computational costs associated with numerical simulations in flood modelling many hydraulic and hydrodynamic numerical models especially when operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions have prohibitively high computational costs for tasks requiring the instantaneous generation of very large numbers of simulation results this study examines the appropriateness and robustness of gaussian process gp models to emulate the results from a hydraulic inundation model the developed gps produce real time predictions based on the simulation output from lisflood fp numerical model an efficient dimensionality reduction scheme is developed to tackle the high dimensionality of the output space and is combined with the gps to investigate the predictive performance of the proposed emulator for estimation of the inundation depth the developed gp based framework is capable of robust and straightforward quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions without requiring additional model evaluations and simulations further this study explores the computational advantages of using a gp based emulator over alternative methodologies such as neural networks by undertaking a comparative analysis for the case study data presented in this paper the gp model was found to accurately reproduce water depths and inundation extent by classification and produce computational speedups of approximately 10 000 times compared with the original simulator and 80 times for a neural network based emulator graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flood prediction lisflood fp gaussian process emulator spatiotemporal outputs dimensionality reduction extreme event simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction numerical modelling and simulations of flooding scenarios is a vital part of flood risk management enabling timely planning and response to extreme climatic events a range of complex numerical modelling techniques have been developed in the past decade to accurately simulate the flow structure interactions and the corresponding hydrodynamic structure these models differ on factors such as scale spatial resolution e g global continental basin numerical techniques complexity as measured by the number of dimensions considered to model the flow 1d 2d and 3d the underlying processes which lead to flooding events i e inland and coastal flood and the model outputs hence there are significant differences between the capabilities accuracy and robustness of the available flood models much research has been conducted into reviewing the current hydrodynamic modelling strategies teng et al 2017 bulti abebe 2020 and assessing the performance of existing widely used flood models fewtrell et al 2011 zischg et al 2018 a primary drawback of the existing numerical simulations for flood modelling is the associated computational costs to generate results despite active research to enhance the computational capabilities of these models accurate flood modelling at high spatiotemporal resolutions could still be prohibitively expensive in most flood modelling studies it is also desirable to understand the influence of varying the inputs on the outputs and simulate potential flooding scenarios in depth understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model outputs and the model parameterisation is essential to establish a robust flood modelling framework there are several approached to address these questions including sensitivity analysis noori et al 2022 oakley o hagan 2004 daneshkhah bedford 2013 uncertainty quantification ghiasi et al 2022 soize 2017 ghanem et al 2017 and model calibration lee et al 2019 kennedy o hagan 2001 however these techniques generally require very large numbers of model runs indicating that performing such tasks can become infeasible with even modest model computation times and so alternative modelling approaches are needed for robust and timely analysis of numerical models one approach to mitigate the high costs associated with numerical flood modelling tools is to utilise parallel and gpu computing techniques sharif et al 2020 morales hernandez et al 2021 neal et al 2018 abolfathi et al 2018 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2020 at high temporal and spatial resolutions although parallel cpu and gpu implementations can significantly reduce the computation time a single simulation of such models can take many hours to complete abolfathi et al 2018 goodarzi et al 2020 shaw et al 2021 despite the computational limitations in many cases numerical modelling is the most reliable tool for simulation and prediction of flooding and inundation especially when no alternative data driven approaches van steenbergen et al 2012 abolfathi et al 2016 can be utilised due to sparse empirical observations the adoption of machine learning ml approaches mosavi et al 2018 yang chang 2020 lin et al 2020 in flood modelling could alleviate the high computational costs associated with numerical modelling allowing a wider range of scenarios to be considered in a reasonable amount of time and with more accessible computational resources the increasing dependence on numerical models for applications in science and engineering and their associated computational costs has led to the development and adoption of a new class of ml based models known as surrogate models or probabilistic emulators an emulator is a statistical model that approximates the outputs of a usually complex model where the model can be considered as a deterministic input output computer simulator sarri et al 2012 the emulator considered in this paper is originated from model output o hagan 2006 where working with the convenient simulators representing complex mathematical models is computationally very expensive an emulator should approximate the output of a simulator to a sufficient level of accuracy with a significant reduction in associated computational cost and the required training datapoints in recent years several studies focused on the use of emulators for a range of numerical models including tsunami models sarri et al 2012 salmanidou et al 2017 flood models kabir et al 2020 and climate projection models tran et al 2019 a variety of approaches have been examined for statistical emulation including artificial neural networks garcía alba et al 2019 wang et al 2019 polynomial chaos expansions massoud 2019 moreno rodenas et al 2018 and gaussian processes conti et al 2009 chang et al 2015 longobardi et al 2020 yang et al 2018 kabir et al 2020 proposed a deep convolutional neural network cnn model to emulate flood simulation results from a numerical model to generate rapid predictions of inundation levels benchmarked against a support vector regression svr model kabir et al 2020 found the cnn model outperforms svr with respect to classification metrics such as precision and recall and slightly underperforms with respect to regression metrics such as rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency however when validating the model only a very small subset of the locations in the domain were chosen to validate the model at which may not provide the most accurate assessment of the model performance the proposed emulator was more than 20 times faster compared to the underlying numerical model however while the computational improvements are significant relative to the original numerical model the runtime of the emulator may still be prohibitively computationally expensive for tasks such as scenario modelling sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification kabir et al 2020 further concluded that in contrast to gps the cnn based approach can not readily quantify the uncertainty associated with the emulator predictions there are several ml based techniques which have led to a variety of hybrid approaches to forecasting flood inundation depth utilising the computationally expensive physics based numerical models and ml methodologies these approaches often aim to reconstruct or simplify the modelling problem to make it more tenable for ml approaches and have had success in reconstructing inundation values yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 however in this study a novel gp based methodology is developed to emulate the outputs of a 2d hydraulic flood model making as few modelling simplifications as possible the proposed model will require far less model evaluations and consequently significant reduction in the computational resources needed and model s runtime the numerical model used in this study is lisflood fp originally developed by bates de roo 2000 for flood inundation simulations due to the high number of model outputs to be considered a dimensionality reduction scheme is developed on the output space to reduce the computational complexity of modelling with multi output gp models the proposed model has low computational costs and is capable of straightforward quantification of predictive uncertainty the appropriateness and robustness of the developed multi outputs gp model for predicting flood inundation depths is examined for a case study data in north yorkshire uk and a direct comparison is made between the outlined gp methodology and cnn model proposed by kabir et al 2020 2 methods 2 1 numerical flood modelling numerical flood models simulate the interactions of water flow with the surrounding environment using partial differential equations pdes that govern the motion of the fluid flow many open source models exist for modelling flood in two dimensions i e spatial coordinates including lisflood lisflood fp mike flood and telemac 2d these models have been successfully validated for modelling inland and coastal flooding scenarios pinos timbe 2019 dong et al 2018 abolfathi et al 2018 this study adopts lisflood fp a two dimensional hydraulic model hereafter 2d flood model capable of utilising high resolution topographic data for simulating flood inundation depths in challenging urban settings the accuracy of lisflood fp for predicting inundation levels is validated by several studies e g shustikova et al 2019 o loughlin et al 2020 2d flood models make the simplifying assumption that the depth of the water is shallow compared with the magnitude of the other spatial dimensions and as a result vertical variations in flow and velocity structure can be ignored the shallow water equations are commonly used as the governing equations of 2d flood models to determine the interactions between fluid flow and the environment lisflood fp simplifies the problem of simulating 2d flow by decoupling the flows in x and y directions and treats the simulation of 2d flow as a series of calculations in one dimension through the cell face boundaries shustikova et al 2019 the governing equations used for flow modelling in this study including the conservation of mass eq 1 and momentum eq 2 are represented as follows 1 q x a t q 2 s 0 n 2 p 4 3 q 2 a 10 3 h x 0 where q is the volumetric flow rate in the channel a denotes the cross sectional area of the flow q is the flow into the channel from other sources e g precipitations wastewater discharge s 0 is the bed slope n denotes the manning s roughness coefficient p is the wetted perimeter of the channel and ℎ stands for the flow depth the numerical model adopted in this study discretises the governing equations over square type eulerian grids by discretising the domain into a rectangular grid of h w cells the model uses an adaptive numerical time stepping scheme to determine δ t fluid flow between two cells is described as a function between the cells over time 3 d h i j δ t q x i 1 j q x i j q y i j 1 q y i j δ x δ y where h i j is the water free surface height at cell i j δ x and δ y are the cell size in the x and y direction and q x i j and q y i j are the volumetric flow rates between cells in the floodplain the reader should refer to bates de roo 2000 for a full explanation of the governing equations and numerical implementation flood simulations with lisflood fp requires parameterisation with a topographic dataset boundary conditions describing fluid flows into and out of the model domains choice of numerical solvers and other case specific parameters such as friction coefficients in this study assuming d sources of time varying boundary conditions lisflood fp can be considered as a function f x t taking inputs x t r d describing the time varying boundary conditions at time t the outputs generated at each simulation timestep is a matrix of inundation depths y t f x t r h w for a rectangular modelling domain of h w cells where y i j t denotes the water level in cell i j at time t however for mathematical convenience the matrices y t are flattened into vectors y t r h w as illustrated in fig 1 therefore a single flood simulation with t timesteps can be described by the dataset d x y x r t d y r t hw where x x t t 1 t and y y t t 1 t are matrices corresponding to the row wise aggregation of each x t and y t 2 2 gaussian processes a gaussian process is a stochastic process defined as a collection of random variables any finite number of which have a joint gaussian distribution rasmussen williams 2006 in other words a gp can be simply considered as a generalisation of the multivariate gaussian distribution retaining many convenient mathematical properties of the multivariate gaussian distribution however instead of being defined over finite length vectors and parameterised by a mean vector and covariance matrix a gp is defined over functions and parameterised by mean and covariance functions a gp is a possibly infinite distribution that is fully specified by its mean function m x i and its kernel covariance function k x i x j referred to as the kernel function for a real process f x i such as a numerical model taking boundary conditions x i at time t i as outlined in section 2 1 the mean and kernel functions can be written as 4 m x i e f x i 5 c o v x i x j k x i x j e f x i m x i f x j m x j leading to the prior distribution over functions 6 f x i g p m x i k x i x j which can be read as some function f at a given location in the input space x i is distributed as a gp with mean function m and kernel function k a real kernel is a symmetric function which can approximately be considered to provide a metric of similarity between two points x i and x j eq 6 outlines a prior distribution over target functions and encapsulates the prior beliefs about the space of functions from which the target function f could be drawn from in practice mean functions and kernel functions are replaced with finite length mean vectors μ 0 and covariance matrices k whose entries are k i j k x i x j it should be noted that the zero mean function assumption is common in ml applications and this does not limit the mean of the posterior to zero for further details see rasmussen and williams 2006 the flexibility of gps comes from the choices of kernel functions and their parameterisations these choices will determine the properties of candidate functions such as smoothness and variability by combining the prior distribution with the observed dataset the space of candidate functions is constrained to only contain functions which interpolate exactly or approximately the training datapoints obtaining a posterior distribution over the function of interest it is more common in practice to have a collection of noisy observations of some target function y i f x i ε where ε is additive independently identically distributed gaussian noise with variance σ n 2 the prior on the noisy observations can be rewritten as 7 k i j k x i x j δ i j σ n 2 where δ i j 1 if i j otherwise δ i j 0 and 8 c o v y k x x σ n 2 i where x r n d is the design matrix consisting of n training instances which here represents the numerical timesteps in flood simulations in which each row corresponds to x i r d therefore given a set of observations x y where x is the previously mentioned design matrix and y y i i 1 n is a vector of noisy training outputs a joint prior distribution over observed outputs y and predicted outputs f at a set of test inputs x can be defined as 9 y f n 0 k σ n 2 i k k t k where 10 k r n n k x x k r n n k x x k t r n n k x x k r n n k x x by conditioning the prior distribution on the observed data the posterior distribution of zero mean gaussian process over the test inputs is given as 11 f y x x n μ σ where 12 μ k t k σ n 2 i 1 y 13 σ k k t k σ n 2 i 1 k eq 11 shows that within the gp framework prediction is equivalent to the construction of a full multivariate gaussian posterior distribution over function values at new unseen points in the input space hence μ can be considered as the mean prediction and σ the variance associated with the mean prediction 2 2 1 learning the hyperparameters in the gp modelling framework assuming a zero mean training the model means choosing an appropriate kernel function and using the training data to optimise the kernel s hyperparameters the default kernel used in gp regression models is the squared exponential se kernel 14 k x i x j σ 2 exp x i x j 2 l 2 where σ 2 is the output variance determining the average distance of the function from the mean value and l is the lengthscale which determines how quickly the function varies and determines how the covariances decay with distance between points the se kernel function generalises well to many applications yet it makes assumptions about smoothness which often are not realistic in this study a zero mean function and the matern3 2 kernel function are used for the development of the gp model the matern3 2 kernel is a stationary kernel operating only on the euclidean distance between points with origins in spatial statistics and is commonly used for modelling physical processes rasmussen williams 2006 furthermore preliminary testing showed the matern3 2 eq 15 to outperform the se for the flood modelling context addressed in this study 15 k x i x j c 3 2 d σ 2 1 3 x i x 2 j l exp 3 x i x 2 j l σ n 2 δ i j where δ i j 1 if i j otherwise δ i j 0 the kernel s hyperparameters denoted by θ σ 2 l σ n 2 are determined through maximum likelihood estimation with respect to each hyperparameter where σ 2 is the variance parameter l is the length scale and σ n 2 is a gaussian noise parameter to estimate kernel hyperparameters the log marginal likelihood is maximised with respect to the hyperparameters given that prior distribution over observations can be expressed as y n 0 k σ n 2 i y n 0 k σ n 2 i the log marginal likelihood explicitly conditioned on kernel hyperparameters can be written as 16 log p y x θ 1 2 y t k σ n 2 i 1 y 1 2 log k σ n 2 i n 2 log 2 π by taking partial derivatives with respect to each hyperparameters the marginal likelihood can be maximised as 17 θ j log p y x θ 1 2 y t k y 1 k y θ j k y 1 y 1 2 t r k y 1 k y θ j where k y k σ n 2 i and t r is the trace operator performing this operation scales with o n 3 computational complexity from the inversion of k y matrix 2 3 dimensionality reduction with the lisflood fp model the outputs describe inundation across the study area for each timestep when constructing a statistical emulator a collection of k design floods d i i 1 k where d i x i r t i d y i r t i hw consisting of t i timesteps where h is the number of cells in the model in the x direction and w in the y direction is used to train and validate the emulator the input output data matrices from each design flood are aggregated into new input output matrices x r n d and y r n hw with a new number of aggregated timesteps n t 1 t k for numerical simulators operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions this can result in very large values of h w and n to overcome computational issues arising from modelling a very high dimensional output using gps a dimensionality reduction dr scheme is first developed and applied to the outputs of lisflood fp simulations making the construction of a gp based statistical emulator more feasible principal component analysis pca decomposition is implemented using a randomised implementation of single value decomposition svd halko et al 2009 feng et al 2018 this transformation produces a lower dimensional dataset of latent features z r n d to replace the original dataset y r n hw the output features in the original dataset correspond to the water depths in cells of the output domain and so it can be expected that there will exist significant linear spatial correlations in the data a structure which pca can effectively represent in a lower dimensional space cheng et al 2022 furthermore pca relies on linear transformations allowing it to scale easily to very high dimensional datasets and has a computationally efficient decoding process to reconstruct the original observations from the latent features 2 4 pca gp development for standard gp regression problems only functions of the form f r d r are considered such that when performing gp regression a scalar output y i is regressed onto a vector valued input x i this type of gp regression scales cubically with the number of training instances o n 3 which means the gp has the order of n 3 time complexity or express the runtime in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the size of the input as the size of input gets larger however after the construction of the latent feature dataset z there are d outputs to be modelled and so construction of the emulator is equivalent to a vector valued regression problem in which the mapping f r d r d is learned approaches for vector valued gp regression have been explored and methods such as the linear model of coregionalization lmc have been proposed alvarez et al 2012 however exact implementation of these methods would result in the computational complexity of o d n 3 using the reduced dataset z a collection of independent single output gps sogp is utilised to model each latent feature independently given that applying pca constructs a collection of orthogonal latent features possibly removing correlations between output features the exact implementation of this methodology will scale with o d n 3 computational complexity as it is evident the computational time of sogp is at least d 2 time faster than the lcm method fig 2 illustrates the computational complexity of alternative approaches to vector valued gp regression for a varying number of features d using a baseline of n 1000 training instances this figure implicitly highlights how infeasible a naive implementation of the original dataset would be for which d 800 000 fig 3 shows a graphical representation of the gp model with d input features and d independent output features mapping each input vector to a scalar via a gp f j for j 1 d for each gp in this model a zero mean function and the matern3 2 kernel function are used with the hyperparameters for each determined as outlined in section 2 2 2 5 validation metrics when building statistical emulators the primary concerns are predictive accuracy and time taken to generate new predictions in this study the modified versions of the root mean squared log error rmsle and root mean squared error rmse defined by eqs 18 and 19 respectively will be used for assessing regression performance 18 r m s l e ω log y ω i log y ω i 2 ω 19 r m s e ω y ω i y ω i 2 ω where for each simulation ω is the set of cell indexes in which either lisflood fp or the gp emulator predict an inundation value greater than 0 at any time step this reduces the number of cells averaged over providing a more realistic error metric because most of the cells will never see any inundation causing the average error to be reduced furthermore the log error is used as well as ordinary rmse as it could give a more realistic weighting to the errors given that the relative error of prediction is more important than the absolute value the error should be weighted accordingly for instance in a deep section of the river the emulator s prediction error may be large in an absolute sense but this might not be the case when scaled against the true value whereas in the floodplain where inundation is lower a small absolute error could represent a significant difference in the interpretation of the results the model s ability to correctly classify wet dry cells is also assessed to convert regression predictions into a classification task an inundation threshold c is applied as a binary classifier to determine if a cell is wet or dry 20 y 1 y c 0 y c different values of c were trialled including 0 05m 0 1m and 0 3m a threshold of c 0 3 is recommended following the flood risk assessment conducted by aldrige et al 2016 in which it was concluded that properties intersecting a flood depth of 0 3m would be determined as flooded having established a binary classification scheme an assessment of classification performance is conducted using true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr and f1 score defined by eqs 21 23 respectively 21 t p r t p t p f n 22 f p r f p f p t n 23 f 1 t p t p 1 2 f p f n where t p and t n are the number of true positives and negatives respectively f p and f n are the number of false positives and negatives respectively 3 case study 3 1 site description and modelling domain the gp modelling framework developed in this study is adopted for a case study of urban flood modelling in tadcaster uk tadcaster is a town situated between york and leeds in the northeast of england the town is prone to flooding from the river wharfe which is running through the centre of the town in december 2015 fig 4 in the aftermath of storm frank the town faced its worst flood in recorded history during which many of businesses and homes were evacuated and the town s critical infrastructure e g bridge and roads suffered major damages from the force of the flood waters as a result of the extensive flood damages from the 2015 storm frank a 10m flood defence scheme was proposed to enhance the flood resilience of the town for extreme climatic events however the project execution and completion has been delayed until 2026 due to modelling inaccuracies laycock 2021 hence this study examines the performance of the proposed gp based emulator for flood scenario modelling of tadcaster with the aim of producing instantaneous inundation predictions and allowing for the quantification of uncertainty surrounding the model predictions fig 5 illustrates the 3 6km2 study domain that is considered for the case study in this paper 3 2 topographic data lisflood fp was parameterised with a digital elevation map dem describing the topography of the modelling domain the dem was constructed using digital terrain models dtm to capture the elevation of the underlying surface and then key geographical features and urban structures were reinserted to ensure accurate and realistic flow routing in an urban environment flood modelling in urban environments requires high resolution spatial data and therefore this study constructed the dem with a 2m resolution resulting in a two dimensional eulerian mesh of 876 204 cells fig 6 compares elevation in meters above the sea level for the original dtm fig 6a and the post processed dem used in the flood model fig 6b 3 3 boundary conditions time varying point source hydrographs at upstream points at the north side of the domain were used as the boundary conditions for each simulation scenario alongside a free boundary at the southern downstream boundary the hydrographs were determined using discharge data collected from a river monitoring station within the domain from the empirical discharge data a collection of candidate flood hydrographs was extracted as the basis for synthetic hydrographs then by sampling peak discharge values from a pareto distribution fitted using historical peaks over threshold data the hydrographs were re scaled to match the peak discharge values this study focused on modelling extreme climatic events by oversampling from the upper tails of the peak discharge distribution to investigate scenarios with more severe flooding this study simulates 14 synthetic flood scenarios described by datasets d i i 1 14 to investigate the extent of inundation and flood water depth across the domain for each hydrograph a discharge value is recorded for the river wharfe at 15 minute intervals and input to the numerical flood model 3 4 lisflood fp inundation data following implementation of the topographic features of the case study location and the boundary conditions the lisflood fp was used to simulate the flood for the synthetic hydrographs a spatially varying manning s friction coefficient was applied with values determined based on the land usage papaioannou et al 2018 fig 8 presents the land cover map with the respective manning s coefficient values to minimize the potential uncertainty associated with the simulation results an inundation threshold of 0 03m was applied where an inundation less than 0 03m was assigned to 0 following the completion of the simulations the water depth inundation data was aggregated across simulations the discharge value for time t i along with the values at t i i i 2 i 8 is used as training input for the gp emulator these input features were then scaled to have zero mean and unit variance resulting in aggregated inputs x r 2624 9 and outputs y r 2624 876204 for the construction of the emulator model i e 2624 aggregated timesteps across all 14 simulations and 876 204 features cells for each timestep 3 5 latent feature dataset the dimensionality reduction approach outlined in section 2 2 was then applied to y to produce a dataset of latent variables z r 2624 d it was determined to set d 6 after experimentation found that the first six principal components were sufficient to explain 99 of the variance within the dataset to assess the fit of this pca decomposition the rmse between the original dataset and the reconstruction of the latent features back to the original features space was assessed eq 24 the rmse obtained was 0 018m meaning the reconstruction deviates from the original by 1 8cm on average 24 rmse y ϕ 1 ϕ y performing 10 fold cross validation on the pca transformation found the result obtained from eq 24 to be highly consistent across folds showing the methodology generalises well to out of sample test instances fig 9 illustrates the new dataset z plotting each of principal component values aggregated across all the hydrographs the delineation between each of the 14 hydrographs is highlighted by the blue dashed lines the unit of measurement on the y axis can be ignored as the regression performance in the latent feature space is not interpreted fig 10 illustrates a visual representation of the complete methodology employed in this study to build and train the gp emulator for inland flood modelling highlighting the sequential modelling process and data sources fig 11 shows how the constructed emulator can then be employed to make predictions on unseen data as a replacement for the lisflood fp flood simulation model 4 results and discussion 4 1 cross validation results to validate the gp model and assess out of sample performance leave one out cross validation loocv method was implemented whereby the gp based emulator is trained on 13 synthetic hydrographs fig 7 and predictive performance is assessed on the remaining hydrograph repeating this process for all 14 training examples fig 12 illustrates the model s regression performance showing the test rmsle and rmse values for each held out hydrograph the mean rmsle and rmse values are 0 11 and 0 21 respectively as expected the rmsle values are lower than the rmse and are theoretically expected to be a better estimate of the model s error reasonable variance among the results from cross validation testing is observed with hydrographs 8 being somewhat of an outlier however overall consistency in performance across the test cases are evident while good regression performance is important the ability to correctly identify areas as wet dry is essential for flood risk management and produce interpretable forecasts as such classification was also considered utilising the scheme outlined in eq 20 fig 13 shows the cross validation classification performance differentiating the model performance by the threshold value c used table 1 provides a full breakdown of the mean averaged across cross validation folds scores for each metric at each threshold the scores remain relatively consistent across the threshold values with no value being clearly favourable however c 0 05 appears marginally better than the other values overall the gp model clearly shows effectiveness at predicting whether cells will be wet or dry figs 14 15 illustrate regression performance in the latent feature space with 95 predictive intervals highlighted a common feature of these plots is the ability of each gp to accurately predict the value of the first 3 principal components in each test case the performance on the following 3 components is more varied and the model expresses greater uncertainty surrounding the predictions for these features as illustrated by the significantly wider confidence intervals however the earlier principal components capture most of the variance within the dataset and so accurate prediction of these is significantly more important than accurate prediction of the latter components figs 16 17 illustrate results of flood modelling for hydrographs 7 and 9 during the cross validation process the data from these simulations is held out for testing while the model trains on the other 13 hydrographs respectively in the original feature space after projecting predictions on the latent feature space back to the high dimensional space the maximum water depth in each cell across the entire simulation is plotted and then a water depth threshold of 0 3m is applied to the cells if the maximum inundation across the flood event is greater than 0 3m the cells is highlighted and left blank otherwise figs 18 19 illustrates the difference between the average water depth produced from lisflood fp simulation and the predictions by the gp emulator this allows the exploration of the average prediction error on a cell by cell basis similar results are observed in both scenarios with the gp model s error being approximately 0 for very large sections of the inundated areas and smaller areas of higher errors was observed in both cases the areas of higher error correspond to the areas with more complex urban topography which are in closest proximity to the river reaches to improve future model performance in similar scenarios the training data could be chosen such that a wide range of inundation scenarios in these areas is observed 4 2 benchmarking to robustly assess the performance of the proposed gp model against alternative methods of statistical emulation the cnn model fig 20 outlined in kabir et al 2020 was reconstructed for this study to make a direct comparison of predictive performance between the two methodologies performing the same approach to cross validation by training 14 different cnns each time holding one hydrograph out as validation data a direct comparison of gp and cnn model performance can be made table 2 shows the cross validation regression performance and table 3 describes the classification performance of each model although performance of both models is quite similar the results show that the gp model outperforms cnn with respect to both regression and classification these results confirm the findings of previous studies in terms of the ability of deep learning methodologies to tackle these complex predictive tasks however this study proves the capability of the proposed gp methodology to outperform alternative emulations which cannot be directly evaluated for uncertainty quantification the proposed gp model is also far more robust for scenario modelling compared to alternative emulators when the computational costs is significant see section 4 3 4 3 model runtimes table 4 outlines training time run time and model size i e number of cells in modelling domain for the original lisflood fp simulator the gp based emulator developed in this study and the cnn emulator reconstructed for this study the run time is calculated as the time taken to generate new predictions for a simulation with 250 timesteps of 15 minutes the results show a significant reduction in runtime when using the gp emulator proposed in this study over the cnn however for both methods of statistical emulation very significant reductions in runtime are observed as compared with the original numerical model the gp emulator is shown to be 80 times faster than the cnn model adopted for the considered case study constructing emulators has considerable developmental cost given that training data are generated from the original numerical model which can be costly although this computational cost is common for all surrogate models the gp model can be efficiently trained with considerable limited training datapoints which makes it a very cost efficient emulator furthermore modelling decisions need to be made during development of surrogate models e g network structure for a cnn or kernel for a gp the training times in table 4 only represent the time taken to estimate model hyperparameters however the overall development time associated with emulator construction is higher due to data collection model training and validation 5 application of gp emulator for flood predictions as an example of replacing the efficient gp based emulator with the simulator a flood was simulated using an estimated 1000 year return period synthetic hydrograph using the previously constructed peak discharge distribution see section 3 3 the estimated peak discharge was 750m3 s for reference the estimated peak discharge in the 2015 flood was 480m3 s a candidate synthetic hydrograph was scaled to match this estimated peak discharge value as shown in fig 21 fig 22 shows the gp s prediction for the 1000 year return period event in the latent feature space comparing the predictions made in this instance with those seen previously in figs 14 and 15 it can be observed that there is far greater uncertainty associated with these predictions as illustrated by the much wider confidence intervals even among the first 3 principal components where accurate prediction was observed previously the uncertainty observed in the latent feature space for this set of data can be associated with the fact that the emulator did not observe a training instance like the 1000 year return period hydrograph fig 23a illustrates the inundation resulted from 1000 year flood event with fig 23b discretising this into sections of different inundation depths the grey boundary illustrates the estimated area within the modelling domain that has a 0 1 or greater risk of flooding each year as provided by the uk s environment agency overlayed in blue is the estimated inundated extent predicted from the gp model tested on the hydrograph described in fig 22 different representations of the underlying processes or initial conditions of the model will propagate differences through the simulation and can result in varied outputs for instance the gp emulator models a flash flood type scenario in which no previous inundation is present whereas the environment agency likely models on a longer timeframe and accounts for additional variables such as previous inundation and soil moisture content however there are also clear similarities and consistencies between these predictions which suggests that the proposed gp emulator model s predictions and the estimation of a 1000 year flood are in line with those of the environment agency the differences in maximum inundation between gp predictions at the upper and lower bounds of predicted 95 confidence intervals are analysed fig 24 these intervals are calculated using the variance values predicted by the gp emulator in the latent feature space since gps define a distribution over function values at test inputs using a gaussian framework there is a mean prediction and corresponding variance estimates for each test instance x i the upper and lower 95 confidence interval values are defined as 24 c i μ x i 2 σ x i fig 24 show that most of the difference between inundation estimates is limited to less than 0 5m however in some sections such as the river channel inundation differences of greater than 1m between predictive interval bounds can be observed these values can be considered to illustrate predictive uncertainty by the gp based emulator 6 conclusions a multi output gaussian process based statistical emulator was proposed for the emulation of high dimensional outputs from a numerical flood simulator the standard univariate gp regression methodology is extended to the multi output case by producing a collection of univariate gps to model each output feature independently the gp model was developed to approximate the results of a coupled hydraulic flood model i e lisflood fp and significantly reduce the computational costs associated with numerical flood modelling at high spatiotemporal resolutions to overcome the methodological issues surrounding the use of very high dimensional data in gp modelling a computationally efficient dimensionality reduction scheme was utilised the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed model is examined for a case study of a flood prone region in the uk topographical and hydrological data is collected and preprocessed to produce a realistic high resolution digital elevation model and a collection of synthetic hydrographs to parameterise and run the lisflood fp simulations inundation data in the form of water levels across the modelling domain over time is generated from the numerical simulator which is then used to build and train the gp based emulator the gp emulator was assessed against a cnn emulator by performing the cross validation to ensure no over fitting occurs in either model and to assess each methodology s ability to generalise to out of sample tests during these tests the performance of both the dimensionality reduction scheme and the gp based emulator were found to be robust the gp method outperformed the cnn emulator with respect to both regression and classification furthermore the runtime for gp emulator was very significant reduced compared with the original numerical model and the cnn emulator demonstrating the gp s high predictive accuracy fast runtimes and readily available quantification of predictive uncertainty this study demonstrates the robustness and appropriateness of the proposed gp emulator as a more efficient method of probabilistically emulating complex physics based models over alternative approaches such as the cnn based emulator however a statistical emulator is very sensitive to its experimental design choosing a representative sample of training data remains vital to building an emulator that can generalise well to out of sample tests therefore the choice of training data should be carefully considered and the training dataset should be as large comprehensive as possible while considering the associated cost of collecting new training data it should be noted that each emulator is case specific and so cannot be transferred to alternative scenarios in which different geographical areas are considered modelling a new scenario involves considerable further development time for the original simulator as well as the collection and processing of input data and simulation time however the gp emulator methodology proposed here can be easily translated to any scenario in which high resolution spatiotemporal data is being generated from a highly complex model or processes i e not just 2d inundation modelling furthermore there are likely to be constraints to the spatiotemporal extent that emulators can effectively reproduce especially with a gp methodology s computationally expensive training cost however this study demonstrated the model s high degree of accuracy for a very high spatial resolution model with over 800 000 discrete cells the developmental cost of building emulators can be very high and therefore consideration should be given to whether an emulator is necessary in the first place however for cases where the underlying model s computational cost is prohibitive to real time forecasting or for tasks requiring large numbers of simulations i e scenario modelling a gp based emulator is an efficient modelling alternative

15431,the computational limitations of complex numerical models have led to adoption of statistical emulators across a variety of problems in science and engineering disciplines to circumvent the high computational costs associated with numerical simulations in flood modelling many hydraulic and hydrodynamic numerical models especially when operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions have prohibitively high computational costs for tasks requiring the instantaneous generation of very large numbers of simulation results this study examines the appropriateness and robustness of gaussian process gp models to emulate the results from a hydraulic inundation model the developed gps produce real time predictions based on the simulation output from lisflood fp numerical model an efficient dimensionality reduction scheme is developed to tackle the high dimensionality of the output space and is combined with the gps to investigate the predictive performance of the proposed emulator for estimation of the inundation depth the developed gp based framework is capable of robust and straightforward quantification of the uncertainty associated with the predictions without requiring additional model evaluations and simulations further this study explores the computational advantages of using a gp based emulator over alternative methodologies such as neural networks by undertaking a comparative analysis for the case study data presented in this paper the gp model was found to accurately reproduce water depths and inundation extent by classification and produce computational speedups of approximately 10 000 times compared with the original simulator and 80 times for a neural network based emulator graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flood prediction lisflood fp gaussian process emulator spatiotemporal outputs dimensionality reduction extreme event simulation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction numerical modelling and simulations of flooding scenarios is a vital part of flood risk management enabling timely planning and response to extreme climatic events a range of complex numerical modelling techniques have been developed in the past decade to accurately simulate the flow structure interactions and the corresponding hydrodynamic structure these models differ on factors such as scale spatial resolution e g global continental basin numerical techniques complexity as measured by the number of dimensions considered to model the flow 1d 2d and 3d the underlying processes which lead to flooding events i e inland and coastal flood and the model outputs hence there are significant differences between the capabilities accuracy and robustness of the available flood models much research has been conducted into reviewing the current hydrodynamic modelling strategies teng et al 2017 bulti abebe 2020 and assessing the performance of existing widely used flood models fewtrell et al 2011 zischg et al 2018 a primary drawback of the existing numerical simulations for flood modelling is the associated computational costs to generate results despite active research to enhance the computational capabilities of these models accurate flood modelling at high spatiotemporal resolutions could still be prohibitively expensive in most flood modelling studies it is also desirable to understand the influence of varying the inputs on the outputs and simulate potential flooding scenarios in depth understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model outputs and the model parameterisation is essential to establish a robust flood modelling framework there are several approached to address these questions including sensitivity analysis noori et al 2022 oakley o hagan 2004 daneshkhah bedford 2013 uncertainty quantification ghiasi et al 2022 soize 2017 ghanem et al 2017 and model calibration lee et al 2019 kennedy o hagan 2001 however these techniques generally require very large numbers of model runs indicating that performing such tasks can become infeasible with even modest model computation times and so alternative modelling approaches are needed for robust and timely analysis of numerical models one approach to mitigate the high costs associated with numerical flood modelling tools is to utilise parallel and gpu computing techniques sharif et al 2020 morales hernandez et al 2021 neal et al 2018 abolfathi et al 2018 yeganeh bakhtiary et al 2020 at high temporal and spatial resolutions although parallel cpu and gpu implementations can significantly reduce the computation time a single simulation of such models can take many hours to complete abolfathi et al 2018 goodarzi et al 2020 shaw et al 2021 despite the computational limitations in many cases numerical modelling is the most reliable tool for simulation and prediction of flooding and inundation especially when no alternative data driven approaches van steenbergen et al 2012 abolfathi et al 2016 can be utilised due to sparse empirical observations the adoption of machine learning ml approaches mosavi et al 2018 yang chang 2020 lin et al 2020 in flood modelling could alleviate the high computational costs associated with numerical modelling allowing a wider range of scenarios to be considered in a reasonable amount of time and with more accessible computational resources the increasing dependence on numerical models for applications in science and engineering and their associated computational costs has led to the development and adoption of a new class of ml based models known as surrogate models or probabilistic emulators an emulator is a statistical model that approximates the outputs of a usually complex model where the model can be considered as a deterministic input output computer simulator sarri et al 2012 the emulator considered in this paper is originated from model output o hagan 2006 where working with the convenient simulators representing complex mathematical models is computationally very expensive an emulator should approximate the output of a simulator to a sufficient level of accuracy with a significant reduction in associated computational cost and the required training datapoints in recent years several studies focused on the use of emulators for a range of numerical models including tsunami models sarri et al 2012 salmanidou et al 2017 flood models kabir et al 2020 and climate projection models tran et al 2019 a variety of approaches have been examined for statistical emulation including artificial neural networks garcía alba et al 2019 wang et al 2019 polynomial chaos expansions massoud 2019 moreno rodenas et al 2018 and gaussian processes conti et al 2009 chang et al 2015 longobardi et al 2020 yang et al 2018 kabir et al 2020 proposed a deep convolutional neural network cnn model to emulate flood simulation results from a numerical model to generate rapid predictions of inundation levels benchmarked against a support vector regression svr model kabir et al 2020 found the cnn model outperforms svr with respect to classification metrics such as precision and recall and slightly underperforms with respect to regression metrics such as rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency however when validating the model only a very small subset of the locations in the domain were chosen to validate the model at which may not provide the most accurate assessment of the model performance the proposed emulator was more than 20 times faster compared to the underlying numerical model however while the computational improvements are significant relative to the original numerical model the runtime of the emulator may still be prohibitively computationally expensive for tasks such as scenario modelling sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification kabir et al 2020 further concluded that in contrast to gps the cnn based approach can not readily quantify the uncertainty associated with the emulator predictions there are several ml based techniques which have led to a variety of hybrid approaches to forecasting flood inundation depth utilising the computationally expensive physics based numerical models and ml methodologies these approaches often aim to reconstruct or simplify the modelling problem to make it more tenable for ml approaches and have had success in reconstructing inundation values yan et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 however in this study a novel gp based methodology is developed to emulate the outputs of a 2d hydraulic flood model making as few modelling simplifications as possible the proposed model will require far less model evaluations and consequently significant reduction in the computational resources needed and model s runtime the numerical model used in this study is lisflood fp originally developed by bates de roo 2000 for flood inundation simulations due to the high number of model outputs to be considered a dimensionality reduction scheme is developed on the output space to reduce the computational complexity of modelling with multi output gp models the proposed model has low computational costs and is capable of straightforward quantification of predictive uncertainty the appropriateness and robustness of the developed multi outputs gp model for predicting flood inundation depths is examined for a case study data in north yorkshire uk and a direct comparison is made between the outlined gp methodology and cnn model proposed by kabir et al 2020 2 methods 2 1 numerical flood modelling numerical flood models simulate the interactions of water flow with the surrounding environment using partial differential equations pdes that govern the motion of the fluid flow many open source models exist for modelling flood in two dimensions i e spatial coordinates including lisflood lisflood fp mike flood and telemac 2d these models have been successfully validated for modelling inland and coastal flooding scenarios pinos timbe 2019 dong et al 2018 abolfathi et al 2018 this study adopts lisflood fp a two dimensional hydraulic model hereafter 2d flood model capable of utilising high resolution topographic data for simulating flood inundation depths in challenging urban settings the accuracy of lisflood fp for predicting inundation levels is validated by several studies e g shustikova et al 2019 o loughlin et al 2020 2d flood models make the simplifying assumption that the depth of the water is shallow compared with the magnitude of the other spatial dimensions and as a result vertical variations in flow and velocity structure can be ignored the shallow water equations are commonly used as the governing equations of 2d flood models to determine the interactions between fluid flow and the environment lisflood fp simplifies the problem of simulating 2d flow by decoupling the flows in x and y directions and treats the simulation of 2d flow as a series of calculations in one dimension through the cell face boundaries shustikova et al 2019 the governing equations used for flow modelling in this study including the conservation of mass eq 1 and momentum eq 2 are represented as follows 1 q x a t q 2 s 0 n 2 p 4 3 q 2 a 10 3 h x 0 where q is the volumetric flow rate in the channel a denotes the cross sectional area of the flow q is the flow into the channel from other sources e g precipitations wastewater discharge s 0 is the bed slope n denotes the manning s roughness coefficient p is the wetted perimeter of the channel and ℎ stands for the flow depth the numerical model adopted in this study discretises the governing equations over square type eulerian grids by discretising the domain into a rectangular grid of h w cells the model uses an adaptive numerical time stepping scheme to determine δ t fluid flow between two cells is described as a function between the cells over time 3 d h i j δ t q x i 1 j q x i j q y i j 1 q y i j δ x δ y where h i j is the water free surface height at cell i j δ x and δ y are the cell size in the x and y direction and q x i j and q y i j are the volumetric flow rates between cells in the floodplain the reader should refer to bates de roo 2000 for a full explanation of the governing equations and numerical implementation flood simulations with lisflood fp requires parameterisation with a topographic dataset boundary conditions describing fluid flows into and out of the model domains choice of numerical solvers and other case specific parameters such as friction coefficients in this study assuming d sources of time varying boundary conditions lisflood fp can be considered as a function f x t taking inputs x t r d describing the time varying boundary conditions at time t the outputs generated at each simulation timestep is a matrix of inundation depths y t f x t r h w for a rectangular modelling domain of h w cells where y i j t denotes the water level in cell i j at time t however for mathematical convenience the matrices y t are flattened into vectors y t r h w as illustrated in fig 1 therefore a single flood simulation with t timesteps can be described by the dataset d x y x r t d y r t hw where x x t t 1 t and y y t t 1 t are matrices corresponding to the row wise aggregation of each x t and y t 2 2 gaussian processes a gaussian process is a stochastic process defined as a collection of random variables any finite number of which have a joint gaussian distribution rasmussen williams 2006 in other words a gp can be simply considered as a generalisation of the multivariate gaussian distribution retaining many convenient mathematical properties of the multivariate gaussian distribution however instead of being defined over finite length vectors and parameterised by a mean vector and covariance matrix a gp is defined over functions and parameterised by mean and covariance functions a gp is a possibly infinite distribution that is fully specified by its mean function m x i and its kernel covariance function k x i x j referred to as the kernel function for a real process f x i such as a numerical model taking boundary conditions x i at time t i as outlined in section 2 1 the mean and kernel functions can be written as 4 m x i e f x i 5 c o v x i x j k x i x j e f x i m x i f x j m x j leading to the prior distribution over functions 6 f x i g p m x i k x i x j which can be read as some function f at a given location in the input space x i is distributed as a gp with mean function m and kernel function k a real kernel is a symmetric function which can approximately be considered to provide a metric of similarity between two points x i and x j eq 6 outlines a prior distribution over target functions and encapsulates the prior beliefs about the space of functions from which the target function f could be drawn from in practice mean functions and kernel functions are replaced with finite length mean vectors μ 0 and covariance matrices k whose entries are k i j k x i x j it should be noted that the zero mean function assumption is common in ml applications and this does not limit the mean of the posterior to zero for further details see rasmussen and williams 2006 the flexibility of gps comes from the choices of kernel functions and their parameterisations these choices will determine the properties of candidate functions such as smoothness and variability by combining the prior distribution with the observed dataset the space of candidate functions is constrained to only contain functions which interpolate exactly or approximately the training datapoints obtaining a posterior distribution over the function of interest it is more common in practice to have a collection of noisy observations of some target function y i f x i ε where ε is additive independently identically distributed gaussian noise with variance σ n 2 the prior on the noisy observations can be rewritten as 7 k i j k x i x j δ i j σ n 2 where δ i j 1 if i j otherwise δ i j 0 and 8 c o v y k x x σ n 2 i where x r n d is the design matrix consisting of n training instances which here represents the numerical timesteps in flood simulations in which each row corresponds to x i r d therefore given a set of observations x y where x is the previously mentioned design matrix and y y i i 1 n is a vector of noisy training outputs a joint prior distribution over observed outputs y and predicted outputs f at a set of test inputs x can be defined as 9 y f n 0 k σ n 2 i k k t k where 10 k r n n k x x k r n n k x x k t r n n k x x k r n n k x x by conditioning the prior distribution on the observed data the posterior distribution of zero mean gaussian process over the test inputs is given as 11 f y x x n μ σ where 12 μ k t k σ n 2 i 1 y 13 σ k k t k σ n 2 i 1 k eq 11 shows that within the gp framework prediction is equivalent to the construction of a full multivariate gaussian posterior distribution over function values at new unseen points in the input space hence μ can be considered as the mean prediction and σ the variance associated with the mean prediction 2 2 1 learning the hyperparameters in the gp modelling framework assuming a zero mean training the model means choosing an appropriate kernel function and using the training data to optimise the kernel s hyperparameters the default kernel used in gp regression models is the squared exponential se kernel 14 k x i x j σ 2 exp x i x j 2 l 2 where σ 2 is the output variance determining the average distance of the function from the mean value and l is the lengthscale which determines how quickly the function varies and determines how the covariances decay with distance between points the se kernel function generalises well to many applications yet it makes assumptions about smoothness which often are not realistic in this study a zero mean function and the matern3 2 kernel function are used for the development of the gp model the matern3 2 kernel is a stationary kernel operating only on the euclidean distance between points with origins in spatial statistics and is commonly used for modelling physical processes rasmussen williams 2006 furthermore preliminary testing showed the matern3 2 eq 15 to outperform the se for the flood modelling context addressed in this study 15 k x i x j c 3 2 d σ 2 1 3 x i x 2 j l exp 3 x i x 2 j l σ n 2 δ i j where δ i j 1 if i j otherwise δ i j 0 the kernel s hyperparameters denoted by θ σ 2 l σ n 2 are determined through maximum likelihood estimation with respect to each hyperparameter where σ 2 is the variance parameter l is the length scale and σ n 2 is a gaussian noise parameter to estimate kernel hyperparameters the log marginal likelihood is maximised with respect to the hyperparameters given that prior distribution over observations can be expressed as y n 0 k σ n 2 i y n 0 k σ n 2 i the log marginal likelihood explicitly conditioned on kernel hyperparameters can be written as 16 log p y x θ 1 2 y t k σ n 2 i 1 y 1 2 log k σ n 2 i n 2 log 2 π by taking partial derivatives with respect to each hyperparameters the marginal likelihood can be maximised as 17 θ j log p y x θ 1 2 y t k y 1 k y θ j k y 1 y 1 2 t r k y 1 k y θ j where k y k σ n 2 i and t r is the trace operator performing this operation scales with o n 3 computational complexity from the inversion of k y matrix 2 3 dimensionality reduction with the lisflood fp model the outputs describe inundation across the study area for each timestep when constructing a statistical emulator a collection of k design floods d i i 1 k where d i x i r t i d y i r t i hw consisting of t i timesteps where h is the number of cells in the model in the x direction and w in the y direction is used to train and validate the emulator the input output data matrices from each design flood are aggregated into new input output matrices x r n d and y r n hw with a new number of aggregated timesteps n t 1 t k for numerical simulators operating at high spatiotemporal resolutions this can result in very large values of h w and n to overcome computational issues arising from modelling a very high dimensional output using gps a dimensionality reduction dr scheme is first developed and applied to the outputs of lisflood fp simulations making the construction of a gp based statistical emulator more feasible principal component analysis pca decomposition is implemented using a randomised implementation of single value decomposition svd halko et al 2009 feng et al 2018 this transformation produces a lower dimensional dataset of latent features z r n d to replace the original dataset y r n hw the output features in the original dataset correspond to the water depths in cells of the output domain and so it can be expected that there will exist significant linear spatial correlations in the data a structure which pca can effectively represent in a lower dimensional space cheng et al 2022 furthermore pca relies on linear transformations allowing it to scale easily to very high dimensional datasets and has a computationally efficient decoding process to reconstruct the original observations from the latent features 2 4 pca gp development for standard gp regression problems only functions of the form f r d r are considered such that when performing gp regression a scalar output y i is regressed onto a vector valued input x i this type of gp regression scales cubically with the number of training instances o n 3 which means the gp has the order of n 3 time complexity or express the runtime in terms of how quickly it grows relative to the size of the input as the size of input gets larger however after the construction of the latent feature dataset z there are d outputs to be modelled and so construction of the emulator is equivalent to a vector valued regression problem in which the mapping f r d r d is learned approaches for vector valued gp regression have been explored and methods such as the linear model of coregionalization lmc have been proposed alvarez et al 2012 however exact implementation of these methods would result in the computational complexity of o d n 3 using the reduced dataset z a collection of independent single output gps sogp is utilised to model each latent feature independently given that applying pca constructs a collection of orthogonal latent features possibly removing correlations between output features the exact implementation of this methodology will scale with o d n 3 computational complexity as it is evident the computational time of sogp is at least d 2 time faster than the lcm method fig 2 illustrates the computational complexity of alternative approaches to vector valued gp regression for a varying number of features d using a baseline of n 1000 training instances this figure implicitly highlights how infeasible a naive implementation of the original dataset would be for which d 800 000 fig 3 shows a graphical representation of the gp model with d input features and d independent output features mapping each input vector to a scalar via a gp f j for j 1 d for each gp in this model a zero mean function and the matern3 2 kernel function are used with the hyperparameters for each determined as outlined in section 2 2 2 5 validation metrics when building statistical emulators the primary concerns are predictive accuracy and time taken to generate new predictions in this study the modified versions of the root mean squared log error rmsle and root mean squared error rmse defined by eqs 18 and 19 respectively will be used for assessing regression performance 18 r m s l e ω log y ω i log y ω i 2 ω 19 r m s e ω y ω i y ω i 2 ω where for each simulation ω is the set of cell indexes in which either lisflood fp or the gp emulator predict an inundation value greater than 0 at any time step this reduces the number of cells averaged over providing a more realistic error metric because most of the cells will never see any inundation causing the average error to be reduced furthermore the log error is used as well as ordinary rmse as it could give a more realistic weighting to the errors given that the relative error of prediction is more important than the absolute value the error should be weighted accordingly for instance in a deep section of the river the emulator s prediction error may be large in an absolute sense but this might not be the case when scaled against the true value whereas in the floodplain where inundation is lower a small absolute error could represent a significant difference in the interpretation of the results the model s ability to correctly classify wet dry cells is also assessed to convert regression predictions into a classification task an inundation threshold c is applied as a binary classifier to determine if a cell is wet or dry 20 y 1 y c 0 y c different values of c were trialled including 0 05m 0 1m and 0 3m a threshold of c 0 3 is recommended following the flood risk assessment conducted by aldrige et al 2016 in which it was concluded that properties intersecting a flood depth of 0 3m would be determined as flooded having established a binary classification scheme an assessment of classification performance is conducted using true positive rate tpr false positive rate fpr and f1 score defined by eqs 21 23 respectively 21 t p r t p t p f n 22 f p r f p f p t n 23 f 1 t p t p 1 2 f p f n where t p and t n are the number of true positives and negatives respectively f p and f n are the number of false positives and negatives respectively 3 case study 3 1 site description and modelling domain the gp modelling framework developed in this study is adopted for a case study of urban flood modelling in tadcaster uk tadcaster is a town situated between york and leeds in the northeast of england the town is prone to flooding from the river wharfe which is running through the centre of the town in december 2015 fig 4 in the aftermath of storm frank the town faced its worst flood in recorded history during which many of businesses and homes were evacuated and the town s critical infrastructure e g bridge and roads suffered major damages from the force of the flood waters as a result of the extensive flood damages from the 2015 storm frank a 10m flood defence scheme was proposed to enhance the flood resilience of the town for extreme climatic events however the project execution and completion has been delayed until 2026 due to modelling inaccuracies laycock 2021 hence this study examines the performance of the proposed gp based emulator for flood scenario modelling of tadcaster with the aim of producing instantaneous inundation predictions and allowing for the quantification of uncertainty surrounding the model predictions fig 5 illustrates the 3 6km2 study domain that is considered for the case study in this paper 3 2 topographic data lisflood fp was parameterised with a digital elevation map dem describing the topography of the modelling domain the dem was constructed using digital terrain models dtm to capture the elevation of the underlying surface and then key geographical features and urban structures were reinserted to ensure accurate and realistic flow routing in an urban environment flood modelling in urban environments requires high resolution spatial data and therefore this study constructed the dem with a 2m resolution resulting in a two dimensional eulerian mesh of 876 204 cells fig 6 compares elevation in meters above the sea level for the original dtm fig 6a and the post processed dem used in the flood model fig 6b 3 3 boundary conditions time varying point source hydrographs at upstream points at the north side of the domain were used as the boundary conditions for each simulation scenario alongside a free boundary at the southern downstream boundary the hydrographs were determined using discharge data collected from a river monitoring station within the domain from the empirical discharge data a collection of candidate flood hydrographs was extracted as the basis for synthetic hydrographs then by sampling peak discharge values from a pareto distribution fitted using historical peaks over threshold data the hydrographs were re scaled to match the peak discharge values this study focused on modelling extreme climatic events by oversampling from the upper tails of the peak discharge distribution to investigate scenarios with more severe flooding this study simulates 14 synthetic flood scenarios described by datasets d i i 1 14 to investigate the extent of inundation and flood water depth across the domain for each hydrograph a discharge value is recorded for the river wharfe at 15 minute intervals and input to the numerical flood model 3 4 lisflood fp inundation data following implementation of the topographic features of the case study location and the boundary conditions the lisflood fp was used to simulate the flood for the synthetic hydrographs a spatially varying manning s friction coefficient was applied with values determined based on the land usage papaioannou et al 2018 fig 8 presents the land cover map with the respective manning s coefficient values to minimize the potential uncertainty associated with the simulation results an inundation threshold of 0 03m was applied where an inundation less than 0 03m was assigned to 0 following the completion of the simulations the water depth inundation data was aggregated across simulations the discharge value for time t i along with the values at t i i i 2 i 8 is used as training input for the gp emulator these input features were then scaled to have zero mean and unit variance resulting in aggregated inputs x r 2624 9 and outputs y r 2624 876204 for the construction of the emulator model i e 2624 aggregated timesteps across all 14 simulations and 876 204 features cells for each timestep 3 5 latent feature dataset the dimensionality reduction approach outlined in section 2 2 was then applied to y to produce a dataset of latent variables z r 2624 d it was determined to set d 6 after experimentation found that the first six principal components were sufficient to explain 99 of the variance within the dataset to assess the fit of this pca decomposition the rmse between the original dataset and the reconstruction of the latent features back to the original features space was assessed eq 24 the rmse obtained was 0 018m meaning the reconstruction deviates from the original by 1 8cm on average 24 rmse y ϕ 1 ϕ y performing 10 fold cross validation on the pca transformation found the result obtained from eq 24 to be highly consistent across folds showing the methodology generalises well to out of sample test instances fig 9 illustrates the new dataset z plotting each of principal component values aggregated across all the hydrographs the delineation between each of the 14 hydrographs is highlighted by the blue dashed lines the unit of measurement on the y axis can be ignored as the regression performance in the latent feature space is not interpreted fig 10 illustrates a visual representation of the complete methodology employed in this study to build and train the gp emulator for inland flood modelling highlighting the sequential modelling process and data sources fig 11 shows how the constructed emulator can then be employed to make predictions on unseen data as a replacement for the lisflood fp flood simulation model 4 results and discussion 4 1 cross validation results to validate the gp model and assess out of sample performance leave one out cross validation loocv method was implemented whereby the gp based emulator is trained on 13 synthetic hydrographs fig 7 and predictive performance is assessed on the remaining hydrograph repeating this process for all 14 training examples fig 12 illustrates the model s regression performance showing the test rmsle and rmse values for each held out hydrograph the mean rmsle and rmse values are 0 11 and 0 21 respectively as expected the rmsle values are lower than the rmse and are theoretically expected to be a better estimate of the model s error reasonable variance among the results from cross validation testing is observed with hydrographs 8 being somewhat of an outlier however overall consistency in performance across the test cases are evident while good regression performance is important the ability to correctly identify areas as wet dry is essential for flood risk management and produce interpretable forecasts as such classification was also considered utilising the scheme outlined in eq 20 fig 13 shows the cross validation classification performance differentiating the model performance by the threshold value c used table 1 provides a full breakdown of the mean averaged across cross validation folds scores for each metric at each threshold the scores remain relatively consistent across the threshold values with no value being clearly favourable however c 0 05 appears marginally better than the other values overall the gp model clearly shows effectiveness at predicting whether cells will be wet or dry figs 14 15 illustrate regression performance in the latent feature space with 95 predictive intervals highlighted a common feature of these plots is the ability of each gp to accurately predict the value of the first 3 principal components in each test case the performance on the following 3 components is more varied and the model expresses greater uncertainty surrounding the predictions for these features as illustrated by the significantly wider confidence intervals however the earlier principal components capture most of the variance within the dataset and so accurate prediction of these is significantly more important than accurate prediction of the latter components figs 16 17 illustrate results of flood modelling for hydrographs 7 and 9 during the cross validation process the data from these simulations is held out for testing while the model trains on the other 13 hydrographs respectively in the original feature space after projecting predictions on the latent feature space back to the high dimensional space the maximum water depth in each cell across the entire simulation is plotted and then a water depth threshold of 0 3m is applied to the cells if the maximum inundation across the flood event is greater than 0 3m the cells is highlighted and left blank otherwise figs 18 19 illustrates the difference between the average water depth produced from lisflood fp simulation and the predictions by the gp emulator this allows the exploration of the average prediction error on a cell by cell basis similar results are observed in both scenarios with the gp model s error being approximately 0 for very large sections of the inundated areas and smaller areas of higher errors was observed in both cases the areas of higher error correspond to the areas with more complex urban topography which are in closest proximity to the river reaches to improve future model performance in similar scenarios the training data could be chosen such that a wide range of inundation scenarios in these areas is observed 4 2 benchmarking to robustly assess the performance of the proposed gp model against alternative methods of statistical emulation the cnn model fig 20 outlined in kabir et al 2020 was reconstructed for this study to make a direct comparison of predictive performance between the two methodologies performing the same approach to cross validation by training 14 different cnns each time holding one hydrograph out as validation data a direct comparison of gp and cnn model performance can be made table 2 shows the cross validation regression performance and table 3 describes the classification performance of each model although performance of both models is quite similar the results show that the gp model outperforms cnn with respect to both regression and classification these results confirm the findings of previous studies in terms of the ability of deep learning methodologies to tackle these complex predictive tasks however this study proves the capability of the proposed gp methodology to outperform alternative emulations which cannot be directly evaluated for uncertainty quantification the proposed gp model is also far more robust for scenario modelling compared to alternative emulators when the computational costs is significant see section 4 3 4 3 model runtimes table 4 outlines training time run time and model size i e number of cells in modelling domain for the original lisflood fp simulator the gp based emulator developed in this study and the cnn emulator reconstructed for this study the run time is calculated as the time taken to generate new predictions for a simulation with 250 timesteps of 15 minutes the results show a significant reduction in runtime when using the gp emulator proposed in this study over the cnn however for both methods of statistical emulation very significant reductions in runtime are observed as compared with the original numerical model the gp emulator is shown to be 80 times faster than the cnn model adopted for the considered case study constructing emulators has considerable developmental cost given that training data are generated from the original numerical model which can be costly although this computational cost is common for all surrogate models the gp model can be efficiently trained with considerable limited training datapoints which makes it a very cost efficient emulator furthermore modelling decisions need to be made during development of surrogate models e g network structure for a cnn or kernel for a gp the training times in table 4 only represent the time taken to estimate model hyperparameters however the overall development time associated with emulator construction is higher due to data collection model training and validation 5 application of gp emulator for flood predictions as an example of replacing the efficient gp based emulator with the simulator a flood was simulated using an estimated 1000 year return period synthetic hydrograph using the previously constructed peak discharge distribution see section 3 3 the estimated peak discharge was 750m3 s for reference the estimated peak discharge in the 2015 flood was 480m3 s a candidate synthetic hydrograph was scaled to match this estimated peak discharge value as shown in fig 21 fig 22 shows the gp s prediction for the 1000 year return period event in the latent feature space comparing the predictions made in this instance with those seen previously in figs 14 and 15 it can be observed that there is far greater uncertainty associated with these predictions as illustrated by the much wider confidence intervals even among the first 3 principal components where accurate prediction was observed previously the uncertainty observed in the latent feature space for this set of data can be associated with the fact that the emulator did not observe a training instance like the 1000 year return period hydrograph fig 23a illustrates the inundation resulted from 1000 year flood event with fig 23b discretising this into sections of different inundation depths the grey boundary illustrates the estimated area within the modelling domain that has a 0 1 or greater risk of flooding each year as provided by the uk s environment agency overlayed in blue is the estimated inundated extent predicted from the gp model tested on the hydrograph described in fig 22 different representations of the underlying processes or initial conditions of the model will propagate differences through the simulation and can result in varied outputs for instance the gp emulator models a flash flood type scenario in which no previous inundation is present whereas the environment agency likely models on a longer timeframe and accounts for additional variables such as previous inundation and soil moisture content however there are also clear similarities and consistencies between these predictions which suggests that the proposed gp emulator model s predictions and the estimation of a 1000 year flood are in line with those of the environment agency the differences in maximum inundation between gp predictions at the upper and lower bounds of predicted 95 confidence intervals are analysed fig 24 these intervals are calculated using the variance values predicted by the gp emulator in the latent feature space since gps define a distribution over function values at test inputs using a gaussian framework there is a mean prediction and corresponding variance estimates for each test instance x i the upper and lower 95 confidence interval values are defined as 24 c i μ x i 2 σ x i fig 24 show that most of the difference between inundation estimates is limited to less than 0 5m however in some sections such as the river channel inundation differences of greater than 1m between predictive interval bounds can be observed these values can be considered to illustrate predictive uncertainty by the gp based emulator 6 conclusions a multi output gaussian process based statistical emulator was proposed for the emulation of high dimensional outputs from a numerical flood simulator the standard univariate gp regression methodology is extended to the multi output case by producing a collection of univariate gps to model each output feature independently the gp model was developed to approximate the results of a coupled hydraulic flood model i e lisflood fp and significantly reduce the computational costs associated with numerical flood modelling at high spatiotemporal resolutions to overcome the methodological issues surrounding the use of very high dimensional data in gp modelling a computationally efficient dimensionality reduction scheme was utilised the appropriateness and robustness of the proposed model is examined for a case study of a flood prone region in the uk topographical and hydrological data is collected and preprocessed to produce a realistic high resolution digital elevation model and a collection of synthetic hydrographs to parameterise and run the lisflood fp simulations inundation data in the form of water levels across the modelling domain over time is generated from the numerical simulator which is then used to build and train the gp based emulator the gp emulator was assessed against a cnn emulator by performing the cross validation to ensure no over fitting occurs in either model and to assess each methodology s ability to generalise to out of sample tests during these tests the performance of both the dimensionality reduction scheme and the gp based emulator were found to be robust the gp method outperformed the cnn emulator with respect to both regression and classification furthermore the runtime for gp emulator was very significant reduced compared with the original numerical model and the cnn emulator demonstrating the gp s high predictive accuracy fast runtimes and readily available quantification of predictive uncertainty this study demonstrates the robustness and appropriateness of the proposed gp emulator as a more efficient method of probabilistically emulating complex physics based models over alternative approaches such as the cnn based emulator however a statistical emulator is very sensitive to its experimental design choosing a representative sample of training data remains vital to building an emulator that can generalise well to out of sample tests therefore the choice of training data should be carefully considered and the training dataset should be as large comprehensive as possible while considering the associated cost of collecting new training data it should be noted that each emulator is case specific and so cannot be transferred to alternative scenarios in which different geographical areas are considered modelling a new scenario involves considerable further development time for the original simulator as well as the collection and processing of input data and simulation time however the gp emulator methodology proposed here can be easily translated to any scenario in which high resolution spatiotemporal data is being generated from a highly complex model or processes i e not just 2d inundation modelling furthermore there are likely to be constraints to the spatiotemporal extent that emulators can effectively reproduce especially with a gp methodology s computationally expensive training cost however this study demonstrated the model s high degree of accuracy for a very high spatial resolution model with over 800 000 discrete cells the developmental cost of building emulators can be very high and therefore consideration should be given to whether an emulator is necessary in the first place however for cases where the underlying model s computational cost is prohibitive to real time forecasting or for tasks requiring large numbers of simulations i e scenario modelling a gp based emulator is an efficient modelling alternative

aquatic sciences of magic angle graphene are not done so far herein we investigated the properties of ion conduction and water transportat in magic angle graphene by choosing proton and water as a proof of concept for the first time magic angle graphene with different twist angles were selected out and the proton transport in them were symmetrically investigated the results indicated that the energy barrier of proton transport had a positive correlation with the twist angle in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the smaller the magic angle was the lower the protonic migration energy barrier was the potential energy surface maps clearly depicted the obstacle that the proton needed to overcome during the migration process furthermore the water transport properties in magic angle graphene can be improved by tuning twist angles 2 experimental section for our density functional theory neuhauser et al 2014 calculations we employed the plane wave basis projector augmented wave blöchl 1994 kresse and joubert 1999 method as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package vasp kresse and furthmuller 1996 kresse and furthmüller 1996 kresse and hafner 1994 the generalized gradient approximation was used to process exchange correlation effect between electrons using the functional proposed by perdew et al 1996 this work considered 1 valence electron for hydrogen 1s 1 4 valence electrons for carbon 2s 22p 2 and 6 valence electrons for oxygen 2s 22p 4 the exchange and correlation potential with a plane wave cutoff is 500 ev the method of monkhorst and pack 1976 was used to generate the k point sampling with a mesh of 13 13 1 in the structural optimization as well as a finer k point mesh of 26 26 1 in calculating the electronic property for monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene primitive cell two angle wigner seitz cell corresponding to magic angle graphenes with 3 3 1 and 5 5 1 k point mesh were selected for structural optimization and electronic property respectively the van der waals vdw interactions was applied via the dft d2 approach grimme 2006 grimme et al 2010 the atomic structure was completely relaxed with a energy convergence range of 10 5 ev and an atomic force of below 0 001 ev å the 20 å vacuum layer in the z axis direction was considered energy barriers were calculated with the climbing image nudged elastic

henkelman et al 2006 the phonon frequencies were calculated by using phonopy code togo and tanaka 2015 which directly used the force constant hessian matrix calculated by dfpt baroni et al 2001 static calculations were visualized with vesta software momma and izumi 2008 the adsorption energy e ad is important for understanding the proton adsorption strength in the 2d host materials which is defined as 1 e ad e host h e host e h where e host h and e host are the optimized total ground state energies of the 2d host with proton and host materials themselves respectively e h is the total energy of an isolated h atom 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structures of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene in order to distinguish and compare different twist angles of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene 4 typical twist angles were selected out 0 28 38 and 60 the magic angle graphene structures with twist angles θ of 28 and 38 are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively where both red and blue atoms are denoted as c atoms for the θ 28 structure it will have a larger unit cell because its moiré angle is smaller usually after optimization the lattice constant is a b 8 893 å and the layer spacing between the upper and lower graphene layers is 3 334 å this configuration contains 52 c atoms and has an average c c bond length of 1 424 å for the θ 38 structure the optimized lattice parameter is a b 6 530 å and the layer spacing is 3 331 å in this structure there are 28 c atoms and the average c c bond length is 1 425 å we also calculated the 2d honeycomb hexagonal lattice structure of intrinsic graphene as a c atoms composition as shown in fig s1 where the c c bond length is 1 425 å and lattice parameter is 2 468 å which is well consistent with the results of other groups avouris et al 2007 pramanik and kang 2011 the phonon spectrum of graphene has no imaginary frequency fig s2 showing that our calculation results are reliable fig 1 c shows the irreducible brillouin zone the irreducible k point path г m k г corresponds to the magic angle graphene the structural data of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene are listed in table 1 the intrinsic bilayer graphene was divided into aa stacking bilayer graphene with chaotic stack and ab stacking bilayer graphene with bernina stack as shown in fig s3 the twist bilayer graphene was a new system formed by stacking two layers of graphene and rotating each other in twist bilayer graphene the relative twist between two layers of graphene broken the original symmetry of the lattice resulting in long range ordered periodic moiré pattern at the magic angle as shown in the black dashed circles in fig 2 a we defined the twist angle θ using aa stacking bilayer graphene as the benchmark as shown in fig 2 b based on this definition the θ of aa stacking graphene is 0 and that of ab stacking graphene is 60 in addition fig 2 c shows the schematic diagram of aa ab and ba stacking in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene furthermore to verify the stability of the structure two representative magic angles θ 0 and θ 38 were selected for the phonon dispersion fig s4 obviously no imaginary frequency modes over the whole brillouin zone could be found indicating that these ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene were stable as 2d materials fig 3 a and 3 b show the total density of states tdos of θ 28 and θ 38 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene as well as fig 3 c and 3 d show their energy band structures the analysis of the electronic properties shows that both configurations of the magic angle were zero band gap semiconductors similar to monolayer graphene there was a dirac cone at the k point and the band gaps of θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene were 0 005 ev and 0 006 ev respectively the tdos and energy band structures of monolayer and bilayer graphene are shown in figs s1 and s3 there was also a dirac cone at the k point and the band gaps of graphene θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene were 0 019 ev 0 102 ev and 0 002 ev respectively 3 2 hydrogen absorption in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene to explore the conduction of hydrogen ion in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene we investigated the adsorption behavior of h atom the optimal adsorption sites of h on graphene surface are shown in fig s5 and table s1 nine and seven h adsorption sites were tested for the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively according to the eq 1 and initial test all these adsorption energies e ad were comparatively close in each structure of magic angle graphene fig s6 and table s2 as well as these e a were all negative indicating that h atom can be stably adsorbed on magic angle graphene thus we selected the 1st adsorption location the start of the migration path for the follow up detailed studies thereafter the charge transfer of hydrogen adsorption in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene was calculated by the bader charge analysis method the analysis results were presented in table 2 and a negative value indicates the charge depletion the charge loss of the θ 28 and θ 38 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene were 0 125 e and 0 142 e respectively whether h was adsorbed on monolayer graphene or magic angle graphene it lost charge and changed from h atom to proton h fast proton transport is crucial for the potential use of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene for key fuel cell electrode materials the electrode material performance is determined by electronic conductivity and proton diffusion dynamics for electronic conduction we calculated the tdos of proton adsorption in magic angle graphene upon hydrogen adsorption the electronic structures of magic angle graphene become metallic which was beneficial to improve its electronic conductivity the red line in fig 3 a and b the results have indicated that the electronic conductivity could be high enough during the proton conduction process in magic angle graphene the electron localization function elf map describes the degree of electron localization kresse and hafner 1994 and the bonding type kresse and furthmüller 1996 the change of electronic properties in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene after h adsorption can also be reflected in the real space charge distribution fig 4 a and 4 b shows side views of elf maps for h adsorption in the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively by comparing these figures we can see clearly that the red area around the h is darker indicating that the charge gathered on the h was more in the θ 28 structure and it lost less charge than that of the θ 38 magic angle graphene in agreement with the results of bader charge analysis we calculated the plane averaged charge density difference of magic angle graphene after h adsorption using the formula 2 δ ρ z ρ mag h x y z dxdy ρ mag x y z dxdy ρ h x y z dxdy where ρ mag h x y z ρ mag x y z and ρ h x y z are charge densities in magic angle graphene after h adsorption magic angle graphene and hydrogen at the x y z point respectively as plotted in fig 4 c and 4 d the inset shows the corresponding isosurfaces of charge density difference yellow and blue areas denote the electron accumulation and depletion respectively for the system of whole adsorption evidently the charges transferred from h to magic angle graphene and thus more charges were accumulated in magic angle graphene and depleted in hydrogen these data coincided with the bader charge analysis the elf map and plane averaged charge density difference of monolayer the θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene are shown in figs s7 and s8 3 3 proton transport in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the electronic conductivity of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene is well known superhigh and the solid state ionics of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene also has great attractive to energy materials especially for the promising protonics the proton transport in magic angle graphene is essential for various electrodes of fuel cells and electrolyzers determing their output performance thus it is significant to investigate proton transport in magic angle graphene systematically and deeply to prevent the effect of periodicity on proton migration we constructed the 2 2 1 supercells for the structures of θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene the superlattice constants were 17 786 å and 13 060 å and the corresponding numbers of c atoms were 208 and 112 respectively these superlattice structures can be seen in the fig s9 in order to represent the migration paths of proton more clearly only the paths of proton migration in the primitive cell were schematically drawn in fig 5 a and b for the θ 28 magic angle graphene we firstly selected two migration paths for proton path ⅰ and path ⅱ path ⅰ is the lateral diffusion path of proton along the x axis of the structure the green arrow in fig 5 a and path ⅱ is the longitudinal diffusion path along the y axis the orange arrow in fig 5 a since the configuration has periodic symmetry the two migration paths could be extended in the x and y axis which in turn can simulate the diffusion of proton in magic angle graphene as can be seen in fig 5 a in path ⅰ the proton reached the equivalence site after seven migration steps in this transport process the proton migrated approximately 10 65 å within the θ 28 magic angle graphene interface corresponding to a maximum migration energy barrier of 1 063 ev as shown in fig 5 c in path ⅱ the proton also reached the equivalence site after seven migration steps the proton migrated about 10 63 å within the intercalation corresponding to a maximum transport energy barrier of 1 057 ev which was slightly reduced compared to the potential barrier of path ⅰ as shown in fig 5 e path ⅰ and path ⅱ are also selected see fig s10 for the θ 38 magic angle graphene we also chose two proton migration paths named path ⅲ and path ⅳ according to the same method the proton migrated about 7 51 å with five migration steps in path ⅲ as well as the maximum migration energy barrier was 1 326 ev as shown in fig 5 d moreover there were six migration steps in the longitudinal diffusion path path ⅳ as shown in fig 5 f the total path length of the transport process was 9 01 å and the highest migration barrier was 1 326 ev by comparing the energy barriers of proton transport in magic angle graphene there was a dramatical reduction of 0 260 ev in the structure with θ 28 than in the structure with θ 38 the results indicate that the twist angle might affect the properties of proton transport in magic angle graphene path ⅲ and path ⅳ are also selected see fig s10 additionally we summarized the migration barrier data of proton along path ⅰ ⅳ and path ⅰ ⅳ as well as the data are listed in table 3 in θ 28 magic angle graphene the migration barriers of proton are all around 1 0 ev in θ 38 magic angle graphene the proton migration barrier is about 1 3 ev the above data show that in magic angle graphene with the same twist angle the migration barrier of the proton at its interface is not much different moreover the effect of interlayer spacing on proton conduction was studied as shown in fig s11 to test the above conjecture we also investigated the proton transport in the θ 0 and θ 60 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the transport path and migration energy barrier diagrams are shown in fig s12 the proton migration barrier for the θ 0 magic angle graphene was 0 791 ev and the proton barrier for the θ 60 magic angle graphene increased to 1 585 ev besides the migration energy barrier of proton on monolayer graphene s surface was the largest at 2 028 ev black dashed line in the fig 6 we fitted these dates and discovered that the proton transport barrier in magic angle graphene showed a positive correlation with the twist angle where the linear correlation coefficient was as good as 96 3 obviously we concluded that the twist angle of magic angle graphene affected the properties of proton transport in it the smaller the twist angle was the lower the protonic migration energy barrier was and the faster the proton transport in magic angle graphene was more promisingly the results have indicated that the proton conduction in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene can be easily tuned by the twist angle to explain why the discovered law exists in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene with spontaneous symmetry breaking we calculated the potential energy surface pes for proton transport in magic angle graphene the pes is at the interface of magic angle graphene here the pes was calculated by fixing the adsorbed ions laterally at different positions and allowing all other atoms and ions to be highly relaxed in this work we scattered 12 12 and 9 9 points between the layers of the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene structures respectively and optimized a total of 144 and 81 structures to obtain relative energies with reference to the lowest energy at the most stable adsorption position fig 7 a and 7 b show the pes for proton transport in the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively the upper part of the fig 7 is the pes map in three dimensions 3d and the lower part is the pes map projected in the xy plane to facilitate data comparison we normalized the energies with blue to red indicating the energy barrier to be crossed by the proton from easy to hard the longitudinal transport paths of proton were selected for illustration where the white balls in the 3d pes map is proton and the red paths in the 3d map correspond to the white paths in the 2d map it can be clearly seen that in the θ 28 magic angle graphene the proton had more dark blue regions in the pathway during transport indicating that the energy barriers of proton to overcome are then lower on the contrary in the θ 38 magic angle graphene the proton encountered more green part or even orange part regions during the transport process this suggests that the proton encounters more obstacles in the transport process which leads to an increase in the migration energy barrier hinders the proton transport in magic angle graphene and ultimately reduces the proton transport the pes maps of the graphene θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene are shown in fig s13 it can be concluded that as the twist angle decreases the energy barrier that protons need to cross becomes smaller which in turn improves the performance of proton transport magic angle graphene as a new super material startled the world recently as shown in fig 8 a achieving the super conventional superconductivity properties as is well known cao et al 2018a 2018b discovered an intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in 1 1 magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at 1 7 k realizing an all carbon 2d superconductor and

by water transport and it is essential to explore the migration of water in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene in actual liquid or gaseous water water molecules are arranged in a disorderly manner amorphous state so individual water molecules can exist at any angle to simplify the motion postures of water molecules we selected four basic water molecule modes h2o vertical h2o horizontal h2o rotation i and h2o rotation ⅱ as shown in fig s14 water molecule attitudes are relative to the xy plane of magic angle graphene to investigate the migration properties of water among magic angle

aquatic sciences of magic angle graphene are not done so far herein we investigated the properties of ion conduction and water transportat in magic angle graphene by choosing proton and water as a proof of concept for the first time magic angle graphene with different twist angles were selected out and the proton transport in them were symmetrically investigated the results indicated that the energy barrier of proton transport had a positive correlation with the twist angle in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the smaller the magic angle was the lower the protonic migration

angle graphene can be improved by tuning twist angles 2 experimental section for our density functional theory neuhauser et al 2014 calculations we employed the plane wave basis projector augmented wave blöchl 1994 kresse and joubert 1999 method as implemented in vienna ab initio simulation package vasp kresse and furthmuller 1996 kresse and furthmüller 1996 kresse and hafner 1994 the generalized gradient approximation was used to process exchange correlation effect between electrons using the functional proposed by perdew et al 1996 this work considered 1 valence electron for hydrogen 1s 1 4 valence electrons for carbon 2s 22p 2 and 6 valence electrons for oxygen 2s 22p 4 the exchange and correlation potential with a plane wave cutoff is 500 ev the method of monkhorst and pack 1976 was used to generate the k point sampling with a mesh of 13 13 1 in the structural optimization as well as a finer k point mesh of 26 26 1 in calculating the electronic property for monolayer graphene and bilayer graphene primitive cell two angle wigner seitz cell corresponding to magic angle graphenes with 3 3 1 and 5 5 1 k point mesh were selected for structural optimization and electronic property respectively the van der waals vdw interactions was applied via the dft d2 approach grimme 2006 grimme et al 2010 the atomic structure was completely relaxed with a energy convergence range of 10 5 ev and an atomic force of below 0 001 ev å the 20 å vacuum layer in the z axis direction was considered energy barriers were calculated with the climbing image nudged elastic band method using the implementation in the vasp transition state tools henkelman et al 2000 sheppard et al 2012 the charge transfer of material was calculated by bader charge analysis method henkelman et al 2006 the phonon frequencies were calculated by using phonopy code togo and tanaka 2015 which directly used the force constant hessian matrix calculated by dfpt baroni et al 2001 static calculations were visualized with vesta software momma and izumi 2008 the adsorption energy e ad is important for understanding the proton adsorption strength in the 2d host materials which is defined as 1 e ad e host h e host e h where e host h and e host are the optimized total ground state energies of the 2d host with proton and host materials themselves respectively e h is the total energy of an isolated h atom 3 results and discussion 3 1 the structures of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene in order to distinguish and compare different twist angles of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene 4 typical twist angles were selected out 0 28 38 and 60 the magic angle graphene structures with twist angles θ of 28 and 38 are shown in fig 1 a and 1 b respectively where both red and blue atoms are denoted as c atoms for the θ 28 structure it will have a larger unit cell because its moiré angle is smaller usually after optimization the lattice constant is a b 8 893 å and the layer spacing between the upper and lower graphene layers is 3 334 å this configuration contains 52 c atoms and has an average c c bond length of 1 424 å for the θ 38 structure the optimized lattice parameter is a b 6 530 å and the layer spacing is 3 331 å in this structure there are 28 c atoms and the average c c bond length is 1 425 å we also calculated the 2d honeycomb hexagonal lattice structure of intrinsic graphene as a c atoms composition as shown in fig s1 where the c c bond length is 1 425 å and lattice parameter is 2 468 å which is well consistent with the results of other groups avouris et al 2007 pramanik and kang 2011 the phonon spectrum of graphene has no imaginary frequency fig s2 showing that our calculation results are reliable fig 1 c shows the irreducible brillouin zone the irreducible k point path г m k г corresponds to the magic angle graphene the structural data of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene are listed in table 1 the intrinsic bilayer graphene was divided into aa stacking bilayer graphene with chaotic stack and ab stacking bilayer graphene with bernina stack as shown in fig s3 the twist bilayer graphene was a new system formed by stacking two layers of graphene and rotating each other in twist bilayer graphene the relative twist between two layers of graphene broken the original symmetry of the lattice resulting in long range ordered periodic moiré pattern at the magic angle as shown in the black dashed circles in fig 2 a we defined the twist angle θ using aa stacking bilayer graphene as the benchmark as shown in fig 2 b based on this definition the θ of aa stacking graphene is 0 and that of ab stacking graphene is 60 in addition fig 2 c shows the schematic diagram of aa ab and ba stacking in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene furthermore to verify the stability of the structure two representative magic angles θ 0 and θ 38 were selected for the phonon dispersion fig s4 obviously no imaginary frequency modes over the whole brillouin zone could be found indicating that these ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene were stable as 2d materials fig 3 a and 3 b show the total density of states tdos of θ 28 and θ 38 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene as well as fig 3 c and 3 d show their energy band structures the analysis of the electronic properties shows that both configurations of the magic angle were zero band gap semiconductors similar to monolayer graphene there was a dirac cone at the k point and the band gaps of θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene were 0 005 ev and 0 006 ev respectively the tdos and energy band structures of monolayer and bilayer graphene are shown in figs s1 and s3 there was also a dirac cone at the k point and the band gaps of graphene θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene were 0 019 ev 0 102 ev and 0 002 ev respectively 3 2 hydrogen absorption in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene to explore the conduction of hydrogen ion in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene we investigated the adsorption behavior of h atom the optimal adsorption sites of h on graphene surface are shown in fig s5 and table s1 nine and seven h adsorption sites were tested for the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively according to the eq 1 and initial test all these adsorption energies e ad were comparatively close in each structure of magic angle graphene fig s6 and table s2 as well as these e a were all negative indicating that h atom can be stably adsorbed on magic angle graphene thus we selected the 1st adsorption location the start of the migration path for the follow up detailed studies thereafter the charge transfer of hydrogen adsorption in the ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene was calculated by the bader charge analysis method the analysis results were presented in table 2 and a negative value indicates the charge depletion the charge loss of the θ 28 and θ 38 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene were 0 125 e and 0 142 e respectively whether h was adsorbed on monolayer graphene or magic angle graphene it lost charge and changed from h atom to proton h fast proton transport is crucial for the potential use of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene for key fuel cell electrode materials the electrode material performance is determined by electronic conductivity and proton diffusion dynamics for electronic conduction we calculated the tdos of proton adsorption in magic angle graphene upon hydrogen adsorption the electronic structures of magic angle graphene become metallic which was beneficial to improve its electronic conductivity the red line in fig 3 a and b the results have indicated that the electronic conductivity could be high enough during the proton conduction process in magic angle graphene the electron localization function elf map describes the degree of electron localization kresse and hafner 1994 and the bonding type kresse and furthmüller 1996 the change of electronic properties in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene after h adsorption can also be reflected in the real space charge distribution fig 4 a and 4 b shows side views of elf maps for h adsorption in the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively by comparing these figures we can see clearly that the red area around the h is darker indicating that the charge gathered on the h was more in the θ 28 structure and it lost less charge than that of the θ 38 magic angle graphene in agreement with the results of bader charge analysis we calculated the plane averaged charge density difference of magic angle graphene after h adsorption using the formula 2 δ ρ z ρ mag h x y z dxdy ρ mag x y z dxdy ρ h x y z dxdy where ρ mag h x y z ρ mag x y z and ρ h x y z are charge densities in magic angle graphene after h adsorption magic angle graphene and hydrogen at the x y z point respectively as plotted in fig 4 c and 4 d the inset shows the corresponding isosurfaces of charge density difference yellow and blue areas denote the electron accumulation and depletion respectively for the system of whole adsorption evidently the charges transferred from h to magic angle graphene and thus more charges were accumulated in magic angle graphene and depleted in hydrogen these data coincided with the bader charge analysis the elf map and plane averaged charge density difference of monolayer the θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene are shown in figs s7 and s8 3 3 proton transport in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the electronic conductivity of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene is well known superhigh and the solid state ionics of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene also has great attractive to energy materials especially for the promising protonics the proton transport in magic angle graphene is essential for various electrodes of fuel cells and electrolyzers determing their output performance thus it is significant to investigate proton transport in magic angle graphene systematically and deeply to prevent the effect of periodicity on proton migration we constructed the 2 2 1 supercells for the structures of θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene the superlattice constants were 17 786 å and 13 060 å and the corresponding numbers of c atoms were 208 and 112 respectively these superlattice structures can be seen in the fig s9 in order to represent the migration paths of proton more clearly only the paths of proton migration in the primitive cell were schematically drawn in fig 5 a and b for the θ 28 magic angle graphene we firstly selected two migration paths for proton path ⅰ and path ⅱ path ⅰ is the lateral diffusion path of proton along the x axis of the structure the green arrow in fig 5 a and path ⅱ is the longitudinal diffusion path along the y axis the orange arrow in fig 5 a since the configuration has periodic symmetry the two migration paths could be extended in the x and y axis which in turn can simulate the diffusion of proton in magic angle graphene as can be seen in fig 5 a in path ⅰ the proton reached the equivalence site after seven migration steps in this transport process the proton migrated approximately 10 65 å within the θ 28 magic angle graphene interface corresponding to a maximum migration energy barrier of 1 063 ev as shown in fig 5 c in path ⅱ the proton also reached the equivalence site after seven migration steps the proton migrated about 10 63 å within the intercalation corresponding to a maximum transport energy barrier of 1 057 ev which was slightly reduced compared to the potential barrier of path ⅰ as shown in fig 5 e path ⅰ and path ⅱ are also selected see fig s10 for the θ 38 magic angle graphene we also chose two proton migration paths named path ⅲ and path ⅳ according to the same method the proton migrated about 7 51 å with five migration steps in path ⅲ as well as the maximum migration energy barrier was 1 326 ev as shown in fig 5 d moreover there were six migration steps in the longitudinal diffusion path path ⅳ as shown in fig 5 f the total path length of the transport process was 9 01 å and the highest migration barrier was 1 326 ev by comparing the energy barriers of proton transport in magic angle graphene there was a dramatical reduction of 0 260 ev in the structure with θ 28 than in the structure with θ 38 the results indicate that the twist angle might affect the properties of proton transport in magic angle graphene path ⅲ and path ⅳ are also selected see fig s10 additionally we summarized the migration barrier data of proton along path ⅰ ⅳ and path ⅰ ⅳ as well as the data are listed in table 3 in θ 28 magic angle graphene the migration barriers of proton are all around 1 0 ev in θ 38 magic angle graphene the proton migration barrier is about 1 3 ev the above data show that in magic angle graphene with the same twist angle the migration barrier of the proton at its interface is not much different moreover the effect of interlayer spacing on proton conduction was studied as shown in fig s11 to test the above conjecture we also investigated the proton transport in the θ 0 and θ 60 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene the transport path and migration energy barrier diagrams are shown in fig s12 the proton migration barrier for the θ 0 magic angle graphene was 0 791 ev and the proton barrier for the θ 60 magic angle graphene increased to 1 585 ev besides the migration energy barrier of proton on monolayer graphene s surface was the largest at 2 028 ev black dashed line in the fig 6 we fitted these dates and discovered that the proton transport barrier in magic angle graphene showed a positive correlation with the twist angle where the linear correlation coefficient was as good as 96 3 obviously we concluded that the twist angle of magic angle graphene affected the properties of proton transport in it the smaller the twist angle was the lower the protonic migration energy barrier was and the faster the proton transport in magic angle graphene was more promisingly the results have indicated that the proton conduction in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene can be easily tuned by the twist angle to explain why the discovered law exists in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene with spontaneous symmetry breaking we calculated the potential energy surface pes for proton transport in magic angle graphene the pes is at the interface of magic angle graphene here the pes was calculated by fixing the adsorbed ions laterally at different positions and allowing all other atoms and ions to be highly relaxed in this work we scattered 12 12 and 9 9 points between the layers of the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene structures respectively and optimized a total of 144 and 81 structures to obtain relative energies with reference to the lowest energy at the most stable adsorption position fig 7 a and 7 b show the pes for proton transport in the θ 28 and θ 38 magic angle graphene respectively the upper part of the fig 7 is the pes map in three dimensions 3d and the lower part is the pes map projected in the xy plane to facilitate data comparison we normalized the energies with blue to red indicating the energy barrier to be crossed by the proton from easy to hard the longitudinal transport paths of proton were selected for illustration where the white balls in the 3d pes map is proton and the red paths in the 3d map correspond to the white paths in the 2d map it can be clearly seen that in the θ 28 magic angle graphene the proton had more dark blue regions in the pathway during transport indicating that the energy barriers of proton to overcome are then lower on the contrary in the θ 38 magic angle graphene the proton encountered more green part or even orange part regions during the transport process this suggests that the proton encounters more obstacles in the transport process which leads to an increase in the migration energy barrier hinders the proton transport in magic angle graphene and ultimately reduces the proton transport the pes maps of the graphene θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene are shown in fig s13 it can be concluded that as the twist angle decreases the energy barrier that protons need to cross becomes smaller which in turn improves the performance of proton transport magic angle graphene as a new super material startled the world recently as shown in fig 8 a achieving the super conventional superconductivity properties as is well known cao et al 2018a 2018b discovered an intrinsic unconventional superconductivity in 1 1 magic angle twisted bilayer graphene at 1 7 k realizing an all carbon 2d superconductor and inspiring potential high critical temperature superconductors the electronic properties of magic angle graphene were characterized by double isolated flat electronic bands being useful to the discovery of strongly correlated electrons and exotic correlated systems based on the flat electronic bands with topological character nuckolls et al 2020 investigated the topological properties of magic angle graphene by the local spectroscopic technique of scanning tunnelling microscope and found the strongly correlated chern insulating phases creating the topological phases of not exiting in weakly interacting materials uri et al 2020 investigated the influence of twisted angle disorder on quantum hall effect in magic angle graphene by squid on tip using the twist angle gradients for band structure engineering and realizing the correlated phenomena for device design the magnetism properties of magic angle graphene were discovered by polshyn et al 2020 experimentally demonstrating the voltage control of magnetic states in an orbital chern insulator and applying in reconfigurable microwave circuit elements and ultralow power magnetic memories the mechanical properties of magic angle graphene were investigated by hou et al 2019 getting the magic angle of 10 9 for the normal auxeticity transition and inspiring the potential nonlinear dimensional response on the strong mechanical loading at different temperatures the phononic properties of magic angle graphene were investigated via the electron phonon coupling in it by lian et al 2019 demonstrating its enough strong phonon mediated electron attraction at 1 k and inspiring the potential superconductors with different magic angles and the bigger electron densities in bigger moiré bands the optical properties of magic angle graphene were investigated via the tight binding dft approach by vela et al 2018 discovering 2 well defined absorption peaks in visible infrared range and making clear their wide applications in optical devices all in all it is extremely important to investigate the properties of magic angle graphene and very promising to develop its new applications in energy in this work we deeply investigated the ionic conductivity properties of magic angle graphene for the first time and constructed a new efficient device of magic angle graphene based protonic fuel cells for energy conversion and hydrogen energy storage as shown in fig 8 b compared with graphene the magic angle graphene exhibited the twist angle tuned ionic conductivity and could achieve faster proton transport as well known the as discovered fast proton conductor of magic angle graphene showed the excellent electrical conductivity and the super adaptability of surface functionalization demonstrating a promising electrode material for protonic fuel cells the electrode based upon magic angle graphene could reach the enhancement of conductive and catalytic triple phase boundaries tpbs for electrocatalytic reactions achieving higher output performance of protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells 3 4 water transport in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene proton transport in fuel cells is accompanied by water transport and it is essential to explore the migration of water in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene in actual liquid or gaseous water water molecules are arranged in a disorderly manner amorphous state so individual water molecules can exist at any angle to simplify the motion postures of water molecules we selected four basic water molecule modes h2o vertical h2o horizontal h2o rotation i and h2o rotation ⅱ as shown in fig s14 water molecule attitudes are relative to the xy plane of magic angle graphene to investigate the migration properties of water among magic angle graphene the 2 2 1 supercell continues to be built to prevent the effect of periodicity on water migration in θ 28 magic angle graphene water molecule can migrate between the layers of magic angle graphene along the path shown in fig 9 a the energy barriers in h2o vertical and h2o horizontal are 0 101 ev and 0 098 ev respectively both are basically the same as shown in fig 9 b in θ 38 magic angle graphene h2o vertical and h2o horizontal along the pathway in the interface and their energy barriers are 0 229 ev and 0 212 ev respectively as shown in fig 9 c and 9 d the migration barriers of h2o rotation i and h2o rotation ⅱ are shown in fig s15 and then we also research the adsorption behavior of water in the the θ 0 and θ 60 ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene s interface because of these two graphene configurations have high symmetry the top and hollow sites were tested for the θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene respectively the optimal adsorption sites of water in interface are shown in fig s16 and table s3 the hollow site was found to be the best adsorption position after calculation on this basis the the water transport path and migration energy barrier diagrams in the θ 0 and θ 60 magic angle graphene are shown in figs s17 and s18 the energy barriers of water in magic angle graphene with different angles are listed in table 4 it can be found that when a certain twist angle of the bilayer graphene exists the symmetry breaking of the intrinsic structure leads to a dramatical decrease in the migration barrier of water in the magic angle graphene being as low as 0 1 0 2 ev which indicate that water transport in ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene can be improved by tuning twist angles and besides we also explored the effect of interlayer spacing on water transport as shown in fig s19 4 conclusion in summary we investigated the ionic conductivity and water transport properties of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene by choosing proton and water as a proof of concept for the first time discovered the twist angle tuned proton conduction and water transport in magic angle graphene demonstrated the faster proton and water transport in magic angle graphene than that in graphene and constructed an efficient device of protonic ceramic membrane fuel cell based upon the new fast proton conducting materials of magic angle graphene magic angle graphene with different specific twist angles were selected out and stable as 2d materials the proton conduction in magic angle graphene could be easily tuned by the twist angle which was explained by the potential energy surface for proton transport in magic angle graphene the smaller the twist angle is the lower the protonic migration energy barrier is and the faster the proton transport in magic angle graphene is the protonic migration energy barrier in magic angle graphene is lower by about 50 than that in graphene indicating the faster proton transport in magic angle graphene additionally the water transport properties in magic angle graphene can be improved by tuning twist angles the electrode based upon the as discovered fast proton conducting material of magic angle graphene could reach the enhancement of conductive and catalytic triple phase boundaries tpbs for electrocatalytic reactions achieving higher output performance of protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells the results have suggested the potential of magic angle graphene as fast proton conducting and water transport materials for protonic ceramic membrane fuel cells the present work not only proves the promise of solid state ionics and water transport properties of magic angle graphene but also opens the specific applications of ceramic membrane based magic angle graphene in

15433,high methane and salt levels in groundwater have been the most widely cited unconventional oil and gas development uogd related water impairments the attribution of these contaminants to uogd is usually complex especially in regions with mixed land uses here we compiled a large hydrogeochemistry dataset containing 13 geochemical analytes for 17 794 groundwater samples from rural northern appalachia i e 19 counties located on the boundary between pennsylvania pa uogd is permitted and new york ny uogd is banned with this dataset we explored if statistical and geospatial tools can help shed light on the sources of inorganic solutes and methane in groundwater in regions with mixed land uses the traditional principal component analysis pca indicates salts in ny and pa groundwater are mainly from the appalachian basin brine abb in contrast the machine learning tool non negative matrix factorization nmf highlights that road salts in addition to abb account for 36 48 of total chloride in ny and pa groundwaters the pca fails to identify road salts as one water salt source likely due to its geochemical similarity with abb neither pca nor nmf detects a regional impact of uogd on groundwater quality our geospatial analyses further corroborate 1 road salting is the major salt source in groundwater and its impact is enhanced in proximity to highways 2 uogd related groundwater

org resource 0539c57b68ec4b1bbac6f8c89fca8da6 1 introduction the increase in natural gas supply within the united states u s since 2008 is mainly driven by advancements in horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing hvhf enabling widespread implementation of unconventional oil and gas development uogd useia 2022 hvhf is widely used during uogd to enhance the rock permeability via the injection of pressurized chemical fluids proppants and large volumes of water into low permeability rocks e g shale to produce economic quantities of gas clark et al 2022 usepa 2015 the marcellus shale located in the northeastern u s and covering five states including pennsylvania pa and new york ny is one of the most prolific shale gas plays in the u s the rapid boom in uogd within the marcellus shale has spurred public concern over its impact on groundwater quality methane migration wen et al 2018 woda et al 2018 and spills of drilling produced fluids i e water returned to the surface with crude oil and natural gas brantley et al 2014 patterson et al 2017 are the most widely reported uogd related water contamination incidents drilling and produced fluids from uogd usually contain health concerning chemical species such as high salt content e g sodium and chloride and heavy metals e g barium such water contaminations if occurring could pose a severe safety and health risk particularly in rural areas where domestic wells are the primary drinking water source for residents e g high salt contents in water can increase the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease in addition high levels of methane trapped in confined space can lead to explosion and asphyxiation hammond et al 2020 dissolved methane in the water can also mobilize other inorganic solutes that could pose a health risk e g sulfide and arsenic siegel et al 2015b soriano et al 2020 methane has been reported as one of the most common contaminants associated with uogd by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep unconventional oil and gas wells uog wells might act as conduits to facilitate the migration of natural gas stored in the targeted geologic formation or a penetrated shallow gas reservoir to shallow groundwater when the casing and or cementing of uog wells are faulty e g darrah et al 2014 however many studies have shown that elevated levels of naturally occurring methane in the marcellus are not uncommon siegel et al 2015a wen et al 2019 drilling and produced fluids used in uogd contain a high level of salt i e sodium and chloride and other toxic constituents the improper storage and disposal of these fluids can degrade water quality cantlay et al 2020a through either chemical spills e g patterson et al 2017 or subsurface migration e g soriano et al 2020 in regions where uogd overlaps with other land uses salt contents in groundwaters might also come from other non uogd related sources e g road salting septic effluents and the naturally migrated appalachian basin brine abb from deeper formations e g brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020a lautz et al 2014 warner et al 2012 which is often hard to distinguish from uogd sources to note surface runoff flushing the highway will carry the applied road salt and enter nearby shallow aquifers also domestic water wells jain 2018 pieper et al 2018 septic effluents can seep into the nearby shallow aquifers potentially contaminating groundwater while abb has been found to be able to migrate into the shallow aquifer via geologic faults and fractures e g warner et al 2012 the impact of abb and road salting on groundwater quality is relatively more regional compared to septic effluents the impact of which is usually limited to rural regions additionally abb naturally migrated into a shallow formation can mix with meteoric recharge water acting as a source of salt in groundwater although it presents much lower concentrations of salt related analytes compared to the pristine abb in addition as suggested by the literature shaheen et al 2022 rainwater contains low concentrations of chloride as infiltrating and percolating into the aquifer meteoric recharge water might mix with organic wastes that are relatively geochemically non distinct and near surface sourced recent studies have attempted to address the spatiotemporal extent of uogd impacts on groundwater quality within the marcellus shale footprint by using hydrogeochemical e g soriano et al 2020 warner et al 2012 statistical e g siegel et al 2015a and geospatial tools e g li et al 2017 2016 wen et al 2019b 2018 warner et al 2012 utilized geochemical analytes br cl na ba sr and li measured in shallow groundwater to explore the natural migration of deep brine unrelated to shale gas drilling geochemical tracers showed no significant uogd impact on groundwater salinity siegel et al 2015a analyzed a large groundwater quality dataset collected prior to shale gas drilling i e pre drill in the appalachian basin concluding there was little to no significant impact from uogd on regional groundwater quality wen et al 2018 used a geospatial analysis tool i e sliding window geospatial tool swgt first developed by li et al 2016 2017 to evaluate the geospatial correlations between methane concentrations in northeastern pa groundwater and the proximity to various features of interest this study revealed the regional control of geologic features e g anticlinal folding and faults on elevated dissolved methane in groundwater potentially uogd related methane contamination was observed in only a few localities based on compiled groundwater quality data in uogd regions wen et al 2019b 2021 developed empirical and machine learning based models to predict the incidents of methane migration near shale gas wells also revealing a limited number of methane migration incidents present in uogd regions both with and without legacy conventional oil and gas development cogd fewer comparative studies were conducted in regions that differ with respect to uogd but are otherwise hydrogeologically comparable e g similar topography and geology which may provide an ideal study area to quantitatively separate potential uogd impacts from other non uogd impacts one such region exists in northern appalachia where uogd is permitted in pa but is strictly banned in ny providing a valuable opportunity to assess the occurrence and origin of dissolved solutes i e methane and salt contents in regions with and without uogd other land uses such as highways and associated highway maintenance e g road salting are common in both states this enables us to test analysis tools to separate uogd derived contaminants from non uogd derived contaminants mcmahon et al 2019 previously studied groundwater samples from 50 domestic wells from the state boundary region between ny and pa identifying non uogd sources of dissolved methane in groundwater but analysis of larger datasets in such a region enables a more robust comparison of contamination frequencies across regions with and without uogd here we attempted to apply multiple statistical and geospatial analysis tools to delineate the anthropogenic and natural sources of methane and salts e g cl in groundwater using the ny pa state boundary as our study area fig 1 since dissolved methane in groundwater of the uogd region was widely studied we mainly focused on the delineation of salt sources in pa and ny groundwaters two end member mixing analysis methods principal component analysis pca and non negative matrix factorization nmf were applied to a compiled hydrogeochemistry dataset to delineate potential salt sources in ny and pa groundwaters additionally the swgt li et al 2017 2016 wen et al 2018 was also used to detect individual localities where solute concentrations in groundwater increased with proximity to unconventional gas wells and non uogd related features i e conventional oil gas wells faults stream flowline and highway we sought to address two questions 1 what is the spatial distribution and extent of uogd impact on dissolved methane and salt contents in groundwater and 2 how does the impact of uogd compare to that of other non uogd related land uses 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area located within the appalachian basin province extends across ten ny counties from west to east chautauqua cattaraugus allegany steuben chemung tioga broome delaware sullivan orange and nine pa counties from west to east erie warren mckean potter tioga bradford susquehanna wayne and pike fig 1 except for orange sullivan and chautauqua counties in ny and pike and erie counties in pa all counties are underlain by the marcellus shale the study area is primarily underlain by clastic unconsolidated sedimentary rocks and glacial material deposited in devonian ordovician and mississippian ages christian et al 2016 williams 2010 figs s1 and s2 the major thrust faults in the study area are predominantly located in bradford county pa a detailed description of geologic and hydrogeological setting of the study area is included in the supporting information 2 2 dataset collection groundwater quality measurements were obtained from four publicly accessible databases community science institute csi csi 2021 shale water interaction forensic tools swift christian et al 2016 lautz 2020 shale network database brantley 2015 and water quality portal wqp read et al 2017 to increase the number of groundwater sampling sites samples the compiled dataset included 17 794 groundwater samples reporting 13 chemical analytes potassium k iron fe methane ch4 bromide br calcium ca barium ba chloride cl ph specific conductance sc manganese mn sodium na strontium sr and sulfate so4 these analytes were chosen because they either were indicative of potential uogd impacts or had the largest number of measurements any censored values i e below the detection limit were replaced with the corresponding detection limit tables s1 and s2 the sampling date of these water samples ranges from 1927 to 2020 with 16 460 92 5 of all water samples samples collected post 1980 and 15 346 86 2 collected post 2004 the location and spud date of both unconventional and conventional oil and gas wells were downloaded from the padep padep 2021 and the new york department of environmental conservation nydec 2021 the near function in the arcgis pro version 2 8 3 was used to calculate the distance between geochemical analytes and the nearest features of interest i e highways and faults due to the high density of uogd within the past decade many oil and gas wells that did not exist at the moment of water sampling were subsequently drilled around nearby water samples these oil and gas wells should not be considered as hydrocarbon wells that might have contaminated the corresponding water sample to address this the distance between groundwater samples and oil and gas wells unconventional and conventional was calculated using r codes to exclude oil and gas wells drilled after the groundwater sample collection distance calculations using both arcgis pro and r refer to the planar distance between water chemistry measurements and the nearest features of interest the pa and ny bedrock geology was derived from the usgs usgs 2021 and new york state museum nysm 2022 2 3 endmember mixing analysis when applied to water quality data principal component analysis pca can extract the principal components pcs of the dataset where each component represents a linear combination of water quality parameters these components can be interpreted as distinct solute water sources based on domain knowledge the minimum number of pcs was determined by comparing the total variance explained by the selected pcs to a threshold of 90 the greater the explained variance the more information from the original dataset is retained in the selected pcs grunsky et al 2014 pearson correlations between water quality variables were evaluated to identify linearly correlated variables only intercorrelated analytes were considered in pca to derive solute water sources saporta and niang keita 2009 non negative matrix factorizations nmf is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that delineates the endmembers solute water sources mixing proportions in each groundwater sample by solving the equation v w x h where v is the groundwater sample matrix w is the endmember mixing proportions and h represents the endmember chemical composition unlike traditional inverse models nmf delineates the endmembers water types mixing proportions without prior knowledge or assumptions about the endmember compositions shaheen et al 2022 shaughnessy et al 2021 the performance of nmf in identifying salinity sources using a previously published synthetic dataset was tested lautz et al 2014 shaheen et al 2022 here nmf was applied to quantitatively assess mixing proportions of salt water sources e g brine and road salting discharge in ny and pa before performing nmf the molar ratios of na k ba ca and so4 to cl were calculated and normalized to the corresponding highest ratio the only hyperparameter of nmf was the number of endmembers which was assumed to be the minimum number of pcs of pca results using the same set of analytes as nmf for the pa and ny datasets the nmf was run using 10 000 iterations initiated with a different random state each time to avoid initialization bias only model outputs with mixing proportions of all endmembers summing up within 1 00 0 05 were kept retained models were ranked by error sum of squares and only the top 5 of the best fitting models were used to calculate the average chemical composition of endmembers and their contribution to each water sample 2 4 geospatial and statistical analysis in this study sliding window geospatial tool swgt first developed by li et al 2016 2017 was performed in python 3 9 9 to highlight hotspots with elevated cl na sc ba and ch4 in proximity to features of interest i e faults highways and unconventional and conventional oil and gas wells swgt results can indicate the contribution of natural processes and various human activities to salt and methane contents in groundwater these five analytes were selected as they were most representative of uogd related contamination with respect to methane migration and salt contamination incidents note water samples from the csi database were excluded in the swgt analysis due to the lack of precise locations a detailed description of the swgt can be found in the literature wen et al 2018 the swgt outputs a heatmap with the intensity of kendall rank correlations between analyte concentration and distance to the feature of interest color coded on the heatmap gray color denotes areas without sufficient data density for the swgt calculation while white areas represent regions where no statistically significant correlations are present red or blue color denotes areas where analyte concentration negatively or positively correlates with the proximity to features of interest although these three methods i e pca nmf and swgt can all shed light on the contribution of sources of dissolved solute in groundwater the type of application they are most suitable for varies both pca and nmf are commonly used to delineate the principal components of dissolved solute in groundwater while pca might fail to identify secondary components and nmf can be geared towards deriving information for the sources of a specific analyte e g chloride unlike nmf and pca swgt is a geospatial tool that incorporates geospatial context in the analysis which provides important implications for not only the solute sources but also the potential pathways of solute migrating from its source to the mixing water wilcoxon mann whitney wmw test was used in this study to compare the distribution of concentration of chemical analytes between two sample groups which can be treated as a test of median values of two sample groups wmw test is a non parametric test that requires no normal distribution of the tested population i e sample group because species concentrations in groundwater samples tend to be highly skewed the wmw test is thus well suited for statistical comparison across sample groups 3 results 3 1 overview of groundwater quality data and county categorization the compiled dataset in this study includes 17 794 groundwater samples with 13 geochemical analyses grouped into cations anions and others tables s1 and s2 a total of 16 175 and 1619 water samples are collected from pa and ny respectively analyte concentrations in most groundwater samples 80 of all samples fall below the respective usepa drinking water standard with the exception of fe and mn fig s3 which is consistent with previous literature e g siegel et al 2015b wen et al 2018 a detailed overview of the groundwater quality data is available in the supporting information to assess the regional impact of uogd and cogd on groundwater quality ny and pa counties with 999 1 999 or 0 conventional wells or 299 1 299 or 0 unconventional wells were labeled as counties with heavy moderate or non cogd uogd counties table s3 the selection of above threshold numbers of oil and gas wells was not fully arbitrary given that many more conventional oil and gas wells cog wells were drilled than unconventional oil and gas wells uog wells in addition an unconventional well may potentially yield a larger scale environmental impact than a cog well due to horizontal drilling and hvhf practices therefore a smaller threshold number of uog wells i e 299 was selected to define a heavy uogd county compared to heavy cogd counties wilcoxon mann whitney wmw tests showed no monotonic trend in ch4 na cl sc ba sr mn or k concentrations in groundwaters from heavy to moderate and non uogd counties table s4 suggesting that uogd might not be a source of these solutes particularly dissolved ch4 and salts in groundwater on a regional scale ch4 levels remained unchanged from heavy to moderate cogd counties and decreased from moderate to non cogd counties suggesting that cogd might be one of the sources of dissolved ch4 in pa ny groundwater although such an impact might not be significant on a regional scale table s4 na concentrations increased from heavy to moderate cogd counties table s4 however na concentrations remained the same between moderate and non cogd counties table s4 unlike na sc and cl concentrations decreased from heavy to moderate cogd counties and stayed constant from moderate to non cogd counties table s4 such inconsistent trends in salt related parameters suggest that the impact of cogd on groundwater salinity is not significant on a regional scale which is also consistent with the non monotonic trend in sr concentration from heavy to moderate and non cogd counties although so4 mn and fe levels decreased from heavy to moderate cogd counties only mn and fe further decreased from heavy to non cogd pointing to cogd as a presumable source of elevated regional levels of dissolved mn and fe table s4 ba concentrations decreased from heavy to moderate and non cogd counties suggesting a regional impact of cogd on ba concentration in groundwater such regional impact however might be explained by a few local cogd related water contamination events in heavy and moderate cogd counties as previously suggested by shaheen et al 2022 3 2 endmember mixing analysis a cross correlation was calculated for all 13 analytes of ny and pa samples to identify intercorrelated analytes fig 2 shows na cl br k sr sc and ch4 are intercorrelated for the ny samples while na cl ba sr and sc are intercorrelated for pa samples pca was applied to the ny and pa datasets separately considering only the above intercorrelated analytes a minimum number of one and two pcs were needed to account for at least 90 variance of the original data for the ny 92 8 and pa 91 8 datasets fig s4 for ny samples pc1 showed positive loadings on all solutes especially na cl sc and br fig s5 therefore pc1 was interpreted as the appalachian basin brine abb pc1 is unlikely to be road salting or septic effluent due to the positive loading in br since these two sources are not enriched in br as much as abb for pa samples pc1 was assumed to be abb as well as it exhibited a similar pattern to ny pc1 pa pc2 yielded negative loadings on cl na and sc while positive loadings on ba and sr fig s5 indicative of water solute originated from a mix of rainwater or shallow freshwater recharge negative loadings on cl na and sc and brine positive loadings on ba and sr our pca results showed that abb plays a dominant role in characterizing pa and ny groundwater chemistry with regards to the largely salinity related suite of analytes considered in our analysis especially for ny samples pca however failed to detect other secondary water solute sources for ny samples while abb derived water solute was not separated from that originated from non abb sources for pa samples therefore an alternative method was needed to quantitatively assess the contribution of analyte specific sources in groundwater to further investigate endmember analyte sources in groundwater including assessing potential uogd impacts on groundwater quality we further applied a machine learning based approach nmf to delineate salt sources in pa ny water salt related analytes e g cl in groundwater can serve as effective geochemical tracers to illustrate the sources of water and other dissolved solutes e g cantlay et al 2020a 2020b warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019 ba k ca so4 na and cl were selected for inclusion in the nmf analysis where cl was used as a proxy for salt inputs given its generally conservative behavior in the environment this combination of analytes retained the most groundwater samples while allowing as many analytes as possible to be included in the nmf analysis only water samples reporting measurements for all the selected analytes were included in the nmf analysis as a result 610 out of 1619 ny samples and 2653 out of 16 175 pa samples were retained ba cl k cl ca cl so4 cl and na cl molar ratios were calculated and normalized to the highest respective value before feeding into nmf pca analysis of these molar ratios indicated three endmembers were needed to explain at least 90 variance of the original data three nmf derived endmembers were interpreted as cl sources i e abb or brine road salts and shallow freshwater recharge based on their molar ratio characteristics 1 a higher ba cl ratio suggests a larger abb brine impact 2 elevated ca cl and so4 cl ratios can be interpreted as more contribution from the shallow freshwater recharge endmember since shallow freshwater recharge is typically less saline and more oxidizing and 3 an elevated na cl ratio compared to the other analyte ratio indicates a larger input from road salt table s5 road salts shallow freshwater recharge and abb were the dominant i e 50 cl source in 147 24 39 6 and 79 13 ny groundwater samples fig 3 cl content in 236 9 765 29 and 601 23 pa water samples was dominated by brine shallow freshwater recharge and road salt derived cl fig 3 it is important to note that abb might represent salt containing briny water either naturally migrated from deeper formations to the shallow aquifer or leaked briny wastewater produced during uogd cogd to try to separate these two sources we further applied the swgt to assess the geospatial relationship between salt contents i e na cl sc in groundwater and the proximity to conventional and unconventional oil gas wells highways and faults the swgt was also applied to ba and ch4 because 1 ba serves as an effective proxy for the environmental impact of oil and gas production in pa niu et al 2018 warner et al 2012 and 2 dissolved ch4 in pa groundwater has been widely studied e g wen et al 2018 which can be cross checked with our ch4 results to further determine the accuracy of the swgt results for other analytes i e na cl sc ba 3 3 sliding window geospatial technique swgt in a limited number of localities in uogd present counties cl sc and na levels in groundwater increased closer to the uog wells red zones in figs 4 s6 and s7 suggesting a localized impact of uogd on groundwater quality with respect to salt content in these areas in the heatmap of ba and ch4 levels a few red hotspots were also identified figs s8 and s9 hotspots for the above five analytes were not present across the entirety of northeastern pa indicating the uogd impact on groundwater quality is likely not significant on a regional scale particularly ch4 results generally agreed with the previous studies e g wen et al 2018 which used a slightly smaller groundwater quality dataset from bradford county pa suggesting that swgt was indeed effective in detecting localities with presumable uogd related water impairments in cogd counties swgt detected hotspots where cl na and sc concentrations increase closer to conventional oil and gas wells suggesting cogd impact in these subregions but not on a regional scale figs s10 s12 swgt heatmaps also showed a few subregions with increasing ch4 and ba concentrations near cog wells figs s13 and s14 the geospatial relationship between analyte concentrations and the proximity to geologic faults was also assessed by the swgt figs s15 s19 many fault related hotspots overlapped with cogd uogd related hotspots suggesting detected cogd uogd hotspots might be alternatively explained by the methane containing abb naturally migrated from the deep formation along the geologic faults this was also suggested by many previous studies e g li et al 2017 2016 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2018 compared to heatmaps for cogd uogd and faults many more hotspots were present in the heatmaps for highway and salt analytes figs 5 s20 and s21 indicating a more widespread and potentially regional impact of highway i e road salt containing discharge on pa ny groundwater quality 4 discussion 4 1 sources of dissolved methane in pa and ny groundwater samples our analysis of the distribution and sources of dissolved ch4 in pa ny groundwater provides insight into 1 uogd and cogd impacts on regional dissolved ch4 and 2 the effectiveness of the swgt method in ny with less dense groundwater samples the wmw test showed no simple monotonic trend in the dissolved ch4 in pa ny water from non to moderate and heavy uogd cogd counties suggesting insignificant regional impacts of cogd or uogd on dissolved ch4 swgt results further corroborated this conclusion revealing a limited number of isolated hotspots where ch4 levels increased nearby oil and gas wells in the study area mostly in bradford and susquehanna counties in pa figs s9 and s14 the hotspots in bradford were previously identified by wen et al 2018 and li et al 2016 we searched the padep violation database padep 2022 for unconventional oil and gas wells with citations categorized as 1 cementing casing well construction 2 pollution and 3 pit impoundment related violations these categories of violation were grouped and summarized by brantley et al 2014 and were deemed to be most likely associated with uogd related groundwater impairments in susquehanna county in pa around the ch4 uogd hotspots we found 17 violation records associated with 8 unique unconventional gas wells 11 cementing casing well construction violations associated with n 2 unique unconventional gas wells 1 pit impoundment issue n 1 and 5 pollution incidents n 5 tables s6 and s7 these eight problematic unconventional wells account for 0 41 8 1952 of all unconventional wells in susquehanna county such a small fraction of unconventional oil and gas wells being presumably problematic was consistent with the previous finding in the bradford county where 7 out of the 1385 shale gas wells were deemed problematic which combined suggested no regional uogd impact on dissolved ch4 in northeastern pa in the heatmap of ch4 highway a few hotspots were identified seemingly suggesting that highways i e road salt containing discharge might serve as one of the major sources of dissolved methane in pa ny groundwater fig s23 road salt containing discharge however is unlikely to be enriched in ch4 since highways are usually constructed in valleys typically along streams and rivers in ny and pa usdot 2013 ch4 highway hotspots might instead be explained by the proximity to valley bottoms in these red zones as such these hotspots are likely instead related to the widely observed trend of increased ch4 concentrations in topographic lows in northern pa southern ny e g kreuzer et al 2018 molofsky et al 2016 in addition the heatmaps for ch4 uogd cogd suggested that swgt were indeed effective in identifying localities of uogd cogd related water impairments in areas where a dense groundwater quality dataset is available e g bradford and susquehanna counties in pa for counties e g counties in western ny and pa where no dense groundwater quality dataset is accessible swgt fails to yield meaningful results 4 2 contribution of oil and gas production practices to salt contents in ny and pa groundwater swgt analysis detected small localized hotspots where salt species increased nearby uogd cogd to further test if these hotspots were indeed caused by the nearby uogd we performed thorough scrutiny of well inspection data from the padep in susquehanna county in pa around the hotspots in salt analytes uogd heatmaps we found 158 violation records associated with 39 unique unconventional gas wells 114 cementing casing well construction violations associated with n 16 unique unconventional gas wells 17 pit impoundment issues n 12 and 27 pollution incidents n 14 tables s6 and s7 with 3 wells reporting more than one type of violation in bradford county pa 98 unique unconventional wells reported 279 violation records 98 cementing casing well construction violations n 38 81 pit impoundment issues n 37 and 100 pollution incidents n 38 with 15 wells reporting more than one type of violation in tioga county pa many fewer violations were reported with 13 unique unconventional wells cited in 48 violation records 28 cementing casing well construction violations n 2 4 pit impoundment issues n 3 and 16 pollution incidents n 10 with 2 wells reporting more than one type of violation compared to ch4 results a lot more problematic unconventional wells as deemed by the padep were found in hotspots associated with salt related analytes cl na and sc this suggests that water impairments caused by uogd if occurring are more likely to be documented by the salt contents in groundwater than dissolved ch4 in groundwater although such uogd impact on the salt content in groundwater still does not appear significant on a regional scale based on swgt heatmaps only a limited number of conventional oil and gas wells have been ever drilled in northeastern pa i e tioga n 283 bradford n 66 and susquehanna n 9 as compared to the orders of magnitude more unconventional oil and gas wells being drilled in these counties a few cogd related hotspots were still detected suggesting that the small number of legacy conventional oil and gas wells could still serve as a potential source of salt on a local scale however these cogd uogd related hotspots for cl na and sc largely overlap with the hotspots associated with geologic faults therefore we cannot rule out natural abb migration along faults to shallow aquifer as an alternative explanation for the observed hotspots in cogd uogd heatmaps although cogd uogd was not detected as an individual salt source by the nmf the impact of uogd cogd might be incorporated into the abb derived cl according to nmf abb derived cl accounts for 25 30 of total cl in ny and pa groundwater at the regional scale abb derived salt might be derived from naturally migrated brine along geologic faults and or salt containing briny wastewater released by nearby cogd uogd correspondingly wmw results revealed groundwater samples with 50 cl originated from abb were statistically significantly closer to conventional and unconventional wells and geologic faults than water samples with 50 abb derived cl however swgt analysis indicates uogd and cogd impacts should be confined to only a limited number of localities resultantly cl content from the abb endmember likely represents cl sourced predominantly from naturally occurring brines with inputs from uogd cogd in isolated localities 4 3 widespread road salt contamination in ny and py groundwater we used cl concentration as a salt proxy to assess the contribution of various salt sources to ny pa groundwater as shown by the nmf results for ny samples an average of 30 of total cl originated from the abb while 22 and 48 of total cl were from shallow freshwater recharge and road salt respectively for pa samples shallow freshwater recharge 39 and road salts 36 combined accounted for the majority of total cl while abb contributed only 25 of total cl nmf results thus suggest road salt as the major anthropogenic source of cl in ny and pa groundwater between which ny samples contained more road salt derived cl than pa samples a longer length of highways and thus presumably highway density is present in ny counties compared to pa counties table s3 and thus more road salt has been likely applied on ny roads in addition ny counties located further north and closer to the great lakes receive greater snowfall in the wintertime which would also require more intensive road salt application surface runoff flushing the highway will carry the applied road salt and enter nearby shallow aquifers i e also domestic water wells jain 2018 pieper et al 2018 in addition wmw tests further indicated that pa and ny groundwater samples located within 1 km from highways generally had a higher cl na sc concentration than samples 1 km from highways supporting a widespread impact of road salt on pa ny groundwater such widespread impact was also evidenced by many more hotspots being detected in the swgt heatmaps for na cl and sc vs the proximity to highways as compared to cogd uogd faults heatmaps however the hotspots observed for ch4 and ba relative to the nearest highway suggest some increases in na and cl nearby highways may instead reflect abb upwelling nearby highways indeed highways are usually built along valleys where more abb tends to be present compared to ridge tops e g campbell et al 2022 siegel et al 2015b 5 conclusions in this study we compiled a large hydrogeochemistry dataset containing groundwater quality data collected from 19 counties on the boundary between pennsylvania pa uogd is permitted and new york ny uogd is banned to examine the impact of unconventional oil and gas development uogd and other anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality with a particular emphasis on salts i e cl na and specific conductance and methane the wilcoxon mann whitney test revealed no monotonic trend in methane and salt contents from heavy moderate to non uogd cogd counties indicating no significant regional impact of uogd cogd on pa and ny groundwater quality using non negative matrix factorization nmf the contributions of three major salt sources appalachian basin brine or abb shallow recharge water and road salt to pa and ny groundwater were separated and investigated road salt applied onto highways during wintertime accounted for 36 48 of dissolved salt in pa ny groundwater indicating road salt as the dominant anthropogenic source of salt on a regional scale such a significant regional impact from road salts rather than uogd was further corroborated by the geospatial analysis which detected only a limited number of isolated localities showing uogd impacts on groundwater quality with respect to salt and methane contents but identified widespread areas where groundwater salinity increased with the proximity to highways ny groundwater contained more road salt derived salt than pa samples also consistent with a longer length of highways and a stronger lake effect more snow in the wintertime in ny counties than in pa

15433,high methane and salt levels in groundwater have been the most widely cited unconventional oil and gas development uogd related water impairments the attribution of these contaminants to uogd is usually complex especially in regions with mixed land uses here we compiled a large hydrogeochemistry dataset containing 13 geochemical analytes for 17 794 groundwater samples from rural northern appalachia i e 19 counties located on the boundary between pennsylvania pa uogd is permitted and new york ny uogd is banned with this dataset we explored if statistical and geospatial tools can help shed light on the sources of inorganic solutes and methane in groundwater in regions with mixed land uses the traditional principal component analysis pca indicates salts in ny and pa groundwater are mainly from the appalachian basin brine abb in contrast the machine learning tool non negative matrix factorization nmf highlights that road salts in addition to abb account for 36 48 of total chloride in ny and pa groundwaters the pca fails to identify road salts as one water salt source likely due to its geochemical similarity with abb neither pca nor nmf detects a regional impact of uogd on groundwater quality our geospatial analyses further corroborate 1 road salting is the major salt source in groundwater and its impact is enhanced in proximity to highways 2 uogd related groundwater

org resource 0539c57b68ec4b1bbac6f8c89fca8da6 1 introduction the increase in natural gas supply within the united states u s since 2008 is mainly driven by advancements in horizontal drilling and high volume hydraulic fracturing hvhf enabling widespread implementation of unconventional oil and gas development uogd useia 2022 hvhf is widely used during uogd to enhance the rock permeability via the injection of pressurized chemical fluids proppants and large volumes of water into low permeability rocks e g shale to produce economic quantities of gas clark et al 2022 usepa 2015 the marcellus shale located in the northeastern u s and covering five states including pennsylvania pa and new york ny is one of the most prolific shale gas plays in the u s the rapid boom in uogd within the marcellus shale has spurred public concern over its impact on groundwater quality methane migration wen et al 2018 woda et al 2018 and spills of drilling produced fluids i e water returned to the surface with crude oil and natural gas brantley et al 2014 patterson et al 2017 are the most widely reported uogd related water contamination incidents drilling and produced fluids from uogd usually contain health concerning chemical species such as high salt content e g sodium and chloride and heavy metals e g barium such water contaminations if occurring could pose a severe safety and health risk particularly in rural areas where domestic wells are the primary drinking water source for residents e g high salt contents in water can increase the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease in addition high levels of methane trapped in confined space can lead to explosion and asphyxiation hammond et al 2020 dissolved methane in the water can also mobilize other inorganic solutes that could pose a health risk e g sulfide and arsenic siegel et al 2015b soriano et al 2020 methane has been reported as one of the most common contaminants associated with uogd by the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep unconventional oil and gas wells uog wells might act as conduits to facilitate the migration of natural gas stored in the targeted geologic formation or a penetrated shallow gas reservoir to shallow groundwater when the casing and or cementing of uog wells are faulty e g darrah et al 2014 however many studies have shown that elevated levels of naturally occurring methane in the marcellus are not uncommon siegel et al 2015a wen et al 2019 drilling and produced fluids used in uogd contain a high level of salt i e sodium and chloride and other toxic constituents the improper storage and disposal of these fluids can degrade water quality cantlay et al 2020a through either chemical spills e g patterson et al 2017 or subsurface migration e g soriano et al 2020 in regions where uogd overlaps with other land uses salt contents in groundwaters might also come from other non uogd related sources e g road salting septic effluents and the naturally migrated appalachian basin brine abb from deeper formations e g brantley et al 2014 cantlay et al 2020a lautz et al 2014 warner et al 2012 which is often hard to distinguish from uogd sources to note surface runoff flushing the highway will carry the applied road salt and enter nearby shallow aquifers also domestic water wells jain 2018 pieper et al 2018 septic effluents can seep into the nearby shallow aquifers potentially contaminating groundwater while abb has been found to be able to migrate into the shallow aquifer via geologic faults and fractures e g warner et al 2012 the impact of abb and road salting on groundwater quality is relatively more regional compared to septic effluents the impact of which is usually limited to rural regions additionally abb naturally migrated into a shallow formation can mix with meteoric recharge water acting as a source of salt in groundwater although it presents much lower concentrations of salt related analytes compared to the pristine abb in addition as suggested by the literature shaheen et al 2022 rainwater contains low concentrations of chloride as infiltrating and percolating into the aquifer meteoric recharge water might mix with organic wastes that are relatively geochemically non distinct and near surface sourced recent studies have attempted to address the spatiotemporal extent of uogd impacts on groundwater quality within the marcellus shale footprint by using hydrogeochemical e g soriano et al 2020 warner et al 2012 statistical e g siegel et al 2015a and geospatial tools e g li et al 2017 2016 wen et al 2019b 2018 warner et al 2012 utilized geochemical analytes br cl na ba sr and li measured in shallow groundwater to explore the natural migration of deep brine unrelated to shale gas drilling geochemical tracers showed no significant uogd impact on groundwater salinity siegel et al 2015a analyzed a large groundwater quality dataset collected prior to shale gas drilling i e pre drill in the appalachian basin concluding there was little to no significant impact from uogd on regional groundwater quality wen et al 2018 used a geospatial analysis tool i e sliding window geospatial tool swgt first developed by li et al 2016 2017 to evaluate the geospatial correlations between methane concentrations in northeastern pa groundwater and the proximity to various features of interest this study revealed the regional control of geologic features e g anticlinal folding and faults on elevated dissolved methane in groundwater potentially uogd related methane contamination was observed in only a few localities based on compiled groundwater quality data in uogd regions wen et al 2019b 2021 developed empirical and machine learning based models to predict the incidents of methane migration near shale gas wells also revealing a limited number of methane migration incidents present in uogd regions both with and without legacy conventional oil and gas development cogd fewer comparative studies were conducted in regions that differ with respect to uogd but are otherwise hydrogeologically comparable e g similar topography and geology which may provide an ideal study area to quantitatively separate potential uogd impacts from other non uogd impacts one such region exists in northern appalachia where uogd is permitted in pa but is strictly banned in ny providing a valuable opportunity to assess the occurrence and origin of dissolved solutes i e methane and salt contents in regions with and without uogd other land uses such as highways and associated highway maintenance e g road salting are common in both states this enables us to test analysis tools to separate uogd derived contaminants from non uogd derived contaminants mcmahon et al 2019 previously studied groundwater samples from 50 domestic wells from the state boundary region between ny and pa identifying non uogd sources of dissolved methane in groundwater but analysis of larger datasets in such a region enables a more robust comparison of contamination frequencies across regions with and without uogd here we attempted to apply multiple statistical and geospatial analysis tools to delineate the anthropogenic and natural sources of methane and salts e g cl in groundwater using the ny pa state boundary as our study area fig 1 since dissolved methane in groundwater of the uogd region was widely studied we mainly focused on the delineation of salt sources in pa and ny groundwaters two end member mixing analysis methods principal component analysis pca and non negative matrix factorization nmf were applied to a compiled hydrogeochemistry dataset to delineate potential salt sources in ny and pa groundwaters additionally the swgt li et al 2017 2016 wen et al 2018 was also used to detect individual localities where solute concentrations in groundwater increased with proximity to unconventional gas wells and non uogd related features i e conventional oil gas wells faults stream flowline and highway we sought to address two questions 1 what is the spatial distribution and extent of uogd impact on dissolved methane and salt contents in groundwater and 2 how does the impact of uogd compare to that of other non uogd related land uses 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area the study area located within the appalachian basin province extends across ten ny counties from west to east chautauqua cattaraugus allegany steuben chemung tioga broome delaware sullivan orange and nine pa counties from west to east erie warren mckean potter tioga bradford susquehanna wayne and pike fig 1 except for orange sullivan and chautauqua counties in ny and pike and erie counties in pa all counties are underlain by the marcellus shale the study area is primarily underlain by clastic unconsolidated sedimentary rocks and glacial material deposited in devonian ordovician and mississippian ages christian et al 2016 williams 2010 figs s1 and s2 the major thrust faults in the study area are predominantly located in bradford county pa a detailed description of geologic and hydrogeological setting of the study area is included in the supporting information 2 2 dataset collection groundwater quality measurements were obtained from four publicly accessible databases community science institute csi csi 2021 shale water interaction forensic tools swift christian et al 2016 lautz 2020 shale network database brantley 2015 and water quality portal wqp read et al 2017 to increase the number of groundwater sampling sites samples the compiled dataset included 17 794 groundwater samples reporting 13 chemical analytes potassium k iron fe methane ch4 bromide br calcium ca barium ba chloride cl ph specific conductance sc manganese mn sodium na strontium sr and sulfate so4 these analytes were chosen because they either were indicative of potential uogd impacts or had the largest number of measurements any censored values i e below the detection limit were replaced with the corresponding detection limit tables s1 and s2 the sampling date of these water samples ranges from 1927 to 2020 with 16 460 92 5 of all water samples samples collected post 1980 and 15 346 86 2 collected post 2004 the location and spud date of both unconventional and conventional oil and gas wells were downloaded from the padep padep 2021 and the new york department of environmental conservation nydec 2021 the near function in the arcgis pro version 2 8 3 was used to calculate the distance between geochemical analytes and the nearest features of interest i e highways and faults due to the high density of uogd within the past decade many oil and gas wells that did not exist at the moment of water sampling were subsequently drilled around nearby water samples these oil and gas wells should not be considered as hydrocarbon wells that might have contaminated the corresponding water sample to address this the distance between groundwater samples and oil and gas wells unconventional and conventional was calculated using r codes to exclude oil and gas wells drilled after the groundwater sample collection distance calculations using both arcgis pro and r refer to the planar distance between water chemistry measurements and the nearest features of interest the pa and ny bedrock geology was derived from the usgs usgs 2021 and new york state museum nysm 2022 2 3 endmember mixing analysis when applied to water quality data principal component analysis pca can extract the principal components pcs of the dataset where each component represents a linear combination of water quality parameters these components can be interpreted as distinct solute water sources based on domain knowledge the minimum number of pcs was determined by comparing the total variance explained by the selected pcs to a threshold of 90 the greater the explained variance the more information from the original dataset is retained in the selected pcs grunsky et al 2014 pearson correlations between water quality variables were evaluated to identify linearly correlated variables only intercorrelated analytes were considered in pca to derive solute water sources saporta and niang keita 2009 non negative matrix factorizations nmf is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that delineates the endmembers solute water sources mixing proportions in each groundwater sample by solving the equation v w x h where v is the groundwater sample matrix w is the endmember mixing proportions and h represents the endmember chemical composition unlike traditional inverse models nmf delineates the endmembers water types mixing proportions without prior knowledge or assumptions about the endmember compositions shaheen et al 2022 shaughnessy et al 2021 the performance of nmf in identifying salinity sources using a previously published synthetic dataset was tested lautz et al 2014 shaheen et al 2022 here nmf was applied to quantitatively assess mixing proportions of salt water sources e g brine and road salting discharge in ny and pa before performing nmf the molar ratios of na k ba ca and so4 to cl were calculated and normalized to the corresponding highest ratio the only hyperparameter of nmf was the number of endmembers which was assumed to be the minimum number of pcs of pca results using the same set of analytes as nmf for the pa and ny datasets the nmf was run using 10 000 iterations initiated with a different random state each time to avoid initialization bias only model outputs with mixing proportions of all endmembers summing up within 1 00 0 05 were kept retained models were ranked by error sum of squares and only the top 5 of the best fitting models were used to calculate the average chemical composition of endmembers and their contribution to each water sample 2 4 geospatial and statistical analysis in this study sliding window geospatial tool swgt first developed by li et al 2016 2017 was performed in python 3 9 9 to highlight hotspots with elevated cl na sc ba and ch4 in proximity to features of interest i e faults highways and unconventional and conventional oil and gas wells swgt results can indicate the contribution of natural processes and various human activities to salt and methane contents in groundwater these five analytes were selected as they were most representative of uogd related contamination with respect to methane migration and salt contamination incidents note water samples from the csi database were excluded in the swgt analysis due to the lack of precise locations a detailed description of the swgt can be found in the literature wen et al 2018 the swgt outputs a heatmap with the intensity of kendall rank correlations between analyte concentration and distance to the feature of interest color coded on the heatmap gray color denotes areas without sufficient data density for the swgt calculation while white areas represent regions where no statistically significant correlations are present red or blue color denotes areas where analyte concentration negatively or positively correlates with the proximity to features of interest although these three methods i e pca nmf and swgt can all shed light on the contribution of sources of dissolved solute in groundwater the type of application they are most suitable for varies both pca and nmf are commonly used to delineate the principal components of dissolved solute in groundwater while pca might fail to identify secondary components and nmf can be geared towards deriving information for the sources of a specific analyte e g chloride unlike nmf and pca swgt is a geospatial tool that incorporates geospatial context in the analysis which provides important implications for not only the solute sources but also the potential pathways of solute migrating from its source to the mixing water wilcoxon mann whitney wmw test was used in this study to compare the distribution of concentration of chemical analytes between two sample groups which can be treated as a test of median values of two sample groups wmw test is a non parametric test that requires no normal distribution of the tested population i e sample group because species concentrations in groundwater samples tend to be highly skewed the wmw test is thus well suited for statistical comparison across sample groups 3 results 3 1 overview of groundwater quality data and county categorization the compiled dataset in this study includes 17 794 groundwater samples with 13 geochemical analyses grouped into cations anions and others tables s1 and s2 a total of 16 175 and 1619 water samples are collected from pa and ny respectively analyte concentrations in most groundwater samples 80 of all samples fall below the respective usepa drinking water standard with the exception of fe and mn fig s3 which is consistent with previous literature e g siegel et al 2015b wen et al 2018 a detailed overview of the groundwater quality data is available in the supporting information to assess the regional impact of uogd and cogd on groundwater quality ny and pa counties with 999 1 999 or 0 conventional wells or 299 1 299 or 0 unconventional wells were labeled as counties with heavy moderate or non cogd uogd counties table s3 the selection of above threshold numbers of oil and gas wells was not fully arbitrary given that many more conventional oil and gas wells cog wells were drilled than unconventional oil and gas wells uog wells in addition an unconventional well may potentially yield a larger scale environmental impact than a cog well due to horizontal drilling and hvhf practices therefore a smaller threshold number of uog wells i e 299 was selected to define a heavy uogd county compared to heavy cogd counties wilcoxon mann whitney wmw tests showed no monotonic trend in ch4 na cl sc ba sr mn or k concentrations in groundwaters from heavy to moderate and non uogd counties table s4 suggesting that uogd might not be a source of these solutes particularly dissolved ch4 and salts in groundwater on a regional scale ch4 levels remained unchanged from heavy to moderate cogd counties and decreased from moderate to non cogd counties suggesting that cogd might be one of the sources of dissolved ch4 in pa ny groundwater although such an impact might not be significant on a regional scale table s4 na concentrations increased from heavy to moderate cogd counties table s4 however na concentrations remained the same between moderate and non cogd counties table s4 unlike na sc and cl concentrations decreased from heavy to moderate cogd counties and stayed constant from moderate to non cogd counties table s4 such inconsistent trends in salt related parameters suggest that the impact of cogd on groundwater salinity is not significant on a regional scale which is also consistent with the non monotonic trend in sr concentration from heavy to moderate and non cogd counties although so4 mn and fe levels decreased from heavy to moderate cogd counties only mn and fe further decreased from heavy to non cogd pointing to cogd as a presumable source of elevated regional levels of dissolved mn and fe table s4 ba concentrations decreased from heavy to moderate and non cogd counties suggesting a regional impact of cogd on ba concentration in groundwater such regional impact however might be explained by a few local cogd related water contamination events in heavy and moderate cogd counties as previously suggested by shaheen et al 2022 3 2 endmember mixing analysis a cross correlation was calculated for all 13 analytes of ny and pa samples to identify intercorrelated analytes fig 2 shows na cl br k sr sc and ch4 are intercorrelated for the ny samples while na cl ba sr and sc are intercorrelated for pa samples pca was applied to the ny and pa datasets separately considering only the above intercorrelated analytes a minimum number of one and two pcs were needed to account for at least 90 variance of the original data for the ny 92 8 and pa 91 8 datasets fig s4 for ny samples pc1 showed positive loadings on all solutes especially na cl sc and br fig s5 therefore pc1 was interpreted as the appalachian basin brine abb pc1 is unlikely to be road salting or septic effluent due to the positive loading in br since these two sources are not enriched in br as much as abb for pa samples pc1 was assumed to be abb as well as it exhibited a similar pattern to ny pc1 pa pc2 yielded negative loadings on cl na and sc while positive loadings on ba and sr fig s5 indicative of water solute originated from a mix of rainwater or shallow freshwater recharge negative loadings on cl na and sc and brine positive loadings on ba and sr our pca results showed that abb plays a dominant role in characterizing pa and ny groundwater chemistry with regards to the largely salinity related suite of analytes considered in our analysis especially for ny samples pca however failed to detect other secondary water solute sources for ny samples while abb derived water solute was not separated from that originated from non abb sources for pa samples therefore an alternative method was needed to quantitatively assess the contribution of analyte specific sources in groundwater to further investigate endmember analyte sources in groundwater including assessing potential uogd impacts on groundwater quality we further applied a machine learning based approach nmf to delineate salt sources in pa ny water salt related analytes e g cl in groundwater can serve as effective geochemical tracers to illustrate the sources of water and other dissolved solutes e g cantlay et al 2020a 2020b warner et al 2012 wen et al 2019 ba k ca so4 na and cl were selected for inclusion in the nmf analysis where cl was used as a proxy for salt inputs given its generally conservative behavior in the environment this combination of analytes retained the most groundwater samples while allowing as many analytes as possible to be included in the nmf analysis only water samples reporting measurements for all the selected analytes were included in the nmf analysis as a result 610 out of 1619 ny samples and 2653 out of 16 175 pa samples were retained ba cl k cl ca cl so4 cl and na cl molar ratios were calculated and normalized to the highest respective value before feeding into nmf pca analysis of these molar ratios indicated three endmembers were needed to explain at least 90 variance of the original data three nmf derived endmembers were interpreted as cl sources i e abb or brine road salts and shallow freshwater recharge based on their molar ratio characteristics 1 a higher ba cl ratio suggests a larger abb brine impact 2 elevated ca cl and so4 cl ratios can be interpreted as more contribution from the shallow freshwater recharge endmember since shallow freshwater recharge is typically less saline and more oxidizing and 3 an elevated na cl ratio compared to the other analyte ratio indicates a larger input from road salt table s5 road salts shallow freshwater recharge and abb were the dominant i e 50 cl source in 147 24 39 6 and 79 13 ny groundwater samples fig 3 cl content in 236 9 765 29 and 601 23 pa water samples was dominated by brine shallow freshwater recharge and road salt derived cl fig 3 it is important to note that abb might represent salt containing briny water either naturally migrated from deeper formations to the shallow aquifer or leaked briny wastewater produced during uogd cogd to try to separate these two sources we further applied the swgt to assess the geospatial relationship between salt contents i e na cl sc in groundwater and the proximity to conventional and unconventional oil gas wells highways and faults the swgt was also applied to ba and ch4 because 1 ba serves as an effective proxy for the environmental impact of oil and gas production in pa niu et al 2018 warner et al 2012 and 2 dissolved ch4 in pa groundwater has been widely studied e g wen et al 2018 which can be cross checked with our ch4 results to further determine the accuracy of the swgt results for other analytes i e na cl sc ba 3 3 sliding window geospatial technique swgt in a limited number of localities in uogd present counties cl sc and na levels in groundwater increased closer to the uog wells red zones in figs 4 s6 and s7 suggesting a localized impact of uogd on groundwater quality with respect to salt content in these areas in the heatmap of ba and ch4 levels a few red hotspots were also identified figs s8 and s9 hotspots for the above five analytes were not present across the entirety of northeastern pa indicating the uogd impact on groundwater quality is likely not significant on a regional scale particularly ch4 results generally agreed with the previous studies e g wen et al 2018 which used a slightly smaller groundwater quality dataset from bradford county pa suggesting that swgt was indeed effective in detecting localities with presumable uogd related water impairments in cogd counties swgt detected hotspots where cl na and sc concentrations increase closer to conventional oil and gas wells suggesting cogd impact in these subregions but not on a regional scale figs s10 s12 swgt heatmaps also showed a few subregions with increasing ch4 and ba concentrations near cog wells figs s13 and s14 the geospatial relationship between analyte concentrations and the proximity to geologic faults was also assessed by the swgt figs s15 s19 many fault related hotspots overlapped with cogd uogd related hotspots suggesting detected cogd uogd hotspots might be alternatively explained by the methane containing abb naturally migrated from the deep formation along the geologic faults this was also suggested by many previous studies e g li et al 2017 2016 warner et al 2012 wen et al 2018 compared to heatmaps for cogd uogd and faults many more hotspots were present in the heatmaps for highway and salt analytes figs 5 s20 and s21 indicating a more widespread and potentially regional impact of highway i e road salt containing discharge on pa ny groundwater quality 4 discussion 4 1 sources of dissolved methane in pa and ny groundwater samples our analysis of the distribution and sources of dissolved ch4 in pa ny groundwater provides insight into 1 uogd and cogd impacts on regional dissolved ch4 and 2 the effectiveness of the swgt method in ny with less dense groundwater samples the wmw test showed no simple monotonic trend in the dissolved ch4 in pa ny water from non to moderate and heavy uogd cogd counties suggesting insignificant regional impacts of cogd or uogd on dissolved ch4 swgt results further corroborated this conclusion revealing a limited number of isolated hotspots where ch4 levels increased nearby oil and gas wells in the study area mostly in bradford and susquehanna counties in pa figs s9 and s14 the hotspots in bradford were previously identified by wen et al 2018 and li et al 2016 we searched the padep violation database padep 2022 for unconventional oil and gas wells with citations categorized as 1 cementing casing well construction 2 pollution and 3 pit impoundment related violations these categories of violation were grouped and summarized by brantley et al 2014 and were deemed to be most likely associated with uogd related groundwater impairments in susquehanna county in pa around the ch4 uogd hotspots we found 17 violation records associated with 8 unique unconventional gas wells 11 cementing casing well construction violations associated with n 2 unique unconventional gas wells 1 pit impoundment issue n 1 and 5 pollution incidents n 5 tables s6 and s7 these eight problematic unconventional wells account for 0 41 8 1952 of all unconventional wells in susquehanna county such a small fraction of unconventional oil and gas wells being presumably problematic was consistent with the previous finding in the bradford county where 7 out of the 1385 shale gas wells were deemed problematic which combined suggested no regional uogd impact on dissolved ch4 in northeastern pa in the heatmap of ch4 highway a few hotspots were identified seemingly suggesting that highways i e road salt containing discharge might serve as one of the major sources of dissolved methane in pa ny groundwater fig s23 road salt containing discharge however is unlikely to be enriched in ch4 since highways are usually constructed in valleys typically along streams and rivers in ny and pa usdot 2013 ch4 highway hotspots might instead be explained by the proximity to valley bottoms in these red zones as such these hotspots are likely instead related to the widely observed trend of increased ch4 concentrations in topographic lows in northern pa southern ny e g kreuzer et al 2018 molofsky et al 2016 in addition the heatmaps for ch4 uogd cogd suggested that swgt were indeed effective in identifying localities of uogd cogd related water impairments in areas where a dense groundwater quality dataset is available e g bradford and susquehanna counties in pa for counties e g counties in western ny and pa where no dense groundwater quality dataset is accessible swgt fails to yield meaningful results 4 2 contribution of oil and gas production practices to salt contents in ny and pa groundwater swgt analysis detected small localized hotspots where salt species increased nearby uogd cogd to further test if these hotspots were indeed caused by the nearby uogd we performed thorough scrutiny of well inspection data from the padep in susquehanna county in pa around the hotspots in salt analytes uogd heatmaps we found 158 violation records associated with 39 unique unconventional gas wells 114 cementing casing well construction violations associated with n 16 unique unconventional gas wells 17 pit impoundment issues n 12 and 27 pollution incidents n 14 tables s6 and s7 with 3 wells reporting more than one type of violation in bradford county pa 98 unique unconventional wells reported 279 violation records 98 cementing casing well construction violations n 38 81 pit impoundment issues n 37 and 100 pollution incidents n 38 with 15 wells reporting more than one type of violation in tioga county pa many fewer violations were reported with 13 unique unconventional wells cited in 48 violation records 28 cementing casing well construction violations n 2 4 pit impoundment issues n 3 and 16 pollution incidents n 10 with 2 wells reporting more than one type of violation compared to ch4 results a lot more problematic unconventional wells as deemed by the padep were found in hotspots associated with salt related analytes cl na and sc this suggests that water impairments caused by uogd if occurring are more likely to be documented by the salt contents in groundwater than dissolved ch4 in groundwater although such uogd impact on the salt content in groundwater still does not appear significant on a regional scale based on swgt heatmaps only a limited number of conventional oil and gas wells have been ever drilled in northeastern pa i e tioga n 283 bradford n 66 and susquehanna n 9 as compared to the orders of magnitude more unconventional oil and gas wells being drilled in these counties a few cogd related hotspots were still detected suggesting that the small number of legacy conventional oil and gas wells could still serve as a potential source of salt on a local scale however these cogd uogd related hotspots for cl na and sc largely overlap with the hotspots associated with geologic faults therefore we cannot rule out natural abb migration along faults to shallow aquifer as an alternative explanation for the observed hotspots in cogd uogd heatmaps although cogd uogd was not detected as an individual salt source by the nmf the impact of uogd cogd might be incorporated into the abb derived cl according to nmf abb derived cl accounts for 25 30 of total cl in ny and pa groundwater at the regional scale abb derived salt might be derived from naturally migrated brine along geologic faults and or salt containing briny wastewater released by nearby cogd uogd correspondingly wmw results revealed groundwater samples with 50 cl originated from abb were statistically significantly closer to conventional and unconventional wells and geologic faults than water samples with 50 abb derived cl however swgt analysis indicates uogd and cogd impacts should be confined to only a limited number of localities resultantly cl content from the abb endmember likely represents cl sourced predominantly from naturally occurring brines with inputs from uogd cogd in isolated localities 4 3 widespread road salt contamination in ny and py groundwater we used cl concentration as a salt proxy to assess the contribution of various salt sources to ny pa groundwater as shown by the nmf results for ny samples an average of 30 of total cl originated from the abb while 22 and 48 of total cl were from shallow freshwater recharge and road salt respectively for pa samples shallow freshwater recharge 39 and road salts 36 combined accounted for the majority of total cl while abb contributed only 25 of total cl nmf results thus suggest road salt as the major anthropogenic source of cl in ny and pa groundwater between which ny samples contained more road salt derived cl than pa samples a longer length of highways and thus presumably highway density is present in ny counties compared to pa counties table s3 and thus more road salt has been likely applied on ny roads in addition ny counties located further north and closer to the great lakes receive greater snowfall in the wintertime which would also require more intensive road salt application surface runoff flushing the highway will carry the applied road salt and enter nearby shallow aquifers i e also domestic water wells jain 2018 pieper et al 2018 in addition wmw tests further indicated that pa and ny groundwater samples located within 1 km from highways generally had a higher cl na sc concentration than samples 1 km from highways supporting a widespread impact of road salt on pa ny groundwater such widespread impact was also evidenced by many more hotspots being detected in the swgt heatmaps for na cl and sc vs the proximity to highways as compared to cogd uogd faults heatmaps however the hotspots observed for ch4 and ba relative to the nearest highway suggest some increases in na and cl nearby highways may instead reflect abb upwelling nearby highways indeed highways are usually built along valleys where more abb tends to be present compared to ridge tops e g campbell et al 2022 siegel et al 2015b 5 conclusions in this study we compiled a large hydrogeochemistry dataset containing groundwater quality data collected from 19 counties on the boundary between pennsylvania pa uogd is permitted and new york ny uogd is banned to examine the impact of unconventional oil and gas development uogd and other anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality with a particular emphasis on salts i e cl na and specific conductance and methane the wilcoxon mann whitney test revealed no monotonic trend in methane and salt contents from heavy moderate to non uogd cogd counties indicating no significant regional impact of uogd cogd on pa and ny groundwater quality using non negative matrix factorization nmf the contributions of three major salt sources appalachian basin brine or abb shallow recharge water and road salt to pa and ny groundwater were separated and investigated road salt applied onto highways during wintertime accounted for 36 48 of dissolved salt in pa ny groundwater indicating road salt as the dominant anthropogenic source of salt on a regional scale such a significant regional impact from road salts rather than uogd was further corroborated by the geospatial analysis which detected only a limited number of isolated localities showing uogd impacts on groundwater quality with respect to salt and methane contents but identified widespread areas where groundwater salinity increased with the proximity to highways ny groundwater contained more road salt derived salt than pa samples also consistent with a longer length of highways and a stronger lake effect more snow in the wintertime in ny counties than in pa

15434,identifying and understanding the potential sources delivering microplastics into the urban water environment is imperative for microplastic pollution control however how atmospheric deposition contributes to microplastic pollution in the urban water environment is unclear therefore this study investigated the contribution of atmospheric deposition to microplastic pollution in urban waters based on the analysis of the atmospheric deposition characteristics in the urban area the results showed that microplastic deposition fluxes during wet weather and dry weather varied from 1 1 103 0 06 103 to 3 5 103 0 3 103 particles m2 day and 0 91 103 0 09 103 to 1 6 103 0 1 103 particles m2 day respectively the microplastics deposition flux showed moderate to strong correlations to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations especially the pm2 5 concentration r2 0 76 0 93 suggesting the regularly monitored pm2 5 concentration might be served as an indicator for microplastics deposition flux estimation the deposited microplastics were mainly transparent fragments with an average size of 51 67 μm polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant plastic polymer followed by polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide the comparison of microplastics collected during different weather conditions suggested that rain events could increase microplastics deposition fluxes when air quality conditions are similar particularly rains promoted the deposition of fibrous microplastics as well as smaller microplastics the estimated daily microplastics deposition in the whole city region suggested more microplastics were deposited in summer and winter the total quantity of microplastics deposited in the urban environment could reach 1 7 12 times of those discharged from treated wastewater among them 10 would directly deposit to urban waters in the studied city region while the others may also enter the urban waters through runoff the results of this study highlighted that the atmospheric microplastics deposition is an important source for microplastics especially smaller ones to enter the urban waters which could not be ignored during microplastics pollution control

were defined as plastic particles with sizes smaller than 5 mm which can be originated from the decomposition of large plastic products or be directly produced by manufacturers thompson 2015 as an emerging contaminant the occurrences and behaviors of microplastics in different environmental sectors are attracting increasing attention urban waters refers to freshwater systems such as river water and lake water are important carriers of microplastics where microplastics from different sources are gathered and transported with water flows finally reaching and accumulating in marine systems li et al 2018 however the occurrences of microplastics in urban waters could pose risks to both aquatic lives and human beings for example aquatic species may ingest microplastics directly or through consumption of prey containing mps which could result in the reduction of feeding activity reduction of reproductive fitness or even ultimately death in some cases de sá et al 2018 liu et al 2019a wright et al 2013 ziajahromi et al 2018 in addition microplastics could also pass through the conventional drinking water treatment process and even leach toxic organics during disinfection threatening public health koh et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is of vital importance to fully identify the potential sources contributing to microplastic pollution in urban waters and take measures to alleviate microplastics release from different sources previous studies suggested that the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is an important pathway for microplastics to release into urban waters sun et al 2019 in addition the urban runoff was also recognized as a potential source for delivering microplastics to rivers and lakes piñon colin et al 2020 werbowski et al 2021 more recently studies showed that microplastics could be suspended in the atmosphere with a significant abundance gonzález pleiter et al 2020 huang et al 2021 it has been reported the suspended microplastics concentrations in the urban atmosphere can vary from 1 particle m3 to 35 particle m3 xu et al 2022 some researchers postulated that microplastics may be entrained into the atmosphere through mechanical processes such as vehicle tire movement strong wind events and sea spray brahney et al 2021 these atmospheric microplastics could be transported for a long distance in the air but could also be deposited on the ground and then entered the waterways through urban runoff meanwhile some atmosphere microplastics may be directly deposited into the lake and rivers serving as a source for microplastics to enter urban waters however this source has always been ignored in the past according to different meteorological conditions the atmospheric deposition of microplastics could be divided into dry deposition and wet deposition however whether the rain event would affect the microplastics deposition is always under debate a study carried out in a remote maintain catchment found that the rainfall showed moderate to significant correlations to microplastics deposition fluxes allen et al 2019 while for urban areas a short communication by klein et al 2019 suggested that the microplastics deposition showed no significant correlation with precipitation but was correlated to the wind speed however an early study carried out in paris france suggested that rain events might promote the microplastics deposition in urban areas dris et al 2015 in fact the abundance of atmospheric microplastics could be significantly affected by anthropogenic activities the pollution characteristics of microplastics in urban areas can be distinct from remote districts which may consequently result in different deposit patterns allen et al 2019 dong et al 2021 therefore atmospheric deposition of microplastics in urban areas should be investigated individually to understand its pollution characteristics and to figure out how rain events affected the deposition flux also it is worthwhile to identify potential factors or indices which may correlate to microplastics depositions flux for evaluating how atmospheric deposition contributed to microplastics pollution in urban water systems therefore this study aims to investigate the atmospheric microplastics deposition during both wet and dry weather to reveal the effect of rain events on microplastics deposition fluxes and deposited microplastics characteristics in the urban area shanghai a metropolitan city with a population of over 26 million was selected as the study site since the atmospheric microplastics deposition may be potentially affected by both rainfall and wind speed this is similar to some air quality indices such as particle matter concentration thus the atmospheric microplastics deposition samples were collected on various days with different particle matter concentrations in order to identify a possible correlation between deposition flux and atmospheric particle matter concentration the outcomes of this study are expected to expand the current knowledge on the sources and loadings of microplastics entering the urban waters which is critical for microplastic pollution regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 atmospheric deposition sample collection the atmospheric deposition samples were collected in shanghai on 11 different days covering a wide range of atmospheric particle matter concentrations during a period from september 2019 to june 2020 the sampling campaign was once ceased for 5 months from jan 2020 to may 2020 due to covid 19 the sampling location was a building roof in yangpu district shanghai 121 30 17 4 n 31 17 4 3 e which is 25 m above the ground with no large buildings around two stainless steel buckets with a diameter of 30 cm and volume of 19 5 l each were used for sampling and the duration of each sampling event was 24 h for wet deposition samples the sampling device was placed at a fixed point before the rain according to the weather forecast the volume of rainwater collected in sampling buckets was measured and the hourly rainfall was recorded according to shanghai meteorological service for dry deposition samples the sampling device was also placed at the same sampling point as the wet deposition sample collection and continuously sampled for 24 h the sampling buckets were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water three times and the rinsing water with microplastics was transferred into glass jars for microplastics extraction and identification the hourly variations in pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations during each sampling event were recorded from a station located closed to sampling collation according to the shanghai municipal bureau of ecology and environment 2 2 microplastics extraction the collected sample was firstly peroxided by fenton reagent to removal organics the peroxidation procedure was performed according to which described by tagg et al 2017 with some modifications see text s1 in supporting information si then the density separation was performed to remove the inorganic particles in the samples the solids retained by 3 μm mesh were transferred to a 50 ml silicate centrifuge tube using zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 g ml liu et al 2021 the tube was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 134 16 g for 10 min the supernatants containing the microplastics were vacuum filtered through a gridded nitrocellulose filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm the low speed centrifuge has been applied in many studies to enhance density separation efficiency with the characteristics of microplastics remaining unaffected sun et al 2021 tagg et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the density separation step was conducted in triplicate to ensure that all potential microplastic particles could be extracted 2 3 micro raman spectroscopy for microplastics identification particles on the gridded nitrocellulose filter after microplastic extraction were examined directly using a micro raman spectrometer hr evolution horiba france which has a size detection limit of 1 μm araujo et al 2018 the detailed parameters for micro raman spectroscopy analysis and identification were summarized text s2 si due to some filters containing a large number of particles it was impractical to identify all particles present thus the particles on 1 4 1 2 area of the filtered were picked randomly according to the grids and all particles on this subarea analyzed as the subsample each identified microplastic particle was also photographed to measure both the major axis the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and minor axis the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis and to record the shape and color the total number of microplastics on the filter can be calculated based on the number of the microplastics in the subsample divided by the area fraction of the filter analyzed 2 4 quality control to minimize contamination plastic tools were avoided as much as possible additionally all glass vessels the sampling buckets and tools were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and immediately wrapped with aluminum foil or covered by the lid all liquid reagents were filtered with a 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter before use cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were worn during the sampling and laboratory work to detect possible contamination during sample processing three blank samples were carried out with 1 0 l deionized water treated with the same peroxidation and extraction procedures as previously described the blank samples after the peroxidation and extraction steps were found to be slightly contaminated with 5 transparent microplastic particles in pe pet and pva the contamination during the peroxidation was acceptable 10 compared with the number of microplastics found in the deposited microplastic sample indicating that the results were reliable 2 5 data analysis the microplastics deposition flux particles m2 d was calculated through a sum of microplastics counts scaling using the total area of collectors sampling collect duration and the subsampling ratio allen et al 2019 the correlation of microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations were analyzed by linear regression using originpro2021 and 90 confidence regions were also determined based on t test the masses of microplastics were estimated based on the volume and the density according to the method described by simon et al 2018 for the microplastic fragments the volume was estimated by assuming an ellipsoid shape and the major axis and the minor axis were measured using the microscope the ratio of the thickness and the minor axis of the fragments were assumed the same as the ratio of the minor and major axis which was calculated as a median value of 0 57 0 19 for fibrous microplastics the volume was calculated by presuming a cylindrical shape with the major axis as the length and the minor axis as the diameter the density of different microplastic polymers used in the calculation is listed in table s1 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes during both wet weather and dry weather the atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes measured during both wet weather and dry weather were compared in table 1 the results showed that the variation of microplastic deposition fluxes on rainy days ranged from 1 1 103 0 06 103 to 3 5 103 0 3 103 particles m2 day with a mean value of 2 1 103 1 0 103 particles m2 day meanwhile the microplastics deposition flux generally increased with the decrease in air quality as indicated by the increasing average particulate matter concentrations i e pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations in comparison microplastic deposition fluxes during dry weather were relatively lower ranged from 0 91 103 0 09 103 to 1 6 103 0 1 103 particles m2 day with a mean value of 1 2 103 0 2 103 particles m2 day the fluxes during the dry weather were also changed with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations although the microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather were not constantly higher than that during the dry weather it could be observed that under similar pm2 5 concentrations e g r2 vs d1 r3 vs d2 and r5 vs d4 the fluxes during the wet weather were 1 6 2 2 times of those at dry weather this indicated that rain events may promote the deposition of microplastics in urban areas under similar air quality conditions the enhanced microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather could be attributed to the effect of below cloud wet scavenging by the rain plocoste et al 2021 in fact it was reported that the below cloud wet scavenging could be responsible for 50 80 removal of below cloud aerosols xu et al 2019 similarly the increases of microplastic fiber or fragment deposition with rainfall in urban and remote areas were also observed by dris et al 2016 and allen et al 2019 respectively however klein et al 2019 reported that the microplastic deposition flux was irrelevant to rain events in the urban area in our study we also observed that the dry deposition flux of microplastics could be higher than the wet deposition flux e g d4 and d5 vs r1 and r2 when particulate matter concentration was higher during the dry weather this suggested that rainfall is not the only factor affecting the microplastics deposition and it may be also affected by other meteorological factors such as wind and atmospheric pressure the deposition fluxes may be correlated to the suspended particulate matter concentration which will be further discussed in section 3 2 the atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes observed in this study were compared with those previously reported in table 2 the comparison suggested that deposition fluxes revealed in this study were considerably higher which is probably owing to three different reasons firstly microplastics deposition fluxes could be varied according to sampling locations since plastics are anthropogenic products the abundance of microplastics could relate to the populations and human activities at sampling sites cai et al 2017 as shanghai is a densely populated city 3925 inhabitants km2 sbs 2021 it is reasonable that microplastics deposition fluxes in shanghai are higher than those detected in remote areas allen et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 dong et al 2021 roblin et al 2020 in addition the differences in minimum detection sizes and targeted microplastic shapes could also result in distinctive fluxes for example dris et al 2016 mainly focus on the fibrous microplastics deposition in paris since fibrous microplastics are only counted for 13 28 in our study the fibrous microplastics deposition fluxes in shanghai were within the same order of magnitudes as reported by dris et al 2016 wright et al 2020 detected the microplastics with a minimum size of 20 µm while the size detection limit in our study is 3 µm thus higher deposition fluxes in our study may also be due to that the number of microplastics particles increasing steeply as sizes went down cozar et al 2014 furthermore different microplastics detection methods could also affect deposition fluxes determination early studies quantified microplastics based on visual identification using stereomicroscope or fluorescence stereomicroscope however the visual identification is open to bias with 70 error ratio hidalgo ruz et al 2012 also comparing the two advanced spectroscopic methods micro raman techniques used in this study show better spatial resolution down to 1 μm than micro ftir 20 μm with higher sensitivity and lower interference araujo et al 2018 the superior of the micro raman technique for microplastics identification was also demonstrated by allen et al 2019 they utilized micro raman to detect microplastics in a remote mountain catchment table 2 and microplastics deposition flux achieved is much higher than others for remote areas brahney et al 2020 dong et al 2021 roblin et al 2020 even higher than the reported fluxes in some densely populated cities cai et al 2017 dris et al 2016 the differences in microplastics deposition fluxes suggested that atmospheric microplastics depositions have regional characteristics also it highlighted the importance of establishing harmonized microplastics detection method with high resolution for better microplastics identification and comparison 3 2 the correlation between microplastics deposition fluxes and atmospheric particulate matter concentrations as indicated in table 1 the microplastics deposition fluxes during both wet weather and dry weather increased according to particulate matter concentrations therefore linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations two typical atmospheric particulate matter indices fig 1 the results showed that the microplastics deposition fluxes showed moderate to strong correlations with pm2 5 concentrations during both wet weather r2 0 93 fig 1a and dry weather r2 0 76 fig 1c whereas the correlation between the deposition fluxes with pm10 concentrations is slightly lower with r2 0 60 fig 1b for wet weather and r2 0 67 fig 1d for dry weather respectively it has been reported that apart from rain events the microplastic deposition flux might be also affected by other meteorological factors such as the wind speed allen et al 2019 klein and fischer 2019 szewc et al 2021 meanwhile rain events and wind speeds were also important factors that affect the particulate matter concentrations li et al 2015 yin et al 2017 thus the correlation of microplastic fluxes with particulate matter concentrations is reasonable it also indicated that regularly monitored particulate matter concentrations may be serve as a useful indicator for microplastics depositions estimation among the two typical atmospheric particulate matter indices our results suggested that pm2 5 may be more suitable for microplastics deposition flux estimation due to a higher correlation this is probably due to the defect in pm10 monitoring methods the pm10 monitoring in china was set up around 2002 and methods were not unified also some advanced systems such as the filter dynamic measurement system and the dynamic heating system may not be applied pan et al 2014 as a result in some cases especially during wet weather the pm10 concentration may be underestimated and could be lower than the pm2 5 concentrations see r3 and r6 in table 1 on the other hand the pm2 5 monitoring in china started in the 2010 s and the β ray method combined with a dynamic heating system was mainly applied mee 2013 such a method could eliminate the loss of volatile compounds during the measurement resulting in more reliable outcomes in addition as mps have a low density and are in irregular shapes they can have smaller aerodynamic equivalent diameters than their actual sizes which may also be a reason for the correlation to pm2 5 concentrations however brahney et al 2021 suggested that the transport and deposition of atmospheric microplastics is more analogical to that of coarse mode particles 2 5 µm thus it is worthy to investigate the correlation of microplastics deposition with pm10 or total particles concentration when more accurate and uniform monitoring methods were applied based on the correlation of microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 concentrations during both wet and dry weather as well as the hourly rainfall data the correlation of deposition fluxes with rainfall could also be established r2 0 86 fig 1e which could be used for estimating microplastics deposition during a certain rain event 3 3 the characteristics of deposited microplastics during the wet weather 3 3 1 materials since microplastics deposition flux was high during wet weather the wet weather samples were studied in detail to reveal the characteristics of deposited microplastics the micrographs of some deposited microplastics were shown in fig 2 which were in various sizes and shapes the characteristics of deposited microplastics during wet weather were further summarized in fig 3 overall 12 different plastic polymers were identified with pe pp pet and pa being the most abundant as shown in fig 3a based on the particle concentrations pe accounted for the highest proportion with an average percentage of 49 followed by pp with an average percentage of 20 pet and pa were also presented in all the samples accounting for 9 0 and 7 1 respectively polymers including peaa pam pbma peva ps pva pvb and pom were also observed with their average proportions lower than 5 as shown in table 2 the high proportions of pe and pp were also reported in other studies conducted in urban areas such as dongguan china cai et al 2017 and hamburg germany klein and fischer 2019 these two types of plastic polymer have been widely used in packing containers constructions agricultural coverage films etc the high abundance of pe and pp is probably associated with their high demand in the market which accounted for 30 3 and 19 7 of the global demand for pe and pp respectively pe 2021 on the other hand some studies indicated that pet accounted for the highest proportion of deposited microplastics dris et al 2016 roblin et al 2020 however these studies were mainly focused on the fibrous microplastics in the deposition as pet is the primary material of textile fibers for making clothing and fabrics the proportion of pet in microplastic fibers could be high similarly in our study 81 of pet microplastics were in the shape of fiber the mass of each microplastic particle was estimated based on its major and minor axes and the material distribution according to the mass concentration could be obtained fig 3b based on the mass concentrations pe still accounts for the highest percentage 43 on average while the percentage of pet 27 has increased to second place a higher pet mass fraction was probably due to its high density 1 4 g cm3 and large particle size other polymers with a relatively high fraction of mass concentration included pp 15 0 and peva 7 6 the comparison of fig 3a and b suggested significant differences in the material fractions based on the particle concentration and the mass concentration this is because the mass of a microplastic particle is greatly influenced by its particle volume as volumes of microplastic fragments were commonly estimated by assuming their shape as an ellipsoid ni et al 2020 simon et al 2018 and the dimensions can range from 1 μm to 5 mm thompson 2015 it would lead to considerable variation in particle volume and mass therefore to accurately quantify the mass flux of the deposited microplastic it is necessary to focus on the large microplastic particles and the identification of each small particle may not be necessary however for the determination of particle flux to include small microplastics was also important as small microplastics are believed to have more severe ecological hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 3 3 2 color shape and size six different colors were observed in the deposited microplastics collected in wet weather fig 3c transparent was the predominant color on all sampling days accounting for 76 100 of the collected microplastics with an average of 92 this indicated that most deposited microplastics were aged with their original color faded there were also some colored microplastics such as in brown yellow pink blue and purple with an average proportion of 1 6 for each these microplastics may have a relatively shorter residence time in the environment in terms of shapes fragments accounted for a larger proportion of 55 85 with an average of 72 while fibers accounted for 15 45 with an average of 28 microplastic fragments were mainly originated from wearing of large plastic products and fibers were probably shed from clothing during normal wear and drying processes carr 2017 a higher percentage of fragments than fibers was also observed in other urban areas such as london uk and hamburg germany table 2 however cai et al 2017 and dris et al 2015 found that there were much more fibers in deposited microplastics in the urban area which is probably related to differences in targeted particles and detection methods the proportion of fiber reported by cai et al 2017 included both natural and synthetic fibers with the natural fiber accounting for 77 in addition these two studies conducted more than five years ago when microplastics were counted using a stereomicroscope and mainly focused on microplastics with sizes were over 100 µm by using the stereomicroscope fibers are easier to be found than fragments due to their large sizes allen et al 2019 with the minimum detection size going down such as 3 µm applied in this study more fragments could be detected as the number of fragments could increase exponentially with decreasing size filella 2015 as for sizes the distributions of major and minor axes of microplastics collected on different sampling days were presented in fig 3e and 3f respectively the medium length of major axes ranged from 33 µm to 138 µm and the media length of minor axes were 12 21 µm in general microplastic sizes collected on r3 r5 and r6 have narrower distribution and smaller sizes than those collected on the other three days meanwhile on these three days the ratios of pm2 5 concentrations to pm10 concentrations were also higher though all the microplastics detected were larger than 2 5 µm as the finest filter we used to intercept microplastics was 3 µm a higher concentration ratio of pm2 5 and pm10 may indicate a higher fraction of smaller microplastics 3 4 differences in atmospheric microplastics deposition between wet weather and dry weather the characteristics of deposited microplastics collected during both wet and dry weather were compared as shown in fig 4 a there is no significant difference in microplastic materials between wet weather and dry weather in both cases pe is the most abundant polymer which was followed by pp pet pa and ps the principal component analysis based on materials fig 4b showed that the confidence regions of microplastic samples collected during both weathers were overlapped which further confirmed the similarity in materials however microplastics collected during wet weather were more dispersed probably due to more particle deposited on rainy days in terms of shapes the results showed that rain events promoted the deposition of fibrous microplastics as a higher proportion of fiber deposited during wet weather than during dry weather 28 vs 13 fig 4c this indicated that fibers were more difficult to be deposited than fragments during the dry weather fibers usually have diameters around 5 20 µm with lengths of more than 100 µm to some millimeters such a shape would result in a greater surface area to volume ratio which could increase drag forces and reduce the settling velocity brahney et al 2020 this process may be similar to ballooning in spiders where a combination of electrostatic forces and drag allows spiders attached to silk fibers to travel thousands of kilometers morley and robert 2018 therefore fibers cannot be easily settled during dry weather and if dry deposition of fiber occurred the potential for resuspension may be greater than fragments due to electrostatics forces allen et al 2019 however when it rains the rain droplet could attach to the fiber and change its shape consequently enhancing the settling velocity also rain events promoted the deposition of colored microplastics with the proportion of transparent microplastics collected during the wet weather 92 being lower than those collected during the dry weather 97 fig 4d the increase in colored microplastics suggested that the residence time of microplastics in the atmosphere was reduced by rain events which also suggested that rain events facilitated the microplastics deposition additionally the sizes of microplastics collected during wet weather and dry weather are varied the medium length of major axes of microplastics collected in wet weather was 51 μm which is slightly lower than those collected in dry weather 67 μm fig 4e also the 75 percentile length and 90 percentile length of major axes for wet weather microplastics 106 μm and 225 μm were lower than those for dry weather microplastics 116 μm and 236 μm similarly the wet weather microplastics had smaller minor axes than the dry weather microplastics fig 4f especially the 75 percentile length of the minor axes wet weather microplastics was only about 60 of that of the dry weather microplastics accordingly the mass of microplastics collected during wet weather were also lighter than those collected in dry weather fig 4g thus it could be inferred that rain events promoted the deposition of smaller microplastics normally the settling velocities of particles with similar densities in the atmosphere are proportional to their size so that the larger particles were more ready to be settled this is especially true for particles with its size less than 10 20 μm since the effect of gravity on its settling can be ignored chate and pranesha 2004 when it rain the droplet can be condensed on small microplastic particles and it may also colloid with microplastics through the effect of interception impaction thermophoresis and so on which facilitated the deposition of smaller microplastics zhao et al 2015 3 5 the estimated total atmospheric microplastics deposition in the studied urban area and its contribution to the microplastics pollution in urban waters the daily microplastics deposition in the studied city shanghai total area 6340 5 km2 were estimated according to the correlation of microplastics deposition with pm2 5 concentration and rainfall during dry weather fig 1c and during the rain event fig 1e based on the pm 2 5 concentration hourly rainfall daily rain duration from jun 2019 to may 2020 as shown in fig 5 a the daily microplastics deposition fluctuated with a range of 4 2 1012 4 1 1013 particle day the maximum deposition flux occurred on 8th aug 2019 when the rainfall was 31 mm and pm 2 5 concentration was 41 μg m3 as shown in fig 5b the average daily microplastic deposition was 8 9 1012 particle day with the average deposition during wet weather 1 1 1013 particle day 127 days in total being about 1 5 times higher than that during the dry weather 7 4 1012 particle day 239 days in total this was in accordance with our observation that rain events promoted atmospheric microplastics deposition the variation of microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather was larger than that during the dry weather as it is not only related to pm2 5 concentrations but also depended on rainfalls the daily atmospheric microplastics depositions in different seasons were also compared as shown in fig 5c summer and winter showed higher daily deposition summer average 1 0 1013 particle day and winter average 9 4 1012 particle day than spring average 8 3 1012 particle day and autumn average 7 8 1012 particle day the relatively higher deposition in summer was probably due to more rain events as the rainy days accounted for 39 of the whole summer days fig s1 as shown in fig 5d summer also had the largest variation of microplastic depositions during wet weather which could be owing to the significant fluctuation in rainfall during the summer fig s1 in comparision the higher average microplastics deposition in winter is mainly due to the higher deposition flux during dry weather this could be supported by that the average wet weather deposition flux in winter is comparable to those in spring and autumn fig 5d while the average dry weather deposition flux in winter is about 1 1 1 2 times higher than those in the other three seasons the higher microplastics deposition in winter was mainly related to the worse air quality as indicated by higher pm2 5 concentrations fig s2 as shanghai belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate and northwest wind prevails in winter such wind may bring air masses containing pollutants from inland areas thus aggravating the air pollution and microplastics deposition during the winter feng et al 2009 also the low temperature in winter could reduce the height of atmospheric mixed layer which is not conducive to the vertical transportation of pollutants and may result in higher microplastics deposition tang et al 2016 additionally the microplastic deposition may also be affected by the humidity in the air which are worthy to investigate in future based on the total microplastics deposition it could be estimated that the annual atmospheric deposition in shanghai could reach 3 1 1015 particle year among these microplastics 3 1 1014 particle year could be directly reached urban waters as the area of lakes and rivers accounted for 10 of the total area of shanghai the left would be deposited on the soil roads roofs etc and may also reach the urban waters by the runoff in rainy days or trapped into the soil and infiltrated into the groundwater in comparison microplastics discharged to urban waters from wwtps in shanghai was about 2 5 1014 1 8 1015 particles year calculated based on reported microplastics concentration in wwtps effluent 83 600 particle l jia et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and daily wastewater treatment volume 8 4 million m3 day mohurd 2020 thus the total amount of microplastics deposited in the urban environment could reach 1 7 12 times of those discharged from wwtps to urban waters additionally the amount of microplastic deposited directly into urban waters could reach 18 to 1 3 times of that discharged from the wwtps although the deposition samples collected in our study are limited our results could provide a first insight as the atmospheric microplastics deposition is an important source for microplastics entering urban waters future studies on microplastics deposition covering a wide city region are recommended to provide a more critical assessment however our study suggested that the contribution of atmospheric deposition to microplastic pollution in urban waters especially the pollution caused by the smaller microplastics could not be ignored for controlling microplastics pollution in urban waters caused by atmospheric deposition since the atmospheric microplastics deposition could happen in the whole city area and it is difficult to remove microplastics in atmosphere reducing microplastics entering the atmosphere should be focused on to achieve this goal apart from reducing the usage of plastic products and avoiding unnecessary abrasion strict regulation on plastic waste management is also important as the atmospheric microplastics mainly originated from the breakdown of large plastic products the plastic wastes should be collected as much as possible to avoid their retention in the open environment and breaking down also more attention should be paid when dealing with plastic waste it has been reported that incomplete combustion of plastic debris could produce pe or pp fragments with a black color liu et al 2019b similarly our previous study showed that the low temperature pyrolysis may also result in undegraded or new microplastics particles ni et al 2020 as these microplastics may be released into the air with the flue gas through the chimney thus complete combustion and pyrolysis should be ensured to reduce such emissions in addition the wearing of clothes is an important way for fibrous microplastics releasing into the atmosphere especially during the drying process after laundry as fibrous microplastics can be released greatly with the tumble dryer exhaust pirc et al 2016 advanced drying processes such as the heat pump dryer with fiber traps is recommended to reduce such emissions 4 conclusions this study showed that the atmospheric microplastic deposition fluxes ranged from 0 9 103 0 08 103 to 3 5 103 0 27 103 particles m2 day in the studied urban area the fluxes were correlated to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations especially pm2 5 concentrations the deposited microplastics were mainly transparent fragments with pe pp pet and pa as the top four materials the rain events could promote the deposition of fibrous microplastics and smaller microplastics in the studied city region the total microplastics deposition could reach 1 7 12 times of microplastics discharged from treated wastewater among them 10 would directly deposit to urban waters while the others may also enter the urban waters through runoff the results of this study suggested that atmospheric deposition is an important source for microplastics especially small microplastics to enter urban waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare

15434,identifying and understanding the potential sources delivering microplastics into the urban water environment is imperative for microplastic pollution control however how atmospheric deposition contributes to microplastic pollution in the urban water environment is unclear therefore this study investigated the contribution of atmospheric deposition to microplastic pollution in urban waters based on the analysis of the atmospheric deposition characteristics in the urban area the results showed that microplastic deposition fluxes during wet weather and dry weather varied from 1 1 103 0 06 103 to 3 5 103 0 3 103 particles m2 day and 0 91 103 0 09 103 to 1 6 103 0 1 103 particles m2 day respectively the microplastics deposition flux showed moderate to strong correlations to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations especially the pm2 5 concentration r2 0 76 0 93 suggesting the regularly monitored pm2 5 concentration might be served as an indicator for microplastics deposition flux estimation the deposited microplastics were mainly transparent fragments with an average size of 51 67 μm polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant plastic polymer followed by polyethylene terephthalate and polyamide the comparison of microplastics collected during different weather conditions suggested that rain events could increase microplastics deposition fluxes when air quality conditions are similar particularly rains promoted the deposition of fibrous microplastics as well as smaller microplastics the estimated daily microplastics deposition in the whole city region suggested more microplastics were deposited in summer and winter the total quantity of microplastics deposited in the urban environment could reach 1 7 12 times of those discharged from treated wastewater among them 10 would directly deposit to urban waters in the studied city region while the others may also enter the urban waters through runoff the results of this study highlighted that the atmospheric microplastics deposition is an important source for microplastics especially smaller ones to enter the urban waters which could not be ignored during microplastics pollution control

were defined as plastic particles with sizes smaller than 5 mm which can be originated from the decomposition of large plastic products or be directly produced by manufacturers thompson 2015 as an emerging contaminant the occurrences and behaviors of microplastics in different environmental sectors are attracting increasing attention urban waters refers to freshwater systems such as river water and lake water are important carriers of microplastics where microplastics from different sources are gathered and transported with water flows finally reaching and accumulating in marine systems li et al 2018 however the occurrences of microplastics in urban waters could pose risks to both aquatic lives and human beings for example aquatic species may ingest microplastics directly or through consumption of prey containing mps which could result in the reduction of feeding activity reduction of reproductive fitness or even ultimately death in some cases de sá et al 2018 liu et al 2019a wright et al 2013 ziajahromi et al 2018 in addition microplastics could also pass through the conventional drinking water treatment process and even leach toxic organics during disinfection threatening public health koh et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is of vital importance to fully identify the potential sources contributing to microplastic pollution in urban waters and take measures to alleviate microplastics release from different sources previous studies suggested that the wastewater treatment plant wwtp is an important pathway for microplastics to release into urban waters sun et al 2019 in addition the urban runoff was also recognized as a potential source for delivering microplastics to rivers and lakes piñon colin et al 2020 werbowski et al 2021 more recently studies showed that microplastics could be suspended in the atmosphere with a significant abundance gonzález pleiter et al 2020 huang et al 2021 it has been reported the suspended microplastics concentrations in the urban atmosphere can vary from 1 particle m3 to 35 particle m3 xu et al 2022 some researchers postulated that microplastics may be entrained into the atmosphere through mechanical processes such as vehicle tire movement strong wind events and sea spray brahney et al 2021 these atmospheric microplastics could be transported for a long distance in the air but could also be deposited on the ground and then entered the waterways through urban runoff meanwhile some atmosphere microplastics may be directly deposited into the lake and rivers serving as a source for microplastics to enter urban waters however this source has always been ignored in the past according to different meteorological conditions the atmospheric deposition of microplastics could be divided into dry deposition and wet deposition however whether the rain event would affect the microplastics deposition is always under debate a study carried out in a remote maintain catchment found that the rainfall showed moderate to significant correlations to microplastics deposition fluxes allen et al 2019 while for urban areas a short communication by klein et al 2019 suggested that the microplastics deposition showed no significant correlation with precipitation but was correlated to the wind speed however an early study carried out in paris france suggested that rain events might promote the microplastics deposition in urban areas dris et al 2015 in fact the abundance of atmospheric microplastics could be significantly affected by anthropogenic activities the pollution characteristics of microplastics in urban areas can be distinct from remote districts which may consequently result in different deposit patterns allen et al 2019 dong et al 2021 therefore atmospheric deposition of microplastics in urban areas should be investigated individually to understand its pollution characteristics and to figure out how rain events affected the deposition flux also it is worthwhile to identify potential factors or indices which may correlate to microplastics depositions flux for evaluating how atmospheric deposition contributed to microplastics pollution in urban water systems therefore this study aims to investigate the atmospheric microplastics deposition during both wet and dry weather to reveal the effect of rain events on microplastics deposition fluxes and deposited microplastics characteristics in the urban area shanghai a metropolitan city with a population of over 26 million was selected as the study site since the atmospheric microplastics deposition may be potentially affected by both rainfall and wind speed this is similar to some air quality indices such as particle matter concentration thus the atmospheric microplastics deposition samples were collected on various days with different particle matter concentrations in order to identify a possible correlation between deposition flux and atmospheric particle matter concentration the outcomes of this study are expected to expand the current knowledge on the sources and loadings of microplastics entering the urban waters which is critical for microplastic pollution regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 atmospheric deposition sample collection the atmospheric deposition samples were collected in shanghai on 11 different days covering a wide range of atmospheric particle matter concentrations during a period from september 2019 to june 2020 the sampling campaign was once ceased for 5 months from jan 2020 to may 2020 due to covid 19 the sampling location was a building roof in yangpu district shanghai 121 30 17 4 n 31 17 4 3 e which is 25 m above the ground with no large buildings around two stainless steel buckets with a diameter of 30 cm and volume of 19 5 l each were used for sampling and the duration of each sampling event was 24 h for wet deposition samples the sampling device was placed at a fixed point before the rain according to the weather forecast the volume of rainwater collected in sampling buckets was measured and the hourly rainfall was recorded according to shanghai meteorological service for dry deposition samples the sampling device was also placed at the same sampling point as the wet deposition sample collection and continuously sampled for 24 h the sampling buckets were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water three times and the rinsing water with microplastics was transferred into glass jars for microplastics extraction and identification the hourly variations in pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations during each sampling event were recorded from a station located closed to sampling collation according to the shanghai municipal bureau of ecology and environment 2 2 microplastics extraction the collected sample was firstly peroxided by fenton reagent to removal organics the peroxidation procedure was performed according to which described by tagg et al 2017 with some modifications see text s1 in supporting information si then the density separation was performed to remove the inorganic particles in the samples the solids retained by 3 μm mesh were transferred to a 50 ml silicate centrifuge tube using zncl2 solution with a density of 1 6 g ml liu et al 2021 the tube was then centrifuged at 1000 rpm 134 16 g for 10 min the supernatants containing the microplastics were vacuum filtered through a gridded nitrocellulose filter with a pore size of 0 45 μm the low speed centrifuge has been applied in many studies to enhance density separation efficiency with the characteristics of microplastics remaining unaffected sun et al 2021 tagg et al 2017 ziajahromi et al 2017 the density separation step was conducted in triplicate to ensure that all potential microplastic particles could be extracted 2 3 micro raman spectroscopy for microplastics identification particles on the gridded nitrocellulose filter after microplastic extraction were examined directly using a micro raman spectrometer hr evolution horiba france which has a size detection limit of 1 μm araujo et al 2018 the detailed parameters for micro raman spectroscopy analysis and identification were summarized text s2 si due to some filters containing a large number of particles it was impractical to identify all particles present thus the particles on 1 4 1 2 area of the filtered were picked randomly according to the grids and all particles on this subarea analyzed as the subsample each identified microplastic particle was also photographed to measure both the major axis the longest continuous axis in the center of the particle and minor axis the longest axis perpendicular to the major axis and to record the shape and color the total number of microplastics on the filter can be calculated based on the number of the microplastics in the subsample divided by the area fraction of the filter analyzed 2 4 quality control to minimize contamination plastic tools were avoided as much as possible additionally all glass vessels the sampling buckets and tools were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and immediately wrapped with aluminum foil or covered by the lid all liquid reagents were filtered with a 0 45 μm nitrocellulose filter before use cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were worn during the sampling and laboratory work to detect possible contamination during sample processing three blank samples were carried out with 1 0 l deionized water treated with the same peroxidation and extraction procedures as previously described the blank samples after the peroxidation and extraction steps were found to be slightly contaminated with 5 transparent microplastic particles in pe pet and pva the contamination during the peroxidation was acceptable 10 compared with the number of microplastics found in the deposited microplastic sample indicating that the results were reliable 2 5 data analysis the microplastics deposition flux particles m2 d was calculated through a sum of microplastics counts scaling using the total area of collectors sampling collect duration and the subsampling ratio allen et al 2019 the correlation of microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations were analyzed by linear regression using originpro2021 and 90 confidence regions were also determined based on t test the masses of microplastics were estimated based on the volume and the density according to the method described by simon et al 2018 for the microplastic fragments the volume was estimated by assuming an ellipsoid shape and the major axis and the minor axis were measured using the microscope the ratio of the thickness and the minor axis of the fragments were assumed the same as the ratio of the minor and major axis which was calculated as a median value of 0 57 0 19 for fibrous microplastics the volume was calculated by presuming a cylindrical shape with the major axis as the length and the minor axis as the diameter the density of different microplastic polymers used in the calculation is listed in table s1 si 3 results and discussion 3 1 atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes during both wet weather and dry weather the atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes measured during both wet weather and dry weather were compared in table 1 the results showed that the variation of microplastic deposition fluxes on rainy days ranged from 1 1 103 0 06 103 to 3 5 103 0 3 103 particles m2 day with a mean value of 2 1 103 1 0 103 particles m2 day meanwhile the microplastics deposition flux generally increased with the decrease in air quality as indicated by the increasing average particulate matter concentrations i e pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations in comparison microplastic deposition fluxes during dry weather were relatively lower ranged from 0 91 103 0 09 103 to 1 6 103 0 1 103 particles m2 day with a mean value of 1 2 103 0 2 103 particles m2 day the fluxes during the dry weather were also changed with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations although the microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather were not constantly higher than that during the dry weather it could be observed that under similar pm2 5 concentrations e g r2 vs d1 r3 vs d2 and r5 vs d4 the fluxes during the wet weather were 1 6 2 2 times of those at dry weather this indicated that rain events may promote the deposition of microplastics in urban areas under similar air quality conditions the enhanced microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather could be attributed to the effect of below cloud wet scavenging by the rain plocoste et al 2021 in fact it was reported that the below cloud wet scavenging could be responsible for 50 80 removal of below cloud aerosols xu et al 2019 similarly the increases of microplastic fiber or fragment deposition with rainfall in urban and remote areas were also observed by dris et al 2016 and allen et al 2019 respectively however klein et al 2019 reported that the microplastic deposition flux was irrelevant to rain events in the urban area in our study we also observed that the dry deposition flux of microplastics could be higher than the wet deposition flux e g d4 and d5 vs r1 and r2 when particulate matter concentration was higher during the dry weather this suggested that rainfall is not the only factor affecting the microplastics deposition and it may be also affected by other meteorological factors such as wind and atmospheric pressure the deposition fluxes may be correlated to the suspended particulate matter concentration which will be further discussed in section 3 2 the atmospheric microplastics deposition fluxes observed in this study were compared with those previously reported in table 2 the comparison suggested that deposition fluxes revealed in this study were considerably higher which is probably owing to three different reasons firstly microplastics deposition fluxes could be varied according to sampling locations since plastics are anthropogenic products the abundance of microplastics could relate to the populations and human activities at sampling sites cai et al 2017 as shanghai is a densely populated city 3925 inhabitants km2 sbs 2021 it is reasonable that microplastics deposition fluxes in shanghai are higher than those detected in remote areas allen et al 2019 brahney et al 2020 dong et al 2021 roblin et al 2020 in addition the differences in minimum detection sizes and targeted microplastic shapes could also result in distinctive fluxes for example dris et al 2016 mainly focus on the fibrous microplastics deposition in paris since fibrous microplastics are only counted for 13 28 in our study the fibrous microplastics deposition fluxes in shanghai were within the same order of magnitudes as reported by dris et al 2016 wright et al 2020 detected the microplastics with a minimum size of 20 µm while the size detection limit in our study is 3 µm thus higher deposition fluxes in our study may also be due to that the number of microplastics particles increasing steeply as sizes went down cozar et al 2014 furthermore different microplastics detection methods could also affect deposition fluxes determination early studies quantified microplastics based on visual identification using stereomicroscope or fluorescence stereomicroscope however the visual identification is open to bias with 70 error ratio hidalgo ruz et al 2012 also comparing the two advanced spectroscopic methods micro raman techniques used in this study show better spatial resolution down to 1 μm than micro ftir 20 μm with higher sensitivity and lower interference araujo et al 2018 the superior of the micro raman technique for microplastics identification was also demonstrated by allen et al 2019 they utilized micro raman to detect microplastics in a remote mountain catchment table 2 and microplastics deposition flux achieved is much higher than others for remote areas brahney et al 2020 dong et al 2021 roblin et al 2020 even higher than the reported fluxes in some densely populated cities cai et al 2017 dris et al 2016 the differences in microplastics deposition fluxes suggested that atmospheric microplastics depositions have regional characteristics also it highlighted the importance of establishing harmonized microplastics detection method with high resolution for better microplastics identification and comparison 3 2 the correlation between microplastics deposition fluxes and atmospheric particulate matter concentrations as indicated in table 1 the microplastics deposition fluxes during both wet weather and dry weather increased according to particulate matter concentrations therefore linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate the relationship between microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 and pm10 concentrations two typical atmospheric particulate matter indices fig 1 the results showed that the microplastics deposition fluxes showed moderate to strong correlations with pm2 5 concentrations during both wet weather r2 0 93 fig 1a and dry weather r2 0 76 fig 1c whereas the correlation between the deposition fluxes with pm10 concentrations is slightly lower with r2 0 60 fig 1b for wet weather and r2 0 67 fig 1d for dry weather respectively it has been reported that apart from rain events the microplastic deposition flux might be also affected by other meteorological factors such as the wind speed allen et al 2019 klein and fischer 2019 szewc et al 2021 meanwhile rain events and wind speeds were also important factors that affect the particulate matter concentrations li et al 2015 yin et al 2017 thus the correlation of microplastic fluxes with particulate matter concentrations is reasonable it also indicated that regularly monitored particulate matter concentrations may be serve as a useful indicator for microplastics depositions estimation among the two typical atmospheric particulate matter indices our results suggested that pm2 5 may be more suitable for microplastics deposition flux estimation due to a higher correlation this is probably due to the defect in pm10 monitoring methods the pm10 monitoring in china was set up around 2002 and methods were not unified also some advanced systems such as the filter dynamic measurement system and the dynamic heating system may not be applied pan et al 2014 as a result in some cases especially during wet weather the pm10 concentration may be underestimated and could be lower than the pm2 5 concentrations see r3 and r6 in table 1 on the other hand the pm2 5 monitoring in china started in the 2010 s and the β ray method combined with a dynamic heating system was mainly applied mee 2013 such a method could eliminate the loss of volatile compounds during the measurement resulting in more reliable outcomes in addition as mps have a low density and are in irregular shapes they can have smaller aerodynamic equivalent diameters than their actual sizes which may also be a reason for the correlation to pm2 5 concentrations however brahney et al 2021 suggested that the transport and deposition of atmospheric microplastics is more analogical to that of coarse mode particles 2 5 µm thus it is worthy to investigate the correlation of microplastics deposition with pm10 or total particles concentration when more accurate and uniform monitoring methods were applied based on the correlation of microplastics deposition fluxes with pm2 5 concentrations during both wet and dry weather as well as the hourly rainfall data the correlation of deposition fluxes with rainfall could also be established r2 0 86 fig 1e which could be used for estimating microplastics deposition during a certain rain event 3 3 the characteristics of deposited microplastics during the wet weather 3 3 1 materials since microplastics deposition flux was high during wet weather the wet weather samples were studied in detail to reveal the characteristics of deposited microplastics the micrographs of some deposited microplastics were shown in fig 2 which were in various sizes and shapes the characteristics of deposited microplastics during wet weather were further summarized in fig 3 overall 12 different plastic polymers were identified with pe pp pet and pa being the most abundant as shown in fig 3a based on the particle concentrations pe accounted for the highest proportion with an average percentage of 49 followed by pp with an average percentage of 20 pet and pa were also presented in all the samples accounting for 9 0 and 7 1 respectively polymers including peaa pam pbma peva ps pva pvb and pom were also observed with their average proportions lower than 5 as shown in table 2 the high proportions of pe and pp were also reported in other studies conducted in urban areas such as dongguan china cai et al 2017 and hamburg germany klein and fischer 2019 these two types of plastic polymer have been widely used in packing containers constructions agricultural coverage films etc the high abundance of pe and pp is probably associated with their high demand in the market which accounted for 30 3 and 19 7 of the global demand for pe and pp respectively pe 2021 on the other hand some studies indicated that pet accounted for the highest proportion of deposited microplastics dris et al 2016 roblin et al 2020 however these studies were mainly focused on the fibrous microplastics in the deposition as pet is the primary material of textile fibers for making clothing and fabrics the proportion of pet in microplastic fibers could be high similarly in our study 81 of pet microplastics were in the shape of fiber the mass of each microplastic particle was estimated based on its major and minor axes and the material distribution according to the mass concentration could be obtained fig 3b based on the mass concentrations pe still accounts for the highest percentage 43 on average while the percentage of pet 27 has increased to second place a higher pet mass fraction was probably due to its high density 1 4 g cm3 and large particle size other polymers with a relatively high fraction of mass concentration included pp 15 0 and peva 7 6 the comparison of fig 3a and b suggested significant differences in the material fractions based on the particle concentration and the mass concentration this is because the mass of a microplastic particle is greatly influenced by its particle volume as volumes of microplastic fragments were commonly estimated by assuming their shape as an ellipsoid ni et al 2020 simon et al 2018 and the dimensions can range from 1 μm to 5 mm thompson 2015 it would lead to considerable variation in particle volume and mass therefore to accurately quantify the mass flux of the deposited microplastic it is necessary to focus on the large microplastic particles and the identification of each small particle may not be necessary however for the determination of particle flux to include small microplastics was also important as small microplastics are believed to have more severe ecological hazards than the larger ones enders et al 2015 sussarellu et al 2016 3 3 2 color shape and size six different colors were observed in the deposited microplastics collected in wet weather fig 3c transparent was the predominant color on all sampling days accounting for 76 100 of the collected microplastics with an average of 92 this indicated that most deposited microplastics were aged with their original color faded there were also some colored microplastics such as in brown yellow pink blue and purple with an average proportion of 1 6 for each these microplastics may have a relatively shorter residence time in the environment in terms of shapes fragments accounted for a larger proportion of 55 85 with an average of 72 while fibers accounted for 15 45 with an average of 28 microplastic fragments were mainly originated from wearing of large plastic products and fibers were probably shed from clothing during normal wear and drying processes carr 2017 a higher percentage of fragments than fibers was also observed in other urban areas such as london uk and hamburg germany table 2 however cai et al 2017 and dris et al 2015 found that there were much more fibers in deposited microplastics in the urban area which is probably related to differences in targeted particles and detection methods the proportion of fiber reported by cai et al 2017 included both natural and synthetic fibers with the natural fiber accounting for 77 in addition these two studies conducted more than five years ago when microplastics were counted using a stereomicroscope and mainly focused on microplastics with sizes were over 100 µm by using the stereomicroscope fibers are easier to be found than fragments due to their large sizes allen et al 2019 with the minimum detection size going down such as 3 µm applied in this study more fragments could be detected as the number of fragments could increase exponentially with decreasing size filella 2015 as for sizes the distributions of major and minor axes of microplastics collected on different sampling days were presented in fig 3e and 3f respectively the medium length of major axes ranged from 33 µm to 138 µm and the media length of minor axes were 12 21 µm in general microplastic sizes collected on r3 r5 and r6 have narrower distribution and smaller sizes than those collected on the other three days meanwhile on these three days the ratios of pm2 5 concentrations to pm10 concentrations were also higher though all the microplastics detected were larger than 2 5 µm as the finest filter we used to intercept microplastics was 3 µm a higher concentration ratio of pm2 5 and pm10 may indicate a higher fraction of smaller microplastics 3 4 differences in atmospheric microplastics deposition between wet weather and dry weather the characteristics of deposited microplastics collected during both wet and dry weather were compared as shown in fig 4 a there is no significant difference in microplastic materials between wet weather and dry weather in both cases pe is the most abundant polymer which was followed by pp pet pa and ps the principal component analysis based on materials fig 4b showed that the confidence regions of microplastic samples collected during both weathers were overlapped which further confirmed the similarity in materials however microplastics collected during wet weather were more dispersed probably due to more particle deposited on rainy days in terms of shapes the results showed that rain events promoted the deposition of fibrous microplastics as a higher proportion of fiber deposited during wet weather than during dry weather 28 vs 13 fig 4c this indicated that fibers were more difficult to be deposited than fragments during the dry weather fibers usually have diameters around 5 20 µm with lengths of more than 100 µm to some millimeters such a shape would result in a greater surface area to volume ratio which could increase drag forces and reduce the settling velocity brahney et al 2020 this process may be similar to ballooning in spiders where a combination of electrostatic forces and drag allows spiders attached to silk fibers to travel thousands of kilometers morley and robert 2018 therefore fibers cannot be easily settled during dry weather and if dry deposition of fiber occurred the potential for resuspension may be greater than fragments due to electrostatics forces allen et al 2019 however when it rains the rain droplet could attach to the fiber and change its shape consequently enhancing the settling velocity also rain events promoted the deposition of colored microplastics with the proportion of transparent microplastics collected during the wet weather 92 being lower than those collected during the dry weather 97 fig 4d the increase in colored microplastics suggested that the residence time of microplastics in the atmosphere was reduced by rain events which also suggested that rain events facilitated the microplastics deposition additionally the sizes of microplastics collected during wet weather and dry weather are varied the medium length of major axes of microplastics collected in wet weather was 51 μm which is slightly lower than those collected in dry weather 67 μm fig 4e also the 75 percentile length and 90 percentile length of major axes for wet weather microplastics 106 μm and 225 μm were lower than those for dry weather microplastics 116 μm and 236 μm similarly the wet weather microplastics had smaller minor axes than the dry weather microplastics fig 4f especially the 75 percentile length of the minor axes wet weather microplastics was only about 60 of that of the dry weather microplastics accordingly the mass of microplastics collected during wet weather were also lighter than those collected in dry weather fig 4g thus it could be inferred that rain events promoted the deposition of smaller microplastics normally the settling velocities of particles with similar densities in the atmosphere are proportional to their size so that the larger particles were more ready to be settled this is especially true for particles with its size less than 10 20 μm since the effect of gravity on its settling can be ignored chate and pranesha 2004 when it rain the droplet can be condensed on small microplastic particles and it may also colloid with microplastics through the effect of interception impaction thermophoresis and so on which facilitated the deposition of smaller microplastics zhao et al 2015 3 5 the estimated total atmospheric microplastics deposition in the studied urban area and its contribution to the microplastics pollution in urban waters the daily microplastics deposition in the studied city shanghai total area 6340 5 km2 were estimated according to the correlation of microplastics deposition with pm2 5 concentration and rainfall during dry weather fig 1c and during the rain event fig 1e based on the pm 2 5 concentration hourly rainfall daily rain duration from jun 2019 to may 2020 as shown in fig 5 a the daily microplastics deposition fluctuated with a range of 4 2 1012 4 1 1013 particle day the maximum deposition flux occurred on 8th aug 2019 when the rainfall was 31 mm and pm 2 5 concentration was 41 μg m3 as shown in fig 5b the average daily microplastic deposition was 8 9 1012 particle day with the average deposition during wet weather 1 1 1013 particle day 127 days in total being about 1 5 times higher than that during the dry weather 7 4 1012 particle day 239 days in total this was in accordance with our observation that rain events promoted atmospheric microplastics deposition the variation of microplastics deposition fluxes during the wet weather was larger than that during the dry weather as it is not only related to pm2 5 concentrations but also depended on rainfalls the daily atmospheric microplastics depositions in different seasons were also compared as shown in fig 5c summer and winter showed higher daily deposition summer average 1 0 1013 particle day and winter average 9 4 1012 particle day than spring average 8 3 1012 particle day and autumn average 7 8 1012 particle day the relatively higher deposition in summer was probably due to more rain events as the rainy days accounted for 39 of the whole summer days fig s1 as shown in fig 5d summer also had the largest variation of microplastic depositions during wet weather which could be owing to the significant fluctuation in rainfall during the summer fig s1 in comparision the higher average microplastics deposition in winter is mainly due to the higher deposition flux during dry weather this could be supported by that the average wet weather deposition flux in winter is comparable to those in spring and autumn fig 5d while the average dry weather deposition flux in winter is about 1 1 1 2 times higher than those in the other three seasons the higher microplastics deposition in winter was mainly related to the worse air quality as indicated by higher pm2 5 concentrations fig s2 as shanghai belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate and northwest wind prevails in winter such wind may bring air masses containing pollutants from inland areas thus aggravating the air pollution and microplastics deposition during the winter feng et al 2009 also the low temperature in winter could reduce the height of atmospheric mixed layer which is not conducive to the vertical transportation of pollutants and may result in higher microplastics deposition tang et al 2016 additionally the microplastic deposition may also be affected by the humidity in the air which are worthy to investigate in future based on the total microplastics deposition it could be estimated that the annual atmospheric deposition in shanghai could reach 3 1 1015 particle year among these microplastics 3 1 1014 particle year could be directly reached urban waters as the area of lakes and rivers accounted for 10 of the total area of shanghai the left would be deposited on the soil roads roofs etc and may also reach the urban waters by the runoff in rainy days or trapped into the soil and infiltrated into the groundwater in comparison microplastics discharged to urban waters from wwtps in shanghai was about 2 5 1014 1 8 1015 particles year calculated based on reported microplastics concentration in wwtps effluent 83 600 particle l jia et al 2019 xu et al 2020 and daily wastewater treatment volume 8 4 million m3 day mohurd 2020 thus the total amount of microplastics deposited in the urban environment could reach 1 7 12 times of those discharged from wwtps to urban waters additionally the amount of microplastic deposited directly into urban waters could reach 18 to 1 3 times of that discharged from the wwtps although the deposition samples collected in our study are limited our results could provide a first insight as the atmospheric microplastics deposition is an important source for microplastics entering urban waters future studies on microplastics deposition covering a wide city region are recommended to provide a more critical assessment however our study suggested that the contribution of atmospheric deposition to microplastic pollution in urban waters especially the pollution caused by the smaller microplastics could not be ignored for controlling microplastics pollution in urban waters caused by atmospheric deposition since the atmospheric microplastics deposition could happen in the whole city area and it is difficult to remove microplastics in atmosphere reducing microplastics entering the atmosphere should be focused on to achieve this goal apart from reducing the usage of plastic products and avoiding unnecessary abrasion strict regulation on plastic waste management is also important as the atmospheric microplastics mainly originated from the breakdown of large plastic products the plastic wastes should be collected as much as possible to avoid their retention in the open environment and breaking down also more attention should be paid when dealing with plastic waste it has been reported that incomplete combustion of plastic debris could produce pe or pp fragments with a black color liu et al 2019b similarly our previous study showed that the low temperature pyrolysis may also result in undegraded or new microplastics particles ni et al 2020 as these microplastics may be released into the air with the flue gas through the chimney thus complete combustion and pyrolysis should be ensured to reduce such emissions in addition the wearing of clothes is an important way for fibrous microplastics releasing into the atmosphere especially during the drying process after laundry as fibrous microplastics can be released greatly with the tumble dryer exhaust pirc et al 2016 advanced drying processes such as the heat pump dryer with fiber traps is recommended to reduce such emissions 4 conclusions this study showed that the atmospheric microplastic deposition fluxes ranged from 0 9 103 0 08 103 to 3 5 103 0 27 103 particles m2 day in the studied urban area the fluxes were correlated to atmospheric particulate matter concentrations especially pm2 5 concentrations the deposited microplastics were mainly transparent fragments with pe pp pet and pa as the top four materials the rain events could promote the deposition of fibrous microplastics and smaller microplastics in the studied city region the total microplastics deposition could reach 1 7 12 times of microplastics discharged from treated wastewater among them 10 would directly deposit to urban waters while the others may also enter the urban waters through runoff the results of this study suggested that atmospheric deposition is an important source for microplastics especially small microplastics to enter urban waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare
