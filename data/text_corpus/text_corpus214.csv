1070,a major constraint to science based fish stock management in west africa is the lack of reliable data on target stocks this especially holds true for inland fisheries such as those that operate in reservoirs due to the low availability of resources and population data and the limited number of fisheries experts in the region state institutions and investigators rely heavily on simple catch statistics and empirical models for their estimations of fish production and potential yields this paper reviews data from the fao and published articles and reports on west african reservoirs with special reference to their morphometric and environmental features in relation to fish catch in addition we analyse primary data on three focus reservoirs first to improve and update available models of potential harvests from reservoirs we regress fish catch data against reservoir surface area data for 30 reservoirs in west africa yielding the following equation catch tonnes year 17 3 area km2 0 8626 the equation accounts for 95 7 of the variation observed in the fish catches analysis of covariance of small 2 km2 and large 2 km2 reservoirs shows no significant difference f 0 5895 p 0 45 in the slopes of the two groups second we apply multiple regressions to a sub dataset of 15 reservoirs with surface area and mean depth as predictors and we also explore reservoir age as a further variable we find that fisheries productivity is inversely correlated with both mean depth r 0 49 and surface area r 0 32 but there is no significant correlation found with reservoir age r 0 03 keywords west africa reservoir harvest potential fish catch surface area regression 1 introduction in developing countries more than 60 million people rely on freshwater fisheries for their livelihood seventy one low income countries currently produce nearly seven million tonnes of fish a year representing 80 of global inland fisheries capture fao 2015 in west africa freshwater fish production is highly important to the food security of human populations pauly 2017 with reservoirs lakes and rivers throughout the region being important sources of protein and micronutrients this sub region has an average per capita fish consumption of 12 1 kg year notwithstanding the importance of this industry limited research has been focused on the reservoir fisheries in western africa the fao data on fish catch and fish supply in the region suggest that all fish capture from inland waters is being used for consumption within the region fig 1 and kolding et al 2016b highlight the importance of fisheries and aquaculture to the livelihoods of drylands communities of sub saharan africa however despite the fact that it has been widely reported there are several thousand reservoirs kolding et al 2016b marshall and maes 1994 and venot et al 2012 in sub saharan africa no accurate estimates of the number exist nor their potential contribution to total inland fisheries capture statistical models mostly linear regressions relating morphometric and edaphic factors to fish yields in temperate lakes and reservoirs were developed in the 1950s and 1960s these showed that fish production in canadian lakes was related to mean depth rawson 1952 to water chemistry moyle 1956 and to physical and chemical indices northcote and larkin 1956 ryder 1965 combined these indices into a morpho edaphic index mei defined as the total dissolved solids divided by the mean depth for which he used 23 temperate lakes in tropical fresh water fisheries the first application of ryder s mei was that of henderson and welcomme 1974 who applied it to a selected number of african inland waters the mei was related to yields from african tropical lakes and reservoirs and from the lake bangweulu system toews and griffith 1979 in a further development of the model a review on mei was made by schlesinger and regier 1982 and subsequently fish yields from reservoirs were related to mei by bernacsek and lopes 1984 and marshall 1984 youngs and heimbuch 1982 were able to show that the surface area of a lake alone is a very powerful predictor of catch marshall 1984 applied their model loge yield in tonnes per year tyr 1 7 01 0 83 loge area km2 for the first time to 17 african lakes and reservoirs later crul 1992 used a data set of 25 reservoirs with catch data spanning from 1954 1984 to update this work and derived the following model catch tyr 1 7 09 area0 94 r2 0 94 ideally these models should be updated periodically to accommodate new information as it becomes available for example studies by bhukaswan 1980 and gubiani et al 2011 showed that the catch obtained from a water body may depend largely on the developmental state of the fishery a significant finding such as this should be reflected in the models however due to limited catch data and limited resources many of the models currently in use are old and in need of updating welcomme 2011 youngs and heimbuch 1982 marshall 1984 and crul 1992 have all shown that of all the factors analysed surface area is the most powerful predictor of total catch in african reservoirs other factors such as primary production melack 1976 oglesby 1977 water level fluctuations and discharge fao 2016b kolding and van zwieten 2011 and total phosphorus levels hanson and leggett 1982 could also be useful predictors of fish yield but unfortunately information on these factors is only available for a very limited number of african inland waters in this paper we make an inventory of reservoirs in the region and analyse their potential harvest in developing our model we consider the following two observations i the current observed total catch of reservoirs is not adequately predicted by the crul 1992 model since 28 of the west african sub region reservoirs have catches that exceed the yields predicted by crul s model by an average of 50 see supplement table s1 ii crul s model was developed using datasets from a broad region africa considering the potential geographic differences in resource productivities highlighted by marten and polovina 1982 welcomme and bartley 1998 and yamada and ruttan 1980 our model in contrast to crul s is limited to datasets from western africa only reservoirs are man made impoundments created mostly as a result of dam construction on rivers they are used for community purposes including drinking water supply e g weija and barekese ghana irrigation farming e g tono ghana bagré burkina faso and hydroelectric power generation e g kainji nigeria manantali and sélingué mali these waterbodies vary greatly in their surface areas and in other morphometric features such as their mean depth water holding capacity and discharge in most west african countries fisheries normally develop as an incidental benefit or an intended livelihood as a result of reservoir construction considering the stagnating trend in marine capture fisheries production in the region the potential contribution of reservoirs and other inland water bodies to capture fisheries production in the region should be explored to provide essential information for national fisheries management strategies additionally the question of how morphometric characteristics of reservoirs in the semi arid region of west africa relate to fisheries productivity needs to be understood the tilapiine species s galilaeus and o niloticus of the family cichlidae are the main fisheries resources in most african lakes and reservoirs fao 2003 we present here known data from a selection of the reservoirs at asejire reservoir nigeria 19 fish species from 16 genera and 13 families were recorded during experimental gill nets fishing the family cichlidae were the most dominant among which tilapia marie was the most common species ipinmoroti et al 2017 in ghana targeted cichlid species represented 89 74 and 71 of the total catch composition landed weight at tono bontanga and golinga reservoirs respectively abobi et al 2019 in côte d ivoire the catch composition of taboo reservoir showed predominance of chrysichthys spp 58 4 and tilapiine fish 35 8 other fish species such as clarias spp 2 5 mormyrids 1 heterotis niloticus 0 8 and schilbe spp 0 7 were represented aliko et al 2014 in the reservoir ayamé côte d ivoire the most abundant families were alestidae 36 61 cichlidae 34 19 and claroteidae 13 43 mamadou et al 2019 and in reservoir buyo côte d ivoire the fish biomass was dominated by cichlidae 32 27 and claroteidae 26 35 in mali the top five most frequently encountered species at i reservoir manantali were lates niloticus 74 6 sarotherodon galilaeus 65 7 oreochromis aureus 61 2 synodontis schall 43 1 and synodontis ocellifer 40 8 and ii reservoir selengue were chrysichthys nigrodigitatus 34 6 auchenoglanis occidentalis 34 1 sarotherodon galilaeus 32 labeo senegalensis 29 4 and synodontis membranaceus 26 4 laë et al 2004 the main objective of this contribution is thus to review the sparse information on total fish catch of west african reservoirs and derive an updated predictive model for fisheries production from the reservoirs following the reasoning of oglesby 1977 and petrere 1996 on the relationship between lake size and fish yields the paper explores the potential differences in productivity between small and large reservoirs and considers further potential predictors for the fish catch such as mean reservoir depth and age 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic and climatic characteristics of west africa west africa covers an area of approximately 6 million km2 which is about 20 of africa s total land area the region lies between longitudes 18 w and 16 e and latitudes 3 and 28 n and it is bounded in the west and south by the atlantic ocean in the north by the sahara desert and in the east by the central african nations of chad and cameroon the topography of the region is mainly flat with most parts lying less than 300 m above mean sea level although there exist several isolated high points in the coastal areas andam akorful et al 2017 the climate of western africa can be described predominantly as that of a dryland encompassing arid semi arid and dry sub humid regions corresponding to aridity index values of 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 and 0 50 0 65 respectively the region is conventionally classified into three sub climatic zones namely i the dry north known as the sahel which lies just below the sahara desert ii the sudano transitional zone and iii the relatively wet guinean zone located in the south meynadier et al 2010 the geographic distribution of wet and dry regions depends on the latitude and the distance from the atlantic ocean while the degree of aridity increases from south to north and to a lesser extent from west to east as reported by menz 2010 temperatures in the lowlands of west africa are high throughout the year with annual means usually above 18 c in the sahel maximum temperatures can reach above 40 c for further details on the region s climate see cilss 2016 2 2 data sources use and collection 2 2 1 data sources for this review two fao databases were used i fishstatj provided data for the analysis of west african inland fisheries production and consumption and ii aquastat provided data on the reservoirs physical features in addition published articles and reports containing information on specific reservoir s physical features fisheries production and catch statistics were used table 1 the aquastat data were checked for consistency by comparing them with published literature 2 2 2 data use and collection first data from the aquastat database fao 2016a and other sources see supplement tables s2 and s3 were used to estimate the number of reservoirs and their total surface area in west africa second data on water level fluctuations surface area fluctuations and fish catches from three reservoirs in ghana namely tono bontanga and golinga were obtained from july 2016 to june 2017 through field data collection the water level was recorded monthly from fixed graduated poles at the three reservoirs using a garmin gps the area of the three reservoirs was measured in august 2016 peak of flood season and in april 2017 peak of dry season total fish landings were recorded for five consecutive days staring from monday to friday at tono and from tuesday to saturday at bontanga and golinga in each month and extrapolated to the monthly catch using an estimate of the average number of fishing days per month respective information was obtained from the fishers at the three reservoirs 2 3 catch surface area age and mean depth data from selected west african reservoirs from seven west african countries 30 small to large reservoirs were analysed for correlation between catch and surface area fig 2 and table 1 all the reservoirs were included in a single predictor regression then for a subset of 15 reservoirs that had additional information on age and mean depth a multiple regression analysis was conducted 2 4 modelling approaches used approach 1 simple catch area regression a simple catch area regression was first constructed for all 30 reservoirs with double logarithmic transformation 1 1 l n catch a b l n area where fish catch is in tonnes per year and reservoir area is in square kilometres the resulting single regression line was then tested for an inflection point using a technique described by somerton 1980 to check if small and large reservoirs differed in terms of their catch area relationship the data were repeatedly divided into two groups and regressions were calculated for each group the residual sum of squares of both lines was then summed and the calculation was repeated with another pair of regression lines until the residual sum of squares approached a minimum an inflection point exists if the pooled residual sum of squares of a pair of the resulting regression lines is significantly lower than the residual sum of squares of a single line the dataset was then fitted using the dummy variable regression dvr method which is an analysis of covariance ancova for comparison of two regression lines fox 1997 our dvr model consisted of ln area as a quantitative explanatory variable or the covariate size i e the reservoir group with two levels a above 2 km2 and b below 2 km2 as the dummy variable or factor and the interaction between the dummy variable and the covariate the resulting equation was 2 l n catch l n area size size l n area approach 2 multiple linear regressions using a subset of the data 15 reservoirs that had information available on both age and mean depth multiple linear regression relationships were fitted to test for the effect of the two additional variables i e age and mean depth in explaining the catch variations of the datasets a three way combination of the main effects led to an increase of variance due to the small sample size the multiple regression relationships were preceded by a simple catch area regression fitted for the 15 reservoirs followed by multiple regression using both mean depth in meters 3 and reservoir age in years 4 3 a l n catch a b l n area l n mean depth 4 b l n catch a b l n area l n age as it is widely known that using allometric equations to predict unknown values of y produces a logarithmic transformation bias smith 1993 the predicted fish yield values in log scale were back transformed with a correction factor 5 for natural logarithms provided by sprugel 1983 as 5 cf exp s e e 2 2 the term see is the residual standard error estimate of the regression equation the models were checked to see if the errors were independent normally distributed in each group and had a constant variance in each group homoscedastic these assumptions were assessed by interpreting the residual plot and the histogram of residuals then residuals of the models were tested to see if they were normally distributed using both the anderson darling and cramer von mises normality tests both tests revealed no evidence against normality p 0 08 and p 0 08 for model 1 and p 0 60 and p 0 58 for model 2 for the anderson darling and cramer von mises normality tests respectively the assumptions of linear models were adequately met for the data supplementary material a and b all data analyses were conducted using r 3 5 0 software r core 2018 3 results assessment of the number of reservoirs in western africa and their overall surface we estimate that there are about 6894 reservoirs in west africa with combined surface area of 27 504 km2 see supplement table s3 most of them have been reported as small reservoirs with surface areas within the range of 1 1000 ha 10km2 burkina faso appears to be the country with the highest number of small reservoirs fig 3 supplement table s1 the two largest reservoirs in the sub region with surface areas above 1000 km2 at upper storage level are the volta 8482 km2 and kainji lakes 1270 km2 however the fao aquastat database is not exhaustive it has only 420 reservoirs registered in the sub region and it has no records of small reservoirs with surface area below 10 ha 0 1 km2 the three focus reservoirs of northern ghana used in this study namely tono bontanga and golinga were seen to have significant intra annual change in their surface area and water levels table 2 the smallest reservoir golinga lost more than 50 of its surface area during the dry season monthly water levels of the reservoirs were inversely correlated with total catches with correlation coefficient r giving values of 0 70 0 93 and 0 56 for tono bontanga and golinga reservoirs respectively appendix a 3 1 catch area relationship of west african reservoirs using segmented regression as applied by somerton 1980 we found an inflection in reservoir size at 2 km2 however analysis of covariance showed that the resulting two groups a and b for reservoirs with surface areas above and below 2 km2 respectively see appendix b had no significant difference in their slopes with f 0 5895 d f 26 3 and p 0 45 for more detail see supplementary material c thus the catch area relationship was modelled with a single equation for all the reservoirs the resulting model was model 1 catch tonnes year area km2 catch 17 3 95 ci 13 23 are a 0 8626 95 ci 0 7915 0 9336 n 30 r 2 0 957 p 1 3 e 20 mean

explains 95 7 of the variation of observed catches the expected fish catch of a reservoir with a known area can be observed from fig 4 3 2 fish productivity and yield predictions using a range of reservoir surface area values we compared the fish productivity predicted tonnes km2 year by the model of this study to that of crul s model the model of this study predicted on average more than twice what crul s model predicts fig 5 supplement table s4 a t test on the data showed that the mean of the productivity estimates of crul s 6 2 tonnes km2 year and this study s 16 3 tonnes km2 year see supplement table s4 are significantly different t 5 7252 df 38 p value 0 00000136 see supplement material d analysis of the sub dataset i e the 15 reservoirs where additional information was available showed that the fish productivity per unit area of the reservoirs was inversely correlated both with mean depth r 0 49 and area r 0 32 but not with age r 0 03 fig 6 3 3 multiple regression with area age and mean depth data of 15 reservoirs while a multiple linear regression of catch against area km2 age year and mean depth m of the 15 reservoirs did not produce a reliable model catch

assessment of reservoirs in west africa it has been widely reported that there are several thousand reservoirs in sub saharan africa kolding et al 2016b marshall and maes 1994 venot et al 2012 our study estimated a total of 6894 reservoirs covering approximately 27 504 km2 of area in the west african sub region we estimated that the reservoirs of the region combined contribute 11 6806 3 tonnes 95 ci 42 435 1 320 883 8 tonnes per annum to the inland capture fisheries of the region which represented 12 4 of the region s total inland fish catch 940 767 tonnes annum on average as reported by the fao 2008 2015 our results were comparable to estimates by petr 1994 who reported that in africa reservoir fisheries contribute about 15 000 tonnes 10 to the overall inland fishery of the continent our model and that of crul 1992 were both developed with datasets of man made lakes only and are thus comparable 4 2 models and harvest potential estimate in our study we followed the modelling approach of youngs and heimbuch 1982 which regresses the logarithm of fish catch against the logarithm of reservoir surface area our model accounts for 95 7 of the observed variation in catches of the reservoirs however our potential yield estimates greatly exceed those of the model by crul 1992 this difference may be explained by multiple factors we believe that the higher current catches of the reservoirs in the region are in part due to restocking activities that were accelerated mainly in the 1990s ouedraogo 2010 population growth has contributed to an increase in fishing pressure and together with gear diversification and the optimization of fishing techniques may have driven total harvest levels to increase petr 1994 observed that fish production in africa kept pace with the rise in human population and reported that over a period of 17 years the human population increase of 79 corresponded to a 74 increase in fish production so it is reasonable to assume that the difference in the estimates between the model of this study in 2018 and the previous model of crul 1992 can be attributed to the above factors furthermore increases in the productivity of reservoirs are also related to eutrophication nixon 1995 defined eutrophication as an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem eutrophication tends to affect shallow lake systems more than deeper tropical lakes kemka et al 2006 population growth intensified agriculture including the use of agrochemicals and deforestation are the main drivers of nutrient rich inflows into shallow tropical reservoirs ndebele murisa et al 2010 ntiba et al 2001 our study shows that productivity per unit area greatly decreases as the size of the reservoir increases a reservoir with surface area of 1 km2 is twice more productive per unit area than a 100 km2 reservoir these results corroborate findings by fernando and holčík 1982 that small and shallow african lakes are more productive than larger ones most small reservoirs are constructed mainly for community water storage and livestock watering animal wastes and dung deposition at the edges of the reservoirs are sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus ansari et al 2010 kolding et al 2016b consequently small reservoirs are highly productive baijot et al 1997 found that small reservoirs in burkina faso are richer in mineral concentrations than large artificial lakes but are less stable our findings that there is a decline of fish productivity per unit area as both reservoir surface area and mean depth increase agrees with a study by downing 2010 according to which fish productivity generally declines with increasing lake size depth water chemistry and conductivity have all been used to classify lakes and reservoirs rai and hill 1980 talling and talling 1965 since these parameters appear to be closely related with productivity downing et al 1990 henderson and welcomme 1974 ryder et al 1974 rawson 1938 was the first to suggest that factors affecting lake productivity could be grouped into climatic morphometric and edaphic factors it has been shown that biological production in lake systems is partly controlled by lake morphology nutrients and other environmental factors kolding and van zwieten 2006 kolding and van zwieten 2012 fig 7 a some of these studies suggest that fish productivity per unit area is negatively related with habitat volume area and mean depth since many aquatic processes are less intense and fish is less abundant per unit area in larger water bodies this is attributed to decreased rates of nutrient recycling to the euphotic layer within these lakes downing 2010 fig 7b and c the tilapiine species o niloticus and s galilaeus which are the mainstays of most reservoir fisheries are more productive in the relatively small golinga than in the large tono and bontanga abobi et al 2019 due to the species preferences for shallow waters fao 2009 reservoirs serve multiple community needs and in this light their resources are often subjected to severe competition between irrigation farming and fisheries therefore in estimating reservoir fisheries production the effects of water drawdown caused by irrigation should be considered as intensive use of reservoir waters for farming reduces the size of the aquatic habitat available to fish production according to jul larsen et al 2003 kolding and van zwieten 2011 kolding and van zwieten 2012 kolding et al 2016b and gownaris et al 2017 however there is increasing evidence that inland fish production in africa is more dependent on external climatic drivers such as seasonal variability of water levels than on human exploitation rates or management interventions the relation between seasonal variability of surface water bodies and fish production is consistent with our observations on the three reservoirs in northern ghana where the drawdown of water for irrigation during the dry seasons rather than external climatic drivers significantly reduces reservoir surface area and depth golinga reservoir a small water body with a surface area at full storage of 0 62 km2 experienced 52 and 2 68 m reduction in surface area and water level respectively mainly as a result of intensive withdrawal of water for irrigation during the dry season similar observations on small reservoirs in burkina faso have been made by kolding et al 2016b this phenomenon means that in years of high evaporation and little rainfall these small reservoirs while highly productive under normal conditions may lose a large part if not all of their fish productivity if abstraction for irrigation continues kolding et al 2016b asserts that the impact of water level fluctuations in african lakes and reservoirs is inversely proportional to the size and depth of the system implying that trends in rainfall evaporation and siltation will be crucial to the resilience and productivity of the over 6000 small and shallow reservoirs in the region intra annual variation in total fish catch of reservoirs is also influenced by seasonal changes in livelihood activities for example the lean farming season dry season may lead to a sudden boom in fishing activities at reservoirs where there is open access to the fishery we observed a clear case of a livelihood induced seasonal fishing boom between march and april at golinga reservoir in the northern region of ghana the number of fishers on the reservoir tripled during these two months of lowest water levels the open access allowed the occasional fishers without wooden canoes to practice step in and cast fishing therefore the recorded monthly catches were highest in march and april bontanga and tono on the contrary had the highest catches in may we believe that fish are abundant in the reservoirs during the flood and post flood seasons july december but are mostly harvested when the water level draws down and fish are concentrated in the reservoir increasing their catchability some studies have shown that seasonal fluctuations in water level are associated with enhanced productivity junk et al 1989 kolding 1993 wantzen et al 2008 moreover fluctuations of the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz depend on seasonal water level fluctuations kolding et al 2016b report on increased phosphorous mobilization following wet dry cycles owing to the alteration of physical microbial and chemical processes in the attz among the three reservoirs of this study golinga which is the smallest had the highest intra annual fluctuation in surface area 52 reduction but was the most productive with total catch of 17 2 tonnes km2 year golinga was followed by bontanga which had a 43 reduction in its surface area and fish productivity of 15 8 tonnes km2 year and then by tono with a 33 reduction in its surface area and fish productivity of 10 1 tonnes km2 year these results confirm a finding by kolding et al 2016b which states that the more the water level in the system fluctuates on a regular basis the higher is the average productivity youngs and heimbuch 1982 demonstrated that 97 of the variation in a regression equation was explained by three factors area mean depth and total dissolved solids while a multiple factor model should be applied whenever possible in western africa data to do this presently is unavailable in our second modelling approach model 2 we showed that depth was a significant predictor but that reservoir age was not however we think that this may be due to the low sample size 15 and narrow age difference most are within 10 years in age of the reservoirs used for the study following the observations by mrag 1995 on the effect of sample size on multiple linear regression relationships for reservoirs and lakes fish yield we think that a larger number of reservoirs with a wider age range would show a positive relation this needs to be proven in a follow up study model 2 may be applied whenever the mean depth of the reservoir is known however considering the high coefficient of determination and the low prediction error we recommend that model 1 should be preferred until a larger sample size allows for revisiting and possibly improving model 2 the difference of potential yield estimates between these two models largely depends on the interaction effect of area depth of the individual reservoir being predicted by model 2 the average difference was 57 for the sub data set analysed 4 3 model application limitations and proxies the models of this study are suitable for estimating fish catch from reservoirs of west africa as the fisheries of these reservoirs are mostly unrecorded and undocumented their yield contribution to the total fisheries production of the region can be approximated by our models we can also think of applying our model equations during the reservoir planning process since the expected fish yield as well as the potential water supply for other uses can be calculated for a reservoir of a specific area and depth this could be compared to expected reservoir construction costs providing a sound base for cost benefit analysis this reasoning has been successfully applied in the utilisation of small and medium sized reservoirs in china where fishery aspects were taken into account at the planning stage of reservoir construction de silva 2000 annual changes in fish catches from lakes and reservoirs are common and the factors behind these changes can vary therefore it would be desirable to constantly update the information and data from the water bodies to be considered for the model we recommend either continuous biannual surveys preferably during the peaks of the wet and dry seasons or a full year study every five years future data could comprise changes in the number of fishers boats number of active fishing days introduction withdrawal of fishing gears crafts and water volume similarly the average annual water levels of large reservoirs whose surface areas are monitored by satellites can be obtained for example from the united states department of agriculture and used as proxies for assessing annual variations in the reservoirs sizes and fish catches our two models just like those of youngs and heimbuch 1982 and crul 1992 are based on data of catch and surface area and reservoir depth and do not include fishing effort or other potentially influencing factors following the reasoning of fao 2016b kolding and van zwieten 2011 2012 and mrag 1995 we suggest that further development of catch area relationships into multiple regression models should be done with one or several of the following additional variables chlorophyll a µg l number of fishers number of boats water level fluctuation m volume m3 and discharge m3 s it would be useful to obtain depth data

2016b marshall and maes 1994 and venot et al 2012 in sub saharan africa no accurate estimates of the number exist nor their potential contribution to total inland fisheries capture statistical models mostly linear regressions relating morphometric and edaphic factors to fish yields in temperate lakes and reservoirs were developed in the 1950s and 1960s these showed that fish production in canadian lakes was related to mean depth rawson 1952 to water chemistry moyle 1956 and to physical and chemical indices northcote and larkin 1956 ryder 1965 combined these indices into a morpho edaphic index mei defined as the total dissolved solids divided by the mean depth for which he used 23 temperate lakes in tropical fresh water fisheries the first application of ryder s mei was that of henderson and welcomme 1974 who applied it to a selected number of african inland waters the mei was related to yields from african tropical lakes and reservoirs and from the lake bangweulu system toews and griffith 1979 in a further development of the model a review on mei was made by schlesinger and regier 1982 and subsequently fish yields from reservoirs were related to mei by bernacsek and lopes 1984 and marshall 1984 youngs and heimbuch 1982 were able to show that the surface area of a lake alone is a very powerful predictor of catch marshall 1984 applied their model loge yield in tonnes per year tyr 1 7 01 0 83 loge area km2 for the first time to 17 african lakes and reservoirs later crul 1992 used a data set of 25 reservoirs with catch data spanning from 1954 1984 to update this work and derived the following model catch tyr 1 7 09 area0 94 r2 0 94 ideally these models should be updated periodically to accommodate new information as it becomes available for example studies by bhukaswan 1980 and gubiani et al 2011 showed that the catch obtained from a water body may depend largely on the developmental state of the fishery a significant finding such as this should be reflected in the models however due to limited catch data and limited resources many of the models currently in use are old and in need of updating welcomme 2011 youngs and heimbuch 1982 marshall 1984 and crul 1992 have all shown that of all the factors analysed surface area is the most powerful predictor of total catch in african reservoirs other factors such as primary production melack 1976 oglesby 1977 water level fluctuations and discharge fao 2016b kolding and van zwieten 2011 and total phosphorus levels hanson and leggett 1982 could also be useful predictors of fish yield but unfortunately information on these factors is only available for a very limited number of african inland waters in this paper we make an inventory of reservoirs in the region and analyse their potential harvest in developing our model we consider the following two observations i the current observed total catch of reservoirs is not adequately predicted by the crul 1992 model since 28 of the west african sub region reservoirs have catches that exceed the yields predicted by crul s model by an average of 50 see supplement table s1 ii crul s model was developed using datasets from a broad region africa considering the potential geographic differences in resource productivities highlighted by marten and polovina 1982 welcomme and bartley 1998 and yamada and ruttan 1980 our model in contrast to crul s is limited to datasets from western africa only reservoirs are man made impoundments created mostly as a result of dam construction on rivers they are used for community purposes including drinking water supply e g weija and barekese ghana irrigation farming e g tono ghana bagré burkina faso and hydroelectric power generation e g kainji nigeria manantali and sélingué mali these waterbodies vary greatly in their surface areas and in other morphometric features such as their mean depth water holding capacity and discharge in most west african countries fisheries normally develop as an incidental benefit or an intended livelihood as a result of reservoir construction considering the stagnating trend in marine capture fisheries production in the region the potential contribution of reservoirs and other inland water bodies to capture fisheries production in the region should be explored to provide essential information for national fisheries management strategies additionally the question of how morphometric characteristics of reservoirs in the semi arid region of west africa relate to fisheries productivity needs to be understood the tilapiine species s galilaeus and o niloticus of the family cichlidae are the main fisheries resources in most african lakes and reservoirs fao 2003 we present here known data from a selection of the reservoirs at asejire reservoir nigeria 19 fish species from 16 genera and 13 families were recorded during experimental gill nets fishing the family cichlidae were the most dominant among which tilapia marie was the most common species ipinmoroti et al 2017 in ghana targeted cichlid species represented 89 74 and 71 of the total catch composition landed weight at tono bontanga and golinga reservoirs respectively abobi et al 2019 in côte d ivoire the catch composition of taboo reservoir showed predominance of chrysichthys spp 58 4 and tilapiine fish 35 8 other fish species such as clarias spp 2 5 mormyrids 1 heterotis niloticus 0 8 and schilbe spp 0 7 were represented aliko et al 2014 in the reservoir ayamé côte d ivoire the most abundant families were alestidae 36 61 cichlidae 34 19 and claroteidae 13 43 mamadou et al 2019 and in reservoir buyo côte d ivoire the fish biomass was dominated by cichlidae 32 27 and claroteidae 26 35 in mali the top five most frequently encountered species at i reservoir manantali were lates niloticus 74 6 sarotherodon galilaeus 65 7 oreochromis aureus 61 2 synodontis schall 43 1 and synodontis ocellifer 40 8 and ii reservoir selengue were chrysichthys nigrodigitatus 34 6 auchenoglanis occidentalis 34 1 sarotherodon galilaeus 32 labeo senegalensis 29 4 and synodontis membranaceus 26 4 laë et al 2004 the main objective of this contribution is thus to review the sparse information on total fish catch of west african reservoirs and derive an updated predictive model for fisheries production from the reservoirs following the reasoning of oglesby 1977 and petrere 1996 on the relationship between lake size and fish yields the paper explores the potential differences in productivity between small and large reservoirs and considers further potential predictors for the fish catch such as mean reservoir depth and age 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographic and climatic characteristics of west africa west africa covers an area of approximately 6 million km2 which is about 20 of africa s total land area the region lies between longitudes 18 w and 16 e and latitudes 3 and 28 n and it is bounded in the west and south by the atlantic ocean in the north by the sahara desert and in the east by the central african nations of chad and cameroon the topography of the region is mainly flat with most parts lying less than 300 m above mean sea level although there exist several isolated high points in the coastal areas andam akorful et al 2017 the climate of western africa can be described predominantly as that of a dryland encompassing arid semi arid and dry sub humid regions corresponding to aridity index values of 0 05 0 20 0 20 0 50 and 0 50 0 65 respectively the region is conventionally classified into three sub climatic zones namely i the dry north known as the sahel which lies just below the sahara desert ii the sudano transitional zone and iii the relatively wet guinean zone located in the south meynadier et al 2010 the geographic distribution of wet and dry regions depends on the latitude and the distance from the atlantic ocean while the degree of aridity increases from south to north and to a lesser extent from west to east as reported by menz 2010 temperatures in the lowlands of west africa are high throughout the year with annual means usually above 18 c in the sahel maximum temperatures can reach above 40 c for further details on the region s climate see cilss 2016 2 2 data sources use and collection 2 2 1 data sources for this review two fao databases were used i fishstatj provided data for the analysis of west african inland fisheries production and consumption and ii aquastat provided data on the reservoirs physical features in addition published articles and reports containing information on specific reservoir s physical features fisheries production and catch statistics were used table 1 the aquastat data were checked for consistency by comparing them with published literature 2 2 2 data use and collection first data from the aquastat database fao 2016a and other sources see supplement tables s2 and s3 were used to estimate the number of reservoirs and their total surface area in west africa second data on water level fluctuations surface area fluctuations and fish catches from three reservoirs in ghana namely tono bontanga and golinga were obtained from july 2016 to june 2017 through field data collection the water level was recorded monthly from fixed graduated poles at the three reservoirs using a garmin gps the area of the three reservoirs was measured in august 2016 peak of flood season and in april 2017 peak of dry season total fish landings were recorded for five consecutive days staring from monday to friday at tono and from tuesday to saturday at bontanga and golinga in each month and extrapolated to the monthly catch using an estimate of the average number of fishing days per month respective information was obtained from the fishers at the three reservoirs 2 3 catch surface area age and mean depth data from selected west african reservoirs from seven west african countries 30 small to large reservoirs were analysed for correlation between catch and surface area fig 2 and table 1 all the reservoirs were included in a single predictor regression then for a subset of 15 reservoirs that had additional information on age and mean depth a multiple regression analysis was conducted 2 4 modelling approaches used approach 1 simple catch area regression a simple catch area regression was first constructed for all 30 reservoirs with double logarithmic transformation 1 1 l n catch a b l n area where fish catch is in tonnes per year and reservoir area is in square kilometres the resulting single regression line was then tested for an inflection point using a technique described by somerton 1980 to check if small and large reservoirs differed in terms of their catch area relationship the data were repeatedly divided into two groups and regressions were calculated for each group the residual sum of squares of both lines was then summed and the calculation was repeated with another pair of regression lines until the residual sum of squares approached a minimum an inflection point exists if the pooled residual sum of squares of a pair of the resulting regression lines is significantly lower than the residual sum of squares of a single line the dataset was then fitted using the dummy variable regression dvr method which is an analysis of covariance ancova for comparison of two regression lines fox 1997 our dvr model consisted of ln area as a quantitative explanatory variable or the covariate size i e the reservoir group with two levels a above 2 km2 and b below 2 km2 as the dummy variable or factor and the interaction between the dummy variable and the covariate the resulting equation was 2 l n catch l n area size size l n area approach 2 multiple linear regressions using a subset of the data 15 reservoirs that had information available on both age and mean depth multiple linear regression relationships were fitted to test for the effect of the two additional variables i e age and mean depth in explaining the catch variations of the datasets a three way combination of the main effects led to an increase of variance due to the small sample size the multiple regression relationships were preceded by a simple catch area regression fitted for the 15 reservoirs followed by multiple regression using both mean depth in meters 3 and reservoir age in years 4 3 a l n catch a b l n area l n mean depth 4 b l n catch a b l n area l n age as it is widely known that using allometric equations to predict unknown values of y produces a logarithmic transformation bias smith 1993 the predicted fish yield values in log scale were back transformed with a correction factor 5 for natural logarithms provided by sprugel 1983 as 5 cf exp s e e 2 2 the term see is the residual standard error estimate of the regression equation the models were checked to see if the errors were independent normally distributed in each group and had a constant variance in each group homoscedastic these assumptions were assessed by interpreting the residual plot and the histogram of residuals then residuals of the models were tested to see if they were normally distributed using both the anderson darling and cramer von mises normality tests both tests revealed no evidence against normality p 0 08 and p 0 08 for model 1 and p 0 60 and p 0 58 for model 2 for the anderson darling and cramer von mises normality tests respectively the assumptions of linear models were adequately met for the data supplementary material a and b all data analyses were conducted using r 3 5 0 software r core 2018 3 results assessment of the number of reservoirs in western africa and their overall surface we estimate that there are about 6894 reservoirs in west africa with combined surface area of 27 504 km2 see supplement table s3 most of them have been reported as small reservoirs with surface areas within the range of 1 1000 ha 10km2 burkina faso appears to be the country with the highest number of small reservoirs fig 3 supplement table s1 the two largest reservoirs in the sub region with surface areas above 1000 km2 at upper storage level are the volta 8482 km2 and kainji lakes 1270 km2 however the fao aquastat database is not exhaustive it has only 420 reservoirs registered in the sub region and it has no records of small reservoirs with surface area below 10 ha 0 1 km2 the three focus reservoirs of northern ghana used in this study namely tono bontanga and golinga were seen to have significant intra annual change in their surface area and water levels table 2 the smallest reservoir golinga lost more than 50 of its surface area during the dry season monthly water levels of the reservoirs were inversely correlated with total catches with correlation coefficient r giving values of 0 70 0 93 and 0 56 for tono bontanga and golinga reservoirs respectively appendix a 3 1 catch area relationship of west african reservoirs using segmented regression as applied by somerton 1980 we found an inflection in reservoir size at 2 km2 however analysis of covariance showed that the resulting two groups a and b for reservoirs with surface areas above and below 2 km2 respectively see appendix b had no significant difference in their slopes with f 0 5895 d f 26 3 and p 0 45 for more detail see supplementary material c thus the catch area relationship was modelled with a single equation for all the reservoirs the resulting model was model 1 catch tonnes year area km2 catch 17 3 95 ci 13 23 are a 0 8626 95 ci 0 7915 0 9336 n 30 r 2 0 957 p 1 3 e 20 mean

explains 95 7 of the variation of observed catches the expected fish catch of a reservoir with a known area can be observed from fig 4 3 2 fish productivity and yield predictions using a range of reservoir surface area values we compared the fish productivity predicted tonnes km2 year by the model of this study to that of crul s model the model of this study predicted on average more than twice what crul s model predicts fig 5 supplement table s4 a t test on the data showed that the mean of the productivity estimates of crul s 6 2 tonnes km2 year and this study s 16 3 tonnes km2 year see supplement table s4 are significantly different t 5 7252 df 38 p value 0 00000136 see supplement material d analysis of the sub dataset i e the 15 reservoirs where additional information was

with area age and mean depth data of 15 reservoirs while a multiple linear regression of catch against area km2 age year and mean depth m of the 15 reservoirs did not produce a reliable model catch

assessment of reservoirs in west africa it has been widely reported that there are several thousand reservoirs in sub saharan africa kolding et al 2016b marshall and maes 1994 venot et al 2012 our study estimated a total of 6894 reservoirs covering approximately 27 504 km2 of area in the west african sub region we estimated that the reservoirs of the region combined contribute 11 6806 3 tonnes 95 ci 42 435 1 320 883 8 tonnes per annum to the inland capture fisheries of the region which represented 12 4 of the region s total inland fish catch 940 767 tonnes annum on average as reported by the fao 2008 2015 our results were comparable to estimates by petr 1994 who reported that in africa reservoir fisheries contribute about 15 000 tonnes 10 to the overall inland fishery of the continent our model and that of crul 1992 were both developed with datasets of man made lakes only and are thus comparable 4 2 models and harvest potential estimate in our study we followed the modelling approach of youngs and heimbuch 1982 which regresses the logarithm of fish catch against the logarithm of reservoir surface area our model accounts for 95 7 of the observed variation in catches of the reservoirs however our potential yield estimates greatly exceed those of the model by crul 1992 this difference may be explained by multiple factors we believe that the higher current catches of the reservoirs in the region are in part due to restocking activities that were accelerated mainly in the 1990s ouedraogo 2010 population growth has contributed to an increase in fishing pressure and together with gear diversification and the optimization of fishing techniques may have driven total harvest levels to increase petr 1994 observed that fish production in africa kept pace with the rise in human population and reported that over a period of 17 years the human population increase of 79 corresponded to a 74 increase in fish production so it is reasonable to assume that the difference in the estimates between the model of this study in 2018 and the previous model of crul 1992 can be attributed to the above factors furthermore increases in the productivity of reservoirs are also related to eutrophication nixon 1995 defined eutrophication as an increase in the rate of supply of organic matter to an ecosystem eutrophication tends to affect shallow lake systems more than deeper tropical lakes kemka et al 2006 population growth intensified agriculture including the use of agrochemicals and deforestation are the main drivers of nutrient rich inflows into shallow tropical reservoirs ndebele murisa et al 2010 ntiba et al 2001 our study shows that productivity per unit area greatly decreases as the size of the reservoir increases a reservoir with surface area of 1 km2 is twice more productive per unit area than a 100 km2 reservoir these results corroborate findings by fernando and holčík 1982 that small and shallow african lakes are more productive than larger ones most small reservoirs are constructed mainly for community water storage and livestock watering animal wastes and dung deposition at the edges of the reservoirs are sources of both nitrogen and phosphorus ansari et al 2010 kolding et al 2016b consequently small reservoirs are highly productive baijot et al 1997 found that small reservoirs in burkina faso are richer in mineral concentrations than large artificial lakes but are less stable our findings that there is a decline of fish productivity per unit area as both reservoir surface area and mean depth increase agrees with a study by downing 2010 according to which fish productivity generally declines with increasing lake size depth water chemistry and conductivity have all been used to classify lakes and reservoirs rai and hill 1980 talling and talling 1965 since these parameters appear to be closely related with productivity downing et al 1990 henderson and welcomme 1974 ryder et al 1974 rawson 1938 was the first to suggest that factors affecting lake productivity could be grouped into climatic morphometric and edaphic factors it has been shown that biological production in lake systems is partly controlled by lake morphology nutrients and other environmental factors kolding and van zwieten 2006 kolding and van zwieten 2012 fig 7 a some of these studies suggest that fish productivity per unit area is negatively related with habitat volume area and mean depth since many aquatic processes are less intense and fish is less abundant per unit area in larger water bodies this is attributed to decreased rates of nutrient recycling to the euphotic layer within these lakes downing 2010 fig 7b and c the tilapiine species o niloticus and s galilaeus which are the mainstays of most reservoir fisheries are more productive in the relatively small golinga than in the large tono and bontanga abobi et al 2019 due to the species preferences for shallow waters fao 2009 reservoirs serve multiple community needs and in this light their resources are often subjected to severe competition between irrigation farming and fisheries therefore in estimating reservoir fisheries production the effects of water drawdown caused by irrigation should be considered as intensive use of reservoir waters for farming reduces the size of the aquatic habitat available to fish production according to jul larsen et al 2003 kolding and van zwieten 2011 kolding and van zwieten 2012 kolding et al 2016b and gownaris et al 2017 however there is increasing evidence that inland fish production in africa is more dependent on external climatic drivers such as seasonal variability of water levels than on human exploitation rates or management interventions the relation between seasonal variability of surface water bodies and fish production is consistent with our observations on the three reservoirs in northern ghana where the drawdown of water for irrigation during the dry seasons rather than external climatic drivers significantly reduces reservoir surface area and depth golinga reservoir a small water body with a surface area at full storage of 0 62 km2 experienced 52 and 2 68 m reduction in surface area and water level respectively mainly as a result of intensive withdrawal of water for irrigation during the dry season similar observations on small reservoirs in burkina faso have been made by kolding et al 2016b this phenomenon means that in years of high evaporation and little rainfall these small reservoirs while highly productive under normal conditions may lose a large part if not all of their fish productivity if abstraction for irrigation continues kolding et al 2016b asserts that the impact of water level fluctuations in african lakes and reservoirs is inversely proportional to the size and depth of the system implying that trends in rainfall evaporation and siltation will be crucial to the resilience and productivity of the over 6000 small and shallow reservoirs in the region intra annual variation in total fish catch of reservoirs is also influenced by seasonal changes in livelihood activities for example the lean farming season dry season may lead to a sudden boom in fishing activities at reservoirs where there is open access to the fishery we observed a clear case of a livelihood induced seasonal fishing boom between march and april at golinga reservoir in the northern region of ghana the number of fishers on the reservoir tripled during these two months of lowest water levels the open access allowed the occasional fishers without wooden canoes to practice step in and cast fishing therefore the recorded monthly catches were highest in march and april bontanga and tono on the contrary had the highest catches in may we believe that fish are abundant in the reservoirs during the flood and post flood seasons july december but are mostly harvested when the water level draws down and fish are concentrated in the reservoir increasing their catchability some studies have shown that seasonal fluctuations in water level are associated with enhanced productivity junk et al 1989 kolding 1993 wantzen et al 2008 moreover fluctuations of the aquatic terrestrial transition zone attz depend on seasonal water level fluctuations kolding et al 2016b report on increased phosphorous mobilization following wet dry cycles owing to the alteration of physical microbial and chemical processes in the attz among the three reservoirs of this study golinga which is the smallest had the highest intra annual fluctuation in surface area 52 reduction but was the most productive with total catch of 17 2 tonnes km2 year golinga was followed by bontanga which had a 43 reduction in its surface area and fish productivity of 15 8 tonnes km2 year and then by tono with a 33 reduction in its surface area and fish productivity of 10 1 tonnes km2 year these results confirm a finding by kolding et al 2016b which states that the more the water level in the system fluctuates on a regular basis the higher is the average productivity youngs and heimbuch 1982 demonstrated that 97 of the variation in a regression equation was explained by three factors area mean depth and total dissolved solids while a multiple factor model should be applied whenever possible in western africa data to do this presently is unavailable in our second modelling approach model 2 we showed that depth was a significant predictor but that reservoir age was not however we think that this may be due to the low sample size 15 and narrow age difference most are within 10 years in age of the reservoirs used for the study following the observations by mrag 1995 on the effect of sample size on multiple linear regression relationships for reservoirs and lakes fish yield we think that a larger number of reservoirs with a wider age range would show a positive relation this needs to be proven in a follow up study model 2 may be applied whenever the mean depth of the reservoir is known however considering the high coefficient of determination and the low prediction error we recommend that model 1 should be preferred until a larger sample size allows for revisiting and possibly improving model 2 the difference of potential yield estimates between these two models largely depends on the interaction effect of area depth of the individual reservoir being predicted by model 2 the average difference was 57 for the sub data set analysed 4 3 model application limitations and proxies the models of this study are suitable for estimating fish catch from reservoirs of west africa as the fisheries of these reservoirs are mostly unrecorded and undocumented their yield contribution to the total fisheries production of the region can be approximated by our models we can also think of applying our model equations during the reservoir planning process since the expected fish yield as well as the potential water supply for other uses can be calculated for a reservoir of a specific area and depth this could be compared to expected reservoir construction costs providing a sound base for cost benefit analysis this reasoning has been successfully applied in the utilisation of small and medium sized reservoirs in china where fishery aspects were taken into account at the planning stage of reservoir construction de silva 2000 annual changes in fish catches from lakes and reservoirs are common and the factors behind these changes can vary therefore it would be desirable to constantly update the information and data from the water bodies to be considered for the model we recommend either continuous biannual surveys preferably during the peaks of the wet and dry seasons or a full year study every five years future data could comprise changes in the number of fishers boats number of active fishing days introduction withdrawal of fishing gears crafts and water volume similarly the average annual water levels of large reservoirs whose surface areas are monitored by satellites can be obtained for example from the united states department of agriculture and used as proxies for assessing annual variations in the reservoirs sizes and fish catches our two models just like those of youngs and heimbuch 1982 and crul 1992 are based on data of catch and surface area and reservoir depth and do not include fishing effort or other potentially influencing factors following the reasoning of fao 2016b kolding and van zwieten 2011 2012 and mrag 1995 we suggest that further development of catch area relationships into multiple regression models should be done with one or several of the following additional variables chlorophyll a µg l number of fishers number of boats water level fluctuation m volume m3 and discharge m3 s it would be useful to obtain depth data on more reservoirs for further progress on empirical models to predict fish yields of west african reservoirs conflict of interest there is no competing interest to declare ethical statement authors

1071,alpine wetland ecosystems play significant roles in water regulation and regional ecological safety on the qinghai tibet plateau due to large water conservation potential the knowledge of evapotranspiration et in various alpine wetland ecosystems is of great significance for understanding the water balance of wetland ecosystems and carrying out eco environment conservation therefore two alpine wetland ecosystems as lakeside and headwater of qinghai lake basin were selected and their et characteristics and influencing factors were researched over two years the daily et in the lakeside ecosystem showed double peak curve and the headwater ecosystem showed the multiple peak et curve the monthly ets in two respective wetlands ranged from 9 88 to 111 56 mm and from 0 23 to 75 5 mm respectively the annual et in the lakeside ecosystem was averagely 1 89 times more than that of the headwater stepwise multiple linear regressions indicated that monthly average net radiation rn and leaf area index lai explained 96 variance in monthly et in the lakeside ecosystem r n and monthly average wind speed ws explained 94 variance in monthly et in the headwater ecosystem these results indicated that the et is variable in two alpine wetland ecosystems and rn was their primary driving factor on monthly scale keywords evapotranspiration variation alpine wetland ecosystem qinghai lake

et and pan evaporation on the plateau zhang et al 2007 chen et al 2006 xie et al 2010 these studies provided important theories and data for accurately estimating et and water use at regional scale on the qtp the et is mainly influenced by climatic conditions vegetation growth and soil moisture steduto and hsiao 1998b burba and verma 2005 lei and yang 2010 so the et shows strong spatial and temporal variabilities on the qtp gu et al 2008 hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 wetlands on the qtp account for 20 of total wetland areas in china zhao et al 2015 they play significant roles in eco environment protection and regional safety due to large water conservation however specific characteristics of the et in different wetland ecosystems remain unexplained these unknown features include variations of et in kobresia wetland ecosystems along different elevation gradients and their environmental explanatory factors moreover it is critical to study characteristics of the et in different wetland ecosystems and its roles in hydrological cycle in order to get insight for water conservation and optimization of water resources management on the qtp qinghai lake is the largest lake in china an et al 2012 and lies in the northeastern of qtp fig 1 it is an international important wetland and a national nature reserve which supports the ecological security of the northeastern qtp tang et al 1992 qinghai lake basin is strongly influenced by the asian summer monsoon and the westerlies thus it is a climatically sensitive and fragile area chen et al 2016 due to climate change and human activities the hydrological processes in qinghai lake basin have been shifted so seriously that they caused many environmental problems such as change in lake level and area desertification and deterioration of water quality and quantity li et al 2007 2009 cui et al 2015a 2017 although there are some scholars who have reported some studies on runoff cui et al 2015a precipitation xu et al 2007 cui et al 2015b potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2013 li et al 2015 and water evaporation in qinghai lake shi et al 2010 there are few studies on actual et in alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin therefore to study characteristics of actual et in different alpine wetland ecosystems and its influencing factors are crucial for understanding of water uses and water cycle processes of alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin the aims of this study are to 1 compare actual et in two typical alpine wetland ecosystems which are located at the lakeside ls and headwater hw of qinghai lake basin and to 2 reveal how the micro environmental and vegetative conditions influence the et in these two alpine wetland ecosystems the study will help us to understand of the water use of alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the qinghai lake basin located at the intersection of arid zone of northwest china the high cold zone of the qtp and the eastern monsoon zone the qinghai lake 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 47 e 3194 m asl is located at the lowest southeast of the qinghai lake basin fig 1 with a surface area of roughly 4500 km2 ao et al 2014 and a water volume of 71 6 109 m3 its climate belongs to the plateau continental the annual mean temperature is 0 1 c and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm with more than 65 falling between june and september an et al 2012 the larger tributaries include buha river shaliu river haergai river heima river and quanji river the vegetation mainly includes temperate steppe alpine grassland meadow swamp shrub and valley shrub etc the field experiments were conducted in an open and flat lakeside wetland ecosystem 36 42 n 100 46 e 3228 m asl and a headwater wetland ecosystem 37 44 n 100 05 e 3753 m asl the lakeside wetland ls which belongs to xiaobo lake wetland is about 3 km away from the east shore of the qinghai lake fig 1 the headwater wetland hw is located in wayan mountain in the north of qinghai lake and belongs to headwater area of shaliu river fig 1 shaliu river is the second largest river flowing into the qinghai lake both ls and hw are seasonal wetlands which belong to wet meadow or swamp ecosystems ground surface of wetlands have usually moisture in the vegetative growth periods due to the climate characteristics of the same hot and rainy seasons to the contrary they become dry meadows in the non growing periods due to lower precipitation the main vegetative growing period in the ls occurs from may to september the time in the hw shortens about one month due to higher altitude the vegetation in the ls is composed of kobresia tibetica and blysmus sinocompressus the constructive species is the k tibetica in the hw the vegetation includes kobresia humilis potentilla anserina l gentianopsis paludosa etc the constructive and dominant species is k humilis soil is mainly composed of swamp soil and meadow soil there are distributed seasonal permafrost at the surface and permanent permafrost in the deeper layers in both ls and hw 2 2 data collection an observation tower was built at a fixed sample plot in the ls and hw respectively an open path eddy covariance system li 7500a li cor inc usa was installed at the height of 2 83 m of the observing tower in the ls a closed path eddy covariance system li 7200 li cor inc usa was installed at the height of 2 98 m of the observing tower in the hw both open path and closed path covariance systems were connected by an analyzer interface unit of li 7550 the sampling frequency was 10 hz in both open and closed covariance systems data were collected with the average of 30 min interval and saved in ghg format in an industrial u disk a set of scientific automatic weather station instruments dynamet dynamax usa was installed close to the eddy covariance system in the ls for observing and recording the meteorological factors the corresponding meteorological factors including total solar radiation sr incident photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature t a air relative humanity rh wind speed and direction soil temperature t s and total precipitation p were also measured in the hw soil volumetric water content svw temperature and conductivity ec in different depths were measured by an ech2o system 5te decagon usa with the automatic datalogger em50 decagon usa since may 2015 the depths were 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm in the ls the depths were 5 10 30 40 and 50 cm in the hw respectively all data on meteorological and environmental factors were recorded at 30 minute mean intervals keeping synchronously with eddy covariance systems in time the raw data selected for analyses in this study were collected in 2015 and 2016 two daily vegetation indices including leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi were extracted from one modis pixel that was centered on the targeted eddy covariance tower from january to december in 2015 modis land products mod15a2 and mod13q1 containing lai and evi data were downloaded from satellite data products of the nasa s earth observation system eos https ladsweb nascom nasa gov respectively their spatial resolution ratios are 1 0 km and 250 m their temporal resolution ratios are 8 days and 16 days respectively the abnormal lai and evi data due to continual rain was linearly interpolated or replaced by the average between adjacent data the monthly mean values of lai and evi was calculated by averaged the discrete data on the every whole month 2 3 data processing and analyzing the raw flux data gathered by eddy covariance system were processed by eddypro 6 0 software li cor biosciences usa to calculate ecosystem co2 water vapor sensible heat and latent heat fluxes this software was applied the following data preprocessing and corrections wind speed measurement offsets nakai and shimoyama 2012 time lags compensation compensation of density fluctuations webb et al 1980 quality check mauder and foken 2006 footprint estimation kljun et al 2004 spike removal vickers and mahrt 1997 spectral analysis and corrections vickers and mahrt 1997 mauder and foken 2006 moncrieff et al 1997 2004 fratini et al 2012 etc due to the instrument heat components from li 7500a co2 and water vapor fluxes measured by open eddy covariance system were influenced by the surface instrument heat especially when air temperature was low burba et al 2008 ji et al 2013 the effects were more obvious when the air temperature on the alpine wetland system in the qinghai lake was less than 10 c therefore we corrected the heat effect of the instrument itself on the above corresponding flux data using the eddypro 6 0 software in the ls we also observed some other abnormal and missing fluxes data on both alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems during data processing these were caused by instrument failure extreme weather condition degree of atmospheric stability and power supply failure data deletion and interpolation became necessary in such cases data deleted included data in the process of precipitation obvious abnormal data corresponding data on friction velocity that was less than 0 15 m s zhang et al 2008 and 0 1 m s zhao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 at night in the ls and hw respectively and the data fluxes that were three times more than standard deviation at five continuous plots we interpolated the water vapor and heat fluxes data using the multiple methods to obtain the continuous and complete data when the time intervals of missing flux data were less than 2 h we interpolated water vapor and heat fluxes data using the following two methods firstly the missing flux data were interpolated by the average value between adjacent data when the missing intervals were less than 1 h secondly the missing flux data were interpolated by linear interpolation method when the missing intervals were less than 2 h when the missing intervals were more than 2 h the water vapor and heat fluxes were interpolated by linear or nonlinear regression equations between water vapor heat fluxes and environmental factors under similar meteorological conditions barr et al 2006 amiro et al 2006 eichelmann et al 2016 the missing meteorological data were interpolated by the average with similar meteorological conditions the linear or nonlinear relationships with other meteorological elements in statistical analyses correlations of monthly et with every influencing factors were conducted using the statistical methods including linear exponential and multiple linear regressions and stepwise multiple linear regression as well as polynomial curve fitting etc to identify factors of variations of monthly et driven by biotic and abiotic differences between ls and hw we examined the correlations between δet etls ethw and biotic and abiotic variables ls hw all statistical analyses were completed by excel 2013 origin 9 1 and spss 16 0 softwares 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in micrometeorological conditions the daily average solar radiation sr of the ls and hw showed synchronous and multimodal changes as well as had no significant difference with the average values of 211 03 and 217 91 w m2 in two studying years respectively the daily sr greatly fluctuated in rainy and growing periods with the daily sr of the hw slightly higher than that in the ls fig 2 a the daily average t a in the ls was generally higher than that of the hw fig 2b and showed single peak curves in both ls and hw on the whole year the annual average t a value in the ls and hw in two studying years was 3 02 and 2 87 c respectively the difference in ta between ls and hw was 5 88 c the precipitation p in both places mainly occurred during the growing seasons the p from june to august in the ls was obviously lower than that of the hw fig 2c the annual p in the ls and hw in 2015 and 2016 were 304 3 and 420 9 mm 2015 364 and 587 5 mm 2016 respectively the daily rh in the ls and hw synchronously increased from april to september and then decreased from october and march in the next year fig 2d the annual average rh in the ls and hw in two studying years were 55 4 and 57 88 except for january february and december the daily average vapor pressure deficit vpd in the ls was higher than that of the hw fig 2e the annual average vpd values in the ls and hw were 0 4 and 0 25 kpa 2015 0 42 and 0 26 kpa 2016 respectively the daily average vpd was higher in the ls than that of the hw but they were similar to variation fig 2e the daily ws in the ls and hw synchronously varied fig 2f the daily ws in the ls from january to march was higher than that of the hw but was similar in other months fig 2f 3 2 variations of daily and monthly et daily et of the ls and hw in two studying years showed double peak or multiple peak curves the daily et in the ls was generally higher than that in the hw fig 3 the daily et in the ls and hw varied from 0 13 to 4 73 mm d and from 0 0 to 3 93 mm d with the mean of 1 77 and 0 94 mm d respectively the daily et was higher in the growing periods than that in the non growing periods and the fluctuation was also larger tables 1 2 the daily et in the ls in growing periods varied from 0 28 to 4 73 mm d with the mean of 2 49 mm the corresponding range in the non growing periods was from 0 13 to 2 83 mm d with the mean of 0 87 mm d table 1 for the hw the ranges in growing and non growing periods were from 0 04 to 3 93 mm d 0 to 2 83 mm d the mean was 1 77 and 0 44 mm d respectively table 2 according to statistics table 3 the daily mean et in alpine meadow ecosystem on the qtp varied from 0 85 to 1 74 mm d with the values in this study being within the range the daily mean et decreased with increasing altitude but significant statistical analysis could not be performed due to the limited data the daily average ets in the ls were higher than those in the hw in the growing and non growing periods as well as whole year annual maximum of daily et in the ls also was higher than that in the latter with the value of 4 73 and 3 93 mm respectively this suggests that daily et in the hw is lower than that in the ls coners et al 2016 reported that daily et in moist grassland ecosystem at an elevation around 4500 m on the qtp were 4 6 mm d in moist summer periods and 2 mm d in dry periods the maximum et at a grassland dominated by stipa carex and kobresia at 4330 m near damxung on the northeastern tibetan plateau were up to 5 mm d hu et al 2008 the average et rates were 1 9 2 2 mm d for the growing period in an ungrazed k humilis k pygmaea grassland at 3250 m elevation on the northern tibetan plateau gu et al 2008 these results showed that our results were in the reasonable range but the maximum of daily et in the hw and ls were lower than that of the grassland above 4000 m asl on monthly scale the et variations showed one peak at both sites with the maximum et occurring in june or july the minimum et was in january or december the monthly et in the ls and hw ranged from 9 88 to 111 56 mm month and from 0 23 to 75 5 mm month respectively the monthly et in both ls and hw in 2015 was higher than that in 2016 fig 4 compared the monthly et between ls and hw the former was higher than that of the latter the annual ets in the ls and hw were 633 3 362 1 mm year 2015 and 657 2 and 324 96 mm year 2016 with the former being 1 75 and 2 02 times higher than that of the latter respectively the annual et in the ls was higher than that of kobresia pygmaea meadow 493 2 mm potentilla fruticosa shrub 507 9 mm and achnatherum splendens steppe 413 7 mm year in the qinghai lake watershed zhang et al 2016 but was ranged from 451 59 to 681 28 mm year in the alpine meadow ecosystem of haibei zuo et al 2016 near the qinghai lake for the hw the annual et was lower but near to a meadow ecosystem 341 426 mm year in haibei gu et al 2008 these results indicated that the annual et in this study was similar with that in the alpine meadow of haibei more than 80 et of meadows on the qtp occurred from may to september gu et al 2008 li et al 2013 the et from may to september occupied by 86 of annual et in alpine riparian myricaria squamosa shrub on the qtp zhang et al 2014 in this study the et in the ls and hw from may to september in studying periods averagely occupied by 67 and 78 of annual et respectively with the highest et in june or july the percentage of et from may to september in qinghai lake basin was slightly lower than that of the previous studies according to the results of the et of alpine meadow ecosystems in the qtp table 3 if neglected the difference in vegetation composition and micro environmental conditions only the differences in et caused by altitude were considered then annual et significantly decreased with increasing altitude r2 0 28 p 0 05 fig 5 the annual et reduced by 124 1 mm with an elevation of 1000 m these results indicated that variations of monthly and annual et in the alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin not only followed the general laws in the alpine meadow ecosystem of the qtp but also showed regional characteristics the annual total et in the ls exceeded local precipitation by approximately 108 2015 and 81 2016 with ratios of et p in the growing periods of 1 87 and 1 43 the ratios in the non growing periods of 3 46 and 4 93 respectively table 4 these results indicated that the et in the ls was higher than p and the water was deficient the ecological water consumption was mainly used for ecosystem primary production and soil evaporation for the hw the et was about 14 2015 and 45 2016 less than annual precipitation with the ratios of et p in the growing periods of 0 69 and 0 41 the ratios in the non growing periods of 1 54 and 1 52 respectively table 5 these suggested that the et in the growing periods was lower than p but it was versus in the non growing periods the water in the hw in the growing periods was surplus but deficit in the non growing periods the ratios of et p on the whole year were 0 86 2015 and 0 55 2016 table 5 indicating that the et in the hw was lower than p and the water had a surplus on the annual scale which indicates that this wetland has a water conversation function in the catchment zhang et al 2016 also reported that annual et in the achnatherum splendens steppe was 26 more than annual precipitation and annual et in the kobresia meadow and potentilla fruticosa shrub was 16 and 3 less than the local annual precipitation in qinghai lake basin li et al 2013 determined that the ratio of annual et to precipitation at another kobresia meadow located in the northeast of qinghai tibetan plateau was about 60 the ratio of et p in the alpine meadow ecosystem in haibei was within 0 9 1 11 with the mean of 1 07 zuo et al 2016 the average et p value in alpine swamp meadow of haibei was 1 39 hu et al 2009 in the ls and hw of qinghai lake basin the daily precipitation ranged from 0 25 to 22 86 mm d and from 0 25 to 34 29 mm d respectively but about 36 and 31 precipitation was less than 1 mm d as well as 76 and 71 precipitation was less than 5 mm d in the ls and hw in studying periods respectively which could not form surface runoff therefore if neglecting surface runoff and soil water infiltration due to smaller p and relatively flat observing plots as well as soil water recharged from groundwater ecosystem water budget could be calculated by subtracting et from p zuo et al 2016 the results indicated that the difference in water budget between the ls and hw from may to september was more significant than that in cold season fig 6 water was deficit in the ls during the growth season leading to the wetland surface soil drying out and groundwater level declining but was surplus in the hw from june to september fig 6 these results also demonstrated that the hw lying in higher elevation and headwater region had water conservation function in the growing period while the ls around the qinghai lake was only consuming water for ecosystem primary production and soil evaporation therefore to play respective ecological water use functions in the two alpine wetland ecosystems the different strategies of preservation and utilization should be considered as revealed from the results of this study specifically the management options should aim at increasing the ecosystem net primary productivity and exert its material production function as much as possible in the ls this can be done by means of fence enclosure resting or forbidding grazing in growing season and rotational grazing in non growth season the hw in turn should be mainly fenced to restore surface vegetation while the number of livestock should be controlled in order to maintain the water conservation function of this ecosystem 3 3 correlations of micro environmental and vegetative factors with monthly et integrating the data in two studying years the monthly et in both ls and hw showed different correlations with every environmental and vegetative variables fig 7 fig 8 the monthly et in the ls showed significantly positive power relationships with monthly average sr r2 0 8 p 0 0001 fig 7a and svw in 0 5 cm soil r2 0 59 p 0 0001 fig 7i exponential correlations with monthly average r n r2

11e in the form of quadratic polynomial function as well as linear relation to δlai r2 0 23 p 0 05 fig 11j however the relationships between δet with other variables were not significant fig 11a d h i k according to correlation coefficients rn was the primary driving factor of et in ls and hw of qinghai lake on the monthly scale which rn explained more than 90 variance in monthly et in both ls and hw ta ts and evi were key factors driving monthly et in both ls and hw ta ts and evi explained at least 80 variance in monthly et in the ls and hw respectively vpd and svw were more important for monthly et in the ls and hw which vpd and svw explained at least 80 variance in monthly et respectively net radiation a net energy obtained on the surface of the earth is closely related to the state of the vegetation on the surface and represents available energy in ecosystems which plays a key role in the interaction of the ground gas system temperature can represent the amount of solar energy suggesting that solar radiation energy or available energy critically controlled variations of monthly et in the alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin wang et al 2018 also reported that rn played an important role in et in the eastern and northwest section of the qtp the daily et fluctuations in three alpine ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed were primarily controlled by radiation especially during the growing season zhang et al 2016 temperature directly influences the vegetative development and growth and also restricts transpiration meanwhile the moisture movement underlying surface accelerates and the rate of et increases with the increase of air temperature near the ground previous results also reported that solar radiation and temperature mainly influenced the et at high altitudes and under cold climates in alpine ecosystems gu et al 2005 zha et al 2013 vegetation growth and coverage can change the evaporation and transpiration process the evi comprehensively expresses leaf area index and characteristics of vegetation phenology and can truly reflect the vegetative coverage degree and growth status ma et al 2014 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the evi influences the et through controlling ratios between evaporation and transpiration in solar radiation zhang et al 2003 in this study the effect degree of the evi on the monthly et between ls and hw was similar it could be because the values of evis in both ls and hw were relatively near and low the annual mean lai in the ls and hw was 0 3 and 0 42 and the evi was 0 17 and 0 21 respectively both ta and vpd in the ls were higher than these of the hw relatively higher air temperature increased vpd depending on temperature higher vpd successively aggregates the drying degree of the atmosphere and enhances atmospheric water demand which causing the et increased therefore the vpd played a more significant role in monthly et in the ls than that in the hw previous studies also demonstrated that vpd was positively correlated with et goyal 2004 lawrence et al 2007 wieser et al 2008 bergh et al 2013 peng et al 2015 also reported that climate warming stimulated ecosystem water movement increasing et in which increased vpd and extended growing season could explain the et the higher vegetation greatly prevented evaporation in surface soil in the ls on the contrary the lower vegetative height in the hw caused that surface soil prone to be exposed on sunlight which enhanced soil evaporation and caused water deficit in the surface soil especially during the growing season characterized by such physical stress as intensively raining and hot temperatures so increasing et during the growing season resulted in surface soil layer drying the correlation coefficient indicated that the influence of svw on the monthly et in the hw was more significant than that of the ls coners et al 2016 reported that soil moisture and precipitation were identified as main determinants of et in a high elevation pasture the surface soil moisture content was an important factor controlling et in other alpine ecosystems on the qtp yao et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 meanwhile wang et al 2018 reported that there was a strong correlation between et and water supply over most regions of the qtp the daily et fluctuations in three alpine ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed was also controlled by soil water content where or when precipitation was low zhang et al 2016 previous results also showed that et was greatly influenced by soil water storage when the soil water content was below a threshold value burba et al 2005 lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2013 the et variation between ls and hw corresponded to rn ta p rh vpd and lai variations on monthly scale fig 11 the larger δrn δrh and δvpd increased et in hw the larger δta δp and δlai increased et in ls on monthly scale δrn explained 62 variance in δet δrh and δvpd explained approximately 50 variance in δet respectively δta δp and δlai explained about 23 33 variance in δet respectively this indicated that differences of monthly et in ls and hw were mainly caused by diversity of available energy and atmospheric moisture available energy determined the ta level and then indirectly influenced vpd while p influenced the rh level thus the available energy and precipitation were key abiotic factors driving the difference in et between ls and hw on monthly scale the lai played some minor roles in determining δet in order to further determine comprehensive effects of various factors on monthly et in the ls and hw of qinghai lake basin the stepwise multiple linear regressions for the monthly et against environmental and vegetative variables were carried out the results showed that variations of monthly et were expressed by rn and lai in the ls as well as rn and ws in the hw in the two consecutive study years this also suggests that variations of monthly et in the ls are mainly influenced by available energy and vegetative coverage rn and ws play important roles in variations of monthly et in the hw accompanying with increment in rn and lai the monthly et in both ls and hw increased but the monthly et in the hw was decreased with increase in ws wang et al 2018 also reported that rn played an important role in et in the eastern and northwest section of the qtp the et trend in the qtp was dominated by p and lai but et would increase with the decline of wind speed in the qtp the regression equations explained 96 and 94 variance in monthly et in the ls and hw in two study years respectively the equations for ls and hw were as follow e t m 7 416 0 451 r n 30 572 lai r 2 adj 0 96 p 0 0001 e t m 26 682 0 461 r n 10 285 ws r adj 2 0 94 p 0 0001 similarly differences in monthly et δet between ls and hw also expressed by δrn δta and δts which indicated that difference in available energy and temperature between ls and hw determined the difference in et between ls and hw in qinghai lake basin the regression equation explained 79 variance in the δet in two studying years respectively the equation was as follow δ et 43 317 0 52 δ r n 6 311 δ t a 1 886 δ t s r 2 adj 0 79 p 0 0001 if integrated data for ls and hw as well as performed the stepwise multiple linear regressions for the et against the environmental and vegetative variables on the monthly scale it was showed that the monthly et was mainly controlled by monthly average rn and vpd in the two alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in 2015 and 2016 the monthly et on the whole year could be estimated with the following equation et 0 566rn 78 611vpd 9 443 radj 2 0 94 p 0 0001 our results indicated that solar radiation energy or available energy and the air water deficit explained 94 variance in monthly et in the alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in two study years this indicated that differences in the et between hw and ls in the qinghai lake basin were mainly caused by the available energy on monthly scale the available energy determined temperature and affected vpd in addition difference in temperature influenced the length of growing season and indirectly affected the vpd and et that was in agreement with previous studies in which the available energy is a major driver of both evaporation and transpiration in these systems price et al 1998 runkle et al 2014 and atmospheric moisture demand is a direct control on et admiral et al 2006 admiral and lafleur 2007 peng et al 2015 also found that climate warming increased et in alpine meadow ecosystems on the qtp due to extended growing season and increased vpd 4 conclusions the evapotranspiration on daily monthly and annual scales in the lakeside wetland ecosystem was higher than that of the headwater wetland ecosystem in the qinghai lake basin the evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems in growing season in studying periods averagely occupied by 67 and 78 of annual evapotranspiration respectively with the highest evapotranspiration in june or july net radiation was the primary driving factor of evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems on the monthly scale air and surface soil temperature as well as the vegetative coverage degree were key factors driving monthly evapotranspiration in both lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems vapor pressure deficit and surface soil volumetric water content played more important roles in monthly evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems respectively difference of available energy and temperature between lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems controlled the difference in evapotranspiration available energy and vapor pressure deficit were main factors driving variations of monthly evapotranspiration in the alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in brief different management strategies should be considered to play their respective ecological

1071,alpine wetland ecosystems play significant roles in water regulation and regional ecological safety on the qinghai tibet plateau due to large water conservation potential the knowledge of evapotranspiration et in various alpine wetland ecosystems is of great significance for understanding the water balance of wetland ecosystems and carrying out eco environment conservation therefore two alpine wetland ecosystems as lakeside and headwater of qinghai lake basin were selected and their et characteristics and influencing factors were researched over two years the daily et in the lakeside ecosystem showed double peak curve and the headwater ecosystem showed the multiple peak et curve the monthly ets in two respective wetlands ranged from 9 88 to 111 56 mm and from 0 23 to 75 5 mm respectively the annual et in the lakeside ecosystem was averagely 1 89 times more than that of the headwater stepwise multiple linear regressions indicated that monthly average net radiation rn and leaf area index lai explained 96 variance in monthly et in the lakeside ecosystem r n and monthly average wind speed ws explained 94 variance in monthly et in the headwater ecosystem these results indicated that the et is variable in two alpine wetland ecosystems and rn was their primary driving factor on monthly scale keywords evapotranspiration variation alpine wetland ecosystem qinghai lake 1 introduction water cycle is one of the key components in ecosystems that link various biogeochemistry and energy fluxes sellers 1997 wilson and baldocchi 2000 eichelmann et al 2016 as one of the major components in the hydrological cycle ecosystem evapotranspiration et is the sum of water vapor fluxes released into the atmosphere from soil and vegetation soubie et al 2016 which is considered the most excellent indicator of the hydrological water cycle and energy flow wang et al 2018 et has an important influence on ecosystems water balance maruyama and kuwagata 2010 as well as regional and global climate bonan et al 1992 2008 there are several methods that have been used to measure and estimate et such as eddy covariance ec analytical method eta soil water budget method ets and modeling of et etm soubie et al 2016 among these methods ec is recognized as the standard method to measure et continually in a non destructive way at the ecosystem level wofsy et al 1993 baldocchi et al 2001 baldocchi 2003 ec flux observation has been widely used to examine ecosystem et in forests grasslands croplands wetlands and deserts e g mccaughey et al 1997 goulden et al 2007 ryu et al 2008 zhou and zhou 2009 khatun et al 2011 yuan et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 wetlands known as the kidney of the earth play an important role in the global water cycle the water condition in wetland controls its material cycle and energy balance the et is an important dehydration process that determines the water balance and energy exchange of wetland ecosystems and is one of the important factors affecting the global climate many studies have focused on spatial temporal dynamics in et e g wu et al 2016 frédette et al 2019 influencing factors of et in wetlands e g runkle et al 2014 hirano et al 2016 scarlett et al 2017 and et characteristics on the regional scale anda et al 2015 the studied ecosystems included boreal peatlands runkle et al 2014 hirano et al 2016 arid wetlands eichelmann et al 2018 liu et al 2019 restored and constructed fens scarlett et al 2017 frédette et al 2019 coastal wetlands sandoval et al 2016 etc previous studies indicate that ets in different wetland ecosystems are greatly variable both meteorological conditions and biological features affect the et in wetland ecosystems which driving factors are various on different spatial temporal scales however data on et in wetland ecosystems is still insufficient therefore further researches on the et in various wetland ecosystems are meaningful so as to providing basic data and theoretical references for better understanding of its hydrological processes and scientific use of water resources the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is known as the asian water tower and the roof of the world with an average elevation of 4000 m it is essential to accurately estimate et so as to understand hydrological processes on the qtp xue et al 2013 previous studies in this region concerned the actual et in grassland zhang et al 2007 xie et al 2010 alpine riparian shrub zhang et al 2014 alpine meadow and bare land peng et al 2015 you et al 2017 even at the basin scale xue et al 2013 some studies also focused on the potential et and pan evaporation on the plateau zhang et al 2007 chen et al 2006 xie et al 2010 these studies provided important theories and data for accurately estimating et and water use at regional scale on the qtp the et is mainly influenced by climatic conditions vegetation growth and soil moisture steduto and hsiao 1998b burba and verma 2005 lei and yang 2010 so the et shows strong spatial and temporal variabilities on the qtp gu et al 2008 hu et al 2009 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 wetlands on the qtp account for 20 of total wetland areas in china zhao et al 2015 they play significant roles in eco environment protection and regional safety due to large water conservation however specific characteristics of the et in different wetland ecosystems remain unexplained these unknown features include variations of et in kobresia wetland ecosystems along different elevation gradients and their environmental explanatory factors moreover it is critical to study characteristics of the et in different wetland ecosystems and its roles in hydrological cycle in order to get insight for water conservation and optimization of water resources management on the qtp qinghai lake is the largest lake in china an et al 2012 and lies in the northeastern of qtp fig 1 it is an international important wetland and a national nature reserve which supports the ecological security of the northeastern qtp tang et al 1992 qinghai lake basin is strongly influenced by the asian summer monsoon and the westerlies thus it is a climatically sensitive and fragile area chen et al 2016 due to climate change and human activities the hydrological processes in qinghai lake basin have been shifted so seriously that they caused many environmental problems such as change in lake level and area desertification and deterioration of water quality and quantity li et al 2007 2009 cui et al 2015a 2017 although there are some scholars who have reported some studies on runoff cui et al 2015a precipitation xu et al 2007 cui et al 2015b potential evapotranspiration wang et al 2013 li et al 2015 and water evaporation in qinghai lake shi et al 2010 there are few studies on actual et in alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin therefore to study characteristics of actual et in different alpine wetland ecosystems and its influencing factors are crucial for understanding of water uses and water cycle processes of alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin the aims of this study are to 1 compare actual et in two typical alpine wetland ecosystems which are located at the lakeside ls and headwater hw of qinghai lake basin and to 2 reveal how the micro environmental and vegetative conditions influence the et in these two alpine wetland ecosystems the study will help us to understand of the water use of alpine wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in the qinghai lake basin located at the intersection of arid zone of northwest china the high cold zone of the qtp and the eastern monsoon zone the qinghai lake 36 32 37 15 n 99 36 100 47 e 3194 m asl is located at the lowest southeast of the qinghai lake basin fig 1 with a surface area of roughly 4500 km2 ao et al 2014 and a water volume of 71 6 109 m3 its climate belongs to the plateau continental the annual mean temperature is 0 1 c and the mean annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm with more than 65 falling between june and september an et al 2012 the larger tributaries include buha river shaliu river haergai river heima river and quanji river the vegetation mainly includes temperate steppe alpine grassland meadow swamp shrub and valley shrub etc the field experiments were conducted in an open and flat lakeside wetland ecosystem 36 42 n 100 46 e 3228 m asl and a headwater wetland ecosystem 37 44 n 100 05 e 3753 m asl the lakeside wetland ls which belongs to xiaobo lake wetland is about 3 km away from the east shore of the qinghai lake fig 1 the headwater wetland hw is located in wayan mountain in the north of qinghai lake and belongs to headwater area of shaliu river fig 1 shaliu river is the second largest river flowing into the qinghai lake both ls and hw are seasonal wetlands which belong to wet meadow or swamp ecosystems ground surface of wetlands have usually moisture in the vegetative growth periods due to the climate characteristics of the same hot and rainy seasons to the contrary they become dry meadows in the non growing periods due to lower precipitation the main vegetative growing period in the ls occurs from may to september the time in the hw shortens about one month due to higher altitude the vegetation in the ls is composed of kobresia tibetica and blysmus sinocompressus the constructive species is the k tibetica in the hw the vegetation includes kobresia humilis potentilla anserina l gentianopsis paludosa etc the constructive and dominant species is k humilis soil is mainly composed of swamp soil and meadow soil there are distributed seasonal permafrost at the surface and permanent permafrost in the deeper layers in both ls and hw 2 2 data collection an observation tower was built at a fixed sample plot in the ls and hw respectively an open path eddy covariance system li 7500a li cor inc usa was installed at the height of 2 83 m of the observing tower in the ls a closed path eddy covariance system li 7200 li cor inc usa was installed at the height of 2 98 m of the observing tower in the hw both open path and closed path covariance systems were connected by an analyzer interface unit of li 7550 the sampling frequency was 10 hz in both open and closed covariance systems data were collected with the average of 30 min interval and saved in ghg format in an industrial u disk a set of scientific automatic weather station instruments dynamet dynamax usa was installed close to the eddy covariance system in the ls for observing and recording the meteorological factors the corresponding meteorological factors including total solar radiation sr incident photosynthetically active radiation par air temperature t a air relative humanity rh wind speed and direction soil temperature t s and total precipitation p were also measured in the hw soil volumetric water content svw temperature and conductivity ec in different depths were measured by an ech2o system 5te decagon usa with the automatic datalogger em50 decagon usa since may 2015 the depths were 5 10 20 30 and 50 cm in the ls the depths were 5 10 30 40 and 50 cm in the hw respectively all data on meteorological and environmental factors were recorded at 30 minute mean intervals keeping synchronously with eddy covariance systems in time the raw data selected for analyses in this study were collected in 2015 and 2016 two daily vegetation indices including leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi were extracted from one modis pixel that was centered on the targeted eddy covariance tower from january to december in 2015 modis land products mod15a2 and mod13q1 containing lai and evi data were downloaded from satellite data products of the nasa s earth observation system eos https ladsweb nascom nasa gov respectively their spatial resolution ratios are 1 0 km and 250 m their temporal resolution ratios are 8 days and 16 days respectively the abnormal lai and evi data due to continual rain was linearly interpolated or replaced by the average between adjacent data the monthly mean values of lai and evi was calculated by averaged the discrete data on the every whole month 2 3 data processing and analyzing the raw flux data gathered by eddy covariance system were processed by eddypro 6 0 software li cor biosciences usa to calculate ecosystem co2 water vapor sensible heat and latent heat fluxes this software was applied the following data preprocessing and corrections wind speed measurement offsets nakai and shimoyama 2012 time lags compensation compensation of density fluctuations webb et al 1980 quality check mauder and foken 2006 footprint estimation kljun et al 2004 spike removal vickers and mahrt 1997 spectral analysis and corrections vickers and mahrt 1997 mauder and foken 2006 moncrieff et al 1997 2004 fratini et al 2012 etc due to the instrument heat components from li 7500a co2 and water vapor fluxes measured by open eddy covariance system were influenced by the surface instrument heat especially when air temperature was low burba et al 2008 ji et al 2013 the effects were more obvious when the air temperature on the alpine wetland system in the qinghai lake was less than 10 c therefore we corrected the heat effect of the instrument itself on the above corresponding flux data using the eddypro 6 0 software in the ls we also observed some other abnormal and missing fluxes data on both alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems during data processing these were caused by instrument failure extreme weather condition degree of atmospheric stability and power supply failure data deletion and interpolation became necessary in such cases data deleted included data in the process of precipitation obvious abnormal data corresponding data on friction velocity that was less than 0 15 m s zhang et al 2008 and 0 1 m s zhao et al 2010 wang et al 2013 at night in the ls and hw respectively and the data fluxes that were three times more than standard deviation at five continuous plots we interpolated the water vapor and heat fluxes data using the multiple methods to obtain the continuous and complete data when the time intervals of missing flux data were less than 2 h we interpolated water vapor and heat fluxes data using the following two methods firstly the missing flux data were interpolated by the average value between adjacent data when the missing intervals were less than 1 h secondly the missing flux data were interpolated by linear interpolation method when the missing intervals were less than 2 h when the missing intervals were more than 2 h the water vapor and heat fluxes were interpolated by linear or nonlinear regression equations between water vapor heat fluxes and environmental factors under similar meteorological conditions barr et al 2006 amiro et al 2006 eichelmann et al 2016 the missing meteorological data were interpolated by the average with similar meteorological conditions the linear or nonlinear relationships with other meteorological elements in statistical analyses correlations of monthly et with every influencing factors were conducted using the statistical methods including linear exponential and multiple linear regressions and stepwise multiple linear regression as well as polynomial curve fitting etc to identify factors of variations of monthly et driven by biotic and abiotic differences between ls and hw we examined the correlations between δet etls ethw and biotic and abiotic variables ls hw all statistical analyses were completed by excel 2013 origin 9 1 and spss 16 0 softwares 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in micrometeorological conditions the daily average solar radiation sr of the ls and hw showed synchronous and multimodal changes as well as had no significant difference with the average values of 211 03 and 217 91 w m2 in two studying years respectively the daily sr greatly fluctuated in rainy and growing periods with the daily sr of the hw slightly higher than that in the ls fig 2 a the daily average t a in the ls was generally higher than that of the hw fig 2b and showed single peak curves in both ls and hw on the whole year the annual average t a value in the ls and hw in two studying years was 3 02 and 2 87 c respectively the difference in ta between ls and hw was 5 88 c the precipitation p in both places mainly occurred during the growing seasons the p from june to august in the ls was obviously lower than that of the hw fig 2c the annual p in the ls and hw in 2015 and 2016 were 304 3 and 420 9 mm 2015 364 and 587 5 mm 2016 respectively the daily rh in the ls and hw synchronously increased from april to september and then decreased from october and march in the next year fig 2d the annual average rh in the ls and hw in two studying years were 55 4 and 57 88 except for january february and december the daily average vapor pressure deficit vpd in the ls was higher than that of the hw fig 2e the annual average vpd values in the ls and hw were 0 4 and 0 25 kpa 2015 0 42 and 0 26 kpa 2016 respectively the daily average vpd was higher in the ls than that of the hw but they were similar to variation fig 2e the daily ws in the ls and hw synchronously varied fig 2f the daily ws in the ls from january to march was higher than that of the hw but was similar in other months fig 2f 3 2 variations of daily and monthly et daily et of the ls and hw in two studying years showed double peak or multiple peak curves the daily et in the ls was generally higher than that in the hw fig 3 the daily et in the ls and hw varied from 0 13 to 4 73 mm d and from 0 0 to 3 93 mm d with the mean of 1 77 and 0 94 mm d respectively the daily et was higher in the growing periods than that in the non growing periods and the fluctuation was also larger tables 1 2 the daily et in the ls in growing periods varied from 0 28 to 4 73 mm d with the mean of 2 49 mm the corresponding range in the non growing periods was from 0 13 to 2 83 mm d with the mean of 0 87 mm d table 1 for the hw the ranges in growing and non growing periods were from 0 04 to 3 93 mm d 0 to 2 83 mm d the mean was 1 77 and 0 44 mm d respectively table 2 according to statistics table 3 the daily mean et in alpine meadow ecosystem on the qtp varied from 0 85 to 1 74 mm d with the values in this study being within the range the daily mean et decreased with increasing altitude but significant statistical analysis could not be performed due to the limited data the daily average ets in the ls were higher than those in the hw in the growing and non growing periods as well as whole year annual maximum of daily et in the ls also was higher than that in the latter with the value of 4 73 and 3 93 mm respectively this suggests that daily et in the hw is lower than that in the ls coners et al 2016 reported that daily et in moist grassland ecosystem at an elevation around 4500 m on the qtp were 4 6 mm d in moist summer periods and 2 mm d in dry periods the maximum et at a grassland dominated by stipa carex and kobresia at 4330 m near damxung on the northeastern tibetan plateau were up to 5 mm d hu et al 2008 the average et rates were 1 9 2 2 mm d for the growing period in an ungrazed k humilis k pygmaea grassland at 3250 m elevation on the northern tibetan plateau gu et al 2008 these results showed that our results were in the reasonable range but the maximum of daily et in the hw and ls were lower than that of the grassland above 4000 m asl on monthly scale the et variations showed one peak at both sites with the maximum et occurring in june or july the minimum et was in january or december the monthly et in the ls and hw ranged from 9 88 to 111 56 mm month and from 0 23 to 75 5 mm month respectively the monthly et in both ls and hw in 2015 was higher than that in 2016 fig 4 compared the monthly et between ls and hw the former was higher than that of the latter the annual ets in the ls and hw were 633 3 362 1 mm year 2015 and 657 2 and 324 96 mm year 2016 with the former being 1 75 and 2 02 times higher than that of the latter respectively the annual et in the ls was higher than that of kobresia pygmaea meadow 493 2 mm potentilla fruticosa shrub 507 9 mm and achnatherum splendens steppe 413 7 mm year in the qinghai lake watershed zhang et al 2016 but was ranged from 451 59 to 681 28 mm year in the alpine meadow ecosystem of haibei zuo et al 2016 near the qinghai lake for the hw the annual et was lower but near to a meadow ecosystem 341 426 mm year in haibei gu et al 2008 these results indicated that the annual et in this study was similar with that in the alpine meadow of haibei more than 80 et of meadows on the qtp occurred from may to september gu et al 2008 li et al 2013 the et from may to september occupied by 86 of annual et in alpine riparian myricaria squamosa shrub on the qtp zhang et al 2014 in this study the et in the ls and hw from may to september in studying periods averagely occupied by 67 and 78 of annual et respectively with the highest et in june or july the percentage of et from may to september in qinghai lake basin was slightly lower than that of the previous studies according to the results of the et of alpine meadow ecosystems in the qtp table 3 if neglected the difference in vegetation composition and micro environmental conditions only the differences in et caused by altitude were considered then annual et significantly decreased with increasing altitude r2 0 28 p 0 05 fig 5 the annual et reduced by 124 1 mm with an elevation of 1000 m these results indicated that variations of monthly and annual et in the alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin not only followed the general laws in the alpine meadow ecosystem of the qtp but also showed regional characteristics the annual total et in the ls exceeded local precipitation by approximately 108 2015 and 81 2016 with ratios of et p in the growing periods of 1 87 and 1 43 the ratios in the non growing periods of 3 46 and 4 93 respectively table 4 these results indicated that the et in the ls was higher than p and the water was deficient the ecological water consumption was mainly used for ecosystem primary production and soil evaporation for the hw the et was about 14 2015 and 45 2016 less than annual precipitation with the ratios of et p in the growing periods of 0 69 and 0 41 the ratios in the non growing periods of 1 54 and 1 52 respectively table 5 these suggested that the et in the growing periods was lower than p but it was versus in the non growing periods the water in the hw in the growing periods was surplus but deficit in the non growing periods the ratios of et p on the whole year were 0 86 2015 and 0 55 2016 table 5 indicating that the et in the hw was lower than p and the water had a surplus on the annual scale which indicates that this wetland has a water conversation function in the catchment zhang et al 2016 also reported that annual et in the achnatherum splendens steppe was 26 more than annual precipitation and annual et in the kobresia meadow and potentilla fruticosa shrub was 16 and 3 less than the local annual precipitation in qinghai lake basin li et al 2013 determined that the ratio of annual et to precipitation at another kobresia meadow located in the northeast of qinghai tibetan plateau was about 60 the ratio of et p in the alpine meadow ecosystem in haibei was within 0 9 1 11 with the mean of 1 07 zuo et al 2016 the average et p value in alpine swamp meadow of haibei was 1 39 hu et al 2009 in the ls and hw of qinghai lake basin the daily precipitation ranged from 0 25 to 22 86 mm d and from 0 25 to 34 29 mm d respectively but about 36 and 31 precipitation was less than 1 mm d as well as 76 and 71 precipitation was less than 5 mm d in the ls and hw in studying periods respectively which could not form surface runoff therefore if neglecting surface runoff and soil water infiltration due to smaller p and relatively flat observing plots as well as soil water recharged from groundwater ecosystem water budget could be calculated by subtracting et from p zuo et al 2016 the results indicated that the difference in water budget between the ls and hw from may to september was more significant than that in cold season fig 6 water was deficit in the ls during the growth season leading to the wetland surface soil drying out and groundwater level declining but was surplus in the hw from june to september fig 6 these results also demonstrated that the hw lying in higher elevation and headwater region had water conservation function in the growing period while the ls around the qinghai lake was only consuming water for ecosystem primary production and soil evaporation therefore to play respective ecological water use functions in the two alpine wetland ecosystems the different strategies of preservation and utilization should be considered as revealed from the results of this study specifically the management options should aim at increasing the ecosystem net primary productivity and exert its material production function as much as possible in the ls this can be done by means of fence enclosure resting or forbidding grazing in growing season and rotational grazing in non growth season the hw in turn should be mainly fenced to restore surface vegetation while the number of livestock should be controlled in order to maintain the water conservation function of this ecosystem 3 3 correlations of micro environmental and vegetative factors with monthly et integrating the data in two studying years the monthly et in both ls and hw showed different correlations with every environmental and vegetative variables fig 7 fig 8 the monthly et in the ls showed significantly positive power relationships with monthly average sr r2 0 8 p 0 0001 fig 7a and svw in 0 5 cm soil r2 0 59 p 0 0001 fig 7i exponential correlations with monthly average r n r2

b with δrh r2 0 53 p 0 001 fig 11f and δvpd r2 0 51 p 0 001 fig 11g in the form of quadratic polynomial function δet was negatively related to both δta r2 0 33 p 0 05 fig 11c and δp r2 0 32 p 0 05 fig 11e in the form of quadratic polynomial function as well as linear relation to δlai r2 0 23 p 0 05 fig 11j however the relationships between δet with other variables were not significant fig 11a d h i k according to correlation coefficients rn was the primary driving factor of et in ls and hw of qinghai lake on the monthly scale which rn explained more than 90 variance in monthly et in both ls and hw ta ts and evi were key factors driving monthly et in both ls and hw ta ts and evi explained at least 80 variance in monthly et in the ls and hw respectively vpd and svw were more important for monthly et in the ls and hw which vpd and svw explained at least 80 variance in monthly et respectively net radiation a net energy obtained on the surface of the earth is closely related to the state of the vegetation on the surface and represents available energy in ecosystems which plays a key role in the interaction of the ground gas system temperature can represent the amount of solar energy suggesting that solar radiation energy or available energy critically controlled variations of monthly et in the alpine kobresia wetland ecosystems in qinghai lake basin wang et al 2018 also reported that rn played an important role in et in the eastern and northwest section of the qtp the daily et fluctuations in three alpine ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed were primarily controlled by radiation especially during the growing season zhang et al 2016 temperature directly influences the vegetative development and growth and also restricts transpiration meanwhile the moisture movement underlying surface accelerates and the rate of et increases with the increase of air temperature near the ground previous results also reported that solar radiation and temperature mainly influenced the et at high altitudes and under cold climates in alpine ecosystems gu et al 2005 zha et al 2013 vegetation growth and coverage can change the evaporation and transpiration process the evi comprehensively expresses leaf area index and characteristics of vegetation phenology and can truly reflect the vegetative coverage degree and growth status ma et al 2014 yang et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the evi influences the et through controlling ratios between evaporation and transpiration in solar radiation zhang et al 2003 in this study the effect degree of the evi on the monthly et between ls and hw was similar it could be because the values of evis in both ls and hw were relatively near and low the annual mean lai in the ls and hw was 0 3 and 0 42 and the evi was 0 17 and 0 21 respectively both ta and vpd in the ls were higher than these of the hw relatively higher air temperature increased vpd depending on temperature higher vpd successively aggregates the drying degree of the atmosphere and enhances atmospheric water demand which causing the et increased therefore the vpd played a more significant role in monthly et in the ls than that in the hw previous studies also demonstrated that vpd was positively correlated with et goyal 2004 lawrence et al 2007 wieser et al 2008 bergh et al 2013 peng et al 2015 also reported that climate warming stimulated ecosystem water movement increasing et in which increased vpd and extended growing season could explain the et the higher vegetation greatly prevented evaporation in surface soil in the ls on the contrary the lower vegetative height in the hw caused that surface soil prone to be exposed on sunlight which enhanced soil evaporation and caused water deficit in the surface soil especially during the growing season characterized by such physical stress as intensively raining and hot temperatures so increasing et during the growing season resulted in surface soil layer drying the correlation coefficient indicated that the influence of svw on the monthly et in the hw was more significant than that of the ls coners et al 2016 reported that soil moisture and precipitation were identified as main determinants of et in a high elevation pasture the surface soil moisture content was an important factor controlling et in other alpine ecosystems on the qtp yao et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 meanwhile wang et al 2018 reported that there was a strong correlation between et and water supply over most regions of the qtp the daily et fluctuations in three alpine ecosystems in qinghai lake watershed was also controlled by soil water content where or when precipitation was low zhang et al 2016 previous results also showed that et was greatly influenced by soil water storage when the soil water content was below a threshold value burba et al 2005 lei and yang 2010 ding et al 2013 the et variation between ls and hw corresponded to rn ta p rh vpd and lai variations on monthly scale fig 11 the larger δrn δrh and δvpd increased et in hw the larger δta δp and δlai increased et in ls on monthly scale δrn explained 62 variance in δet δrh and δvpd explained approximately 50 variance in δet respectively δta δp and δlai explained about 23 33 variance in δet respectively this indicated that differences of monthly et in ls and hw were mainly caused by diversity of available energy and atmospheric moisture available energy determined the ta level and then indirectly influenced vpd while p influenced the rh level thus the available energy and precipitation were key abiotic factors driving the difference in et between ls and hw on monthly scale the lai played some minor roles in determining δet in order to further determine comprehensive effects of various factors on monthly et in the ls and hw of qinghai lake basin the stepwise multiple linear regressions for the monthly et against environmental and vegetative variables were carried out the results showed that variations of monthly et were expressed by rn and lai in the ls as well as rn and ws in the hw in the two consecutive study years this also suggests that variations of monthly et in the ls are mainly influenced by available energy and vegetative coverage rn and ws play important roles in variations of monthly et in the hw accompanying with increment in rn and lai the monthly et in both ls and hw increased but the monthly et in the hw was decreased with increase in ws wang et al 2018 also reported that rn played an important role in et in the eastern and northwest section of the qtp the et trend in the qtp was dominated by p and lai but et would increase with the decline of wind speed in the qtp the regression equations explained 96 and 94 variance in monthly et in the ls and hw in two study years respectively the equations for ls and hw were as follow e t m 7 416 0 451 r n 30 572 lai r 2 adj 0 96 p 0 0001 e t m 26 682 0 461 r n 10 285 ws r adj 2 0 94 p 0 0001 similarly differences in monthly et δet between ls and hw also expressed by δrn δta and δts which indicated that difference in available energy and temperature between ls and hw determined the difference in et between ls and hw in qinghai lake basin the regression equation explained 79 variance in the δet in two studying years respectively the equation was as follow δ et 43 317 0 52 δ r n 6 311 δ t a 1 886 δ t s r 2 adj 0 79 p 0 0001 if integrated data for ls and hw as well as performed the stepwise multiple linear regressions for the et against the environmental and vegetative variables on the monthly scale it was showed that the monthly et was mainly controlled by monthly average rn and vpd in the two alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in 2015 and 2016 the monthly et on the whole year could be estimated with the following equation et 0 566rn 78 611vpd 9 443 radj 2 0 94 p 0 0001 our results indicated that solar radiation energy or available energy and the air water deficit explained 94 variance in monthly et in the alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in two study years this indicated that differences in the et between hw and ls in the qinghai lake basin were mainly caused by the available energy on monthly scale the available energy determined temperature and affected vpd in addition difference in temperature influenced the length of growing season and indirectly affected the vpd and et that was in agreement with previous studies in which the available energy is a major driver of both evaporation and transpiration in these systems price et al 1998 runkle et al 2014 and atmospheric moisture demand is a direct control on et admiral et al 2006 admiral and lafleur 2007 peng et al 2015 also found that climate warming increased et in alpine meadow ecosystems on the qtp due to extended growing season and increased vpd 4 conclusions the evapotranspiration on daily monthly and annual scales in the lakeside wetland ecosystem was higher than that of the headwater wetland ecosystem in the qinghai lake basin the evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems in growing season in studying periods averagely occupied by 67 and 78 of annual evapotranspiration respectively with the highest evapotranspiration in june or july net radiation was the primary driving factor of evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems on the monthly scale air and surface soil temperature as well as the vegetative coverage degree were key factors driving monthly evapotranspiration in both lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems vapor pressure deficit and surface soil volumetric water content played more important roles in monthly evapotranspiration in the lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems respectively difference of available energy and temperature between lakeside and headwater wetland ecosystems controlled the difference in evapotranspiration available energy and vapor pressure deficit were main factors driving variations of monthly evapotranspiration in the alpine wetland ecosystems of qinghai lake basin in brief different management strategies should be considered to play their respective ecological

1072,rainfall redistribution by forest cover has potential hydrological impacts in semi arid regions due to continuous human intervention studying the process of interception loss by caatinga vegetation and its changes due to deforestation is extremely important for local hydrology however such information is scarce in the literature this study examined the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i in the caatinga vegetation caa and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning the components of rainfall partitioning were measured from 2016 to 2017 to determine the tf and sf respectively and their relationships with rainfall characteristics were evaluated based on linear regression models for the caatinga vegetation tf and sf represent 89 2 and 0 5 of the gross rainfall while interception loss was 10 3 an expressive value that should be included in regional water balance models the rainfall characteristics were able to explain the variations in water partitioning showing that tf and sf increase for events of higher intensity and volume whereas interception loss is mainly associated with events of longer duration for the caatinga stemflow and throughfall usually occur for events of greater than 1 65 mm and 0 98 mm while values for canopy water storage ranged from 0 88 mm to 1 16 mm it is concluded that for semi arid environments these values are significant and cannot be ignored when managing local water resources keywords interception loss semiarid climate stemflow throughfall 1 introduction forest ecosystems are responsible for changes in the mechanism of rainfall entry by its redistribution when interacting with the canopy which plays a prominent role in the local and regional hydrological cycle ávila et al 2014 he et al 2014 llorens and domingo 2007 de moura et al 2009 rainfall above the canopy is divided into three components throughfall stemflow and interception loss carlyle moses 2004 carlyle moses and gash 2011 thus these three processes indicate how rainfall is redistributed in vegetation as the water reaches the canopy llorens and domingo 2007 in the first two cases water flows towards the ground after interacting or not with the vegetation while interception loss refers to water temporarily stored in the canopy which is then lost by evaporation llorens and domingo 2007 de moura et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 throughfall is a critical component of the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of the ecosystems which has high temporal and spatial variability levia and frost 2006 in its turn stemflow despite the small proportion of it is a preferential point of entry for water to the deeper layers of the soil concentrating on the root zone near the stem and making water readily available to the plant roots brasil et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 in arid and semi arid regions this flow of water towards the roots is presumed to be necessary germer et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 interception loss is therefore a key process influencing the availability and distribution of rainfall to other hydrological processes such as evaporation the soil infiltration rate runoff erosion soil moisture and groundwater recharge among others he et al 2014 sajikumar and remya 2015 zhang et al 2018 carlyle moses 2004 showed that in tropical rainforests the percentage of interception loss is around 13 of the gross rainfall in native brazilian forests the interception loss can reach values of 2 4 37 6 of the gross rainfall giglio and kobiyama 2013 with significant spatial variation between the various ecosystems this variation is the result of associations between the meteorological elements microclimate

et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2018 zheng et al 2018 the semiarid region of brazil is very fragile due to the encouragement of such practices as the indiscriminate deforestation to extract firewood plant crops and allow overgrazing by animals conducted at caatinga domain a seasonal dry tropical forest that covers most of the semi arid region of the brazilian northeast dória et al 2016 these practices are often carried out under inadequate management aggravating the process of degradation in native areas and increasing the hydrological complexity of the region rodrigues et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2003 precipitation in this region is scarce and irregular with an annual mean value of between 300 and 800 mm and at least five consecutive dry months as rainfall is the main source of water replenishment in the system such conditions result in water scarcity since the region includes only 3 0 of the total volume of water in the country dória et al 2016 medeiros et al 2009 montenegro and ragab 2012 there are few studies on the process of rainfall redistribution in the brazilian semiarid and in areas of caatinga vegetation with only two being found in the literature brasil et al 2017 medeiros et al 2009 in this type of environment interception loss is especially important because the demand for agricultural industrial and residential water depends on soil moisture thresholds groundwater runoff and recharge carlyle moses 2004 giglio and kobiyama 2013 carried out an extensive review of studies on the measurement of interception loss in native brazilian forests in order to identify which environments should be prioritized in future research among the works reviewed 25 were conducted in the atlantic forest 15 in the amazon and another 4 divided between the cerrado 3 and an area of caatinga 1 the partitioning of rainfall in seasonally dry tropical forests such as caatinga may support government policies based on the study of local hydrological balance as well as allow the assessment of the impacts of change in land use and land cover in these environments carlyle moses 2004 llorens and domingo 2007 moreover the quantification of the interception loss by caatinga vegetation has wide application for the international scientific community especially regarding the estimation of parameters required by interception loss models giglio and kobiyama 2013 the aim of this study was to examine the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i in the caatinga vegetation a seasonal dry tropical forest in the semi arid environment and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning moreover it is expected that this study will improve information peculiar to the brazilian semi arid region for use in hydrological models of regionalization of water interception by caatinga vegetation 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the study site is located in a rural area in the state of pernambuco brazil the climate in the region is semi arid type bsh alvares et al 2013 with a mean annual rainfall of 489 mm occurring mainly between december and april in addition to the variations in rainfall there are strong seasonal differences in terms of air temperature relative humidity and other meteorological variables table 1 the experimental area is located in the caam des

of 81 000 m2 composed of vegetation native to the caatinga domain the forest is dominated by arboreal and shrubby plant species such as spondias tuberosa jatropha molíssima aspidosperma pyrifolium and cenostigma pyramidale of these species many presented microphylls and xeromorphism and strongly modify the landscape throughout the year as a response to the local water restrictions medeiros et al 2009 silva et al 2014 the vegetation has a variable height of 3 15 m and during the wet period it is composed of native tree like shrub and herbaceous stratum species while in the dry period it is composed of leafless tree like shrub species and bare soil fig 1 2 2 plant selection and measurement in the area of caatinga the forest inventory was carried out in 25 plots with 400 m2 each in order to identify the main families of plants and characteristics of the predominant species based on inventory results twenty seven healthy vigorous plants were selected for monitoring rainfall partitioning in the field these plants represent five dominant plant species in the area spondias tuberosa commiphora leptophloeos cnidoscolus quercifoliu aspidosperma pyrifolium and cenostigma

collection surface of 707 cm2 installed at a height of 1 0 m above the ground fig 2 b and c the rain gauges were repositioned during the monitoring period the each three events in order to reduce the effects of spatial variability in the readings and to minimize estimation errors vernimmen et al 2007 the throughfall was calculated from eq 1 as described in zhang et al 2015 2018 1 tf v pi ac where tf is the throughfall mm v pi is the volume of water that passed through the canopy l and ac is the area of the collector and or rain gage m2 to quantify stemflow sf zinc gutters with a height of 0 15 m and lengths depending on the trunk circumference of the trees were installed at a height of 1 30 m with monitoring in 12 plants fig 2 d it was decided to choose plants with a circumference of 20 cm at a height of 1 30 m due to the ease of installing the gutters this resulted in dbh classes of 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm bäse et al 2012 the sf was calculated according to eq 2 2 sf v et pa where sf is the flow of water along the trunk mm v sf is the volume of water in the measured stemflow l and pa is the canopy projection area m2 zhang et al 2015 there was no average distance between the pluviometers and gutters however it was sought to allocate them in circles around the micrometeorological tower with distances varying from 6 to 113 m in order to avoid evaporation the rainfall was directed by a hose fixed to the tf and sf collectors which were made of individual plastic containers with a capacity of 10 l the measurements were carried out with a graduated cylinder in short of the 27 plants selected the internal rain gauges were allocated to 15 and the stem flow gutters to 12 and distributed randomly in nearby of the micrometeorological station under the canopy of dominant species in the area fig 3 the values of tf and sf were obtained by the arithmetic mean of the gauges measurements per species in each rain event 2 5 interception loss the interception loss was obtained for each rainfall event bäse et al 2012 he et al 2014 eq 3 3 i gr tf sf where gr is the gross rainfall obtained in an open area mm the monitoring period for rainfall partitioning was from march 2016 to september 2017 with measurements on a weekly daily event scale depending on access conditions to the area after the rainfall rainfall that did not originate tf and or sf was not recorded as an event the stemflow and throughtfall transfer rainfall from the canopy of plants to the forest soil giglio and kobiyama 2013 however in caatinga areas the vegetation does not fully cover the soil due to its sparse configuration forest that has significant open spaces between the treetops which could cause overestimations in the calculations of these processes when extrapolated to the entire area of the land to solve this gap we determined the vegetation and soil cover index by means of orbital images between the years 2016 and 2017 for an area of 81 000 m2 corresponds to the limits of the monitored property seven images of the landsat 8 satellite were obtained https earthexplorer usgs gov using as a criterion of choice have at least 80 area no clouds based on these images the ndvi

intensity on the components of partitioning were explored through linear regression models for this a data set consisting of 81 points was used i e the 32 rainfall events that generated tf and sf were included as well as rainfall with smaller values that did not promote partitioning all seen from march 2016 to september 2017 2 7 statistical analysis descriptive statistics and the normality test were applied to the data for throughfall stemflow and interception loss and to the characteristics of gross rainfall quantity duration and intensity for the latter histograms of class distribution were created friedman s paired test was used to determine which plant species show statistically different mean rates for rainfall partitioning p 0 05 the linear regressions between the rainfall components and their partitioning were evaluated by means of the significance of the equations and their parameters all statistical procedures were carried out with the statistical software and data

characteristics eighty one rainfall events were recorded during the experimental period from march 2016 to september 2017 with a total of 536 5 mm the rainfall was unevenly distributed throughout the year and between years so that to study rainfall partitioning only 32 rainfall events were used since for the other events the small amount of rainfall did not result in throughfall and or stemflow during the 32 events 506 3 mm were recorded with a difference of only 30 2 mm in relation to the total for the period fig 4 shows the daily rainfall amount fig 4 a duration fig 4 b and intensity fig 4 c during the 32 events from 2016 to 2017 the amount of precipitated water varied from 2 8 to 48 8 mm with a mean value of 15 8 mm standard deviation 11 3 mm rainfall duration ranged from 0 7 to 8 7 h with a mean value of 3 4 h standard deviation 2 2 h while rainfall density ranged from 1 6 to 18 2 mm h 1 with a mean value of 5 6 mm h 1 standard deviation 4 0 mm h 1 it can easily be seen that rainfall distribution was more uniform during 2017 fig 4 a lasting from february to mid july which allowed more constant monitoring of the rainfall partitioning the frequency distribution of the quantity duration and intensity of the rainfall in the 32 events is shown in fig 5 the amount of rainfall was distributed over five classes events with precipitation 10 mm were the most frequent however the amount of accumulated rainfall was 72 mm 14 eleven events were recorded in the 10 20 mm class 34 with the highest percentage of total accumulated rainfall 30 corresponding to 153 mm fig 5 a for the intermediate classes 20 30 mm and 30 40 mm the events were less frequent 13 however the gross rainfall for these events was 99 and 132 mm respectively finally only one single event was greater than 40 mm 3 representing 10 of the gross rainfall 48 8 mm fig 5 a events of shorter duration show greater frequency twenty one events had a duration of less than or equal to 4 h corresponding to 66 of the total and accumulating 316 mm of rain equivalent to 62 of the gross rainfall fig 5 b rainfall lasting from 4 to 8 h occurred in 28 of the events with an accumulated total of 162 mm 32 individual rainfall events lasting more than 6 h were equal to 6 of the total events and to 6 of the gross rainfall fig 5 b the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was skewed to the number of events and amount of rain showing that lower intensities 0 to 5 mm h 1 are the most frequent 18 events 56 of the total the accumulated rainfall for these events was 199 mm 39 of the total fig 5 c the class of intermediate intensity had the second highest occurrence with 31 of events 10 and an accumulated rainfall similar to the previous class 35 two rainfall events with an intensity between 10 and 15 mm h 1 and greater than 15 mm h 1 were recorded but at a different percentage of the gross rainfall 17 and 9 respectively fig 5 c 3 2 rainfall partitioning in the area of caatinga based on orbital image analysis we identified that vegetation and soil covers were equal to 57 5 and 43 5 respectively with tf sf and i calculated only for the canopy area the individual rainfall in the 32 events expressed as throughfall stemflow and interception loss associated with the amount and intensity of the rain is shown in fig 6 for the experimental period nine rainfall events totaling 146 7 mm 19 march to 18 december were recorded during the first year 2016 in contrast 23 rainfall events were recorded during the second year 2017 totaling 359 6 mm 2 february to 14 july respectively representing 29 and 71 of the precipitated volume fig 6 among the components of rainfall partitioning throughfall tf had the greatest variation for the monitored events ranging from 1 32 to 46 8 mm 11 00 mm and responding positively to the gross rainfall fig 6 the values for sf were very low in the caatinga ranging from 0 to 0 53 mm 0 15 mm greater values for stemflow were only seen during events of higher rainfall volume and reduced intensity such as events 9 11 17 19 20 21 27 and 29 sf 0 25 mm fig 6 for interception loss i the values ranged from 0 9 to 8 78 mm 1 61 mm in addition slightly higher i values were seen during the later rainfall events in each year events 8 and 9 in 2016 and events 30 31 and 32 in 2017 fig 6 however this component showed little change as a function of rainfall intensity or quantity during rainfall events displaying similar values during most of the events the percentage values of tf and sf are equal to 89 2 and 0 5 respectively resulting in interception loss by the caatinga vegetation is therefore equal to 10 3 of the gr 3 3 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall characteristics the rainfall characteristics quantity duration and intensity displayed significant positive relationships with all the components of rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception loss fig 7 the results of the regression analysis for the total amount of rainfall gr indicated that all the components had a linear and positive correlation 0 44 r 2 0 98 p 0 0001 showing a better fit for throughfall and stemflow depth fig 7 a and b according to the adjusted equations the rainfall threshold for generating throughfall and stemflow is 0 98 and 1 65 mm respectively the first value can therefore be considered the canopy storage capacity of the caatinga significant positive relationships were obtained between rainfall duration and the components of rainfall partitioning tf sf i p 0 05 with linear increments fig 7 d f tf and sf displayed a significant linear relationship with rainfall duration albeit relatively weak while i had the best fit r 2 0 71 p 0 0001 rainfall intensity mm h 1 was able to explain the variations in throughfall stemflow and interception loss p 0 001 fig 7 g i tf and sf showed a positive trend with the increase in intensity while the smallest adjustment between these variables was obtained for i r 2 0 22 fig 7 i 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall partitioning in the area of caatinga for the study region it was found that rainfall greater than or equal to 20 mm with a duration of over 4 h and an intensity of less than or equal to 5 mm h 1 are the most frequent fig 5 this result directly affects rainfall partitioning when coming into contact with the plant canopy the behavior of the throughfall during the 32 rainfall events proved to be quite variable with a pattern similar to that of the gross rainfall during the entire experimental period higher values for tf than for gr drip points were obtained in five rainfall events this is common in studies of interception loss due to the existence of preferential drip points in the canopy and seen mainly during continuous rainfall events de moura et al 2009 siegert et al 2016 vernimmen et al 2007 vernimmen et al 2007 found an increase in the occurrence of drip points as the precipitated volume increased reaching an occurrence frequency of 33 3 in this study the reduced number of drip points is due to the practice of placing rain gauges throughout the course of the experimental period a practice that should be encouraged in research with caatinga vegetation where canopy formation occurs continuously throughout the rainy period sf contribution was small for events of reduced precipitated volume and vice versa however in general stemflow volume was minimal brasil et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 already values for interception loss varied little between rainfall events irrespective of the amount of precipitated water however slightly higher values for interception loss were seen during the later events and it can be assumed that the sequence of rainfall events allowed the complete formation of plant biomass by the species ávila et al 2014 found that the percentage of tf during dry periods was significantly higher than during wet periods thus a greater volume of water passes through the canopy and reaches the soil surface during the dry season resulting in fewer interception losses those authors associate this behavior with the semi deciduous forest formation with leaf fall during the dry season it is therefore likely that both the tf and i also correlate with the characteristics of the canopy based on the data obtained at the experimental site of caatinga vegetation it can be seen that the 506 mm of gross rainfall resulted in values for throughfall stemflow and interception loss of 89 2 0 5 and 10 3 respectively medeiros et al 2009 found similar values in a preserved area of tree like caatinga with values for tf sf and i of 81 0 6 0 and 13 0 respectively brasil et al 2017 reported values for tf of 79 6 sf of 2 0 and i of 18 4 of the total incident precipitation in an area of caatinga after 28 years of regeneration both studies were conducted in the semi arid region of the state of ceará the results of the present study agree with those obtained in other climate regions using different types of vegetation and management from natural forests to planted forests fig 8 in those studies it can be seen that throughfall is the main way water enters the forest with values ranging from 46 2 to 91 6 stemflow represents 0 2 to 11 8 of the gross rainfall and interception loss ranges between 8 1 and 44 8 the value for interception loss obtained in this study 10 3 is quite significant for the region since the intercepted volume will return to the atmosphere to compose the mass of water vapor considering that for the most part caatinga vegetation is characterized by species that have microphylls small leaves it is to be expected that the percentage of interception loss be lower than for other plant typologies fig 8 due to the reduced water storage capacity of the canopy however some authors suggest that the high rates of evaporation in the region might create a cycle from the interception loss by the canopy to its subsequent return to the atmosphere during and after rainfall events allowing the continuous storage of water brasil et al 2017 medeiros et al 2009 for other arid and semi arid regions of the world studies of interception losses are more frequent serving as an aid in the application of models domingo et al 1998 gash et al 1995 the implementation and evaluation of recovery projects and in hydrological budgets he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2018 sadeghi et al 2016 found significant differences in all the components of water partitioning in four species commonly used in reclamation projects of degraded areas for those authors if the aim of forestation is to reduce soil erosion and runoff p eldarica is the most indicated species as it intercepts more water than the other trees zhang et al 2015 evaluated rainfall partitioning in two species of xerophytic shrub c korshinskii and a ordosica in northwestern china in a region of high water deficit mean annual precipitation of 191 mm as a result c korshinskii displayed values of 74 3 9 0 and 16 7 for tf sf and i while for a ordosica the values were 74 8 2 9 and 22 3 respectively the differences between the species are attributed to their characteristics c korshinskii has smooth stems small leaves waxy branches a more open crown and lai equal to 0 76 m2 m 2 resulting in greater efficiency in stemflow production with less interception loss a ordosica has only one stem which is rough with coarse bark and which hinders stemflow in addition to having a larger lai 1 70 m2 m 2 resulting in greater interception loss 4 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to its characteristics rainfall characteristics are relevant variables for explaining water redistribution in areas of caatinga vegetation the positive relationships between the tf and sf components with gross rainfall and rainfall intensity both jointly and individually indicate that rainfall of greater volume and intensity is more effective in generating flows of these components fig 7 contributing to a reduction in i for small amounts of precipitation the crowns of the trees may not become fully saturated resulting in lower values for tf and sf consequently as the volume and intensity of the rainfall increases greater flows of water are conducted towards the soil since the tree canopy has already reached its maximum storage level van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 zhang et al 2015 in general the relationships between rainfall characteristics and rainfall partitioning indicate that it is possible to estimate their values with some degree of reliability by means of mathematical models derived from linear regressions germer et al 2010 state that the time between maximum rainfall intensity and maximum sf is dependent on the precipitated volume due to the need for the water to reach the canopy storage level in the present study interception loss was the component with the weakest relationships among the components of rainfall partitioning and may be an indication of the existence of other parameters that influence interception loss this result can be evidenced by the weak and even null relationships that do not lead to suitable models germer et al 2010 limin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 gross rainfall rainfall duration and rainfall intensity explain the behavior of the components of rainfall partitioning in the caatinga vegetation fig 7 in the present study gross rainfall gr was a significant predictor this has been confirmed by other studies in which the gr is mainly responsible for the generation of the tf and sf flows limin et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2018 rainfall of longer duration helps the caatinga canopy to intercept more water fig 7 f as also observed by zhang et al 2015 in other ecosystems tf sf and i has been found to be a function of rainfall intensity carlyle moses 2004 although the differences in the partitioning of gross rainfall into stemflow and canopy interception loss depend also on the leaf angle leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention holder 2012 of factors that control during event evaporation meteorological variables e g solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed canopy structure e g species composition height basal area and plant area index carlyle moses 2004 llorens and domingo 2007 interaction between stemflow and the cycling of solutes and transport of particulate matter stemflow and its interactions with canopy fungi and corticolous lichens and stemflow soil interactions levia and germer 2015 in some ecosystems tree morphology may be more relevant to the generation of stemflow than rainfall intensity especially in relation to dbh bäse et al 2012 germer et al 2010 this affirmative also can found in carlyle moses and gash 2011 modeling exercises conducted by gash et al 1995 domingo et al 1998 and van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 the support of this assumption the species under study table 2 are abundant in areas of caatinga and the behavior of rainfall partitioning when interacting with their canopies has a great effect on the local water balance and is deserving of further study however because of the complexity of interaction between the meteorological elements and rainfall behavior amount duration and intensity with canopy characteristics and growth niches of the individual of a species very studies procure to evaluate the partition of rainfall for the ecosystem instead for species by species llorens and domingo 2007 the value for canopy storage for the caatinga 0 98 mm is close to the value of 0 5 mm obtained by medeiros et al 2009 in an area of preserved caatinga zhang et al 2015 found values of 1 3 and 2 2 mm for two xerophytic shrubs in a desert region those authors further point out that the values of antecedent rainfall are required to achieve the water storage capacity of the canopy moreover differences in the threshold values of tf and sf for generating flows between the plant species of the caatinga individually and together indicate that species specific characteristics influence the process of rainfall redistribution germer et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 5 conclusions this study we examined the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i of the caatinga a seasonal dry tropical forest in brazilian semiarid and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning the removal of caatinga may alter the pattern of local hydrological responses and its effects are felt in the suppression of interception by the canopy and this decrease may represent up to 10 3 of gross rainfall the gross rainfall characteristics satisfy the estimates of stemflow throughfall and interception loss processes for semi arid environments these values are significant and cannot be ignored when managing local

1072,rainfall redistribution by forest cover has potential hydrological impacts in semi arid regions due to continuous human intervention studying the process of interception loss by caatinga vegetation and its changes due to deforestation is extremely important for local hydrology however such information is scarce in the literature this study examined the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i in the caatinga vegetation caa and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning the components of rainfall partitioning were measured from 2016 to 2017 to determine the tf and sf respectively and their relationships with rainfall characteristics were evaluated based on linear regression models for the caatinga vegetation tf and sf represent 89 2 and 0 5 of the gross rainfall while interception loss was 10 3 an expressive value that should be included in regional water balance models the rainfall characteristics were able to explain the variations in water partitioning showing that tf and sf increase for events of higher intensity and volume whereas interception loss is mainly associated with events of longer duration for the caatinga stemflow and throughfall usually occur for events of greater than 1 65 mm and 0 98 mm while values for canopy water storage ranged from 0 88 mm to 1 16 mm it is concluded that for semi arid environments these values are significant and cannot be ignored when managing local water resources keywords interception loss semiarid climate stemflow throughfall 1 introduction forest ecosystems are responsible for changes in the mechanism of rainfall entry by its redistribution when interacting with the canopy which plays a prominent role in the local and regional hydrological cycle ávila et al 2014 he et al 2014 llorens and domingo 2007 de moura et al 2009 rainfall above the canopy is divided into three components throughfall stemflow and interception loss carlyle moses 2004 carlyle moses and gash 2011 thus these three processes indicate how rainfall is redistributed in vegetation as the water reaches the canopy llorens and domingo 2007 in the first two cases water flows towards the ground after interacting or not with the vegetation while interception loss refers to water temporarily stored in the canopy which is then lost by evaporation llorens and domingo 2007 de moura et al 2009 sadeghi et al 2016 zheng et al 2018 throughfall is a critical component of the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles of the ecosystems which has high temporal and spatial variability levia and frost 2006 in its turn stemflow despite the small proportion of it is a preferential point of entry for water to the deeper layers of the soil concentrating on the root zone near the stem and making water readily available to the plant roots brasil et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 in arid and semi arid regions this flow of water towards the roots is presumed to be necessary germer et al 2010 zheng et al 2018 interception loss is therefore a key process influencing the availability and distribution of rainfall to other hydrological processes such as evaporation the soil infiltration rate runoff erosion soil moisture and groundwater recharge among others he et al 2014 sajikumar and remya 2015 zhang et al 2018 carlyle moses 2004 showed that in tropical rainforests the percentage of interception loss is around 13 of the gross rainfall in native brazilian forests the interception loss can reach values of 2 4 37 6 of the gross rainfall giglio and kobiyama 2013 with significant spatial variation between the various ecosystems this variation is the result of associations between the meteorological elements microclimate rainfall behavior amount duration and intensity canopy characteristics and growth niches of the plant species carlyle moses 2004 carlyle moses and gash 2011 he et al 2014 medeiros et al 2009 siegert et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2018 zheng et al 2018 the semiarid region of brazil is very fragile due to the encouragement of such practices as the indiscriminate deforestation to extract firewood plant crops and allow overgrazing by animals conducted at caatinga domain a seasonal dry tropical forest that covers most of the semi arid region of the brazilian northeast dória et al 2016 these practices are often carried out under inadequate management aggravating the process of degradation in native areas and increasing the hydrological complexity of the region rodrigues et al 2013 srinivasan et al 2003 precipitation in this region is scarce and irregular with an annual mean value of between 300 and 800 mm and at least five consecutive dry months as rainfall is the main source of water replenishment in the system such conditions result in water scarcity since the region includes only 3 0 of the total volume of water in the country dória et al 2016 medeiros et al 2009 montenegro and ragab 2012 there are few studies on the process of rainfall redistribution in the brazilian semiarid and in areas of caatinga vegetation with only two being found in the literature brasil et al 2017 medeiros et al 2009 in this type of environment interception loss is especially important because the demand for agricultural industrial and residential water depends on soil moisture thresholds groundwater runoff and recharge carlyle moses 2004 giglio and kobiyama 2013 carried out an extensive review of studies on the measurement of interception loss in native brazilian forests in order to identify which environments should be prioritized in future research among the works reviewed 25 were conducted in the atlantic forest 15 in the amazon and another 4 divided between the cerrado 3 and an area of caatinga 1 the partitioning of rainfall in seasonally dry tropical forests such as caatinga may support government policies based on the study of local hydrological balance as well as allow the assessment of the impacts of change in land use and land cover in these environments carlyle moses 2004 llorens and domingo 2007 moreover the quantification of the interception loss by caatinga vegetation has wide application for the international scientific community especially regarding the estimation of parameters required by interception loss models giglio and kobiyama 2013 the aim of this study was to examine the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i in the caatinga vegetation a seasonal dry tropical forest in the semi arid environment and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning moreover it is expected that this study will improve information peculiar to the brazilian semi arid region for use in hydrological models of regionalization of water interception by caatinga vegetation 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the experimental site the study site is located in a rural area in the state of pernambuco brazil the climate in the region is semi arid type bsh alvares et al 2013 with a mean annual rainfall of 489 mm occurring mainly between december and april in addition to the variations in rainfall there are strong seasonal differences in terms of air temperature relative humidity and other meteorological variables table 1 the experimental area is located in the caam des at system caatinga vegetation cam plants and areas under desertification interacting with the atmosphere 08 18 31 s 38 31 37 w 378 m the research was carried out in a private property which has a area of 81 000 m2 composed of vegetation native to the caatinga domain the forest is dominated by arboreal and shrubby plant species such as spondias tuberosa jatropha molíssima aspidosperma pyrifolium and cenostigma pyramidale of these species many presented microphylls and xeromorphism and strongly modify the landscape throughout the year as a response to the local water restrictions medeiros et al 2009 silva et al 2014 the vegetation has a variable height of 3 15 m and during the wet period it is composed of native tree like shrub and herbaceous stratum species while in the dry period it is composed of leafless tree like shrub species and bare soil fig 1 2 2 plant selection and measurement in the area of caatinga the forest inventory was carried out in 25 plots with 400 m2 each in order to identify the main families of plants and characteristics of the predominant species based on inventory results twenty seven healthy vigorous plants were selected for monitoring rainfall partitioning in the field these plants represent five dominant plant species in the area spondias tuberosa commiphora leptophloeos cnidoscolus quercifoliu aspidosperma pyrifolium and cenostigma pyramidale randomly distributed over the experimental site table 2 the following were measured in each plant the total height from the base of the stem to the last green leaf the diameter at breast height dbh at 1 3 m and the crown projection area approximated as circular from the values of the east west and north south diameters measured from the stem to the edge of the canopy in addition we counted the number of stems per plant as well as estimated plant area index pai to obtain the pai measurements of photosynthetically active radiation were performed monthly obtaining readings above

reaching the top of the canopy the gr data series was recorded by automatic rain gauges cs700 l hydrological services liverpool australia with a resolution of 0 254 mm the rain gauges were installed at a height of 8 m at the top of micrometeorological towers located at the observation sites in the caa fig 2 a rainfall quantity and duration data were recorded at 10 min intervals and stored on a cr10x datalogger campbell scientific inc logan utah usa 2 4 throughfall and stemflow the throughfall tf mm was measured with 15 homemade pvc rain gauges one per tree with a height of 0 43 cm and a collection surface of 707 cm2 installed at a height of 1 0 m above the ground fig 2 b and c the rain gauges were repositioned during the monitoring period the each three events in order to reduce the effects of spatial variability in the readings and to minimize estimation errors vernimmen et al 2007 the throughfall was calculated from eq 1 as described in zhang et al 2015 2018 1 tf v pi ac where tf is the throughfall mm v pi is the volume of water that passed through the canopy l and ac is the area of the collector and or rain gage m2 to quantify stemflow sf zinc gutters with a height of 0 15 m and lengths depending on the trunk circumference of the trees were installed at a height of 1 30 m with monitoring in 12 plants fig 2 d it was decided to choose plants with a circumference of 20 cm at a height of 1 30 m due to the ease of installing the gutters this resulted in dbh classes of 5 10 cm and 10 20 cm bäse et al 2012 the sf was calculated according to eq 2 2 sf v et pa where sf is the flow of water along the trunk mm v sf is the volume of water in the measured stemflow l and pa is the canopy projection area m2 zhang et al 2015 there was no average distance between the pluviometers and gutters however it was sought to allocate them in circles around the micrometeorological tower with distances varying from 6 to 113 m in order to avoid evaporation the rainfall was directed by a hose fixed to the tf and sf collectors which were made of individual plastic containers with a capacity of 10 l the measurements were carried out with a graduated cylinder in short of the 27 plants selected the internal rain gauges were allocated to 15 and the stem flow gutters to 12 and distributed randomly in nearby of the micrometeorological station under the canopy of dominant species in the area fig 3 the values of tf and sf were obtained by the arithmetic mean of the gauges measurements per species in each rain event 2 5 interception loss the interception loss was obtained for each rainfall event bäse et al 2012 he et al 2014 eq 3 3 i gr tf sf where gr is the gross rainfall obtained in an open area mm the monitoring period for rainfall partitioning was from march 2016 to september 2017 with measurements on a weekly daily event scale depending on access conditions to the area after the rainfall rainfall that did not originate tf and or sf was not recorded as an event the stemflow and throughtfall transfer rainfall from the canopy of plants to the forest soil giglio and kobiyama 2013 however in caatinga areas the vegetation does not fully cover the soil due to its sparse configuration forest that has significant open spaces between the treetops which could cause overestimations in the calculations of these processes when extrapolated to the entire area of the land to solve this gap we determined the vegetation and soil cover index by means of orbital images between the years 2016 and 2017 for an area of 81 000 m2 corresponds to the limits of the monitored property seven images of the landsat 8 satellite were obtained https earthexplorer usgs gov using as a criterion of choice have at least 80 area no clouds based on these images the ndvi normalized difference vegetation index was determined for each date the identification of the areas covered by vegetation and exposed soil was made based on a supervised classification using software qgis version 4 3 3 considering ndvi values higher than 0 2 as vegetation herbaceous and or tree 2 6 rainfall characteristics the influence of the rainfall characteristics quantity duration and intensity on the components of partitioning were explored through linear regression models for this a data set consisting of 81 points was used i e the 32 rainfall events that generated tf and sf were included as well as rainfall with smaller values that did not promote partitioning all seen from march 2016 to september 2017 2 7 statistical analysis descriptive statistics and the normality test were applied to the data for throughfall stemflow and interception loss and to the characteristics of gross rainfall quantity duration and intensity for the latter histograms of class distribution were created friedman s paired test was used to determine which plant species show statistically different mean rates for rainfall partitioning p 0 05 the linear regressions between the rainfall components and their partitioning were evaluated by means of the significance of the equations and their parameters all statistical procedures were carried out with the statistical software and data

characteristics eighty one rainfall events were recorded during the experimental period from march 2016 to september 2017 with a total of 536 5 mm the rainfall was unevenly distributed throughout the year and between years so that to study rainfall partitioning only 32 rainfall events were used since for the other events the small amount of rainfall did not result in throughfall and or stemflow during the 32 events 506 3 mm were recorded with a difference of only 30 2 mm in relation to the total for the period fig 4 shows the daily rainfall amount fig 4 a duration fig 4 b and intensity fig 4 c during the 32 events from 2016 to 2017 the amount of precipitated water varied from 2 8 to 48 8 mm with a mean value of 15 8 mm standard deviation 11 3 mm rainfall duration ranged from 0 7 to 8 7 h with a mean value of 3 4 h standard deviation 2 2 h while rainfall density ranged from 1 6 to 18 2 mm h 1 with a mean value of 5 6 mm h 1 standard deviation 4 0 mm h 1 it can easily be seen that rainfall distribution was more uniform during 2017 fig 4 a lasting from february to mid july which allowed more constant monitoring of the rainfall partitioning the frequency distribution of the quantity duration and intensity of the rainfall in the 32 events is shown in fig 5 the amount of rainfall was distributed over five classes events with precipitation 10 mm were the most frequent however the amount of accumulated rainfall was 72 mm 14 eleven events were recorded in the 10 20 mm class 34 with the highest percentage of total accumulated rainfall 30 corresponding to 153 mm fig 5 a for the intermediate classes 20 30 mm and 30 40 mm the events were less frequent 13 however the gross rainfall for these events was 99 and 132 mm respectively finally only one single event was greater than 40 mm 3 representing 10 of the gross rainfall 48 8 mm fig 5 a events of shorter duration show greater frequency twenty one events had a duration of less than or equal to 4 h corresponding to 66 of the total and accumulating 316 mm of rain equivalent to 62 of the gross rainfall fig 5 b rainfall lasting from 4 to 8 h occurred in 28 of the events with an accumulated total of 162 mm 32 individual rainfall events lasting more than 6 h were equal to 6 of the total events and to 6 of the gross rainfall fig 5 b the frequency distribution of rainfall intensity was skewed to the number of events and amount of rain showing that lower intensities 0 to 5 mm h 1 are the most frequent 18 events 56 of the total the accumulated rainfall for these events was 199 mm 39 of the total fig 5 c the class of intermediate intensity had the second highest occurrence with 31 of events 10 and an accumulated rainfall similar to the previous class 35 two rainfall events with an intensity between 10 and 15 mm h 1 and greater than 15 mm h 1 were recorded but at a different percentage of the gross rainfall 17 and 9 respectively fig 5 c 3 2 rainfall partitioning in the area of caatinga based on orbital image analysis we identified that vegetation and soil covers were equal to 57 5 and 43 5 respectively with tf sf and i calculated only for the canopy area the individual rainfall in the 32 events expressed as throughfall stemflow and interception loss associated with the amount and intensity of the rain is shown in fig 6 for the experimental period nine rainfall events totaling 146 7 mm 19 march to 18 december were recorded during the first year 2016 in contrast 23 rainfall events were recorded during the second year 2017 totaling 359 6 mm 2 february to 14 july respectively representing 29 and 71 of the precipitated volume fig 6 among the components of rainfall partitioning throughfall tf had the greatest variation for the monitored events ranging from 1 32 to 46 8 mm 11 00 mm and responding positively to the gross rainfall fig 6 the values for sf were very low in the caatinga ranging from 0 to 0 53 mm 0 15 mm greater values for stemflow were only seen during events of higher rainfall volume and reduced intensity such as events 9 11 17 19 20 21 27 and 29 sf 0 25 mm fig 6 for interception loss i the values ranged from 0 9 to 8 78 mm 1 61 mm in addition slightly higher i values were seen during the later rainfall events in each year events 8 and 9 in 2016 and events 30 31 and 32 in 2017 fig 6 however this component showed little change as a function of rainfall intensity or quantity during rainfall events displaying similar values during most of the events the percentage values of tf and sf are equal to 89 2 and 0 5 respectively resulting in interception loss by the caatinga vegetation is therefore equal to 10 3 of the gr 3 3 rainfall partitioning in relation to rainfall characteristics the rainfall characteristics quantity duration and intensity displayed significant positive relationships with all the components of rainfall partitioning throughfall stemflow and interception loss fig 7 the results of the regression analysis for the total amount of rainfall gr indicated that all the components had a linear and positive correlation 0 44 r 2 0 98 p 0 0001 showing a better fit for throughfall and stemflow depth fig 7 a and b according to the adjusted equations the rainfall threshold for generating throughfall and stemflow is 0 98 and 1 65 mm respectively the first value can therefore be considered the canopy storage capacity of the caatinga significant positive relationships were obtained between rainfall duration and the components of rainfall partitioning tf sf i p 0 05 with linear increments fig 7 d f tf and sf displayed a significant linear relationship with rainfall duration albeit relatively weak while i had the best fit r 2 0 71 p 0 0001 rainfall intensity mm h 1 was able to explain the variations in throughfall stemflow and interception loss p 0 001 fig 7 g i tf and sf showed a positive trend with the increase in intensity while the smallest adjustment between these variables was obtained for i r 2 0 22 fig 7 i 4 discussion 4 1 rainfall partitioning in the area of caatinga for the study region it was found that rainfall greater than or equal to 20 mm with a duration of over 4 h and an intensity of less than or equal to 5 mm h 1 are the most frequent fig 5 this result directly affects rainfall partitioning when coming into contact with the plant canopy the behavior of the throughfall during the 32 rainfall events proved to be quite variable with a pattern similar to that of the gross rainfall during the entire experimental period higher values for tf than for gr drip points were obtained in five rainfall events this is common in studies of interception loss due to the existence of preferential drip points in the canopy and seen mainly during continuous rainfall events de moura et al 2009 siegert et al 2016 vernimmen et al 2007 vernimmen et al 2007 found an increase in the occurrence of drip points as the precipitated volume increased reaching an occurrence frequency of 33 3 in this study the reduced number of drip points is due to the practice of placing rain gauges throughout the course of the experimental period a practice that should be encouraged in research with caatinga vegetation where canopy formation occurs continuously throughout the rainy period sf contribution was small for events of reduced precipitated volume and vice versa however in general stemflow volume was minimal brasil et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 zheng et al 2018 already values for interception loss varied little between rainfall events irrespective of the amount of precipitated water however slightly higher values for interception loss were seen during the later events and it can be assumed that the sequence of rainfall events allowed the complete formation of plant biomass by the species ávila et al 2014 found that the percentage of tf during dry periods was significantly higher than during wet periods thus a greater volume of water passes through the canopy and reaches the soil surface during the dry season resulting in fewer interception losses those authors associate this behavior with the semi deciduous forest formation with leaf fall during the dry season it is therefore likely that both the tf and i also correlate with the characteristics of the canopy based on the data obtained at the experimental site of caatinga vegetation it can be seen that the 506 mm of gross rainfall resulted in values for throughfall stemflow and interception loss of 89 2 0 5 and 10 3 respectively medeiros et al 2009 found similar values in a preserved area of tree like caatinga with values for tf sf and i of 81 0 6 0 and 13 0 respectively brasil et al 2017 reported values for tf of 79 6 sf of 2 0 and i of 18 4 of the total incident precipitation in an area of caatinga after 28 years of regeneration both studies were conducted in the semi arid region of the state of ceará the results of the present study agree with those obtained in other climate regions using different types of vegetation and management from natural forests to planted forests fig 8 in those studies it can be seen that throughfall is the main way water enters the forest with values ranging from 46 2 to 91 6 stemflow represents 0 2 to 11 8 of the gross rainfall and interception loss ranges between 8 1 and 44 8 the value for interception loss obtained in this study 10 3 is quite significant for the region since the intercepted volume will return to the atmosphere to compose the mass of water vapor considering that for the most part caatinga vegetation is characterized by species that have microphylls small leaves it is to be expected that the percentage of interception loss be lower than for other plant typologies fig 8 due to the reduced water storage capacity of the canopy however some authors suggest that the high rates of evaporation in the region might create a cycle from the interception loss by the canopy to its subsequent return to the atmosphere during and after rainfall events allowing the continuous storage of water brasil et al 2017 medeiros et al 2009 for other arid and semi arid regions of the world studies of interception losses are more frequent serving as an aid in the application of models domingo et al 1998 gash et al 1995 the implementation and evaluation of recovery projects and in hydrological budgets he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 2018 sadeghi et al 2016 found significant differences in all the components of water partitioning in four species commonly used in reclamation projects of degraded areas for those authors if the aim of forestation is to reduce soil erosion and runoff p eldarica is the most indicated species as it intercepts more water than the other trees zhang et al 2015 evaluated rainfall partitioning in two species of xerophytic shrub c korshinskii and a ordosica in northwestern china in a region of high water deficit mean annual precipitation of 191 mm as a result c korshinskii displayed values of 74 3 9 0 and 16 7 for tf sf and i while for a ordosica the values were 74 8 2 9 and 22 3 respectively the differences between the species are attributed to their characteristics c korshinskii has smooth stems small leaves waxy branches a more open crown and lai equal to 0 76 m2 m 2 resulting in greater efficiency in stemflow production with less interception loss a ordosica has only one stem which is rough with coarse bark and which hinders stemflow in addition to having a larger lai 1 70 m2 m 2 resulting in greater interception loss 4 2 rainfall partitioning in relation to its characteristics rainfall characteristics are relevant variables for explaining water redistribution in areas of caatinga vegetation the positive relationships between the tf and sf components with gross rainfall and rainfall intensity both jointly and individually indicate that rainfall of greater volume and intensity is more effective in generating flows of these components fig 7 contributing to a reduction in i for small amounts of precipitation the crowns of the trees may not become fully saturated resulting in lower values for tf and sf consequently as the volume and intensity of the rainfall increases greater flows of water are conducted towards the soil since the tree canopy has already reached its maximum storage level van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 zhang et al 2015 in general the relationships between rainfall characteristics and rainfall partitioning indicate that it is possible to estimate their values with some degree of reliability by means of mathematical models derived from linear regressions germer et al 2010 state that the time between maximum rainfall intensity and maximum sf is dependent on the precipitated volume due to the need for the water to reach the canopy storage level in the present study interception loss was the component with the weakest relationships among the components of rainfall partitioning and may be an indication of the existence of other parameters that influence interception loss this result can be evidenced by the weak and even null relationships that do not lead to suitable models germer et al 2010 limin et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 gross rainfall rainfall duration and rainfall intensity explain the behavior of the components of rainfall partitioning in the caatinga vegetation fig 7 in the present study gross rainfall gr was a significant predictor this has been confirmed by other studies in which the gr is mainly responsible for the generation of the tf and sf flows limin et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 2018 rainfall of longer duration helps the caatinga canopy to intercept more water fig 7 f as also observed by zhang et al 2015 in other ecosystems tf sf and i has been found to be a function of rainfall intensity carlyle moses 2004 although the differences in the partitioning of gross rainfall into stemflow and canopy interception loss depend also on the leaf angle leaf hydrophobicity and water droplet retention holder 2012 of factors that control during event evaporation meteorological variables e g solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed canopy structure e g species composition height basal area and plant area index carlyle moses 2004 llorens and domingo 2007 interaction between stemflow and the cycling of solutes and transport of particulate matter stemflow and its interactions with canopy fungi and corticolous lichens and stemflow soil interactions levia and germer 2015 in some ecosystems tree morphology may be more relevant to the generation of stemflow than rainfall intensity especially in relation to dbh bäse et al 2012 germer et al 2010 this affirmative also can found in carlyle moses and gash 2011 modeling exercises conducted by gash et al 1995 domingo et al 1998 and van dijk and bruijnzeel 2001 the support of this assumption the species under study table 2 are abundant in areas of caatinga and the behavior of rainfall partitioning when interacting with their canopies has a great effect on the local water balance and is deserving of further study however because of the complexity of interaction between the meteorological elements and rainfall behavior amount duration and intensity with canopy characteristics and growth niches of the individual of a species very studies procure to evaluate the partition of rainfall for the ecosystem instead for species by species llorens and domingo 2007 the value for canopy storage for the caatinga 0 98 mm is close to the value of 0 5 mm obtained by medeiros et al 2009 in an area of preserved caatinga zhang et al 2015 found values of 1 3 and 2 2 mm for two xerophytic shrubs in a desert region those authors further point out that the values of antecedent rainfall are required to achieve the water storage capacity of the canopy moreover differences in the threshold values of tf and sf for generating flows between the plant species of the caatinga individually and together indicate that species specific characteristics influence the process of rainfall redistribution germer et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 5 conclusions this study we examined the partitioning of rainfall into throughfall tf stemflow sf and interception loss i of the caatinga a seasonal dry tropical forest in brazilian semiarid and evaluated the influence of rainfall characteristics on this partitioning the removal of caatinga may alter the pattern of local hydrological responses and its effects are felt in the suppression of interception by the canopy and this decrease may represent up to 10 3 of gross rainfall the gross rainfall characteristics satisfy the estimates of stemflow throughfall and interception loss processes for semi arid environments these values are significant and cannot be ignored when managing local

1073,evapotranspiration is the major component of the water cycle excluding precipitation evapotranspiration sub processes represent important paths of water which have been poorly investigated and may play an important role in the water cycle two of these sub processes are root water uptake rwu and root hydraulic redistribution rhr which were modelled and numerically explored in this study both rwu and rhr were evaluated using the source sink term in richards equation coupled to a vegetation atmosphere system this coupling composes a model of water transfer in which the interplay between evapotranspiration and three different root density distributions exponential linear and constant scenarios was simulated to understand mainly the influence of rooting systems on rwu and rhr the results showed that the model consistently described the water dynamics and accurately estimated water fluxes with evapotranspiration and rwu greater under the constant scenario rhr contributed from simulations up to 21 of the evapotranspiration on a daily basis precipitation events may invert the direction of rhr from upward hydraulic lift to downward the last process tends to conserve soil moisture in the root zone the root systems modified the dynamics of the drainage being the exponential scenario the greatest contributor to free drainage keywords water cycle root water uptake hydraulic lift hydrological modeling 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration is the second largest component in the water cycle oki and kanae 2006 but it depends on the water availability for evaporation upper soil layers and transpiration transpiration in vegetated regions returns at least approximately half of the precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in addition this process is coupled to carbon assimilation volpe et al 2013 and is related to soil plant hydrodynamics at different scales nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 hence root water uptake rwu becomes an important mechanism in the water and carbon cycles understanding processes on the soil plant atmosphere system and translating them into physically based models is a task in ecohydrology and water resources researches root water uptake mechanisms have been incorporated into hydrological models as a bulk sink term in richards equation gardner 1964 nimah and hanks 1973 feddes et al 2001 hopmans and bristow 2002 gumiere et al 2006 usually this sink term is calculated using the water potential gradient between soil and tree roots the water flux from the soil to the rooting system depends on the vertical root distribution the soil texture and the water flow conductance at the soil root interface nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 the interplay between soil moisture i e water potential and hydraulic conductivity and root distribution at each layer creates conditions for water to be redistributed through the rooting system in the soil profile in two directions upwards and downwards amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2014 the upward moisture transfer is known as hydraulic lift and occurs when the rooting system takes water from deeper soil layers moister and lifts it to upper layers drier this phenomenon occurs during nighttime whereas during daytime transpiration demand at the canopy level drives the water movement the downward transfer is triggered by rainfall events that moisten soil surface more than bottom soil layers resulting in a downward gradient both directions upward and downward of moisture movement are known as the root hydraulic redistribution rhr manoli et al 2014 2017 huang et al 2017 rhr is well known in ecology dawson 1993 horton and hart 1998 and has been observed in different vegetation types in brazilian biomes such as the cerrado moreira et al 2003 scholz et al 2008 and the amazon forest nepstad et al 1994 oliveira et al 2005 crops such as soybean rice zegada lizarazu and iijima 2004 maize wan et al 2000 cotton wang et al 2009 and others caldwell et al 1998 liste and white 2008 have also presented rhr recent works have modelled rhr using different approaches and scales from local gardner 1964 feddes et al 2001 siqueira et al 2008 huang et al 2017 to regional and global amenu and kumar 2008 schneider et al 2010 miguezmacho and fan 2012 lee et al 2005 it has been reported that rhr can enhance ecosystem services by improving nutrient cycling and by being a strategy to cope with water stress horton and hart 1998 moreira et al 2003 for example in dry seasons rhr promotes water movement at night from deep moist soil to dry shallow soil where plant fine roots are denser in wet seasons water can also move down from shallow layers to deep layers via the rooting system to reduce the loss through surface runoff or evaporation amenu and kumar 2008 li et al 2012 the implementation of rwu and rhr in hydrological models has resulted in more realistic models with higher accuracy in soil moisture water storage and evapotranspiration estimates particularly in drought prone and drought stressed regions nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 lee et al 2005 amenu and kumar 2008 tang et al 2015 according to lee et al 2005 the inclusion of hydraulic lift in a regional atmospheric model led to an increase of 40 in evapotranspiration over the amazon tropical forest amenu and kumar 2008 implemented a mechanistic rhr based on the hagen poiseuille equation to a large scale model and observed a significant improvement in the latent heat flux estimate over a drought prone region in southern california this improvement is attributed to the fact that the water potential gradient intensifies during the dry season rhr which requires a water potential gradient between upper and lower soil layers in order to occur can help maintain evapotranspiration at high rates and delays vegetation water stress siqueira et al 2008 schneider et al 2010 miguezmacho and fan 2012 goulden et al 2016 therefore rhr is a significant term in the model that should be accounted for to accurately estimate water fluxes however the rhr and rwu modelling are not an easy task and there are a couple of associated challenges according to braud et al 2005 siqueira et al 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 volpe et al 2013 the interplay of soil type and vertical root distribution can provide different soil moisture dynamics volpe et al 2013 used three distinct root distributions on a grassland dominated region and concluded that a linear root distribution uptakes more water but is less sensitive to water stress over a drying period hence root distribution becomes an important input for hydrological models nevertheless this information is somewhat scarce for various vegetation types and biomes amenu and kumar 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 castanho et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 an additional challenge to model rhr and rwu arises from vegetation and soil inputs in the case of vegetation inputs for example biophysical parameters associated to stomatal resistance photosynthetic capacity bonan et al 2014 castanho et al 2013 water use efficiency volpe et al 2013 and xylem vulnerability huang et al 2017 are crucial parameters for models however information on these is very limited and restricted to certain areas for soil hydraulic parameters and texture are very spatially heterogeneous which cause different responses for a same vegetation type amenu and kumar 2008 seidl et al 2012 manoli et al 2014 moreover water table depth has an influence on root water uptake and rhr dynamics which in turn can modify bottom drainage amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2014 the modelling of the rhr and rwu involve the numerical solution of the fluxes of water in the soil vegetation atmosphere system the so called soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models nimah and hanks 1973 braud et al 2005 mihailovic and ruml 1996 siqueira et al 2008 manzoni et al 2013b manoli et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 flux estimations are based on water and energy balances on soil layers and aboveground respectively svat models have been constantly updated with the inclusion of sub processes that improve the model outputs mainly on vadose zone which is the most dynamical compartment oliveira et al 2015 considering the above we aimed to explore numerically the dynamics of soil moisture root water uptake and rhr as a case study for a clay soil type in northern pantanal of mato grosso state brazil the site presents an inundation period that finishes in july johnson et al 2013 as the soil moisture in this region depletes progressively from july to september fantin cruz et al 2011 schwerdtfeger et al 2014 vegetation presents a more superficial rooting system and has different distributions along soil depth salis et al 2014 in addition this region presents shallow groundwater fantin cruz et al 2011 which can provide plants access to water during dry periods we hypothesized that this context must promote a favourable condition for rhr associated with root water uptake rwu dynamics we tested three different scenarios of rooting system profile coupled to rhr as a sink term in richards equation that was solved for a vertical dimensional 1d representation thus we specifically investigated the interplay of these three rooting system profiles and rhr seeking to know which rooting system promotes higher rates of root hydraulic lift rhr in the upward direction in addition we explored the behavior of the downwards rhr on the soil vegetation system from a precipitation event 20 mm within a 30 days period finally we run a simulation using the same precipitation event over 30 days to investigate the role of root density distribution on free drainage below rooting system output component 2 materials and methods a description of rwu and rwr models is presented in this section including the richards equation for water transport in the soil rwu needs a transpiration component to force the model thereby a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model fig 1 was developed to account for transpiration and evapotranspiration conveniently this is an aboveground energy balance model that aims for our purpose to split evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and transpiration components that may provide a second generation water balance it was based mainly on siqueira et al 2008 and mihailovic and eitzinger 2007 and is described in appendix a 2 1 water movement in soil water transport in unsaturated soil is described by the combination of darcy s law and mass conservation for unsaturated conditions richards 1931 gardner 1964 reichardt and timm 2004 and is assigned as richards equation and can be expressed in ψs based

water retention curve which is related to soil texture campbell and norman 2012 due to high non linearly in richards equation involving the second term in eq 1 a kirchhoff integral transformation to ψs campbell 1985 bittelli et al 2015 can be applied to overcome this issue defining a matric potential expressed as φ ψ s k s d ψ s k s ψ s 1 n where n is a dimensionless parameter described in eq 4 it is an alternative way of linearizing the problem and to decrease computational demands siqueira et al 2008 the newton raphson nr iterative method was used to find the solution for ψs being applied to a soil water balance function fi at each layer i discretized as 4 f i k s i ψ s i k s i 1 ψ s i 1 1 n z i z i 1 k s i 1 ψ s i 1 k s i ψ s i 1 n z i 1 z i g k s i k s i 1 ρ w θ s i j 1 θ s i j z i 1

eq 4 is integrated the nr method algorithm creates a tridiagonal jacobian matrix of fi can be solved by thomas algorithm bittelli et al 2008 2 2 rwu modelling the source sink term er is a key component for modelling rhr both upward and downward dynamics to define er the rooting system is here described as a network like structure fig 1 in which each layer is directly connected to a conduit like xylem vessel the overall conductance g s r kg s m 4 is proportional to hydraulic conductivity root density and root permeability zhang et al 2014 and stands for flow across two pathways in series i conductance associated to the transfer of water from the soil to the root surface interface k s s s 1 ii conductance associated to the water movement from root surface interface to the rooting system k s r s 1 the modelling described is similar to that presented by volpe et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 as follows 5 g s r z ρ w g k s s z k s r z k s s z k s r z where kss is formulated as 6 k s s z g ρ w k s z α r a i z and ksr is 7 k s r z p r r a i z d z z here α l r a i d r is associated to a distance for water to reach root soil interface and therefore is related to total root area

is root permeability assumed to be 3 5 10 8 s 1 details in supplementary material dz is depth of each layer that increases geometrically from the surface in this model fig 1 the root distribution functions were based on measurement carried out by jackson et al 1996 and jackson mooney and schulze 1997 throughout several vegetation types in our study the rooting system profiles were represented by three different functions such as exponential linear and constant and assumed based on salis et al 2014 and field observation such as braud et al 2005 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 8 d r z β z l n β and 9 d r z 2 c z l 2 1 c l where dr z is the root density distribution in eq 9 when c is set as zero this equation becomes a constant root profile β is a fitting parameter and represents the shape of root profile if it approximates to the unit more linear is the profile finally the sink term er can be computed as a product between overall conductance and root water potential ψr kpa such as 10 e r z g s r z ψ s z ψ r note that er can be positive when one has rwu or negative when one has rhr root water potential ψr is given by 11 ψ r n i 1 ψ si g sri q r i 1 n g sri where q r kg m 2 s 1 is the net root water uptake to close this problem an atmospheric forcing for transpiration equation must be added that allows the water to be extracted from the vegetation thus transpiration t r mm d 1 eq 13 from aboveground energy balance is estimated and details are presented in appendix a integrating er z in steady state yields q r kg m 2 s 1 converted to mm d 1 for following analyses that represents the net water uptake from the soil to leaves without considering vegetation capacity to storage water hence it is slightly less than the tr the relationship between tr and qr is provided in a17 both components are described as 12 q r i 1 n g sri ψ si ψ l ρ w g h c g p g p i 1 n g sri and 13 t r m w g s h 2 o g b v r ρ w g s h 2 o g b v h f e t s v t s v e a v t a v where gravitational potential ρwghc is also included due to canopy height hc 15 m to be a non negligible effect manzoni et al 2013a do not take account gravitational potential for plants smaller than 10 m canopy height gp is a bulk vegetation conductance r is the universal gas constant jmo l 1 k 1 mw is the water molecular weight kg mo l 1 hf is the fractional humidity it serves to correct moisture within the

supplementary material and gbv are stomatal and boundary layer conductance s m s 1 respectively gbv has been well discussed elsewhere vendrame et al 2000 sallo 2017 gives more details to parameters description for eq 13 to compute qr the vegetation conductance g p kg s m 4 is formulated following manzoni et al 2013b and is represented typically by a weibull function volpe et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 or similar to a sigmoid shape manzoni et al 2013b such as 14 g p g m a x 1 ψ r ψ l 2 ψ 50 a 1 where g m a x 5 42 10 8 m s 1 is the maximum vegetation hydraulic conductivity and was obtained using manzoni et al 2013b methodology the maximum hydraulic conductivity should be converted to a convenient conductance unit kg s m 4 by multiplying to ρw g in this case hc is stands for a measure of the average hydraulic length within the vegetation in turn related to canopy height novick et al 2009 a 3 and ψ 50 2 10 3 kpa are a shape parameter and the leaf water potential at 50 loss of conductivity more details in supplementary material the svat model presented here is an improved water dynamic model as compared with elsewhere tuzet et al 2003 and gumiere et al 2006 2 3 performance and model input for simulating the svat model typically atmospheric forcing variables supplementary material for energy balance and soil properties are required as a top down model it needs the air temperature k relative air humidity wind speed m s 1 ground heat flux w m 2 incident short wave radiation flux w m 2 and prescribed soil temperature k at the bottom boundary in this particular case we used a measured soil temperature at 0 35 m for more realistic representation the model accounts for ponded water however it was not analyzed here since most of our study focuses on the investigation of soil water dynamics during a drying period and that region northern pantanal presents a propitious dry season from may to september fantin cruz et al 2011 we compute a typical day from measured data supplementary material for all input variables which were repeated daily for the 30 days simulated therefore the initial condition for soil water content was set as saturated status 0 46 m 3 m 3 the campbell water retention curve parameters used for all simulation were ψ s s a t 2 6 k p a b 6 8 k s s a t 5 4 10 4 kg s m 3 more details in supplementary material the run time step was set as 600 s and is in agreement with mihailovic and eitzinger 2007 mihailovic et al 2010 the soil depth was divided by 40 layers having different size near to surface layers are thinner than deeper ones which increases geometrically fig 1 prior to presenting the analyses from the numerical runs an evaluation of the svat model was conducted for a forest stand dominated by pioneer species vochysia divergens pohl vochysiaceae sanches et al 2015 the measured evapotranspiration average daily cycle fig 3 was compared with the simulated from svat model note that the model reproduced the dynamics of tr and qr thereby lending some confidence in its performance we observed that evapotranspiration reached greater values than tr as soil evaporation contributes to water flux mainly at midday the delay between tr eq 12 and qr eq 13 agrees with the observations made by sallo et al 2017 and this effect is due to vegetation capacitance supplementary material when considering capacitance a more realistic soil water dynamic is observed and this influences the water movement during nighttime this is an improvement from previous works from siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 and manoli et al 2014 the soil dynamics coupled with the three root vertical distributions was explored from four runs in which three of them considered the different vertical distributions and the last one allowed us to evaluate a precipitation event of 20 mm simulated with the exponential scenario ultimately the free drainage dynamic was evaluated for the last run attempting to find the influence of root distribution in the conversion of green water soil water available for vegetation to transpire and for microorganism activity to blue water runoff and groundwater 3 results and discussion note firstly that the modelled accumulated evapotranspiration fig 4 reached approximately 124 mm average for three scenarios and it agreed with sanches et al 2011 that observed about 3 mm d 1 during the july and august also a slight difference from these three root distributions was noted constant and linear distributions presented the greatest accumulated evapotranspiration during the 30 days period while exponential distribution experienced 4 mm less soil evaporation in simulations remained similar for the three scenarios representing approximately 20 of evapotranspiration hence we concluded that the exponential root distribution may experience more resistance to water uptake than the others for the whole period the simulated rwu for the exponential scenario fig 5 captured maximum rwu rates at the beginning reaching a rate of 0 69 mm d 1 on the shallow layers maximum rwu rates were caused by greater root density and high hydraulic conductivity but this maximum rwu region migrated to deeper soil this effect is caused mainly by the interplay of soil moisture hydraulic conductivity and root density which created a preferential condition for greater water flux rates at middle approx 0 6 m layers rather than shallow ones the drop of high rwu rates emerged from the fast darcian redistribution and drainage in the first days that promoted a decrease in soil moisture on the shallower layers which in turn decreased rapidly the hydraulic conductivity and the movement of soil water the nighttime rwu at deep layers was almost imperceptible rhr near to zero until about the 12th day but it intensified in the following days this process occurred due to the transpiration demand in the daytime to be more intense than the capacity of root water uptake consequently it created a water potential gradient between soil and roots that was balanced at nighttime similar dynamics are reported in volpe et al 2013 and manoli et al 2014 the depth from where water is taken up at nighttime varied depending on root distribution in the soil profile and promoted different dynamics as shown in figures 5 to 7 a portion of nighttime water uptake could have been redistributed along the soil profile and it was driven by water potential gradient between root and soil siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 the rwu rate was greater in the constant scenario 0 96 mm d 1 while in the linear 0 67 mm d 1 and exponential scenarios 0 70 mm d 1 it was quite similar schneider et al 2010 reported similar results using a 3d rwu model yet they observed a decrease in the rwu for an exponential like profile over drying time manoli et al 2014 observed rwu values greater than 2 5 mm d 1 with a maximum transpiration rate of 15 mm d 1 and saturated hydraulic conductivity of ten times greater than that one as the movement of water in the soil to the roots is enhanced when saturated hydraulic conductivity is high we believe that our results for rwu are coherent with real world conditions in each scenario rwu had preference for regions in which conductance at the root soil interface was greater eq 6 note that even though the root density in the exponential scenario is around three times greater than that in the constant the last one developed the highest rwu rates this result suggests that soil moisture is the main variable that maintains soil interface conductance at high levels in addition it was noted the constant scenario presented the lowest nighttime rwu rates the hydraulic redistribution driven by roots is represented in this study by rhr and is presented firstly by hydraulic lift upward redistribution figs 5 7 that occurred intensively in a dry period the three root density distributions behaved differently in terms of rhr rates and layers from where the water was redistributed in the exponential and linear scenarios the rhr rates started to intensify from the 15th day and reached 0 28 and 0 16 mm d 1 respectively while in the constant scenario the maximum rhr rate was lower reaching 0 12 mm d 1 at the 16th day the depth from where the water was redistributed by roots increased for the exponential scenario while in the constant it decreased the depth for redistribution by roots in the linear scenario remained the same for the 30 days period manoli et al 2014 found rhr rates ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm d 1 for a maximum transpiration rate of 15 mm d 1 while in this present study the transpiration rates reached 8 mm d 1 volpe et al 2013 found rhr rate of 0 26 mm d 1 for transpiration rate around 9 mm d 1 by integrating vertically daily rhr fig 8 it was possible to obtain the daily allocated water from the deeper layer that was redistributed to shallower layers initially the daily rhr for the linear scenario was greater than the other scenarios however from the 16th day the exponential became the largest one moreover the exponential scenario was the greatest water allocator the maximum amounts of water redistributed by the constant linear and exponential scenarios were 0 45 0 76 and 0 88 mm d 1 respectively these results are in agreement with siqueira et al 2008 and manoli et al 2014 who found values between 0 5 and 1 1 mm d 1 using different models with 1d and 3d representations respectively our maximum rhr was achieved with delays among the scenarios and followed the sequence linear 20th day constant 22th day and exponential 24th day after these days the rhr decreased progressively this decrease was due to insufficient soil water potential gradient created by root density distribution along the soil profile promoting lower rhr rates within the soil vegetation system in this numerical experiment daily rhr exponential supplied a maximum of 21 of the daily evapotranspiration i e 0 77 mm although several studies have reported a wide range neumann and cardon 2012 liste and white 2008 scholz et al 2010 of the rhr daily transpiration ratio comprising from 1 to 143 neumann and cardon 2012 for cerrado ecosystems that encompass pantanal vegetation types field observations report percentages ranging from 1 scholz et al 2008 to 23 scholz et al 2010 with the maximum values found during the dry season the field observations and numerical experiments with downward rhr have been estimated elsewhere amenu and kumar 2008 volpe et al 2013 neumann and cardon 2012 manoli et al 2014 there is no experimental data for the pantanal ecosystem to a direct comparison with this model the hydraulic lift plays an important role in tropical forests subjected to water stress as at the northern pantanal as the allocated water to shallow layers is used for transpiration and carbon assimilation zeri et al 2014 furthermore tropical forests are highly dependent of nutrient cycling which hydraulic lift can enhance by supplying moisture that is the main driver of litter decomposition li et al 2012 as mentioned before downward rhr occurs when soil moisture is higher at the shallower soil layers e g rain events however its intensity depends on the soil properties and rooting systems this scenario was simulated fig 9 using a total precipitation of 20 mm with the increase of the hydraulic conductivity at shallower layers a sufficient water potential gradient is created within the rooting system that moves water downward hence downward rhr occurs in order to balance soil water potential gradient along the soil profile note that the redistribution rate in this case 1 mm d 1 was greater than the rate obtained for hydraulic lift this is a consequence of the large gradient generated during rainfall the downward rhr occurs mainly in clay soil because infiltration is very slow moreover it can help decrease peak runoff evaporation and soil erosion but the importance of the impact in these three processes is poorly understood li et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 as the rhr may contribute substantially to the transpiration and eventually to percolation fig 9 the inclusion of redistribution on hydrological models can enhance water fluxes estimations as found in amenu and kumar 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 zhu et al 2017 it becomes especially important in forested watersheds with deforestation tendency as the pantanal s basins both upward and downward rhr were influenced by the root density profiles but downward in lesser magnitude considering our results it is possible to infer that when the shallow layer consists of sandy soil and the deeper layer is clay soil downward redistribution could be enhanced as this condition creates a higher water potential gradient along soil profile and within the rooting system additionally the drainage rates may be affected by root density profiles simulated accumulated free drainage for all the scenarios fig 10 showed a difference of about 5 mm on average 4 5 of the total 30 day drainage between exponential and linear profiles with greater accumulated drainage for the exponential profile it is worth to mention that the drainage was not influenced by downward rhr meaning that in this context the green water was not converted to blue water so that the soil moisture was maintained at the root zone similar results were observed for all scenarios complementary simulations are depicted in supplementary material long term simulations were conducted elsewhere amenu and kumar 2008 and reported a reduction in drainage of 60 when comparing to a free root scenario that consequently reduced green water availability the main finding is that rhr and rwu may modify the balance between green and blue water furthermore the findings suggest that the root profiles interact with free drainage and consequently can influence green water management 4 conclusions the numerical experiment explored by means of a svat model the interplay between different root density distributions and the rwu and rhr on the soil water dynamics furthermore the role of rhr on the drainage with precipitation event was investigated the implemented physically based model described coherently the hydrodynamics between soil and rooting system from these findings we can conclude that when high root density is established at shallower soil layers the hydraulic lift is intensified representing until 21 of evapotranspiration for the exponential scenario although the dynamics vary for each scenario this also emphasizes the importance of rhr in the water cycle of a vegetated basin water loss by free drainage could be decreased until 4 5 when the vegetation root profile is linearly distributed compared to an exponential profile thus less significant in this case study on the other hand the downward rhr tends to maintain moisture in the root zone avoiding loss by runoff the main findings suggest that the water budget estimations transpiration evaporation and drainage may be improved when rwu and rhr processes are accounted for conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

1073,evapotranspiration is the major component of the water cycle excluding precipitation evapotranspiration sub processes represent important paths of water which have been poorly investigated and may play an important role in the water cycle two of these sub processes are root water uptake rwu and root hydraulic redistribution rhr which were modelled and numerically explored in this study both rwu and rhr were evaluated using the source sink term in richards equation coupled to a vegetation atmosphere system this coupling composes a model of water transfer in which the interplay between evapotranspiration and three different root density distributions exponential linear and constant scenarios was simulated to understand mainly the influence of rooting systems on rwu and rhr the results showed that the model consistently described the water dynamics and accurately estimated water fluxes with evapotranspiration and rwu greater under the constant scenario rhr contributed from simulations up to 21 of the evapotranspiration on a daily basis precipitation events may invert the direction of rhr from upward hydraulic lift to downward the last process tends to conserve soil moisture in the root zone the root systems modified the dynamics of the drainage being the exponential scenario the greatest contributor to free drainage keywords water cycle root water uptake hydraulic lift hydrological modeling 1 introduction terrestrial evapotranspiration is the second largest component in the water cycle oki and kanae 2006 but it depends on the water availability for evaporation upper soil layers and transpiration transpiration in vegetated regions returns at least approximately half of the precipitation to the atmosphere oki and kanae 2006 in addition this process is coupled to carbon assimilation volpe et al 2013 and is related to soil plant hydrodynamics at different scales nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 hence root water uptake rwu becomes an important mechanism in the water and carbon cycles understanding processes on the soil plant atmosphere system and translating them into physically based models is a task in ecohydrology and water resources researches root water uptake mechanisms have been incorporated into hydrological models as a bulk sink term in richards equation gardner 1964 nimah and hanks 1973 feddes et al 2001 hopmans and bristow 2002 gumiere et al 2006 usually this sink term is calculated using the water potential gradient between soil and tree roots the water flux from the soil to the rooting system depends on the vertical root distribution the soil texture and the water flow conductance at the soil root interface nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 the interplay between soil moisture i e water potential and hydraulic conductivity and root distribution at each layer creates conditions for water to be redistributed through the rooting system in the soil profile in two directions upwards and downwards amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2014 the upward moisture transfer is known as hydraulic lift and occurs when the rooting system takes water from deeper soil layers moister and lifts it to upper layers drier this phenomenon occurs during nighttime whereas during daytime transpiration demand at the canopy level drives the water movement the downward transfer is triggered by rainfall events that moisten soil surface more than bottom soil layers resulting in a downward gradient both directions upward and downward of moisture movement are known as the root hydraulic redistribution rhr manoli et al 2014 2017 huang et al 2017 rhr is well known in ecology dawson 1993 horton and hart 1998 and has been observed in different vegetation types in brazilian biomes such as the cerrado moreira et al 2003 scholz et al 2008 and the amazon forest nepstad et al 1994 oliveira et al 2005 crops such as soybean rice zegada lizarazu and iijima 2004 maize wan et al 2000 cotton wang et al 2009 and others caldwell et al 1998 liste and white 2008 have also presented rhr recent works have modelled rhr using different approaches and scales from local gardner 1964 feddes et al 2001 siqueira et al 2008 huang et al 2017 to regional and global amenu and kumar 2008 schneider et al 2010 miguezmacho and fan 2012 lee et al 2005 it has been reported that rhr can enhance ecosystem services by improving nutrient cycling and by being a strategy to cope with water stress horton and hart 1998 moreira et al 2003 for example in dry seasons rhr promotes water movement at night from deep moist soil to dry shallow soil where plant fine roots are denser in wet seasons water can also move down from shallow layers to deep layers via the rooting system to reduce the loss through surface runoff or evaporation amenu and kumar 2008 li et al 2012 the implementation of rwu and rhr in hydrological models has resulted in more realistic models with higher accuracy in soil moisture water storage and evapotranspiration estimates particularly in drought prone and drought stressed regions nimah and hanks 1973 siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 lee et al 2005 amenu and kumar 2008 tang et al 2015 according to lee et al 2005 the inclusion of hydraulic lift in a regional atmospheric model led to an increase of 40 in evapotranspiration over the amazon tropical forest amenu and kumar 2008 implemented a mechanistic rhr based on the hagen poiseuille equation to a large scale model and observed a significant improvement in the latent heat flux estimate over a drought prone region in southern california this improvement is attributed to the fact that the water potential gradient intensifies during the dry season rhr which requires a water potential gradient between upper and lower soil layers in order to occur can help maintain evapotranspiration at high rates and delays vegetation water stress siqueira et al 2008 schneider et al 2010 miguezmacho and fan 2012 goulden et al 2016 therefore rhr is a significant term in the model that should be accounted for to accurately estimate water fluxes however the rhr and rwu modelling are not an easy task and there are a couple of associated challenges according to braud et al 2005 siqueira et al 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 volpe et al 2013 the interplay of soil type and vertical root distribution can provide different soil moisture dynamics volpe et al 2013 used three distinct root distributions on a grassland dominated region and concluded that a linear root distribution uptakes more water but is less sensitive to water stress over a drying period hence root distribution becomes an important input for hydrological models nevertheless this information is somewhat scarce for various vegetation types and biomes amenu and kumar 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 castanho et al 2013 zhu et al 2017 an additional challenge to model rhr and rwu arises from vegetation and soil inputs in the case of vegetation inputs for example biophysical parameters associated to stomatal resistance photosynthetic capacity bonan et al 2014 castanho et al 2013 water use efficiency volpe et al 2013 and xylem vulnerability huang et al 2017 are crucial parameters for models however information on these is very limited and restricted to certain areas for soil hydraulic parameters and texture are very spatially heterogeneous which cause different responses for a same vegetation type amenu and kumar 2008 seidl et al 2012 manoli et al 2014 moreover water table depth has an influence on root water uptake and rhr dynamics which in turn can modify bottom drainage amenu and kumar 2008 manoli et al 2014 the modelling of the rhr and rwu involve the numerical solution of the fluxes of water in the soil vegetation atmosphere system the so called soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models nimah and hanks 1973 braud et al 2005 mihailovic and ruml 1996 siqueira et al 2008 manzoni et al 2013b manoli et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 flux estimations are based on water and energy balances on soil layers and aboveground respectively svat models have been constantly updated with the inclusion of sub processes that improve the model outputs mainly on vadose zone which is the most dynamical compartment oliveira et al 2015 considering the above we aimed to explore numerically the dynamics of soil moisture root water uptake and rhr as a case study for a clay soil type in northern pantanal of mato grosso state brazil the site presents an inundation period that finishes in july johnson et al 2013 as the soil moisture in this region depletes progressively from july to september fantin cruz et al 2011 schwerdtfeger et al 2014 vegetation presents a more superficial rooting system and has different distributions along soil depth salis et al 2014 in addition this region presents shallow groundwater fantin cruz et al 2011 which can provide plants access to water during dry periods we hypothesized that this context must promote a favourable condition for rhr associated with root water uptake rwu dynamics we tested three different scenarios of rooting system profile coupled to rhr as a sink term in richards equation that was solved for a vertical dimensional 1d representation thus we specifically investigated the interplay of these three rooting system profiles and rhr seeking to know which rooting system promotes higher rates of root hydraulic lift rhr in the upward direction in addition we explored the behavior of the downwards rhr on the soil vegetation system from a precipitation event 20 mm within a 30 days period finally we run a simulation using the same precipitation event over 30 days to investigate the role of root density distribution on free drainage below rooting system output component 2 materials and methods a description of rwu and rwr models is presented in this section including the richards equation for water transport in the soil rwu needs a transpiration component to force the model thereby a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model fig 1 was developed to account for transpiration and evapotranspiration conveniently this is an aboveground energy balance model that aims for our purpose to split evapotranspiration into soil evaporation and transpiration components that may provide a second generation water balance it was based mainly on siqueira et al 2008 and mihailovic and eitzinger 2007 and is described in appendix a 2 1 water movement in soil water transport in unsaturated soil is described by the combination of darcy s law and mass conservation for unsaturated conditions richards 1931 gardner 1964 reichardt and timm 2004 and is assigned as richards equation and can be expressed in ψs based

water retention curve which is related to soil texture campbell and norman 2012 due to high non linearly in richards equation involving the second term in eq 1 a kirchhoff integral transformation to ψs campbell 1985 bittelli et al 2015 can be applied to overcome this issue defining a matric potential expressed as φ ψ s k s d ψ s k s ψ s 1 n where n is a dimensionless parameter described in eq 4 it is an alternative way of linearizing the problem and to decrease computational demands siqueira et al 2008 the newton raphson nr iterative method was used to find the solution for ψs being applied to a soil water balance function fi at each layer i discretized as 4 f i k s i ψ s i k s i 1 ψ s i 1 1 n z i z i 1 k s i 1 ψ s i 1 k s i ψ s i 1 n z i 1 z i g k s i k s i 1 ρ w θ s i j 1 θ s i j z i 1

eq 4 is integrated the nr method algorithm creates a tridiagonal jacobian matrix of fi can be solved by thomas algorithm bittelli et al 2008 2 2 rwu modelling the source sink term er is a key component for modelling rhr both upward and downward dynamics to define er the rooting system is here described as a network like structure fig 1 in which each layer is directly connected to a conduit like xylem vessel the overall conductance g s r kg s m 4 is proportional to hydraulic conductivity root density and root permeability zhang et al 2014 and stands for flow across two pathways in series i conductance associated to the transfer of water from the soil to the root surface interface k s s s 1 ii conductance associated to the water movement from root surface interface to the rooting system k s r s 1 the modelling described is similar to that presented by volpe et al 2013 and zhang et al 2014 as follows 5 g s r z ρ w g k s s z k s r z k s s z k s r z where kss is formulated as 6 k s s z g ρ w k s z α r a i z and ksr is 7 k s r z p r r a i z d z z here α l r a i d r is associated to a distance for water to reach root soil interface and therefore is related to total root area

is root permeability assumed to be 3 5 10 8 s 1 details in supplementary material dz is depth of each layer that increases geometrically from the surface in this model fig 1 the root distribution functions were based on measurement carried out by jackson et al 1996 and jackson mooney and schulze 1997 throughout several vegetation types in our study the rooting system profiles were represented by three different functions such as exponential linear and constant and assumed based on salis et al 2014 and field observation such as braud et al 2005 volpe et al 2013 manoli et al 2014 8 d r z β z l n β and 9 d r z 2 c z l 2 1 c l where dr z is the root density distribution in eq 9 when c is set as zero this equation becomes a constant root profile β is a fitting parameter and represents the shape of root profile if it approximates to the unit more linear is the profile finally the sink term er can be computed as a product between overall conductance and root water potential ψr kpa such as 10 e r z g s r z ψ s z ψ r note that er can be positive when one has rwu or negative when one has rhr root water potential ψr is given by 11 ψ r n i 1 ψ si g sri q r i 1 n g sri where q r kg m 2 s 1 is the net root water uptake to close this problem an atmospheric forcing for transpiration equation must be added that allows the water to be extracted from the vegetation thus transpiration t r mm d 1 eq 13 from aboveground energy balance is estimated and details are presented in appendix a integrating er z in steady state yields q r kg m 2 s 1 converted to mm d 1 for following analyses that represents the net water uptake from the soil to leaves without considering vegetation capacity to storage water hence it is slightly less than the tr the relationship between tr and qr is provided in a17 both components are described as 12 q r i 1 n g sri ψ si ψ l ρ w g h c g p g p i 1 n g sri and 13 t r m w g s h 2 o g b v r ρ w g s h 2 o g b v h f e t s v t s v e a v t a v where gravitational potential ρwghc is also included due to canopy height hc 15 m to be a non negligible effect manzoni et al 2013a do not take account gravitational potential for plants smaller than 10 m canopy height gp is a bulk vegetation conductance r is the universal gas constant jmo l 1 k 1 mw is the water molecular weight kg mo l 1 hf is the fractional humidity it serves to correct moisture within the

supplementary material and gbv are stomatal and boundary layer conductance s m s 1 respectively gbv has been well discussed elsewhere vendrame et al 2000 sallo 2017 gives more details to parameters description for eq 13 to compute qr the vegetation conductance g p kg s m 4 is formulated following manzoni et al 2013b and is represented typically by a weibull function volpe et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 or similar to a sigmoid shape manzoni et al 2013b such as 14 g p g m a x 1 ψ r ψ l 2 ψ 50 a 1 where g m a x 5 42 10 8 m s 1 is the maximum vegetation hydraulic conductivity and was obtained using manzoni et al 2013b methodology the maximum hydraulic conductivity should be converted to a convenient conductance unit kg s m 4 by multiplying to ρw g in this case hc is stands for a measure of the average hydraulic length within the vegetation in turn related to canopy height novick et al 2009 a 3 and ψ 50 2 10 3 kpa are a shape parameter and the leaf water potential at 50 loss of conductivity more details in supplementary material the svat model presented here is an improved water dynamic model as compared with elsewhere tuzet et al 2003 and gumiere et al 2006 2 3 performance and model input for simulating the svat model typically atmospheric forcing variables supplementary material for energy balance and soil properties are required as a top down model it needs the air temperature k relative air humidity wind speed m s 1 ground heat flux w m 2 incident short wave radiation flux w m 2 and prescribed soil temperature k at the bottom boundary in this particular case we used a measured soil temperature at 0 35 m for more realistic representation the model accounts for ponded water however it was not analyzed here since most of our study focuses on the investigation of soil water dynamics during a drying period and that region northern pantanal presents a propitious dry season from may to september fantin cruz et al 2011 we compute a typical day from measured data supplementary material for all input variables which were repeated daily for the 30 days simulated therefore the initial condition for soil water content was set as saturated status 0 46 m 3 m 3 the campbell water retention curve parameters used for all simulation were ψ s s a t 2 6 k p a b 6 8 k s s a t 5 4 10 4 kg s m 3 more details in supplementary material the run time step was set as 600 s and is in agreement with mihailovic and eitzinger 2007 mihailovic et al 2010 the soil depth was divided by 40 layers having different size near to surface layers are thinner than deeper ones which increases geometrically fig 1 prior to presenting the analyses from the numerical runs an evaluation of the svat model was conducted for a forest stand dominated by pioneer species vochysia divergens pohl vochysiaceae sanches et al 2015 the measured evapotranspiration average daily cycle fig 3 was compared with the simulated from svat model note that the model reproduced the dynamics of tr and qr thereby lending some confidence in its performance we observed that evapotranspiration reached greater values than tr as soil evaporation contributes to water flux mainly at midday the delay between tr eq 12 and qr eq 13 agrees with the observations made by sallo et al 2017 and this effect is due to vegetation capacitance supplementary material when considering capacitance a more realistic soil water dynamic is observed and this influences the water movement during nighttime this is an improvement from previous works from siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 and manoli et al 2014 the soil dynamics coupled with the three root vertical distributions was explored from four runs in which three of them considered the different vertical distributions and the last one allowed us to evaluate a precipitation event of 20 mm simulated with the exponential scenario ultimately the free drainage dynamic was evaluated for the last run attempting to find the influence of root distribution in the conversion of green water soil water available for vegetation to transpire and for microorganism activity to blue water runoff and groundwater 3 results and discussion note firstly that the modelled accumulated evapotranspiration fig 4 reached approximately 124 mm average for three scenarios and it agreed with sanches et al 2011 that observed about 3 mm d 1 during the july and august also a slight difference from these three root distributions was noted constant and linear distributions presented the greatest accumulated evapotranspiration during the 30 days period while exponential distribution experienced 4 mm less soil evaporation in simulations remained similar for the three scenarios representing approximately 20 of evapotranspiration hence we concluded that the exponential root distribution may experience more resistance to water uptake than the others for the whole period the simulated rwu for the exponential scenario fig 5 captured maximum rwu rates at the beginning reaching a rate of 0 69 mm d 1 on the shallow layers maximum rwu rates were caused by greater root density and high hydraulic conductivity but this maximum rwu region migrated to deeper soil this effect is caused mainly by the interplay of soil moisture hydraulic conductivity and root density which created a preferential condition for greater water flux rates at middle approx 0 6 m layers rather than shallow ones the drop of high rwu rates emerged from the fast darcian redistribution and drainage in the first days that promoted a decrease in soil moisture on the shallower layers which in turn decreased rapidly the hydraulic conductivity and the movement of soil water the nighttime rwu at deep layers was almost imperceptible rhr near to zero until about the 12th day but it intensified in the following days this process occurred due to the transpiration demand in the daytime to be more intense than the capacity of root water uptake consequently it created a water potential gradient between soil and roots that was balanced at nighttime similar dynamics are reported in volpe et al 2013 and manoli et al 2014 the depth from where water is taken up at nighttime varied depending on root distribution in the soil profile and promoted different dynamics as shown in figures 5 to 7 a portion of nighttime water uptake could have been redistributed along the soil profile and it was driven by water potential gradient between root and soil siqueira et al 2008 volpe et al 2013 the rwu rate was greater in the constant scenario 0 96 mm d 1 while in the linear 0 67 mm d 1 and exponential scenarios 0 70 mm d 1 it was quite similar schneider et al 2010 reported similar results using a 3d rwu model yet they observed a decrease in the rwu for an exponential like profile over drying time manoli et al 2014 observed rwu values greater than 2 5 mm d 1 with a maximum transpiration rate of 15 mm d 1 and saturated hydraulic conductivity of ten times greater than that one as the movement of water in the soil to the roots is enhanced when saturated hydraulic conductivity is high we believe that our results for rwu are coherent with real world conditions in each scenario rwu had preference for regions in which conductance at the root soil interface was greater eq 6 note that even though the root density in the exponential scenario is around three times greater than that in the constant the last one developed the highest rwu rates this result suggests that soil moisture is the main variable that maintains soil interface conductance at high levels in addition it was noted the constant scenario presented the lowest nighttime rwu rates the hydraulic redistribution driven by roots is represented in this study by rhr and is presented firstly by hydraulic lift upward redistribution figs 5 7 that occurred intensively in a dry period the three root density distributions behaved differently in terms of rhr rates and layers from where the water was redistributed in the exponential and linear scenarios the rhr rates started to intensify from the 15th day and reached 0 28 and 0 16 mm d 1 respectively while in the constant scenario the maximum rhr rate was lower reaching 0 12 mm d 1 at the 16th day the depth from where the water was redistributed by roots increased for the exponential scenario while in the constant it decreased the depth for redistribution by roots in the linear scenario remained the same for the 30 days period manoli et al 2014 found rhr rates ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm d 1 for a maximum transpiration rate of 15 mm d 1 while in this present study the transpiration rates reached 8 mm d 1 volpe et al 2013 found rhr rate of 0 26 mm d 1 for transpiration rate around 9 mm d 1 by integrating vertically daily rhr fig 8 it was possible to obtain the daily allocated water from the deeper layer that was redistributed to shallower layers initially the daily rhr for the linear scenario was greater than the other scenarios however from the 16th day the exponential became the largest one moreover the exponential scenario was the greatest water allocator the maximum amounts of water redistributed by the constant linear and exponential scenarios were 0 45 0 76 and 0 88 mm d 1 respectively these results are in agreement with siqueira et al 2008 and manoli et al 2014 who found values between 0 5 and 1 1 mm d 1 using different models with 1d and 3d representations respectively our maximum rhr was achieved with delays among the scenarios and followed the sequence linear 20th day constant 22th day and exponential 24th day after these days the rhr decreased progressively this decrease was due to insufficient soil water potential gradient created by root density distribution along the soil profile promoting lower rhr rates within the soil vegetation system in this numerical experiment daily rhr exponential supplied a maximum of 21 of the daily evapotranspiration i e 0 77 mm although several studies have reported a wide range neumann and cardon 2012 liste and white 2008 scholz et al 2010 of the rhr daily transpiration ratio comprising from 1 to 143 neumann and cardon 2012 for cerrado ecosystems that encompass pantanal vegetation types field observations report percentages ranging from 1 scholz et al 2008 to 23 scholz et al 2010 with the maximum values found during the dry season the field observations and numerical experiments with downward rhr have been estimated elsewhere amenu and kumar 2008 volpe et al 2013 neumann and cardon 2012 manoli et al 2014 there is no experimental data for the pantanal ecosystem to a direct comparison with this model the hydraulic lift plays an important role in tropical forests subjected to water stress as at the northern pantanal as the allocated water to shallow layers is used for transpiration and carbon assimilation zeri et al 2014 furthermore tropical forests are highly dependent of nutrient cycling which hydraulic lift can enhance by supplying moisture that is the main driver of litter decomposition li et al 2012 as mentioned before downward rhr occurs when soil moisture is higher at the shallower soil layers e g rain events however its intensity depends on the soil properties and rooting systems this scenario was simulated fig 9 using a total precipitation of 20 mm with the increase of the hydraulic conductivity at shallower layers a sufficient water potential gradient is created within the rooting system that moves water downward hence downward rhr occurs in order to balance soil water potential gradient along the soil profile note that the redistribution rate in this case 1 mm d 1 was greater than the rate obtained for hydraulic lift this is a consequence of the large gradient generated during rainfall the downward rhr occurs mainly in clay soil because infiltration is very slow moreover it can help decrease peak runoff evaporation and soil erosion but the importance of the impact in these three processes is poorly understood li et al 2012 zhu et al 2017 as the rhr may contribute substantially to the transpiration and eventually to percolation fig 9 the inclusion of redistribution on hydrological models can enhance water fluxes estimations as found in amenu and kumar 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 zhu et al 2017 it becomes especially important in forested watersheds with deforestation tendency as the pantanal s basins both upward and downward rhr were influenced by the root density profiles but downward in lesser magnitude considering our results it is possible to infer that when the shallow layer consists of sandy soil and the deeper layer is clay soil downward redistribution could be enhanced as this condition creates a higher water potential gradient along soil profile and within the rooting system additionally the drainage rates may be affected by root density profiles simulated accumulated free drainage for all the scenarios fig 10 showed a difference of about 5 mm on average 4 5 of the total 30 day drainage between exponential and linear profiles with greater accumulated drainage for the exponential profile it is worth to mention that the drainage was not influenced by downward rhr meaning that in this context the green water was not converted to blue water so that the soil moisture was maintained at the root zone similar results were observed for all scenarios complementary simulations are depicted in supplementary material long term simulations were conducted elsewhere amenu and kumar 2008 and reported a reduction in drainage of 60 when comparing to a free root scenario that consequently reduced green water availability the main finding is that rhr and rwu may modify the balance between green and blue water furthermore the findings suggest that the root profiles interact with free drainage and consequently can influence green water management 4 conclusions the numerical experiment explored by means of a svat model the interplay between different root density distributions and the rwu and rhr on the soil water dynamics furthermore the role of rhr on the drainage with precipitation event was investigated the implemented physically based model described coherently the hydrodynamics between soil and rooting system from these findings we can conclude that when high root density is established at shallower soil layers the hydraulic lift is intensified representing until 21 of evapotranspiration for the exponential scenario although the dynamics vary for each scenario this also emphasizes the importance of rhr in the water cycle of a vegetated basin water loss by free drainage could be decreased until 4 5 when the vegetation root profile is linearly distributed compared to an exponential profile thus less significant in this case study on the other hand the downward rhr tends to maintain moisture in the root zone avoiding loss by runoff the main findings suggest that the water budget estimations transpiration evaporation and drainage may be improved when rwu and rhr processes are accounted for conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

1074,fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies cause severe changes in the natural flow regime of continental water systems however assessments of these impacts on the freshwater fish distribution are still scarce we investigated whether an artificial flow regime generated by discharges from an aqueduct would promote a longitudinal environmental gradient in an off river reservoir we tested the hypothesis that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions we expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage and that the lotic lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness a longitudinal gradient in environmental characteristics with differing fish assemblage structure was found temporal changes in the fish assemblages occurred only in areas near the discharge of the aqueduct the highest fish richness and diversity were recorded in the transition zone during the wet season associated with the greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone whereas the lowest was found in the lotic zone probably associated with the altered flow regime the greatest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone in the wet season whereas the lowest was found in the lower lentic zone in both seasons our results corroborate the hypothesis that the artificial flow regime modulated by the seasonality of discharges and the influence of environmental variables promotes longitudinal gradients in reservoirs when rivers are not present the findings are relevant in a scenario where ever more interconnections of aquatic bodies have been diffused around the world keywords fish assemblages water diversion inter basin transfer lotic lentic dams freshwater fishes 1 introduction reservoir construction and water diversion have multiplied in the world disfiguring the landscape and flow regime of continental water systems nowadays more than half of the world s largest river systems are fragmented by dams grill et al 2019 nilsson et al 2005 with severe implications for the global diversity of freshwater fish liermann et al 2012 in addition to fragmentation the rivers have been exposed to the spread of large inter and intra basin water interconnection and transfer programmes state and private investments of over us 2 7 trillion in water transfer megaprojects is expected over the next few years mainly in north america asia and africa with a total water transfer volume reaching 1910 km3 per year and a total transfer distance greater than twice the length of the equator shumilova et al 2018 in the us for example the number of inter basin water transfer projects has risen from 256 in 1985 1986 to 2161 in 2017 dickson and dzombak 2017 recently one of the largest water crises in modern history has led the indian government to formulate an unprecedented program of linking 30 major rivers through more than 15 000 km of concrete channels lakra et al 2011 fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies originate a complex artificial hydrological network with unpredictable long term consequences the construction of reservoirs breaks the natural river flow regime and results in a set of abiotic and biotic modifications equivalent to the formation of a new ecosystem with hybrid characteristics between a river and a lake baxter 1977 fernando and holčík 1991 poff et al 1997 the environmental contrast between rivers and lakes can be observed in the longitudinal axis of the reservoirs where the new lentic regimes formed near the dam can be observed as well as the presence of free flow regimes upstream of the enterprise longitudinal zonation patterns in reservoirs are often based on a common conceptualization proposed by thornton 1990 where the environment is categorized into three distinct zones i riverine pluvial or lotic ii transition and iii lacustrine or lentic the area occupied by each zone varies according to each reservoir and is influenced by the magnitude of the barred river morphometry retention time thermal stratification season and geographical location straškraba and

et al 2016 for example lentic zones tend to support fewer species due to a lower number of species pre adapted to exclusively lentic conditions fernando and holčík 1991 affonso et al 2016 lentic habitats are generally characterized by low levels of organic nutrients clear water and greater depths kimmel et al al 1990 in the lotic zone the flow is intense the nutrient levels are higher and the abiotic characteristics are more similar to those of a river straškraba and tundisi 2013 thornton 1990 fish that colonize the lotic zone are adapted to river conditions and this zone supports for example a greater number of rheophilic species agostinho et al 2007 the transition zone shares characteristics of the lotic and lentic zones a higher species richness may occur in the transition areas due to greater habitat heterogeneity in this ecotone buckmeier et al 2013 willis and magnuson 2000 river reservoir transition ecotones may temporarily promote coexistence between species adapted to both lentic and lotic conditions or those tolerant of hydrological variations nobile et al 2019 sandhya et al 2019 terra et al 2010 the seasonality of rainfall and flow changes also result in changes in nutrient inputs and habitat availability which interact in a complex manner in the longitudinal gradient and modulate the distribution of assemblages agostinho et al 2004 junk et al 1989 nobile et al 2019 several reservoirs were built outside of the main channel of a river e g off stream off river or polders in flooding areas adjacent to water bodies and can be supplied by inter and or intra basin water transposition mechanisms in these types of reservoirs the direct absence of an upstream river may not favour the formation of marked longitudinal gradients however water discharges from hydraulic mechanisms produce artificial flow regimes and have the potential to promote longitudinal environmental gradients in reservoirs the hydrological regime is a main driver of freshwater

show that the conversion of a lotic to a lentic environment caused by river fragmentation is harmful to the native fish assemblages e g liermann et al 2012 loures and pompeu 2019 wu et al 2019 however the reverse that is the effects of the conversion of a lentic environment to a lotic one caused by artificial flow regime in reservoirs are still scarce in the literature even more scarce are studies that attempt to predict how these contrasting effects fragmentation and interconnection interact and affect fish distribution the present study aimed to investigate for the first time whether water inflows reaching an off river reservoir through a transposition between adjacent watersheds would be responsible for spatiotemporal changes in the fish assemblages and in the descriptors of abundance species richness and diversity specifically we aimed to i identify whether there is a longitudinal abiotic gradient through environmental variables habitat physicochemical ii determine how species are distributed along this gradient iii compare fish assemblages and their descriptors between zones and seasons and iv examine the fish environment relationships in these non natural conditions the tested hypothesis was that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions we expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage since flow is one of the main modulators of the environmental conditions and consequently of the communities poff et al 1997 in addition we expect that the lotic lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness because of the great environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone buckmeier et al 2013 willis and magnuson 2000 achieving these goals can serve to identify the environmental effects caused by changing flow patterns and to improve our understanding of the impacts on the fish distribution imposed by river

main finding of this study is that water transposition from an adjacent watershed through a hydraulic mechanism promoted longitudinal changes in the physicochemical parameters and habitats and consequently influenced the structure of fish assemblages in an off river reservoir thus corroborating our hypothesis temporal changes in fish assemblages occurred only in areas located near the discharges which may be associated with periodic fluctuations of the aqueduct flow given the often cited relationships between flow habitat structure and fishes it is not surprising that temporal modifications to flow regimes affect fish assemblage structure bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 1997 hydrological regime is of crucial importance in the modulation of fish ecological processes and assemblage structure species select physiologically convenient habitats throughout the life cycle changes in flow can influence phenological aspects of individual fish species e g gonad maturation migration growth and habitat availability and heterogeneity with consequent effects on biotic interactions agostinho et al 2007 bunn and arthington 2002 junk et al 1989 mims and olden 2012 winemiller 1989 the discharges of the aqueduct formed a lotic regime zone and upon the influence of this artificial flow the fish richness s and diversity h were significantly lower compared with the other zones this pattern differs from reservoirs built on the continuum of a river where the lotic zone may exhibit the highest fish richness and diversity as this is the main habitat for most species before damming agostinho et al 2007 affonso et al 2016 in general impoundment effects on fish diversity were more pronounced in lentic environments than lotic zones loures and pompeu 2019 the unnatural lotic zone of the lajes reservoir is intermittent in periods of low water and reduced flow and has a channel that prevents upstream migration of fish this conjuncture of potential environmental stressors seems to be consistent with the lower richness and diversity observed in the lotic zone which is regulated by artificial inflows hypostomus luetkeni and l copelandii were the only species that were exclusively typical of the lotic zone associated with rocky substrate and turbid waters with comparatively low temperature for h luetkeni the predominance of rocky substrate may be associated with periphyton the main dietary item the sucking mouth provided with expanded suction shaped lips allows strong adherence to the rocky substrate even under high flow conditions casatti et al 2005 on the other hand l copelandii a migratory species agostinho et al 2007 may be using the lotic zone because of the flow the lentic zones occupy a large longitudinal extension of the lajes reservoir reflecting the long retention time dendritic morphology and the absence of large natural tributaries in this zone a longitudinal pattern can be observed in the abundance of species we found the lowest fish abundance near the dam whereas the highest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone this pattern corroborates other e g sandhya et al 2019 which reported lower fish abundances in lentic reservoir zones especially in locations near dams where the deep depth was a main driver limiting fish distribution fernando and holčík 1991 on the other hand the largest abundances in the upper lentic zone are mainly due to the high local catches of l castaneus in this compartment this benthic and low mobility species is tolerant to hypoxia silva et al 1997 and use the sandy substrate in low flow habitats with greater depths 8 m costa et al 2013 conditions that predominate in the upper reservoir zone the impoundments facilitate the invasion dispersal and establishment of loricariichthys spp casemiro et al 2017 and the increased depth after reservoir formation expands this type of habitat where this species is prone to occupy and reach high numerical abundance in addition l castaneus had pronounced seasonality being typical of the wet season this pattern may be associated with the reservoir bed anoxic conditions in the wet season soares et al 2008 consequently the need for vertical displacement to obtain air oxygen silva et al 1997 which would leave the species more exposed to capture in the transition zone an ecotone between lotic conditions generated by artificial inflows and the lentic zone the number of species s and diversity h were significantly higher than in other zones meeting our expectation riverine lacustrine ecotones in river built reservoirs can support highly diverse assemblies because they provide physical chemical biological and ecological connections between different environments buckmeier et al 2013 ecotones perform important functions in the spatiotemporal structuring of communities with tendencies to increase biodiversity willis and magnuson 2000 the highest species richness in the river reservoir transition zone was observed by terra et al 2010 yang et al 2012 nobile et al 2019 and sandhya et al 2019 and were associated to high environmental heterogeneity and the suitability of ecotones to temporarily promote coexistence between riverine and lacustrine species or those tolerant of hydrological variations in the transition zone of the lajes reservoir macrophyte banks are found increasing the physical structure complexity and heterogeneity of habitats which could be associated with the presence of native species such as a cf bimaculatus c gilbert and h malabaricus thomaz and cunha 2010 costa et al 2013 in the case of gradients promoted by artificial water discharges the greatest richness found in the transition zone may be due to the stressful effects at the ends of the longitudinal gradient generated by both the upstream aqueduct discharges and the low number of pre adapted species to the lentic environment near the dam inter basin water transfer projects affect both the donor and the recipient basins with effects that include but are not limited to changes in flow dynamics and physicochemical conditions as well as other deleterious effects such as habitat destruction fishery collapse spread of parasites biological invasions species extinction and water pollution zhuang 2016 in addition to these adverse effects there are also those caused by dams where native communities are already weakened by the physical chemical and biological changes imposed by river fragmentation finally fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies affect both abiotic and biotic environments and the convergence of these impacts is complex and should be better understood in future studies 5 conclusions based on the finding of this study we concluded that in the absence of the natural flow of a river artificial discharges may promote longitudinal flow regime partitioning of reservoirs the potential for water discharges to form longitudinal gradients in reservoirs may also be related to the location of the discharges technical specifications of the hydraulic mechanism as well as anthropogenic regulation in variables such as frequency duration and magnitude of discharges these should be better understood in later studies and taken into consideration when planning water diversion ventures inter basin water transfer connection areas in the reservoir exhibit lower fish richness and diversity which may be associated with unstable and unnatural flow regime on the other hand the transition zone between an artificial lotic and lentic flow regime presents the highest fish species richness and diversity which may be associated with greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone and to stressors at the ends of the longitudinal gradient i e the upstream unnatural discharges and the downstream smaller number of species pre adapted to the lentic environment finally our results corroborate the hypothesis that artificial flow regime modulated by seasonality influence

1074,fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies cause severe changes in the natural flow regime of continental water systems however assessments of these impacts on the freshwater fish distribution are still scarce we investigated whether an artificial flow regime generated by discharges from an aqueduct would promote a longitudinal environmental gradient in an off river reservoir we tested the hypothesis that the incoming water from aqueduct discharges promotes environmental gradient between lotic and lentic conditions we expect that environmental changes and the artificial flow regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage and that the lotic lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness a longitudinal gradient in environmental characteristics with differing fish assemblage structure was found temporal changes in the fish assemblages occurred only in areas near the discharge of the aqueduct the highest fish richness and diversity were recorded in the transition zone during the wet season associated with the greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone whereas the lowest was found in the lotic zone probably associated with the altered flow regime the greatest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone in the wet season whereas the lowest was found in the lower lentic zone in both seasons our results corroborate the hypothesis that the artificial flow regime modulated by the seasonality of discharges and the influence of environmental variables promotes longitudinal gradients in reservoirs when rivers are not present the findings are relevant in a scenario where ever more interconnections of aquatic bodies have been diffused around the world keywords fish assemblages water diversion inter basin transfer

example a greater number of rheophilic species agostinho et al 2007 the transition zone shares characteristics of the lotic and lentic zones a higher species richness may occur in the transition areas due to greater habitat heterogeneity in this ecotone buckmeier et al 2013 willis and magnuson 2000 river reservoir transition ecotones may temporarily promote coexistence between species adapted to both lentic and lotic conditions or those tolerant of hydrological variations nobile et al 2019 sandhya et al 2019 terra et al 2010 the seasonality of rainfall and flow changes also result in changes in nutrient inputs and habitat availability which interact in a complex manner in the longitudinal gradient and modulate the distribution of assemblages agostinho et al 2004 junk et al 1989 nobile et

the reverse that is the effects of the conversion of a lentic environment to a lotic one caused by artificial flow regime in reservoirs are still scarce in the literature even more scarce are studies that attempt to predict how these contrasting effects fragmentation and interconnection interact and affect fish distribution the present study aimed to investigate for the first time whether water inflows reaching an off river reservoir through a transposition between adjacent watersheds would be responsible for spatiotemporal changes in the fish assemblages and in the descriptors of abundance

regime promote the structuring of fish assemblage since flow is one of the main modulators of the environmental conditions and consequently of the communities poff et al 1997 in addition we expect that the lotic lentic transition areas present the highest fish species richness because of the great environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone buckmeier et al 2013 willis and magnuson 2000

coverage between the fixed factors i seasons dry april september wet october march and ii longitudinal zones lotic lo transition tr upper lentic ule middle lentic mle and lower lentic lle significant differences among the factors were followed by permanova pairwise comparison tests a permanova was also applied to compare the structure of the fish assemblage between seasons and longitudinal zones fixed factors fish abundance data were previously transformed square root to reduce the influence of abundant species but preserve information on their relative abundance and the triangular matrix was constructed using bray curtis similarity permanova was applied using the type iii square sum partial to calculate the p values when significant differences were detected p 0 01 paired comparisons were conducted between the groups in addition comparisons of the total number of individuals n total number of species s and shannon wiener diversity h were performed between zones and seasons using this permanova analysis we also used a similarity percentage simper analysis to determine species that most contributed to within group average similarity of the seasons and zones thus identifying their distribution patterns along the spatial temporal gradient the relationship between environmental variables and the fish assemblage structure was investigated using distance based redundancy analysis

main finding of this study is that water transposition from an adjacent watershed through a hydraulic mechanism promoted longitudinal changes in the physicochemical parameters and habitats and consequently influenced the structure of fish assemblages in an off river reservoir thus corroborating our hypothesis temporal changes in fish assemblages occurred only in areas located near the discharges which may be associated with periodic fluctuations of the aqueduct flow given the often cited relationships between flow habitat structure and fishes it is not surprising that temporal modifications to flow regimes affect fish assemblage structure bunn and arthington 2002 poff et al 1997 hydrological regime is of crucial importance in the modulation of fish ecological processes and assemblage structure species select physiologically convenient habitats throughout the life cycle changes in flow can influence phenological aspects of individual fish species e g gonad maturation migration growth and habitat availability and heterogeneity with consequent effects on biotic interactions agostinho et al 2007 bunn and arthington 2002 junk et al 1989 mims and olden 2012 winemiller 1989 the discharges of the aqueduct formed a lotic regime zone and upon the influence of this artificial flow the fish richness s and diversity h were significantly lower compared with the other zones this pattern differs from reservoirs built on the continuum of a river where the lotic zone may exhibit the highest fish richness and diversity as this is the main habitat for most species before damming agostinho et al 2007 affonso et al 2016 in general impoundment effects on fish diversity were more pronounced in lentic environments than lotic zones loures and pompeu 2019 the unnatural lotic zone of the lajes reservoir is intermittent in periods of low water and reduced flow and has a channel that prevents upstream migration of fish this conjuncture of potential environmental stressors seems to be consistent with the lower richness and diversity observed in the lotic zone which is regulated by artificial inflows hypostomus luetkeni and l copelandii were the only species that were exclusively typical of the lotic zone associated with rocky substrate and turbid waters with comparatively low temperature for h luetkeni the predominance of rocky substrate may be associated with periphyton the main dietary item the sucking mouth provided with expanded suction shaped lips allows strong adherence to the rocky substrate even under high flow conditions casatti et al 2005 on the other hand l copelandii a migratory species agostinho et al 2007 may be using the lotic zone because of the flow the lentic zones occupy a large longitudinal extension of the lajes reservoir reflecting the long retention time dendritic morphology and the absence of large natural tributaries in this zone a longitudinal pattern can be observed in the abundance of species we found the lowest fish abundance near the dam whereas the highest abundance was recorded in the upper lentic zone this pattern corroborates other e g sandhya et al 2019 which reported lower fish abundances in lentic reservoir zones especially in locations near dams where the deep depth was a main driver limiting fish distribution fernando and holčík 1991 on the other hand the largest abundances in the upper lentic zone are mainly due to the high local catches of l castaneus in this compartment this benthic and low mobility species is tolerant to hypoxia silva et al 1997 and use the sandy substrate in low flow habitats with greater depths 8 m costa et al 2013 conditions that predominate in the upper reservoir zone the impoundments facilitate the invasion dispersal and establishment of loricariichthys spp casemiro et al 2017 and the increased depth after reservoir formation expands this type of habitat where this species is prone to occupy and reach high numerical abundance in addition l castaneus had pronounced seasonality being typical of the wet season this pattern may be associated with the reservoir bed anoxic conditions in the wet season soares et al 2008 consequently the need for vertical displacement to obtain air oxygen silva et al 1997 which would leave the species more exposed to capture in the transition zone an ecotone between lotic conditions generated by artificial inflows and the lentic zone the number of species s and diversity h were significantly higher than in other zones meeting our expectation riverine lacustrine ecotones in river built reservoirs can support highly diverse assemblies because they provide physical chemical biological and ecological connections between different environments buckmeier et al 2013 ecotones perform important functions in the spatiotemporal structuring of communities with tendencies to increase biodiversity willis and magnuson 2000 the highest species richness in the river reservoir transition zone was observed by terra et al 2010 yang et al 2012 nobile et al 2019 and sandhya et al 2019 and were associated to high environmental heterogeneity and the suitability of ecotones to temporarily promote coexistence between riverine and lacustrine species or those tolerant of hydrological variations in the transition zone of the lajes reservoir macrophyte banks are found increasing the physical structure complexity and heterogeneity of habitats which could be associated with the presence of native species such as a cf bimaculatus c gilbert and h malabaricus thomaz and cunha 2010 costa et al 2013 in the case of gradients promoted by artificial water discharges the greatest richness found in the transition zone may be due to the stressful effects at the ends of the longitudinal gradient generated by both the upstream aqueduct discharges and the low number of pre adapted species to the lentic environment near the dam inter basin water transfer projects affect both the donor and the recipient basins with effects that include but are not limited to changes in flow dynamics and physicochemical conditions as well as other deleterious effects such as habitat destruction fishery collapse spread of parasites biological invasions species extinction and water pollution zhuang 2016 in addition to these adverse effects there are also those caused by dams where native communities are already weakened by the physical chemical and biological changes imposed by river fragmentation finally fragmentation and interconnection of water bodies affect both abiotic and biotic environments and the convergence of these impacts is complex and should be better understood in future studies 5 conclusions based on the finding of this study we concluded that in the absence of the natural flow of a river artificial discharges may promote longitudinal flow regime partitioning of reservoirs the potential for water discharges to form longitudinal gradients in reservoirs may also be related to the location of the discharges technical specifications of the hydraulic mechanism as well as anthropogenic regulation in variables such as frequency duration and magnitude of discharges these should be better understood in later studies and taken into consideration when planning water diversion ventures inter basin water transfer connection areas in the reservoir exhibit lower fish richness and diversity which may be associated with unstable and unnatural flow regime on the other hand the transition zone between an artificial lotic and lentic flow regime presents the highest fish species richness and diversity which may be associated with greater environmental heterogeneity of this ecotone and to stressors at the ends of the longitudinal gradient i e the upstream unnatural discharges and the downstream smaller number of species pre adapted to the lentic environment finally our results corroborate the hypothesis that artificial flow regime modulated by seasonality influence environmental variables and have potential effect on the longitudinal distribution of the fish assemblages in an off river reservoir credit authorship contribution statement gustavo henrique soares
