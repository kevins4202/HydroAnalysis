16165,severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 gave rise to an international public health emergency in 3 months after its emergence in wuhan china typically for an rna virus random mutations occur constantly leading to new lineages incidental with a higher transmissibility the highly infective alpha lineage firstly discovered in the uk led to elevated mortality and morbidity rates as a consequence of covid 19 worldwide wastewater surveillance proved to be a powerful tool for early detection and subsequent monitoring of the dynamics of sars cov 2 and its variants in a defined catchment using a combination of sequencing and rt qpcr approaches we investigated the total sars cov 2 concentration and the emergence of the alpha lineage in wastewater samples in vienna austria linking it to clinical data based on a non linear regression model and occurrence of signature mutations we conclude that the alpha variant was present in vienna sewage samples already in december 2020 even one month before the first clinical case was officially confirmed and reported by the health authorities this provides evidence that a well designed wastewater monitoring approach can provide a fast snapshot and may detect the circulating lineages in wastewater weeks before they are detectable in the clinical samples furthermore declining 14 days prevalence data with simultaneously increasing sars cov 2 total concentration in wastewater indicate a different shedding behavior for the alpha variant overall our results support wastewater surveillance to be a suitable

wastewater based epidemiology alpha lineage signature mutations epidemiological data whole genome sequencing 1 introduction the novel corona virus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 was officially declared an international public health emergency by the who within 3 months after its emergence in wuhan china who 2020a 2020b one year after the onset of the pandemic the ongoing active cases are still raising counting more than 229 million confirmed cases and over 4 7 million deaths as of by september 23rd 2021 https covid19 who int although the virus infects mainly the respiratory system sars cov 2 rna has been also detected in human feces wang et al 2020 and urine peng et al 2020 resulting in a pool of viral particles from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in municipal wastewater sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 wastewater based epidemiology wbe for sars cov 2 surveillance the concept proposed by daughton daughton 2020 enables the local authorities to have a real time overview of the prevalent rna viral loads and variants in a defined sewer catchment the approach has been successfully implemented in many countries for early detection of sars cov 2 hotspots ahmed et al 2020a fontenele et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 medema et al 2020 the clinical data associated with the epidemiological observations suggest municipal wastewater to be a useful tool for early warning and tracking the dissemination of sars cov 2 in the community a correlation between sars cov 2 prevalence in primary sewage sludge and epidemiological data demonstrated that viral rna concentrations in sewage sludge showed an increase that was not observed in the reported tests or hospital admission data highlighting that the sludge results may be considered as an earlier real time approach regarding the infection dynamics peccia et al 2020 rt qpcr reverse transcription quantitative pcr and wgs whole genome sequencing represent the most common tools applied for sars cov 2 quantitation and identification n gene assay kits are implemented globally for sars cov 2 screening by reason of their high specificity sensitivity and fast results nalla et al 2020 due to the noticeable spread of more contagious variants variants of concern vocs and variants of interest vois sequencing techniques proved to be the most valuable strategy to provide a deep and accurate understanding of the new circulating lineages fontenele et al 2021 martin et al 2020 rambaut et al 2020b the method is efficiently carried out worldwide ahmed et al 2020a alygizakis et al 2021 crits christoph et al 2021 popa et al 2020 providing real time data essential for understanding the pandemic dynamics in a recent study fontanele and collabolators 2021 determined 263 sars cov 2 snvs single nucleotide variants in wastewater samples collected from different wwtps wastewater treatment plants which have not been identified in clinical cases by then interestingly spatial and temporal sars cov 2 sequence variations were found in the wastewater samples from each location over time fontenele et al 2021 as with any replicating virus random mutations accumulate in sars cov 2 genome overtime leading to new variants which potentially have a higher infectivity virulence or capability to bypass the immune system response of its host computational studies based on epidemiological data show that mutations located in the spike receptor binding domain rbd of sars cov 2 can boost its dissemination in the human population it is already well known that the d614g mutation which was firstly identified in february 2020 in europe enhances the sars cov 2 infectivity and alters the virus fitness hu et al 2020 korber et al 2020 besides higher viral loads the mutation doesn t affect the severity of the disease korber et al 2020 nonetheless a 10 fold increase in the infectivity was observed compared with the original wuhan 1 strain li et al 2020b furthermore n501y mutation presents a higher affinity to bind to the ace2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor in human epithelial cells resulting in an elevated shedding value which presumably has a role in viral transmissibility khateeb et al 2021 luan et al 2021 therefore d614g and n501y mutations may enhance sars cov 2 shedding which can raise the infectivity and dissemination rates the present study describes the longitudinal screening of total sars cov 2 gc genome copies and alpha lineage occurrence in vienna austria in the inflow sewage from the wwtp and in clinical samples during the time period around the emergence of the alpha lineage the main goal of the manuscript is to report monitoring data regarding alpha variant abundance since its emergence in wastewater and to correlate the overall rt qpcr signal with the epidemiological data alpha lineage assessment in sewage samples started in january 2021 in parallel with the official confirmation of the first clinical case carrying the new variant based on the hypothesis that alpha variant is associated with an increase of the viral rna concentrations in the human stool we presume that the new variant was present in vienna sewage samples already in the middle of december 2020 to test our assumption we correlated epidemiological data with sequencing and rt qpcr results of wastewater samples for the same period the novelty of our approach is represented by the correlation of different data obtained from clinical and environmental samples to trace back the moment when sars cov 2 alpha variant emerged in a defined sewer catchment the correlation of sars cov 2 rt qpcr and sequencing data with the increasing trend in viral shedding compared with the epidemiological data highlight that a well designed wastewater based epidemiology may detect new variants already circulating before they are seen in clinic data the present manuscript describes the first observation regarding the alpha lineage in wastewater samples in vienna austria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater monitoring sampling campaigns the wastewater from the city of vienna 1 9 million inhabitants is collected in the sewerage system and further treated at the main wwtp due to a well defined sewer system with an average flow time of about 2 h and connected to a single main wwtp wastewater based surveillance approach is feasible in real time representative 24 h flow proportional composite samples cvvt constant volume variable time of untreated wastewater sewage were collected at least twice per week directly from the inflow of the wwtp by an automated sampler samples were cooled at 4 c during the 24 hour sampling duration directly in the sampler and afterwards transferred to the laboratory of the wwtp there the sewage samples were mixed thoroughly transferred to sterile 1 l hdpe high density poly ethylene sigma aldrich bottles and transported to the processing laboratory on ice in insulated boxes the wastewater samples were processed on the same day during the period of the study 73 samples were collected in total between october 4th 2020 and may 5th 2021 wastewater inflow rate m3 day and temperature c were recorded on a daily basis total nitrogen tn was determined to calculate the corresponding daily loads and further for rt qpcr results normalization in order to compensate for fluctuations related to dilution effects caused by storm water events information regarding sampling dates and wastewater characteristic parameters are given in table s1 si 2 2 wastewater viral concentration and rna extraction sars cov 2 viral rna was concentrated using a modified peg polyethylene glycol precipitation protocol medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 thoroughly mixed 45 ml aliquots from each sample were centrifuged at 4500 g for 30 min at 4 c the centrifuge was previously cooled down to 4 c 40 ml of the supernatant were further added to fresh 50 ml falcon tubes containing 100 g l peg 8000 sigma aldrich and 22 5 g l nacl sigma aldrich followed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 1 h 30 min at 4 c the supernatant was carefully removed and an additional centrifugation step was carried out in order to remove the remaining liquid 12 000 g 5 min 4 c the pellet was resuspended in 400 µl molecular biology grade water sigma aldrich and 400 µl ctab hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide promega buffer prior to the rna extraction 40 µl of proteinase k promega were added to each tube and inverted carefully in order to obtain a homogenous suspension the suspension was further transferred to a tube containing disruptor beads and run on fastprep24 machine for 40 s at 6 m s subsequently 400 µl of each sample were used for further rna extraction the rna extraction was performed on maxwell rsc as4500 promega device using viral rna dna concentration and extraction kit from wastewater promega the sars cov 2 viral rna was eluted in 100 µl te buffer 2 3 rt qpcr analysis the quantitative assessment of sars cov 2 rna gc in wastewater samples was performed with the viroreal kit sars cov 2 sars ingenetix vienna austria on a quantstudio 6 pro instrument applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific targeting a highly conserved region of the nucleocapsid protein gene n gene a standard curve for absolute quantification was obtained using serial dilutions 101 to 105 copies reaction of a synthetic rna template positive control pc containing the target sequence the reaction mixture contains 4 µl molecular biology grade water thermo fisher scientific 5 µl of master mix ingenetix 1 µl of sars cov 2 multiplex assay mix comprising the primers and the probe ingenetix and 10 µl rna template thermal cycling conditions were as follow reverse transcription at 50 c for 15 min initial denaturation at 95 c for 20 s followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 30 s all rt qpcr reactions were performed in duplicates in a total volume of 20 µl reaction for each rt qpcr run a standard curve containing the five dilution steps in duplicate and two negative controls molecular biology grade water was added to the reaction mixture were included 2 4 rt qpcr assay performance primer set validation and recovery efficiency assay linearity limit of detection lod inter and intra assay precision were assessed by ingenetix vienna austria detailed information regarding the results are given in the supplementary information file an internal positive control ipc was employed to estimate the rna extraction efficiency and to detect inhibition during rt qpcr reaction each tested sample was seeded with 1 µl ipc of known concentration 6 105 copies µl prior to rna extraction and the recovery efficiency was calculated as follows recovery efficiency ipc recovered ipc seeded x 100 for each rna extraction run a non template control ntc was included by adding ipc 6 105 copies µl to molecular biology grade water and further used it as reference sample rt qpcr inhibition was assessed by comparing the ipc cycle threshold ct value of the seeded wastewater sample with the ipc non template control ct value a threshold difference of 2 cycles was indicative for no inhibition staley et al 2012 sars cov 2 primer set used for rt qpcr quantification was subjected to validation by whole genome sequencing based mutation analysis for the binding sites details in si the analysis revealed that only five mutations within the binding site of any of the used primers end probes were observed within the sequenced samples none of the observed mutations occurred in more than 2 samples or exceeded a frequency of 0 1 virtually excluding a systematic bias of the applied rt qpcr set up in the quantification of variants occurring in the vienna wastewater in the considered time period figure s1 si recovery efficiency of sars cov 2 gc in wastewater samples average value was 57 71 8 5 for the rt qpcr results a threshold value of 40 cycles was implemented all tested samples were considered positive and presented ct values were below the cut off limit varying between 27 and 35 cycles figure s2 si with an average pcr efficiency of 95 51 and 101 02 for ipc and pc respectively no pcr inhibition was detected for any of the tested samples 2 5 data analysis the raw absolute number of sars cov 2 rna gc in wastewater inflow samples was used to calculate the final concentrations reported to the population equivalent by applying the data normalization to total nitrogen tn frequently used in wbe been et al 2014 van nuijs et al 2011 an estimated excreted value of 11 g tn was taken as value excreted per person per day in wastewater epa 2002 tn was measured in the inflow wastewater samples following the standard en iso 20236 2018 and the normalized sars cov 2 genome copies per tn population equivalent pe11 was calculated by the following formula 1 sars cov 2 copies per ml 11 g tn g tn measured in wastewater 1 0 6 sars cov 2 genome copies per p e 11 where tn total nitrogen pe11 11 g tn per population equivalent detailed explanation of the formula in si equations s1 s2 s3 considering environmental factors such as rain events temperature fluctuations hydraulic retention time in the sewerage system soft smooth data analysis by rbf radial basis functions with factor 0 25 myers 1999 was implemented to closer estimate the number of sars cov 2 gc released per person for the days where no sampling was done in order to be representative as epidemiological data the 14 days incidence was taken into consideration the calculated incidence number was considered as total sum of new infected persons reported in the past 14 days and assuming a duration of 14 days until recovery from the covid disease is considered to represent the shedding duration via stool into wastewater li et al 2020a 2 6 whole genome sequencing and data analysis enriched rna extracts from the wastewater samples were subjected to viral whole genome sequencing as described by popa et al 2020 in brief genomic rna was amplified using the artic sars cov 2 primer set v3 applying 35 pcr cycles to cope with high ct value samples and sequenced on an illumina novaseq 6000 sequencer in 2 250 bp paired end mode to an average of 2 6 m reads per sample reads were demultiplexed quality controlled fastqc andrews 2010 and adapter trimmed bbduk bushnell et al 2017 bbmerge bushnell et al 2017 was used to correct sequences in overlapping regions of the same mate pair this way quality controlled reads were mapped against a joint human hg38 and sars cov 2 nc 045512 2 genome using bwa mem variants were detected and quantified using the tool lofreq wilm et al 2012 including a realignment step using its implementation of the viterbi algorithm samples with less than 40 of the genome covered with at least 10 reads were omitted entirely in the remaining samples variants with an allele frequency below 0 01 and sites with a read coverage less than 250 reads were excluded the consensus sequence was constructed using samtools mpileup and bcftools li 2011 and categorized according its sars cov 2 lineage rambaut et al 2020a using the software pangolin github com cov lineages pangolin for the quantification of the alpha lineage the specific markers applied are depicted in table s2 in supplementary information 2 7 clinical epidemiological data sars cov 2 wuhan

dashboard html and main website https www ages at themen krankheitserreger coronavirus sars cov 2 varianten in oesterreich out of the publicly available data we retrieved the vienna specific information and used it for downstream analysis 14 days incidence data was taken into consideration and compared with the sars cov 2 gc in wastewater normalized to population equivalent pe11 alpha lineage percentages in clinical samples retrieved from wgs data were further used for correlation and comparability evaluation with its share in the wastewater samples statistical analysis statistical data analysis and plots were performed in sigmaplot v14 0 non linear regression sigmoid curve was obtained using a 3 parameter formula equation s4 in si by applying a dynamic fitting regression 3 results 3 1 sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples and epidemiological data sars cov 2 prevalence in wastewater presents similar fluctuations as incidence data and an upward downward trend is observed initially in the sewage samples followed after a time lag by the clinical active cases per 100 000 inhabitants fig 1 depicts the daily sars cov 2 concentrations reported to the population equivalent pe11 for the period under specific investigation in this paper whole dataset figure s4 si the percentage of alpha variant in wastewater and the active cases per 100 000 inhabitants during the study period from october 2020 to may 2021 sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater reported to pe11 ranged from 5 01 107 to 1 10 109 gc fig 1 while comparing with its prevalence calculated per active case it ranged from 1 1011 to 3 5 1011 gc fig 2 for the same period the incidence varied from 237 to 1121 active cases per 100 000 inhabitants with two peaks in november and april data available on ages website corresponding the time right before the onset of the 2nd wave november 11th 2020 and lockdown in the eastern part of austria including vienna april 1st 2021 for 8 months from the pandemic onset sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater exhibit a rather similar trend as epidemiological data represented by the daily active cases reported to 100 000 inhabitants figure s4 si starting from november 2020 the concentration of the virus in the sewage samples showed a downward trend along with the number of the confirmed clinical cases fig 1 on november 11th 2020 the 2nd lockdown commenced in vienna followed by the 3rd one on december 26th 2020 with a break in between of 20 days without constraints restrictions that are highlighted by a drop in the confirmed active cases per 100 000 inhabitants from 1100 to less than 400 clinical covid 19 cases until january 2021 during this period the incidence ranged from 406 to 908 with a mean value of 582 active cases per day per 100 000 persons at the beginning of december sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater started to increase while the confirmed active cases per day continued to descend in contrast to the epidemiological data sars cov 2 concentration in the sewage samples continued to increase until march 2021 with fluctuations within the same order of magnitude over the study period the average sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater samples is 3 44 108 gc per pe11 after the lockdown has terminated february 8th 2021 a noticeable boost in the incidence of covid 19 cases can be observed followed by an overlap of sars cov 2 concentration and incidence per 100 000 inhabitants at the beginning of april 2021 taking into account the lockdown measures and the increasing rate of vaccinated persons a decline in the wastewater viral rna can be noticed starting in april followed by the epidemiological data with a short delay considering the increase of sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater following an upward trend during the same period of a steady decrease in the clinical data raised the question of the explanation behind this state that was observed for 2 months december 8th 2020 until beginning of february 2021 after excluding methodological issues the viral shedding per active case was calculated the total load of the sars cov 2 expressed in gc per ml was multiplied with the wastewater flow of the specific day and divided by the active cases recalculated from the 14 days incidence per 100 000 persons using the actual population the resulting number illustrates the average viral shedding per infected person per day fig 2 exhibits the values calculated for each day during the discussed period plotted versus the 14 days incidences per 100 000 inhabitants as measure for infected persons shedding the virus reported for the same day it was expected that the shedding per person would remain constant resulting in roughly identical values on the y axis independent on the clinical data surprisingly the numbers show a pattern that deviates from expectations resulting in the definition of three phases at the beginning of our study period sars cov 2 concentration reported to the 14 days incidence remained stable at 1011 gc while the 14 days incidence per 100 000 inhabitants increases from approximately 400 to 800 active cases the onset of the 2nd lockdown november 17th 2020 led to a decrease in the incidence but the viral concentration shed by one infected person stayed rather stable in the tested wastewater samples in contrast starting with december 2020 a boost in the viral rna concentration could be observed in the wastewater that resulted in an increase in the number of gcs per active case too in that phase the incidence only showed a small fluctuation basically decreasing form 400 to 250 active cases per 14 days until the 3rd lockdown started december 26th 2020 interesting afterwards the 14 days incidence stabilized at around 200 active cases per 14 days for one month and half while the sars cov 2 concentration increased three times in the same period from 1 1011 to 3 1011 gc per 14 days incidence after the relaxation of the restrictions the incidence quickly started to increase reaching 400 active cases per 14 days in one month again at the same time sars cov 2 shedding per active case remains stable again 3 2 signature mutations for alpha lineage and their frequency in wastewater samples fig 3 displays a detailed analysis based on individual mutations and their relative abundance in the wastewater samples by revealing a consistent and more nuanced picture a block of around 23 mutations which characterize the period before january 2021 but never reach complete fixation in the population are slowly phasing out during january february in the same period around 30 mutations are slowly emerging and reaching fixation by march 2021 all of these mutations are signature mutations of the alpha lineage 3 3 percentages of alpha lineage and n501y mutation in clinical and wastewater samples in vienna austria derived from wgs data on january 4th 2021 the first patient was officially confirmed and reported by the health authorities with sars cov 2 alpha variant in vienna austria although the first case with alpha variant was detected around christmas time the official confirmation from sequencing data was necessary in order to report it as positive for the alpha lineage the alpha lineage increased gradually in clinical samples from 1 on 10th of january 2021 to 49 on 1st of february 2021 reaching 75 on 15th of march 2021 the atypical descending trend observed in clinical data concomitant with the increasing tendency of the sars cov 2 gc in wastewater samples starting with dec 8th 2021 fig 1 gave rise to data interpretation questions regression model analysis dashed line fig 1 for the alpha variant and n501y mutation percentages obtained from sequencing gray area in fig 4 matched in both data sets from clinical and wastewater samples for the same study period the percentage of alpha in wastewater samples reached almost 100 in only 10 weeks since its first detection while a similar share in clinical samples was visible after 13 weeks from the first confirmed case 4 discussions this study describes the temporal quantitative analysis of sars cov 2 genome and alpha lineage in wastewater samples in vienna austria during the study period we determined the total sars cov 2 concentration and alpha variant share in 73 wastewater samples collected between october 4th 2020 and may 5th 2021 from vienna wwtp further we compared the epidemiological data active cases per 100 000 inhabitants with the wastewater data reported to the population equivalent pe11 and based on a non linear regression model the estimated date when alpha variant appeared in the sewage samples from vienna was assessed the present paper considers the tn as human biomarker to estimate the population connected to the sewerage system pe11 in vienna one of the first wbe studies to detect and track sars cov 2 in wastewater in europe was conducted by medema and collaborators in the netherlands medema et al 2020 since the onset of the pandemic the wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 became a monitoring routine worldwide the observed sars cov 2 concentrations in untreated wastewater ranged from 105 to 1011 gc ml ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2021 similarly in our manuscript the observed sars cov 2 concentrations in vienna wastewater over the whole monitoring period figure s4 si ranged from 3 59 107 in may 2021 5 01 107 in april 2020 to respectively 1 10 109 gc ml in march 2021 for the first one and half month of the study october 2020 november 15th 2020 a similar upward sars cov 2 pattern was observed in both wastewater samples and active clinical cases per 100 000 inhabitants the increase in the wastewater signal fits the reported clinical cases fig 1 similar results were observed by wilton et al 2021 foladori et al 2020 and randazzo et al 2020 in contrast for the downward trend the data correspond only for a limited period interesting by december 8th the number of infected persons continue the decline but the sars cov 2 concentration in sewage samples started to raise again one explanation for the resulting changes of sars cov 2 gcs per active case would be a different shedding rate by infected individuals or different virion stability of circulating variants in the respective period in wastewater to elucidate the potential role of variant specific mutations regarding the upward trend of sars cov 2 concentration we characterized the patterns of prevailing virus variants in the wastewater samples the main outcome is that the mutations present at the beginning of the study period disappear within one month and new ones signature mutations for alpha variant showed up and get fixed in the population by the end of march fig 3 comparable to our outcome recent studies highlight the potential contribution of wastewater monitoring for the early detection of alpha lineage by signature mutations la rosa et al 2021 wilton et al 2021 la rosa et al 2021 report the first evidence of vocs identification based on signature mutations in wastewater samples from italy using nested rt pcr together with sanger sequencing technique washington et al 2021 describe the emergence and dynamic of the alpha lineage in the united states in clinical samples results which show that the variant was already present in different states in november 2020 washington et al 2021 considering the association of d614g and n501y mutations with a higher viral load and transmissibility korber et al 2020 volz et al 2021 we presume that the different development of the two signals wastewater and clinical data may correspond with the emergence of alpha lineage recent studies underline our statement that sars cov 2 alpha variant presents a higher viral load in the respiratory tract as well as in stool frampton et al 2021 kidd et al 2021 rosenke et al 2021 in accordance with our results wilton et al 2021 correlate the emergence of alpha variant with high levels of viral rna found in sewage samples from london wilton et al 2021 the dissemination of the alpha lineage appears to have a more accelerated spread than sars cov 2 wuhan 1 strain in human population korber et al 2020 volz et al 2021 wilton et al 2021 the result of the sigmoid regression model derived from sequencing data indicates the first occurrence of the alpha variant in vienna sewage sample started around december 8th 2020 in the same period a decoupling of the wastewater signal and the epidemiological incidence was observed fig 1 and the average amount of gc in wastewater shed by one infected person started to increase fig 2 the modelled data show that on december 8th the alpha lineage was present in vienna sewage samples in a share of about 1 when the initial clinical case was confirmed the variant portion in wastewater was already at 15 fig 1 figure s5 si so within one month the percentage increases to 15 in order to reach 50 after another 3 weeks at the beginning of march 2021 the sars cov 2 alpha lineage gets to 90 of the total wastewater samples tested underlining the fast dissemination of the new variant among the population table s4 si nevertheless data interpretation should consider different factors such as environmental conditions rainfall and snowfall events temperature ph hydraulic retention time in the sewers or chemicals disinfectants and detergents as they may interfere with the final sars cov 2 gc reported polo et al 2020 the well known fact that temperature variations affect the stability of sars cov 2 in wastewater led to suspicions regarding the effect of temperature fluctuation in the vienna sewerage system as it is already shown in literature sars cov 2 viral particles display different behavior influenced by temperature in sewage samples ahmed et al 2020 tested the stability of sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater samples at four different temperatures the main outcome of their study is that sars cov 2 viral particles have an extended persistence at 4 and 15 c up to 27 and 20 days respectively ahmed et al 2020b in contrast wurtzer et al 2021 observed no effect on sars cov 2 viral rna detection after incubation for 24 h in a range of temperature between 4 c and 40 c the authors defined a period of 7 days persistence of total viral rna at 4 c wurtzer et al 2021 noteworthy only temperature values below 15 c led to a slight increase in sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples from vienna figure s5 si as the flow time of the wastewater in vienna sewerage system is rather short average of about two hours a temperature effect on the decay of the viral particles should be rather small based on the combination of a short flow time and only small fluctuations of temperature max difference of 7 c see figure s5 si in the wastewater samples during the time period investigated we conclude the emergence of the new variant being responsible for the increased wastewater signal observed and thus the presence of alpha already well before identification in clinical samples overall sars cov 2 concentration in untreated wastewater from vienna was influenced mainly by the emergence of alpha lineage considering the association of different signature mutations with higher viral loads and only a small effect may be attributed to fluctuations in temperature 5 conclusions considering that for the clinical cases the results can be delayed for few days due to the time required for symptoms to initiate and testing capacity wbe proves to be the fastest and advantageous method to provide a quick snapshot of sars cov 2 circulating variants in a certain catchment the real number of infected persons is difficult to recalculate with accuracy due to the shedding values which are dependent on the specific sars cov 2 variant and the constant change in lineage composition in wastewater different variants may display a distinct behavior of sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater therefore a factor of extrapolation should be considered carefully in drawing the final conclusions wastewater represents a complex matrix thus the key parameters that should be rigorously considered are represented by the viral concentration and circulating sars cov 2 variants in wastewater samples representative samples and population normalization credit

after the onset of the pandemic the ongoing active cases are still raising counting more than 229 million confirmed cases and over 4 7 million deaths as of by september 23rd 2021 https covid19 who int although the virus infects mainly the respiratory system sars cov 2 rna has been also detected in human feces wang et al 2020 and urine peng et al 2020 resulting in a pool of viral particles from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in municipal wastewater sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 wastewater based epidemiology wbe for sars cov 2 surveillance the concept proposed by daughton daughton 2020 enables the local authorities to have a real time overview of the prevalent rna viral loads and variants in a defined sewer catchment the approach has been successfully implemented in many countries for early detection of sars cov 2 hotspots ahmed et al 2020a fontenele et al 2021 gerrity et al 2021 medema et al 2020 the clinical data associated with the epidemiological observations suggest municipal wastewater to be a useful tool for early warning and tracking the dissemination of sars cov 2 in the community a correlation between sars cov 2 prevalence in primary sewage sludge and epidemiological data demonstrated that viral rna concentrations in sewage sludge showed an increase that was not observed in the reported tests or hospital admission data highlighting that the sludge results may be considered as an earlier real time approach regarding the infection dynamics peccia et al 2020 rt qpcr reverse transcription quantitative pcr and wgs whole genome sequencing represent the most common tools applied for sars cov 2 quantitation and identification n gene assay kits are implemented globally for sars cov 2 screening by reason of their high specificity sensitivity and fast results nalla et al 2020 due to the noticeable spread of more contagious variants variants of concern vocs and variants of interest vois sequencing techniques proved to be the most valuable strategy to provide a deep and accurate understanding of the new circulating lineages fontenele et al 2021 martin et al 2020 rambaut et al 2020b the method is efficiently carried out worldwide ahmed et al 2020a alygizakis et al 2021 crits christoph et al 2021 popa et al 2020 providing real time data essential for understanding the pandemic dynamics in a recent study fontanele and collabolators 2021 determined 263 sars cov 2 snvs single nucleotide variants in wastewater samples collected from different wwtps wastewater treatment plants which have not been identified in clinical cases by then interestingly spatial and temporal sars cov 2 sequence variations were found in the wastewater samples from each location over time fontenele et al 2021 as with any replicating virus random mutations accumulate in sars cov 2 genome overtime leading to new variants which potentially have a higher infectivity virulence or capability to bypass the immune system response of its host computational studies based on epidemiological data show that mutations located in the spike receptor binding domain rbd of sars cov 2 can boost its dissemination in the human population it is already well known that the d614g mutation which was firstly identified in february 2020 in europe enhances the sars cov 2 infectivity and alters the virus fitness hu et al 2020 korber et al 2020 besides higher viral loads the mutation doesn t affect the severity of the disease korber et al 2020 nonetheless a 10 fold increase in the infectivity was observed compared with the original wuhan 1 strain li et al 2020b furthermore n501y mutation presents a higher affinity to bind to the ace2 angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor in human epithelial cells resulting in an elevated shedding value which presumably has a role in viral transmissibility khateeb et al 2021 luan et al 2021 therefore d614g and n501y mutations may enhance sars cov 2 shedding which can raise the infectivity and dissemination rates the present study describes the longitudinal screening of total sars cov 2 gc genome copies and alpha lineage occurrence in vienna austria in the inflow sewage from the wwtp and in clinical samples during the time period around the emergence of the alpha lineage the main goal of the manuscript is to report monitoring data regarding alpha variant abundance since its emergence in wastewater and to correlate the overall rt qpcr signal with the epidemiological data alpha lineage assessment in sewage samples started in january 2021 in parallel with the official confirmation of the first clinical case carrying the new variant based on the hypothesis that alpha variant is associated with an increase of the viral rna concentrations in the human stool we presume that the new variant was present in vienna sewage samples already in the middle of december 2020 to test our assumption we correlated epidemiological data with sequencing and rt qpcr results of wastewater samples for the same period the novelty of our approach is represented by the correlation of different data obtained from clinical and environmental samples to trace back the moment when sars cov 2 alpha variant emerged in a defined sewer catchment the correlation of sars cov 2 rt qpcr and sequencing data with the increasing trend in viral shedding compared with the epidemiological data highlight that a well designed wastewater based epidemiology may detect new variants already circulating before they are seen in clinic data the present manuscript describes the first observation regarding the alpha lineage in wastewater samples in vienna austria 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater monitoring sampling campaigns the wastewater from the city of vienna 1 9 million inhabitants is collected in the sewerage system and further treated at the main wwtp due to a well defined sewer system with an average flow time of about 2 h and connected to a single main wwtp wastewater based surveillance approach is feasible in real time representative 24 h flow proportional composite samples cvvt constant volume variable time of untreated wastewater sewage were collected at least twice per week directly from the inflow of the wwtp by an automated sampler samples were cooled at 4 c during the 24 hour sampling duration directly in the sampler and afterwards transferred to the laboratory of the wwtp there the sewage samples were mixed thoroughly transferred to sterile 1 l hdpe high density poly ethylene sigma aldrich bottles and transported to the processing laboratory on ice in insulated boxes the wastewater samples were processed on the same day during the period of the study 73 samples were collected in total between october 4th 2020 and may 5th 2021 wastewater inflow rate m3 day and temperature c were recorded on a daily basis total nitrogen tn was determined to calculate the corresponding daily loads and further for rt qpcr results normalization in order to compensate for fluctuations related to dilution effects caused by storm water events information regarding sampling dates and wastewater characteristic parameters are given in table s1 si 2 2 wastewater viral concentration and rna extraction sars cov 2 viral rna was concentrated using a modified peg polyethylene glycol precipitation protocol medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 thoroughly mixed 45 ml aliquots from each sample were centrifuged at 4500 g for 30 min at 4 c the centrifuge was previously cooled down to 4 c 40 ml of the supernatant were further added to fresh 50 ml falcon tubes containing 100 g l peg 8000 sigma aldrich and 22 5 g l nacl sigma aldrich followed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 1 h 30 min at 4 c the supernatant was carefully removed and an additional centrifugation step was carried out in order to remove the remaining liquid 12 000 g 5 min 4 c the pellet was resuspended in 400 µl molecular biology grade water sigma aldrich and 400 µl ctab hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide promega buffer prior to the rna extraction 40 µl of proteinase k promega were added to each tube and inverted carefully in order to obtain a homogenous suspension the suspension was further transferred to a tube containing disruptor beads and run on fastprep24 machine for 40 s at 6 m s subsequently 400 µl of each sample were used for further rna extraction the rna extraction was performed on maxwell rsc as4500 promega device using viral rna dna concentration and extraction kit from wastewater promega the sars cov 2 viral rna was eluted in 100 µl te buffer 2 3 rt qpcr analysis the quantitative assessment of sars cov 2 rna gc in wastewater samples was performed with the viroreal kit sars cov 2 sars ingenetix vienna austria on a quantstudio 6 pro instrument applied biosystems thermo fisher scientific targeting a highly conserved region of the nucleocapsid protein gene n gene a standard curve for absolute quantification was obtained using serial dilutions 101 to 105 copies reaction of a synthetic rna template positive control pc containing the target sequence the reaction mixture contains 4 µl molecular biology grade water thermo fisher scientific 5 µl of master mix ingenetix 1 µl of sars cov 2 multiplex assay mix comprising the primers and the probe ingenetix and 10 µl rna template thermal cycling conditions were as follow reverse transcription at 50 c for 15 min initial denaturation at 95 c for 20 s followed by 45 cycles at 95 c for 5 s and 60 c for 30 s all rt qpcr reactions were performed in duplicates in a total volume of 20 µl reaction for each rt qpcr run a standard curve containing the five dilution steps in duplicate and two negative controls molecular biology grade water was added to the reaction mixture were included 2 4 rt qpcr assay performance primer set validation and recovery efficiency assay linearity limit of detection lod inter and intra assay precision were assessed by ingenetix vienna austria detailed information regarding the results are given in the supplementary information file an internal positive control ipc was employed to estimate the rna extraction efficiency and to detect inhibition during rt qpcr reaction each tested sample was seeded with 1 µl ipc of known concentration 6 105 copies µl prior to rna extraction and the recovery efficiency was calculated as follows recovery efficiency ipc recovered ipc seeded x 100 for each rna extraction run a non template control ntc was included by adding ipc 6 105 copies µl to molecular biology grade water and further used it as reference sample rt qpcr inhibition was assessed by comparing the ipc cycle threshold ct value of the seeded wastewater sample with the ipc non template control ct value a threshold difference of 2 cycles was indicative for no inhibition staley et al 2012 sars cov 2 primer set used for rt qpcr quantification was subjected to validation by whole genome sequencing based mutation analysis for the binding sites details in si the analysis revealed that only five mutations within the binding site of any of the used primers end probes were observed within the sequenced samples none of the observed mutations occurred in more than 2 samples or exceeded a frequency of 0 1 virtually excluding a systematic bias of the applied rt qpcr set up in the quantification of variants occurring in the vienna wastewater in the considered time period figure s1 si recovery efficiency of sars cov 2 gc in wastewater samples average value was 57 71 8 5 for the rt qpcr results a threshold value of 40 cycles was implemented all tested samples were considered positive and presented ct values were below the cut off limit varying between 27 and 35 cycles figure s2 si with an average pcr efficiency of 95 51 and 101 02 for ipc and pc respectively no pcr inhibition was detected for any of the tested samples 2 5 data analysis the raw absolute number of sars cov 2 rna gc in wastewater inflow samples was used to calculate the final concentrations reported to the population equivalent by applying the data normalization to total nitrogen tn frequently used in wbe been et al 2014 van nuijs et al 2011 an estimated excreted value of 11 g tn was taken as value excreted per person per day in wastewater epa 2002 tn was measured in the inflow wastewater samples following the standard en iso 20236 2018 and the normalized sars cov 2 genome copies per tn population equivalent pe11 was calculated by the following formula 1 sars cov 2 copies per ml 11 g tn g tn measured in wastewater 1 0 6 sars cov 2 genome copies per p e 11 where tn total nitrogen pe11 11 g tn per population equivalent detailed explanation of the formula in si equations s1 s2 s3 considering environmental factors such as rain events temperature fluctuations hydraulic retention time in the sewerage system soft smooth data analysis by rbf radial basis functions with factor 0 25 myers 1999 was implemented to closer estimate the number of sars cov 2 gc released per person for the days where no sampling was done in order to be representative as epidemiological data the 14 days incidence was taken into consideration the calculated incidence number was considered as total sum of new infected persons reported in the past 14 days and assuming a duration of 14 days until recovery from the covid disease is considered to represent the shedding duration via stool into wastewater li et al 2020a 2 6 whole genome sequencing and data analysis enriched rna extracts from the wastewater samples were subjected to viral whole genome sequencing as described by popa et al 2020 in brief genomic rna was amplified using the artic sars cov 2 primer set v3 applying 35 pcr cycles to cope with high ct value samples and sequenced on an illumina novaseq 6000 sequencer in 2 250 bp paired end mode to an average of 2 6 m reads per sample reads were demultiplexed quality controlled fastqc andrews 2010 and adapter trimmed bbduk bushnell et al 2017 bbmerge bushnell et al 2017 was used to correct sequences in overlapping regions of the same mate pair this way quality controlled reads were mapped against a joint human hg38 and sars cov 2 nc 045512 2 genome using bwa mem variants were detected and quantified using the tool lofreq wilm et al 2012 including a realignment step using its implementation of the viterbi algorithm samples with less than 40 of the genome covered with at least 10 reads were omitted entirely in the remaining samples variants with an allele frequency below 0 01 and sites with a read coverage less than 250 reads were excluded the consensus sequence was constructed using samtools mpileup and bcftools li 2011 and categorized according its sars cov 2 lineage rambaut et al 2020a using the software pangolin github com cov lineages pangolin for the quantification of the alpha lineage the specific markers applied are depicted in table s2 in supplementary information 2 7 clinical epidemiological data sars cov 2 wuhan

dashboard html and main website https www ages at themen krankheitserreger coronavirus sars cov 2 varianten in oesterreich out of the publicly available data we retrieved the vienna specific information and used it for downstream analysis 14 days incidence data was taken into consideration and compared with the sars cov 2 gc in wastewater normalized to population equivalent pe11 alpha lineage percentages in clinical samples retrieved from wgs data were further used for correlation and comparability evaluation with its share in the wastewater samples statistical analysis statistical data analysis and plots were performed in sigmaplot v14 0 non linear regression sigmoid curve was obtained using a 3 parameter formula equation s4 in si by applying a dynamic fitting regression 3 results 3 1 sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples and epidemiological data sars cov 2 prevalence in wastewater presents similar fluctuations as incidence data and an upward downward trend is observed initially in the sewage samples followed after a time lag by the clinical active cases per 100 000 inhabitants fig 1 depicts the daily sars cov 2 concentrations reported to the population equivalent pe11 for the period under specific investigation in this paper whole dataset figure s4 si the percentage of alpha variant in wastewater and the active cases per 100 000 inhabitants during the study period from october 2020 to may 2021 sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater reported to pe11 ranged from 5 01 107 to 1 10 109 gc fig 1 while comparing with its prevalence calculated per active case it ranged from 1 1011 to 3 5 1011 gc fig 2 for the same period the incidence varied from 237 to 1121 active cases per 100 000 inhabitants with two peaks in november and april data available on ages website corresponding the time right before the onset of the 2nd wave november 11th 2020 and lockdown in the eastern part of austria including vienna april 1st 2021 for 8 months from the pandemic onset sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater exhibit a rather similar trend as epidemiological data represented by the daily active cases reported to 100 000 inhabitants figure s4 si starting from november 2020 the concentration of the virus in the sewage samples showed a downward trend along with the number of the confirmed clinical cases fig 1 on november 11th 2020 the 2nd lockdown commenced in vienna followed by the 3rd one on december 26th 2020 with a break in between of 20 days without constraints restrictions that are highlighted by a drop in the confirmed active cases per 100 000 inhabitants from 1100 to less than 400 clinical covid 19 cases until january 2021 during this period the incidence ranged from 406 to 908 with a mean value of 582 active cases per day per 100 000 persons at the beginning of december sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater started to increase while the confirmed active cases per day continued to descend in contrast to the epidemiological data sars cov 2 concentration in the sewage samples continued to increase until march 2021 with fluctuations within the same order of magnitude over the study period the average sars cov 2 concentration in the wastewater samples is 3 44 108 gc per pe11 after the lockdown has terminated february 8th 2021 a noticeable boost in the incidence of covid 19 cases can be observed followed by an overlap of sars cov 2 concentration and incidence per 100 000 inhabitants at the beginning of april 2021 taking into account the lockdown measures and the increasing rate of vaccinated persons a decline in the wastewater viral rna can be noticed starting in april followed by the epidemiological data with a short delay considering the increase of sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater following an upward trend during the same period of a steady decrease in the clinical data raised the question of the explanation behind this state that was observed for 2 months december 8th 2020 until beginning of february 2021 after excluding methodological issues the viral shedding per active case was calculated the total load of the sars cov 2 expressed in gc per ml was multiplied with the wastewater flow of the specific day and divided by the active cases recalculated from the 14 days incidence per 100 000 persons using the actual population the resulting number illustrates the average viral shedding per infected person per day fig 2 exhibits the values calculated for each day during the discussed period plotted versus the 14 days incidences per 100 000 inhabitants as measure for infected persons shedding the virus reported for the same day it was expected that the shedding per person would remain constant resulting in roughly identical values on the y axis independent on the clinical data surprisingly the numbers show a pattern that deviates from expectations resulting in the definition of three phases at the beginning of our study period sars cov 2 concentration reported to the 14 days incidence remained stable at 1011 gc while the 14 days incidence per 100 000 inhabitants increases from approximately 400 to 800 active cases the onset of the 2nd lockdown november 17th 2020 led to a decrease in the incidence but the viral concentration shed by one infected person stayed rather stable in the tested wastewater samples in contrast starting with december 2020 a boost in the viral rna concentration could be observed in the wastewater that resulted in an increase in the number of gcs per active case too in that phase the incidence only showed a small fluctuation basically decreasing form 400 to 250 active cases per 14 days until the 3rd lockdown started december 26th 2020 interesting afterwards the 14 days incidence stabilized at around 200 active cases per 14 days for one month and half while the sars cov 2 concentration increased three times in the same period from 1 1011 to 3 1011 gc per 14 days incidence after the relaxation of the restrictions the incidence quickly started to increase reaching 400 active cases per 14 days in one month again at the same time sars cov 2 shedding per active case remains stable again 3 2 signature mutations for alpha lineage and their frequency in wastewater samples fig 3 displays a detailed analysis based on individual mutations and their relative abundance in the wastewater samples by revealing a consistent and more nuanced picture a block of around 23 mutations which characterize the period before january 2021 but never reach complete fixation in the population are slowly phasing out during january february in the same period around 30 mutations are slowly emerging and reaching fixation by march 2021 all of these mutations are signature mutations of the alpha lineage 3 3 percentages of alpha lineage and n501y mutation in clinical and wastewater samples in vienna austria derived from wgs data on january 4th 2021 the first patient was officially confirmed and reported by the health authorities with sars cov 2 alpha variant in vienna austria although the first case with alpha variant was detected around christmas time the official confirmation from sequencing data was necessary in order to report it as positive for the alpha lineage the alpha lineage increased gradually in clinical samples from 1 on 10th of january 2021 to 49 on 1st of february 2021 reaching 75 on 15th of march 2021 the atypical descending trend observed in clinical data concomitant with the increasing tendency of the sars cov 2 gc in wastewater samples starting with dec 8th 2021 fig 1 gave rise to data interpretation questions regression model analysis dashed line fig 1 for the alpha variant and n501y mutation percentages obtained from sequencing gray area in fig 4 matched in both data sets from clinical and wastewater samples for the same study period the percentage of alpha in wastewater samples reached almost 100 in only 10 weeks since its first detection while a similar share in clinical samples was visible after 13 weeks from the first confirmed case 4 discussions this study describes the temporal quantitative analysis of sars cov 2 genome and alpha lineage in wastewater samples in vienna austria during the study period we determined the total sars cov 2 concentration and alpha variant share in 73 wastewater samples collected between october 4th 2020 and may 5th 2021 from vienna wwtp further we compared the epidemiological data active cases per 100 000 inhabitants with the wastewater data reported to the population equivalent pe11 and based on a non linear regression model the estimated date when alpha variant appeared in the sewage samples from vienna was assessed the present paper considers the tn as human biomarker to estimate the population connected to the sewerage system pe11 in vienna one of the first wbe studies to detect and track sars cov 2 in wastewater in europe was conducted by medema and collaborators in the netherlands medema et al 2020 since the onset of the pandemic the wastewater surveillance of sars cov 2 became a monitoring routine worldwide the observed sars cov 2 concentrations in untreated wastewater ranged from 105 to 1011 gc ml ahmed et al 2020a d aoust et al 2021 peccia et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2021 similarly in our manuscript the observed sars cov 2 concentrations in vienna wastewater over the whole monitoring period figure s4 si ranged from 3 59 107 in may 2021 5 01 107 in april 2020 to respectively 1 10 109 gc ml in march 2021 for the first one and half month of the study october 2020 november 15th 2020 a similar upward sars cov 2 pattern was observed in both wastewater samples and active clinical cases per 100 000 inhabitants the increase in the wastewater signal fits the reported clinical cases fig 1 similar results were observed by wilton et al 2021 foladori et al 2020 and randazzo et al 2020 in contrast for the downward trend the data correspond only for a limited period interesting by december 8th the number of infected persons continue the decline but the sars cov 2 concentration in sewage samples started to raise again one explanation for the resulting changes of sars cov 2 gcs per active case would be a different shedding rate by infected individuals or different virion stability of circulating variants in the respective period in wastewater to elucidate the potential role of variant specific mutations regarding the upward trend of sars cov 2 concentration we characterized the patterns of prevailing virus variants in the wastewater samples the main outcome is that the mutations present at the beginning of the study period disappear within one month and new ones signature mutations for alpha variant showed up and get fixed in the population by the end of march fig 3 comparable to our outcome recent studies highlight the potential contribution of wastewater monitoring for the early detection of alpha lineage by signature mutations la rosa et al 2021 wilton et al 2021 la rosa et al 2021 report the first evidence of vocs identification based on signature mutations in wastewater samples from italy using nested rt pcr together with sanger sequencing technique washington et al 2021 describe the emergence and dynamic of the alpha lineage in the united states in clinical samples results which show that the variant was already present in different states in november 2020 washington et al 2021 considering the association of d614g and n501y mutations with a higher viral load and transmissibility korber et al 2020 volz et al 2021 we presume that the different development of the two signals wastewater and clinical data may correspond with the emergence of alpha lineage recent studies underline our statement that sars cov 2 alpha variant presents a higher viral load in the respiratory tract as well as in stool frampton et al 2021 kidd et al 2021 rosenke et al 2021 in accordance with our results wilton et al 2021 correlate the emergence of alpha variant with high levels of viral rna found in sewage samples from london wilton et al 2021 the dissemination of the alpha lineage appears to have a more accelerated spread than sars cov 2 wuhan 1 strain in human population korber et al 2020 volz et al 2021 wilton et al 2021 the result of the sigmoid regression model derived from sequencing data indicates the first occurrence of the alpha variant in vienna sewage sample started around december 8th 2020 in the same period a decoupling of the wastewater signal and the epidemiological incidence was observed fig 1 and the average amount of gc in wastewater shed by one infected person started to increase fig 2 the modelled data show that on december 8th the alpha lineage was present in vienna sewage samples in a share of about 1 when the initial clinical case was confirmed the variant portion in wastewater was already at 15 fig 1 figure s5 si so within one month the percentage increases to 15 in order to reach 50 after another 3 weeks at the beginning of march 2021 the sars cov 2 alpha lineage gets to 90 of the total wastewater samples tested underlining the fast dissemination of the new variant among the population table s4 si nevertheless data interpretation should consider different factors such as environmental conditions rainfall and snowfall events temperature ph hydraulic retention time in the sewers or chemicals disinfectants and detergents as they may interfere with the final sars cov 2 gc reported polo et al 2020 the well known fact that temperature variations affect the stability of sars cov 2 in wastewater led to suspicions regarding the effect of temperature fluctuation in the vienna sewerage system as it is already shown in literature sars cov 2 viral particles display different behavior influenced by temperature in sewage samples ahmed et al 2020 tested the stability of sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater samples at four different temperatures the main outcome of their study is that sars cov 2 viral particles have an extended persistence at 4 and 15 c up to 27 and 20 days respectively ahmed et al 2020b in contrast wurtzer et al 2021 observed no effect on sars cov 2 viral rna detection after incubation for 24 h in a range of temperature between 4 c and 40 c the authors defined a period of 7 days persistence of total viral rna at 4 c wurtzer et al 2021 noteworthy only temperature values below 15 c led to a slight increase in sars cov 2 concentration in wastewater samples from vienna figure s5 si as the flow time of the wastewater in vienna sewerage system is rather short average of about two hours a temperature effect on the decay of the viral particles should be rather small based on the combination of a short flow time and only small fluctuations of temperature max difference of 7 c see figure s5 si in the wastewater samples during the time period investigated we conclude the emergence of the new variant being responsible for the increased wastewater signal observed and thus the presence of alpha already well before identification in clinical samples overall sars cov 2 concentration in untreated wastewater from vienna was influenced mainly by the emergence of alpha lineage considering the association of different signature mutations with higher viral loads and only a small effect may be attributed to fluctuations in temperature 5 conclusions considering that for the clinical cases the results can be delayed for few days due to the time required for symptoms to initiate and testing capacity wbe proves to be the fastest and advantageous method to provide a quick snapshot of sars cov 2 circulating variants in a certain catchment the real number of infected persons is difficult to recalculate with accuracy due to the shedding values which are dependent on the specific sars cov 2 variant and the constant change in lineage composition in wastewater different variants may display a distinct behavior of sars cov 2 concentrations in wastewater therefore a factor of extrapolation should be considered carefully in drawing the final conclusions wastewater represents a complex matrix thus the key parameters that should be rigorously considered are represented by the viral concentration and circulating sars cov 2 variants in wastewater samples representative samples and population normalization credit

developed to understand in depth the synergistic mechanism in the coexisted e coli dh5α tet inactivation and tetracycline hydrochloride tet degradation using photoelectrocatalysis pec as a model technology results showed that low dosage 0 40 ppm of tet exerted a negative influence on arb inactivation with prolonged bactericidal time from 60 to 160 min addition of tet in environmental concentration 5 60 ppm resulted in sub lethal damage and prolonged pec treatment time 100 160 min accounting for inhibition effects on arb inactivation the major reactive species rss involved in arb inactivation and tet degradation were evidenced as photogenerated hole oh and o2 whereas hole and o2 were demonstrated to be the major disinfectants for arb arg inactivation the bacterial defense system displayed increased antioxidative activities of superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gsh px to protect arb cells against oxidative stress exposure to 60 ppm tet was a threshold where certain arb cells were induced into viable but nonculturable bacterial cell vbnc state as evidenced by plate counting and atp activity analysis together with the integral cell membranes observed

args and antibiotics from wastewater to the natural environment several light driven advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis pc and photoelectrocatalysis pec have been reported in literature or already applied in water purification of arb args and antibiotics liu et al 2021 meng et al 2010 noted that pec as a promising method has attracted quite a lot attention in the inactivation of arb args or antibiotics degradation separately in recent years qin et al 2021 shi et al 2020 pec have shown effective inactivation capacity to a variety of bacteria such as escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus li et al 2011 lin et al 2021 nie et al 2014 sun et al 2014 and even can inactive arb args such as tetracycline resistant bacteria and β lactame resistant bacteria cai et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 yin et al 2019 yin et al 2021 however pec was generally applied to inactivate arb args in the absence of antibiotics which faced a large gap from the real situation of the co existed arb args and antibiotics in many complex water systems it was demonstrated that antibiotics such as tetracycline tet and ofloxacin were degraded by photogenerated holes h and reactive oxidation species ross in pec system li et al 2014 li et al 2012 meng et al 2010 ye et al 2021 which might bring about negative influence on inactivation of arb args besides exposure to several adverse stressors such as antibiotic residues and oxidative stimulus may induce a synergistic reinforcement to accelerate bacterial death or stimulate various stress responses inside living cells to protect bacteria from damage and death cai et al 2021 ghernaout and elboughdiri 2020 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2013 which would make the inactivation process aberrant complicated therefore in depth understanding photoelectrocatalytic inactivation mechanism of various arb args and synergistic degradation of antibiotics in a complex water system by pec is highly required but there is still a lack of relevant reports the aims of the current study are therefore to 1 identify the dominant species of arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation within these coexisted water system 2 verify the relationship between rss level antioxidant enzyme activities and arb arg inactivation efficiencies 3 unveil the changes in cell membrane integrity cell morphology and arg abundance utilizing flow cytometry fcm field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr during pec processes 4 clarify possible synergistic purification mechanism of arb args and antibiotics during pec processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received ultrapure deionized water 18 mω cm produced with a milli q water purification system was used to prepare all the experimental solutions antibiotic resistant bacterial strain related to tetracycline hydrochloride tet namely e coli dh5α tet and antibiotic tet were selected as the treated objects 2 2 pec apparatus setup a cylindrical glass pec reactor 50 ml volume with a quartz window for uva illumination was used to perform synchronous arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation experiments using a two electrode system with a tio2 nanotube array photoanode and a platinum foil counter electrode a voltage of 1 v was applied to the two electrode system by a direct current power supply hspy 36 03 china and a led lamp with maximum emission at 365 nm 100 mw cm2 was used to provide the uv light source the reaction temperature was controlled in 25 c 2 c and the reaction solution was mixed with a constant temperature digital magnetic stirrer for each run of pec process 50 ml 0 20 m nano3 solution containing 1 108 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml e coli dh5α tet and antibiotic tet of specified concentrations were added into the reactor and aliquots of solution were withdrawn at constant time intervals during pec and then were processed into samples for further measurements 2 3 quantification of arb viability and tet degradation the e coli dh5α tet strain was constructed by our research group which contains an arg encoded plasmid conferring resistance to tet yin et al 2020 the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of tet against e coli dh5α tet was tested in the range of 256 512 ppm through two fold dilutions in 96 well plates the bacterial cells were cultured in the nutrient broth growth medium at 37 c for 16 h so that the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth was reached the cultured bacteria were washed with sterilized 0 2 m nano3 via centrifugation then the bacterial cell concentration was adjusted to a final cell concentration of 1 108 cfu ml in 0 2 m nano3 solution which base on the principle that the bacteria need persist appropriate osmotic pressure during pec for each obtained bacterial sample an appropriate gradient dilution was conducted with sterilized 0 9 nacl solution and 0 1 ml diluted sample was uniformly spread on nutrient agar plates in triplicate and then the nutrient agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the number of single colonies formed was counted to quantify the viable and cultivable bacterial cells the concentration of tet was measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc with chromatography column athena c18 wp 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm and the mobile phase was consisted of water containing 0 1 v v formic acid a and methanol b the degradation intermediates of tet were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry uhplc q orbitrap hrms thermo scientic dionex u3000 and the base peak intensity chromatographic data obtained in both esi positive and negative modes full scan spectra were measured range from 150 to 2000 m z the chromatography column was waters acquity uplc behc18 2 1 mm 100 mm 1 7 μm and the column temperature was 35 c a quaternary pump was used and the mobile phase was consisted of water containing 0 1 v v formic acid a and methanol b with gradient elution the flow rate was set at 0 25 ml min and the injection volume was 2 μl for each analysis all the data acquired would be processed in the thermo xcalibur data system version 4 1 detailed information is summed in table s1 in supporting information si 2 4 assay of extracellular and intracellular ros level the levels of the ross in water generated during pec process was analyzed with electron spin resonance measurements esr emxplus bruker biospin in the first ten minutes of pec running esr spectra of oh and o2 were trapped by dmpo in aqueous dispersion and in methanol dispersion respectively esr spectrum of 1o2 was trapped by temp in aqueous dispersion to explore the oxidative stress levels of bacteria the levels of intracellular ross in the e coli dh5α tet cells were also detected during pec process with different tet concentrations variation briefly the intracellular ross were indirectly quantified using a probe of fluorogenic dye 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da dcfh da can freely go through the cell membrane with no fluorescence after entering cell dcfh da can be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to produce dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh which cannot penetrate the cell membrane making it easy for the probe to be loaded into the cell the intracellular ross can oxidize non fluorescent dcfh to produce fluorescent dichlorofluorescein dcf and the level of ross in the bacterial cells can be determined by detecting the fluorescence of the dcf detailed experimental procedures are described in the si 2 5 assay of antioxidant enzyme activities and respiration rate of bacteria the activities of various antioxidant enzymes including catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gsh px that can reduce intracellular peroxidation levels were also tested briefly the total protein of bacterial cell suspension in each sample was extracted with the bacterial protein extraction kit c600596 sangon biotech china the protein samples extracted were analyzed for sod cat and gsh px activities using total superoxide dismutase assay kit with wst 8 s0101s beyotime biotechnology china catalase assay kit s0051 beyotime biotechnology china and cellular glutathione peroxidase assay kit with nadph s0056 beyotime biotechnology china respectively the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp concentration of bacterial cell suspension in each sample was measured using atp assay kit s0026 beyotime biotechnology china 2 6 evaluation of cell membrane permeability and integrity the permeability and integrity of bacterial membrane were assessed by fcm bd facsaria ii bd biosciences briefly the bacterial suspension of each sample obtained was diluted into 106 107 cfu ml and immediately stained with syto 9 and propidium iodide pi with live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 2 031 174 invitrogen by themo fisher scientific syto 9 could stain all bacterial cells with green fluorescence while pi could stain destroyed or dead cells with red fluorescence for completing the staining samples were incubated with syto 9 and pi for 20 min at room temperature in the dark forward scatter fsc versus side scatter ssc biplots were used to identify and gate the bacterial population by filtering background particles and noise out the green fluorescence of syto 9 and red fluorescence of pi were filtered on the fl1 channel 530 30 nm and the fl3 channel 670 nm long pass respectively for each sample about 10 000 cells were collected and analyzed all acquired date were processed using bd facsdiva software 6 0 2 7 the analysis of cell morphology the cellular structure of e coli dh5α tet sampled during different treatment intervals was observed by tungsten filament scanning electron microscope sem s 3400 n hitachi japan sem analysis was conducted as follows the bacterial cells were firstly fixed on a single crystal silicon with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h after washing with sterilized pbs solution for three times the samples were dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol 30 50 70 90 and 100 for 10 min respectively finally the dehydrated samples were dried by vacuum freeze drying coated with gold foil and observed under sem 2 8 evaluation of gene abundance related tet resistance and oxidative stress total dna of each sample obtained was extracted with ezup column bacteria genomic dna purification kit b518255 sangon biotech china quantification of 23 typical genes related tet resistance and oxidative stress found in nature were carried out using real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr the 16s rrna gene as an amplification internal control was also evaluated by rt pcr and detailed information about recipes and primers for rt pcr is in table s2 in si all the data expressed in this study were replicated in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb inactivation under antibiotics with different concentrations to determine the pec inactivation activity under the coexistence of arb cells and antibiotics time killing curves were firstly plotted using plate counting method for pec inactivation of arb e coli dh5a tet under tet in a concentration range of 0 to 360 ppm fig 1 a complete bacterial inactivation was obtained within 60 min in the absence of tet suggesting pec alone can effectively inactivate arb cells with a concentration of 108 cfu ml and also confirmed by our early study nie et al 2014 it was also observed that low dosage of tet exerted a negative influence on arb inactivation increasing tet concentration from 5 to 40 ppm resulted in prolonged pec inactivation time from 100 to 160 min fig 1a where the removal of tet was accelerated with a proximately 80 removal efficiency achieved fig 1b surprisingly a synergistic effect between bacteria inactivation and antibiotics degradation occurred when the dosage of tet was up to 60 ppm which significantly facilitated the inactivation of arb with a complete inactivation within 120 min and slowed down tet removal efficiency fig 1a and b however adding 120 and 360 ppm tet alone also resulted in a certain amount of inactivation of arb fig 1c exactly the same as the previous results in fig 1a this provided evidence that the bactericidal effect of pec would be deemed less important in the presence of tet higher than 120 ppm and antibiotics may inactivate bacteria more quickly than pecs at high antibiotics concentration wang and zhuan 2020 wu and hu 2020 therefore 0 60 ppm of tet was used in the following experiments to elucidate the synergistic purification effect of pec system in bacteria and tet coexisted water system 3 2 relative contributions of ross during pec process the photogenerated holes could oxidize the adsorbed surface water molecules and hydroxyls into oh then the photogenerated electrons react with o2 to produce o2 li et al 2012 meng et al 2010 it is generally accepted that the main active substances in pec process are holes oh o2 that are able to strongly attack various pollutants li et al 2012 wang and zhuan 2020 to illuminate the possible main ross involved in arb inactivation and tet degradation except for the part directly oxidized by holes on the photoanode surface the esr spin trap experiments were used to also identify the relative contribution of other ross except photogenerated holes including oh o2 and 1o2 in pec process by the ross scavenging method descript in our early works cai et al 2020 wang and zhuan 2020 the obvious signals of dmpo oh fig 2 a and dmpoo2 fig 2b indicated that large quantities of oh and o2 were both generated in pec system mousset and dionysiou 2020 with the addition of 20 ppm tet the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpoo2 were substantially weakened suggesting that both oh and o2 were responsible for the degradation of tet except the direct contribution of photogenerated holes ma et al 2019 in addition the initially produced radical from the reaction between tet and oh may react with o2 to release o2 which may provide additional source of o2 in the system the observed weak peaks of temp 1o2 might be generated from the further oxidation of o2 by photogenerated holes shi et al 2022 whereas it completely vanished with the addition of tet fig 2c these results suggested the competitive consumption of oh o2 and 1o2 by increased tet could partially account for the retarded inactivation of arb in this coexisted system of arb and antibiotics besides considering the low concentration of oh and 1o2 in the presence of tet holes and o2 were thereby believed as dominated rss for inactivation of arb and degradation of antibiotics within this pec system 3 3 bacterial inactivation mechanism in the presence tet 3 3 1 stress response under co exposure to pec and tet the attacks by various rss are usually an important pathway for arb inactivation during pec process to further clarify the oxidative response of arb in the presence of tet the activities of intracellular ross and main antioxidant enzymes including sod gsh px and cat were monitored during pec process with various concentrations of tet fig 3 first of all in the absence of tet the intracellular ros level was found to sharply increase at the beginning 20 min and then followed a quick decrease fig 3a this result combined with the complete inactivation of arb cells achieved within 60 min fig 1a suggested that pec treatment alone could directly trigger bacterial oxidative stress systems and induce disruption of cellular redox equilibrium through quick raising accumulation of intracellular ross according to early references gusarov and nudler 2005 yin et al 2020 in contrast the presence of tet 5 60 ppm resulted in a low level of intracellular ross fig 3a suggesting the mitigated oxidative responses of arb cells this result matches well with the esr results further confirming that tet could act as a ros scavenger to reduce the oxidative inactivation of arb the activity of sod and cat represents the response of bacteria toward o2 and h2o2 respectively while both h2o2 and lipid peroxides enable the stimulation of gsh px according to references djordjevic et al 2004 wilke et al 1992 in fig 3b the evolution of the sod activity matched well with that of the intracellular ross concentration implying that o2 might be the main intracellular ross to attack the intracellular substances of the arb this speculation was also supported by previous studies where oh in solution was incapable to penetrate the bacterial membrane due to its short half life and short half diffusion length sun et al 2016 sun et al 2014 noted that gsh px activities decreased slowly at the beginning and then increased gradually fig 3c while the cat activities remained steady throughout 60 min of pec treatment fig 3d therefore we can also conclude that bacterial defense system tended to display increased activities of sod and gsh px to protect the arb cells during pec treatment alone however the observed increase in sod and gsh px activities was negligible in the presence of tet this observation again demonstrated the alleviated oxidative pressure of arb by tet 3 3 2 mechanisms of arb inactivation in the presence tet the destruction of cell membrane integrity of bacteria was generally used as an indicator of the first step of the bactericidal effect pigeot remy et al 2012 sun et al 2014 to characterize the integrity of arb cell membrane under co exposure to pec and tet the fcm of syto 9 pi stained arb cells were investigated according to early reference lindivat et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 a a quadrant marker divided two parameter plots into four quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 to discriminate bacterial cells in different states dead pi stained cells q1 injured syto 9 pi double stained cells q2 unstained cells q3 and viable syto 9 stained cells q4 based on the method reported in the reference lindivat et al 2020 before the exposure to pec and tet the fcm signals almost located in q4 quadrant suggesting nearly all the cells have the intact membranes and a very small fraction of injured cells before experimental operation fig 4aa1 d1 as displayed in fig 4a the distribution of fcm signals intimately related on the concentration of tet during the exposure to pec alone the proportion of membrane damaged cells increased to 97 1 in the first 60 min and 98 5 of 180 min fig 4aa2 aa3 with low dosage 5 20 ppm addition of tet the proportion of membrane damaged cells decreased to 73 2 86 2 within 60 min whereas 97 6 was obtained within 180 min fig 4ab2 ab3 increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm the proportion of damaged cells increased to 72 9 within 60 min however no membrane damage was identified as the treatment further extended to 180 min this phenomenon suggested that excessive antibiotics residues might become dominated strategy to inactive bacteria rather than pec in this coexisted water system of arb and antibiotics fig 4ac2 ac3 it was of interest to find a great deviation between the arb inactivation and membrane damage results fig s1 noted that the percentages of culturable viable cells measured by plate counting method were all more than 60 within 60 min of pec treatment in the presence of 5 20 ppm tet much higher than the damage percentage of cell membrane obtained by fcm analysis these results suggested that a proportion of the membrane damaged cells remained culturable which might be benefited from the bacterial self defense and auto repair mechanisms as previously reported schottroff et al 2018 withers 1975 zhao et al 2013 by further increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm distinctly higher percentage of the membrane damaged cells was observed using fcm method as compared with the results using plate counting method within 60 min where certain cells remained intact membrane but cannot be cultured according to previous studies harsh conditions can induce bacterial cells into viable but nonculturable vbnc state in which the cells still keep intact membranes but lose the ability to form colonies ayrapetyan et al 2015 casini et al 2018 chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020 herein our results suggest that excessive antibiotic restudies within certain concentration range in pec system might also induce arb turning into vbnc state we speculate part of the reasons may be associated with the inhibition of arb cell metabolism under co exposure to pec and tet merlin et al 2011 yin et al 2019 one major indicator of cell metabolic activity is the potential of the cells to produce atp pu et al 2019 thus we herein also examined the relative atp levels of arb cells during pec treatment in the presence of different dosages of tet 0 60 ppm fig 4b with pec treatment alone the cellular atp level showed a slight increase and followed a drop after 40 min this result agreed with the changes in the activities of intracellular ross and sod fig 3a and 3b further suggesting a correlation between metabolic activity and viability of bacterial cells barrette et al 1989 the presence of 5 ppm tet triggered a higher cellular atp level than that with pec treatment alone which might be resulted from the increased survival efficiency of arb cells as shown in fig 1a addition of tet with a range of 20 60 ppm the cellular atp levels were inversely correlated with tet concentration and significantly lower than those of adding tet with a range of 0 5 ppm this suggested that 20 60 ppm tet might facilitate some arb cells into dormant state with low metabolism by decreasing atp generation activities in which arb cells may gain a decreased cellular susceptibility to osmotic pressure and exhibit reduced cell membrane damaged effects to survive pec treatment chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020 klein and lewinson 2011 to directly observe the characteristic of cell membrane damage sem was also employed to image the morphologies of treated bacterial cells during pec process with different dosages of tet as shown in fig 4ca1 cd1 the untreated cells were solid rod shapes with intact and smooth membrane after 60 min of pec treatment apparent crevasse yawned at cell membrane and significant leakage of intracellular substances were observed only large amount of bacterial cell debris remained after 180 min treatment the sem images clearly showed that the intensities of cell membrane destruction were dependent on the changes of cell membrane shape and fine structure over pec treatment time increasing tet from 5 to 60 ppm the cell membranes presented a reduced damage with fewer microstructures of depression distortion wrinkling and rupture after 60 min treatment fig 4ca2 cd2 which was attributed to the quenched effect of tet throughout 180 min of pec treatment in the presence of 60 ppm tet some arb cells became small short and ellipsoidal with intact membranes fig 4ca3 cd3 but they were complete inactivated and nonculturable as demonstrated by plate counting method fig 1a this suggested that increasing tet up to 60 ppm during pec treatment may present vbnc inducing conditions consistent well with fcm analysis 3 3 3 evaluation of gene abundance related tet resistance to further investigate the inactivation and damage of args the relative abundance of typical genes related to tet resistance and oxidative stress were also examined during pec treatment intervals jiang et al 2017 with increasing tet from 0 to 60 ppm the relative abundance of tested gene residues related to ribosomal protection proteins efflux of tet and oxidative stress obviously increased fig 5 which might be attributed to the alleviated oxidation damage of dna by tet based on ross scavenger effects in addition low concentration of tet facilitated the inactivation of tested genes related to sos response fig 5 which is a basic function of the cells to survive in a stressful situation according to early references erental et al 2014 sutton et al 2000 this might be explained by that sos response appeared to be in repairing dna lesions caused by oxidative stress under co exposure to pec and low dosage of tet in which the related dna would unwind the double helix and tend to be vulnerable to oxidative attacks janion 2001 sutton et al 2000 however with increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm the relative abundance of tested genes residues related to tet resistance was observed considerably higher this might be resulted from the increased amount of arb cells in vbnc state as demonstrated in fig 4 leading to the retention of more active arg residues and potential risk of their continued spread 3 4 degradation pathway of tet in the presence arb to further understand the degradation pathway of tet in the arb args and antibiotics coexisted system pec degradation experiments of tet in the presence of arb were also examined and the uhplc q orbitrap hrms was employed to identify its degradation intermediates the major intermediates and final products of tet degradation were identified and the ms characteristic of all tet degradation intermediates are all shown in fig s2 in si in summary the degradation pathways of tet in the presence of arb were grouped as three dominant routes as proposed in fig 6 in route i except tet a intermediate b m z 477 1500 was identified as hydroxylation product of tet attacked by oh then the carbon chain scission produced intermediate e m z 396 8009 was obtained with the further attacks by rss mainly holes oh and o2 intermediate e opened the benzene ring to produce intermediates h m z 351 2492 and l m z 242 2838 in route ii intermediate c m z 461 1552 was another hydroxylation product of tet attacked by oh then the n methyl group was oxidized to the carbonyl group intermediate f m z 509 1395 was formed with the further attacks by ross intermediate f opened the benzene ring to produce intermediates i m z 451 0993 and l m z 242 2838 in route iii intermediate d m z 399 1546 was formed from tet through n and c demethylation reaction ross further attacked intermediate d with loss of nh2 and ring opening reaction to produce intermediates g m z 432 2798 j m z 403 2490 k m z 367 2186 and l m z 242 2838 although intermediates h k and l still have the potential for further degradation in a sufficient time of pec treatment but some intermediates like those with m z 461 432 and 477 may retain some kind of toxicity according to the early references khan et al 2010 wang et al 2018 which might present additional stressor to induce the arb cells entering vbnc state as a survival strategy and the decrease in the inactivation of args this is worth further study to systematically analyze the influence of degradation intermediates on the inactivation and propagation of arb args during pec treatment 4 conclusions this study mainly presented an in depth understanding of the synergistic mechanism of the inactivation of e coli dh5α tet bacteria and the degradation of corresponding antibiotics tet in coexisted water system using pec as a model technology the results demonstrated that pec treatment alone quick inactivated arb args by raising accumulation of intracellular ross and disrupting the cellular redox equilibrium meanwhile the bacterial defense system tended to increase antioxidative activities of sod and gsh px to protect arb cells against the oxidative stress the addition of tet in water system of bacteria inhibited the inactivation of arb args mainly due to competing for the reactive species such as hole oh and o2 whereas the arb arg inactivation was dominated by holes and o2 of particular concern is that the exposure of pec together with tet may facilitate some arb cells turning into vbncs leading to the retention of more active arg residues and potential risk of their continued spread although some aspects remain unclear and the studied system is a typical example in real time the evaluation of synergistic mechanisms of arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation is a task worthy of a more complete and exhaustive approach to help avoid underestimating the risk of antibiotic resistance

16166,the occurrence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args antibiotic resistant bacteria arb have been currently aggravating due to the increase of antibiotic residues in the aquatic environment the interaction of arb args with antibiotics inevitably occurred during water purification yet their synergistic purification mechanism remains unclear herein a systematic approach was developed to understand in depth the synergistic mechanism in the coexisted e coli dh5α tet inactivation and tetracycline hydrochloride tet degradation using photoelectrocatalysis pec as a model technology results showed that low dosage 0 40 ppm of tet exerted a negative influence on arb inactivation with prolonged bactericidal time from 60 to 160 min addition of tet in environmental concentration 5 60 ppm resulted in sub lethal damage and prolonged pec treatment time 100 160 min accounting for inhibition effects on arb inactivation the major reactive species rss involved in arb inactivation and tet degradation were evidenced as photogenerated hole oh and o2 whereas hole and o2 were demonstrated to be the major disinfectants for arb arg inactivation the bacterial defense system displayed increased antioxidative activities of superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gsh px to protect arb cells against oxidative stress exposure to 60 ppm tet was a threshold where certain arb cells were induced into viable but nonculturable bacterial cell vbnc state as evidenced by plate counting and atp activity analysis together with the integral cell membranes observed by flow cytometry fcm and scanning electron microscope sem these findings appeal for appropriate technical adjustments for water and wastewater treatment to ensure safety of water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photoeletrocatalytic technology coexistence of arb args with antibiotics bacteria inactivation antibiotic degradation synergetic mechanism 1 introduction the occurrence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes args antibiotic resistant bacteria arb are gradually evolving into a global problem rodriguez rojas et al 2013 especially in the special period such as covid 19 outbreak the propagation of arb args through sewage channels will be aggravated seriously endangering the ecological environment and human health bhowmick et al 2020 daraei et al 2020 horn et al 2020 qu et al 2020 it was reported that antibiotic residues even at trace levels potentially foster the antibiotic resistance and promote the proliferation of arb args as an undesirable side effect ghernaout and elboughdiri 2020 jia et al 2011 unfortunately antibiotic residues ubiquitously coexist with arb args in aquatic environment for example medical wastewater or sewage water the consumed antibiotics with 48 being used for humans and the rest for animals are hardly completely metabolized in bodies resulting in antibiotic residues e g erythromycin oxytetracycline with detected levels ranging from tens of ng l to hundreds of μg l in the aquatic environments carvalho and santos 2016 daghrir and drogui 2013 jia et al 2011 kovalakova et al 2020 kümmerer 2009 in medical wastewater the level of antibiotic residues even hits hundreds of mg l bansal 2019 they pose intensifying concerns to trigger the increase in resistant strains of microorganisms worldwide and bring out particularly high risk of arb args andreozzi et al 2004 besse and garric 2008 in this context the development of safe and effective technologies has become an imperative need to simultaneously eliminate the coexisted arb args and antibiotics from aquatic environment the wastewater treatment plants play the central role in regulating the migration of arb args and antibiotics from wastewater to the natural environment several light driven advanced oxidation processes such as photocatalysis pc and photoelectrocatalysis pec have been reported in literature or already applied in water purification of arb args and antibiotics liu et al 2021 meng et al 2010 noted that pec as a promising method has attracted quite a lot attention in the inactivation of arb args or antibiotics degradation separately in recent years qin et al 2021 shi et al 2020 pec have shown effective inactivation capacity to a variety of bacteria such as escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus li et al 2011 lin et al 2021 nie et al 2014 sun et al 2014 and even can inactive arb args such as tetracycline resistant bacteria and β lactame resistant bacteria cai et al 2021 jiang et al 2017 yin et al 2019 yin et al 2021 however pec was generally applied to inactivate arb args in the absence of antibiotics which faced a large gap from the real situation of the co existed arb args and antibiotics in many complex water systems it was demonstrated that antibiotics such as tetracycline tet and ofloxacin were degraded by photogenerated holes h and reactive oxidation species ross in pec system li et al 2014 li et al 2012 meng et al 2010 ye et al 2021 which might bring about negative influence on inactivation of arb args besides exposure to several adverse stressors such as antibiotic residues and oxidative stimulus may induce a synergistic reinforcement to accelerate bacterial death or stimulate various stress responses inside living cells to protect bacteria from damage and death cai et al 2021 ghernaout and elboughdiri 2020 jiang et al 2017 li et al 2013 which would make the inactivation process aberrant complicated therefore in depth understanding photoelectrocatalytic inactivation mechanism of various arb args and synergistic degradation of antibiotics in a complex water system by pec is highly required but there is still a lack of relevant reports the aims of the current study are therefore to 1 identify the dominant species of arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation within these coexisted water system 2 verify the relationship between rss level antioxidant enzyme activities and arb arg inactivation efficiencies 3 unveil the changes in cell membrane integrity cell morphology and arg abundance utilizing flow cytometry fcm field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr during pec processes 4 clarify possible synergistic purification mechanism of arb args and antibiotics during pec processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all the chemicals were of reagent grade and used as received ultrapure deionized water 18 mω cm produced with a milli q water purification system was used to prepare all the experimental solutions antibiotic resistant bacterial strain related to tetracycline hydrochloride tet namely e coli dh5α tet and antibiotic tet were selected as the treated objects 2 2 pec apparatus setup a cylindrical glass pec reactor 50 ml volume with a quartz window for uva illumination was used to perform synchronous arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation experiments using a two electrode system with a tio2 nanotube array photoanode and a platinum foil counter electrode a voltage of 1 v was applied to the two electrode system by a direct current power supply hspy 36 03 china and a led lamp with maximum emission at 365 nm 100 mw cm2 was used to provide the uv light source the reaction temperature was controlled in 25 c 2 c and the reaction solution was mixed with a constant temperature digital magnetic stirrer for each run of pec process 50 ml 0 20 m nano3 solution containing 1 108 colony forming unit per milliliter cfu ml e coli dh5α tet and antibiotic tet of specified concentrations were added into the reactor and aliquots of solution were withdrawn at constant time intervals during pec and then were processed into samples for further measurements 2 3 quantification of arb viability and tet degradation the e coli dh5α tet strain was constructed by our research group which contains an arg encoded plasmid conferring resistance to tet yin et al 2020 the minimum inhibitory concentration mic of tet against e coli dh5α tet was tested in the range of 256 512 ppm through two fold dilutions in 96 well plates the bacterial cells were cultured in the nutrient broth growth medium at 37 c for 16 h so that the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth was reached the cultured bacteria were washed with sterilized 0 2 m nano3 via centrifugation then the bacterial cell concentration was adjusted to a final cell concentration of 1 108 cfu ml in 0 2 m nano3 solution which base on the principle that the bacteria need persist appropriate osmotic pressure during pec for each obtained bacterial sample an appropriate gradient dilution was conducted with sterilized 0 9 nacl solution and 0 1 ml diluted sample was uniformly spread on nutrient agar plates in triplicate and then the nutrient agar plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c the number of single colonies formed was counted to quantify the viable and cultivable bacterial cells the concentration of tet was measured with high performance liquid chromatography hplc with chromatography column athena c18 wp 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 μm and the mobile phase was consisted of water containing 0 1 v v formic acid a and methanol b the degradation intermediates of tet were analyzed using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole

the data acquired would be processed in the thermo xcalibur data system version 4 1 detailed information is summed in table s1 in supporting information si 2 4 assay of extracellular and intracellular ros level the levels of the ross in water generated during pec process was analyzed with electron spin resonance measurements esr emxplus bruker biospin in the first ten minutes of pec running esr spectra of oh and o2 were trapped by dmpo in aqueous dispersion and in methanol dispersion respectively esr spectrum of 1o2 was trapped by temp in aqueous dispersion to explore the oxidative stress levels of bacteria the levels of intracellular ross in the e coli dh5α tet cells were also detected during pec process with different tet concentrations variation briefly the intracellular ross were indirectly quantified using a probe of fluorogenic dye 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da dcfh da can freely go through the cell membrane with no fluorescence after entering cell dcfh da can be hydrolyzed by intracellular esterase to produce dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dcfh which cannot penetrate the cell membrane making it easy for the probe to be loaded into the cell the intracellular ross can oxidize non fluorescent dcfh to produce fluorescent dichlorofluorescein dcf and the level of ross in the bacterial cells can be determined by detecting the fluorescence of the dcf detailed experimental procedures are described in the si 2 5 assay of antioxidant enzyme activities and respiration rate of bacteria the activities of various antioxidant enzymes including catalase cat superoxide dismutase sod and glutathione peroxidase gsh px that can reduce intracellular peroxidation levels were also tested briefly the total protein of bacterial cell suspension in each sample was extracted with the bacterial protein extraction kit c600596 sangon biotech china the protein samples extracted were analyzed for sod cat and gsh px activities using total superoxide dismutase assay kit with wst 8 s0101s beyotime biotechnology china catalase assay kit s0051 beyotime biotechnology china and cellular glutathione peroxidase assay kit with nadph s0056 beyotime biotechnology china respectively the cellular adenosine triphosphate atp concentration of bacterial cell suspension in each sample was measured using atp assay kit s0026 beyotime biotechnology china 2 6 evaluation of cell membrane permeability and integrity the permeability and integrity of bacterial membrane were assessed by fcm bd facsaria ii bd biosciences briefly the bacterial suspension of each sample obtained was diluted into 106 107 cfu ml and immediately stained with syto 9 and propidium iodide pi with live dead baclight bacterial viability kit 2 031 174 invitrogen by themo fisher scientific syto 9 could stain all bacterial cells with green fluorescence while pi could stain destroyed or dead cells with red fluorescence for completing the staining samples were incubated with syto 9 and pi for 20 min at room temperature in the dark forward scatter fsc versus side scatter ssc biplots were used to identify and gate the bacterial population by filtering background particles

cells were collected and analyzed all acquired date were processed using bd facsdiva software 6 0 2 7 the analysis of cell morphology the cellular structure of e coli dh5α tet sampled during different treatment intervals was observed by tungsten filament scanning electron microscope sem s 3400 n hitachi japan sem analysis was conducted as follows the bacterial cells were firstly fixed on a single crystal silicon with 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution for 2 h after washing with sterilized pbs solution for three times the samples were dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol 30 50 70 90 and 100 for 10 min respectively finally the dehydrated samples were dried by vacuum freeze drying coated with gold foil and observed under sem 2 8 evaluation of gene abundance related tet resistance and oxidative stress total dna of each sample obtained was extracted with ezup column bacteria genomic dna purification kit b518255 sangon biotech china quantification of 23 typical genes related tet resistance and oxidative stress found in nature were carried out using real time polymerase chain reaction rt pcr the 16s rrna gene as an amplification internal control was also evaluated by rt pcr and detailed information about recipes and primers for rt pcr is in table s2 in si all the data expressed in this study were replicated in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 arb inactivation under antibiotics with different concentrations to determine the pec inactivation activity under the coexistence of arb cells and antibiotics time killing curves were firstly plotted using plate counting method for pec inactivation of arb e coli dh5a tet under tet in a concentration range of 0 to 360 ppm fig 1 a complete bacterial inactivation was obtained within 60 min in the absence of tet suggesting pec alone can effectively inactivate arb cells with a concentration of 108 cfu ml and also confirmed by our early study nie et al 2014 it was also observed that low dosage of tet exerted a negative influence on arb inactivation increasing tet concentration from 5 to 40 ppm resulted in prolonged pec inactivation time from 100 to 160 min fig 1a where the removal of tet was accelerated with a proximately 80 removal efficiency achieved fig 1b surprisingly a synergistic effect between bacteria inactivation and antibiotics degradation occurred when the dosage of tet was up to 60 ppm which significantly facilitated the inactivation of arb with a complete inactivation within 120 min and slowed down tet removal efficiency fig 1a and b however adding 120 and 360 ppm tet alone also resulted in a certain amount of inactivation of arb fig 1c exactly the same as the previous results in fig 1a this provided evidence that the bactericidal effect of pec would be deemed less important in the presence of tet higher than 120 ppm and antibiotics may inactivate bacteria more quickly than pecs at high antibiotics concentration wang and zhuan 2020 wu and hu 2020 therefore 0 60 ppm of tet was used in the following experiments to elucidate the synergistic purification effect of pec system in bacteria and tet coexisted water system 3 2 relative contributions of ross during pec process the photogenerated holes could oxidize the adsorbed surface water molecules and hydroxyls into oh then the photogenerated electrons react with o2 to produce o2 li et al 2012 meng et al 2010 it is generally accepted that the main active substances in pec process are holes oh o2 that are able to strongly attack various pollutants li et al 2012 wang and zhuan 2020 to illuminate the possible main ross involved in arb inactivation and tet degradation except for the part directly oxidized by holes on the photoanode surface the esr spin trap experiments were used to also identify the relative contribution of other ross except photogenerated holes including oh o2 and 1o2 in pec process by the ross scavenging method descript in our early works cai et al 2020 wang and zhuan 2020 the obvious signals of dmpo oh fig 2 a and dmpoo2 fig 2b indicated that large quantities of oh and o2 were both generated in pec system mousset and dionysiou 2020 with the addition of 20 ppm tet the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh and dmpoo2 were substantially weakened suggesting that both oh and o2 were responsible for the degradation of tet except the direct contribution of photogenerated holes ma et al 2019 in addition the initially produced radical from the reaction between tet and oh may react with o2 to release o2 which may provide additional source of o2 in the system the observed weak peaks of temp 1o2 might be generated from the further oxidation of o2 by photogenerated holes shi et al 2022 whereas it completely vanished with the addition of tet fig 2c these results suggested the competitive consumption of oh o2 and 1o2 by increased tet could partially account for the retarded inactivation of arb in this coexisted system of arb and antibiotics besides considering the low concentration of oh and 1o2 in the presence of tet holes and o2 were thereby believed as dominated rss for inactivation of arb and degradation of antibiotics within this pec system 3 3 bacterial inactivation mechanism in the presence tet 3 3 1 stress response under co exposure to pec and tet the attacks by various rss are usually an important pathway for arb inactivation during pec process to further clarify the oxidative response of arb in the presence of tet the activities of intracellular ross and main antioxidant enzymes including sod gsh px and cat were monitored during pec process with various concentrations of tet fig 3 first of all in the absence of tet the intracellular ros level was found to sharply increase at the beginning 20 min and then followed a quick decrease fig 3a this result combined with the complete inactivation of arb cells achieved within 60 min fig 1a suggested that pec treatment alone could directly trigger bacterial oxidative stress systems and induce disruption of cellular redox equilibrium through quick raising accumulation of intracellular ross according to early references gusarov and nudler 2005 yin et al 2020 in contrast the presence of tet 5 60 ppm resulted in a low level of intracellular ross fig 3a suggesting the mitigated oxidative responses of arb cells this result matches well with the esr results further confirming that tet could act as a ros scavenger to reduce the oxidative inactivation of arb the activity of sod and cat represents the response of bacteria toward o2 and h2o2 respectively while both h2o2 and lipid peroxides enable the stimulation of gsh px according to references djordjevic et al 2004 wilke et al 1992 in fig 3b the evolution of the sod activity matched well with that of the intracellular ross concentration implying that o2 might be the main intracellular ross to attack the intracellular substances of the arb this speculation was also supported by previous studies where oh in solution was incapable to penetrate the bacterial membrane due to its short half life and short half diffusion length sun et al 2016 sun et al 2014 noted that gsh px activities decreased slowly at the beginning and then increased gradually fig 3c while the cat activities remained steady throughout 60 min of pec treatment fig 3d therefore we can also conclude that bacterial defense system tended to display increased activities of sod and gsh px to protect the arb cells during pec treatment alone however the observed increase in sod and gsh px activities was negligible in the presence of tet this observation again demonstrated the alleviated oxidative pressure of arb by tet 3 3 2 mechanisms of arb inactivation in the presence tet the destruction of cell membrane integrity of bacteria was generally used as an indicator of the first step of the bactericidal effect pigeot remy et al 2012 sun et al 2014 to characterize the integrity of arb cell membrane under co exposure to pec and tet the fcm of syto 9 pi stained arb cells were investigated according to early reference lindivat et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 a a quadrant marker divided two parameter plots into four quadrants q1 q2 q3 and q4 to discriminate bacterial cells in different states dead pi stained cells q1 injured syto 9 pi double stained cells q2 unstained cells q3 and viable syto 9 stained cells q4 based on the method reported in the reference lindivat et al 2020 before the exposure to pec and tet the fcm signals almost located in q4 quadrant suggesting nearly all the cells have the intact membranes and a very small fraction of injured cells before experimental operation fig 4aa1 d1 as displayed in fig 4a the distribution of fcm signals intimately related on the concentration of tet during the exposure to pec alone the proportion of membrane damaged cells increased to 97 1 in the first 60 min and 98 5 of 180 min fig 4aa2 aa3 with low dosage 5 20 ppm addition of tet the proportion of membrane damaged cells decreased to 73 2 86 2 within 60 min whereas 97 6 was obtained within 180 min fig 4ab2 ab3 increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm the proportion of damaged cells increased to 72 9 within 60 min however no membrane damage was identified as the treatment further extended to 180 min this phenomenon suggested that excessive antibiotics residues might become dominated strategy to inactive bacteria rather than pec in this coexisted water system of arb and antibiotics fig 4ac2 ac3 it was of interest to find a great deviation between the arb inactivation and membrane damage results fig s1 noted that the percentages of culturable viable cells measured by plate counting method were all more than 60 within 60 min of pec treatment in the presence of 5 20 ppm tet much higher than the damage percentage of cell membrane obtained by fcm analysis these results suggested that a proportion of the membrane damaged cells remained culturable which might be benefited from the bacterial self defense and auto repair mechanisms as previously reported schottroff et al 2018 withers 1975 zhao et al 2013 by further increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm distinctly higher percentage of the membrane damaged cells was observed using fcm method as compared with the results using plate counting method within 60 min where certain cells remained intact membrane but cannot be cultured according to previous studies harsh conditions can induce bacterial cells into viable but nonculturable vbnc state in which the cells still keep intact membranes but lose the ability to form colonies ayrapetyan et al 2015 casini et al 2018 chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020 herein our results suggest that excessive antibiotic restudies within certain concentration range in pec system might also induce arb turning into vbnc state we speculate part of the reasons may be associated with the inhibition of arb cell metabolism under co exposure to pec and tet merlin et al 2011 yin et al 2019 one major indicator of cell metabolic activity is the potential of the cells to produce atp pu et al 2019 thus we herein also examined the relative atp levels of arb cells during pec treatment in the presence of different dosages of tet 0 60 ppm fig 4b with pec treatment alone the cellular atp level showed a slight increase and followed a drop after 40 min this result agreed with the changes in the activities of intracellular ross and sod fig 3a and 3b further suggesting a correlation between metabolic activity and viability of bacterial cells barrette et al 1989 the presence of 5 ppm tet triggered a higher cellular atp level than that with pec treatment alone which might be resulted from the increased survival efficiency of arb cells as shown in fig 1a addition of tet with a range of 20 60 ppm the cellular atp levels were inversely correlated with tet concentration and significantly lower than those of adding tet with a range of 0 5 ppm this suggested that 20 60 ppm tet might facilitate some arb cells into dormant state with low metabolism by decreasing atp generation activities in which arb cells may gain a decreased cellular susceptibility to osmotic pressure and exhibit reduced cell membrane damaged effects to survive pec treatment chen et al 2018 guo et al 2020 klein and lewinson 2011 to directly observe the characteristic of cell membrane damage sem was also employed to image the morphologies of treated bacterial cells during pec process with different dosages of tet as shown in fig 4ca1 cd1 the untreated cells were solid rod shapes with intact and smooth membrane after 60 min of pec treatment apparent crevasse yawned at cell membrane and significant leakage of intracellular substances were observed only large amount of bacterial cell debris remained after 180 min treatment the sem images clearly showed that the intensities of cell membrane destruction were dependent on the changes of cell membrane shape and fine structure over pec treatment time increasing tet from 5 to 60 ppm the cell membranes presented a reduced damage with fewer microstructures of depression distortion wrinkling and rupture after 60 min treatment fig 4ca2 cd2 which was attributed to the quenched effect of tet throughout 180 min of pec treatment in the presence of 60 ppm tet some arb cells became small short and ellipsoidal with intact membranes fig 4ca3 cd3 but they were complete inactivated and nonculturable as demonstrated by plate counting method fig 1a this suggested that increasing tet up to 60 ppm during pec treatment may present vbnc inducing conditions consistent well with fcm analysis 3 3 3 evaluation of gene abundance related tet resistance to further investigate the inactivation and damage of args the relative abundance of typical genes related to tet resistance and oxidative stress were also examined during pec treatment intervals jiang et al 2017 with increasing tet from 0 to 60 ppm the relative abundance of tested gene residues related to ribosomal protection proteins efflux of tet and oxidative stress obviously increased fig 5 which might be attributed to the alleviated oxidation damage of dna by tet based on ross scavenger effects in addition low concentration of tet facilitated the inactivation of tested genes related to sos response fig 5 which is a basic function of the cells to survive in a stressful situation according to early references erental et al 2014 sutton et al 2000 this might be explained by that sos response appeared to be in repairing dna lesions caused by oxidative stress under co exposure to pec and low dosage of tet in which the related dna would unwind the double helix and tend to be vulnerable to oxidative attacks janion 2001 sutton et al 2000 however with increasing tet concentration to 60 ppm the relative abundance of tested genes residues related to tet resistance was observed considerably higher this might be resulted from the increased amount of arb cells in vbnc state as demonstrated in fig 4 leading to the retention of more active arg residues and potential risk of their continued spread 3 4 degradation pathway of tet in the presence arb to further understand the degradation pathway of tet in the arb args and antibiotics coexisted system pec degradation experiments of tet in the presence of arb were also examined and the uhplc q orbitrap hrms was employed to identify its degradation intermediates the major intermediates and final products of tet degradation were identified and the ms characteristic of all tet degradation intermediates are all shown in fig s2 in si in summary the degradation pathways of tet in the presence of arb were grouped as three dominant routes as proposed in fig 6 in route i except tet a intermediate b m z 477 1500 was identified as hydroxylation product of tet attacked by oh then the carbon chain scission produced intermediate e m z 396 8009 was obtained with the further attacks by rss mainly holes oh and o2 intermediate e opened the benzene ring to produce intermediates h m z 351 2492 and l m z 242 2838 in route ii intermediate c m z 461 1552 was another hydroxylation product of tet attacked by oh then the n methyl group was oxidized to the carbonyl group intermediate f m z 509 1395 was formed with the further attacks by ross intermediate f opened the benzene ring to produce intermediates i m z 451 0993 and l m z 242 2838 in route iii intermediate d m z 399 1546 was formed from tet through n and c demethylation reaction ross further attacked intermediate d with loss of nh2 and ring opening reaction to produce intermediates g m z 432 2798 j m z 403 2490 k m z 367 2186 and l m z 242 2838 although intermediates h k and l still have the potential for further degradation in a sufficient time of pec treatment but some intermediates like those with m z 461 432 and 477 may retain some kind of toxicity according to the early references khan et al 2010 wang et al 2018 which might present additional stressor to induce the arb cells entering vbnc state as a survival strategy and the decrease in the inactivation of args this is worth further study to systematically analyze the influence of degradation intermediates on the inactivation and propagation of arb args during pec treatment 4 conclusions this study mainly presented an in depth understanding of the synergistic mechanism of the inactivation of e coli dh5α tet bacteria and the degradation of corresponding antibiotics tet in coexisted water system using pec as a model technology the results demonstrated that pec treatment alone quick inactivated arb args by raising accumulation of intracellular ross and disrupting the cellular redox equilibrium meanwhile the bacterial defense system tended to increase antioxidative activities of sod and gsh px to protect arb cells against the oxidative stress the addition of tet in water system of bacteria inhibited the inactivation of arb args mainly due to competing for the reactive species such as hole oh and o2 whereas the arb arg inactivation was dominated by holes and o2 of particular concern is that the exposure of pec together with tet may facilitate some arb cells turning into vbncs leading to the retention of more active arg residues and potential risk of their continued spread although some aspects remain unclear and the studied system is a typical example in real time the evaluation of synergistic mechanisms of arb arg inactivation and antibiotic degradation is a task worthy of a more complete and exhaustive approach to help avoid underestimating the risk of antibiotic resistance

16167,the continued technological developments and decreased purchase costs of ceramic membranes have seen increased recent interest in the technology as an alternative to the more widely used polymeric membranes this paper assesses the relative technical practical and economic merits of the two membrane materials in the context of potable water production from surface water sources the work focuses on phenomena of direct technoeconomic significance namely cleaning efficacy manifested as permeability recovery membrane integrity and incurred labour effort topics reviewed thus comprise a practical comparison of the two technologies challenged with the same feedwater b comparative technoeconomic analyses c membrane integrity studies of polymeric membranes incorporating aged samples extracted from operating installations d sludging incidents and e pilot and full scale data available relevant data reveal a bench scale comparative tests do not indicate a consistent significant difference in the net permeability between the two membranes b polymeric membranes are subject to a decline in both mechanical strength and permeability from the loss of the hydrophilic agent over a period of years from the action of hypochlorite used for cleaning c the decreased mechanical strength with age of polymeric membranes increases the manual repair requirement and shortens membrane life respectively impacting on labour and membrane replacement costs where the latter is also determined by the permeability d the chemical and mechanical robustness of ceramic membranes permits more aggressive chemical cleaning which then affects the chemicals consumption cost and e anecdotal evidence suggests that polymeric membranes challenged with pre coagulated surface waters may be subject to sludging the agglomeration of solids in the membrane channels which may also be age related notwithstanding the above data from published comparative technoeconomic studies indicate a linear relationship between the overall cost benefit and the membrane module cost ratio mitigated by the relative membrane life and operating flux graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membranes polymeric membranes integrity cost life flux 1 introduction 1 1 background and rationale the relative benefits of ceramic and polymeric membranes for municipal water applications has attracted increasing interest over the past five years or so this is in part evidenced by the number of ceramic membrane based reviews published with at least six produced since the start of 2020 on topics ranging from pathogen rejection goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 and surface fouling hakami et al 2020 li et al 2020 arumugham et al 2021 asif and zhang 2021 to fabrication impacts on material characteristics liang et al 2021 whilst there has been a strong focus on fouling and its amelioration by the academic community in practice membrane fouling is rarely the sole limitation on membrane process implementation and operation in municipal applications recent studies suggest that a substantial part of the operating expenditure opex can be attributed to the labour effort incurred qiblawey and judd 2019 judd and carra 2021 particularly for small installations this in turn is strongly associated with process challenges such as clogging or sludging of the membrane interstices with solids buzatu et al 2012 and or in the case of potable water treatment membrane repair from integrity breaches ferrer et al 2015 lee et al 2019 given the technical and commercial significance of the different facets of the two materials it is instructive to examine papers where either a direct comparison in performance of ceramic and polymeric membranes has been made or b key aspects of each technology studied where differences in performance and or technical characteristics generally can be expected this paper aims to review available data pertaining to a and b above which reflect on the operability and cost of the two technologies primarily for municipal potable applications at full scale viz i side by side studies of ceramic and polymeric membranes challenged with the same feedwater ii comparative cost or technoeconomic studies iii membrane integrity studies iv membrane channel clogging or sludging v operability of pilot and full scale installations potable water applications considered relate to surface water feeds surface waters with seasonally or otherwise intermittently high levels of natural organic matter nom are widely recognised as being more challenging than borehole water due to the nom fouling propensity 1 2 a brief history low pressure membrane technology for genrating potable water from low salinity inland raw waters has predominantly been based on polymeric hollow fibre hf ultrafiltration microfiltration uf mf membranes awwa 2005 goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 judd asnd carra 2021 implementation for potable waters in europe began in 1988 with the 0 16 mld aquasource plant in amoncourt france letourneur and mehra 1993 the first 10 mld capacity system in the us was the memcor plant installed at saratoga five years later awwa 2005 ceramic membranes were first implemented for this duty in 1996 at miyazaki japan with a small 0 55 mld installation based on the original metawater ceramic membrane ceramac by mid 2009 there were 87 wtws in japan based on the metawater system delivering 400 mld of drinking water hattori 2010 this system is based on vertically orientated cylindrical monoliths with multiple tubular channels hence mt modules whilst other mt ceramic products are available the potable water market appears to be dominated by the metawater technology the mid late noughties saw the implementation of the flat sheet fs ceramic module binkle et al 2005 kaplan and kaschek 2009 with its subsequent implementation for industrial process water and effluent and municipal potable water and wastewater applications one of the earliest wastewater installations the 0 5 mld itn nanovation now part of safbon membrane bioreactor mbr plant at petersberg which started up in 2007 kaplan and kaschek 2009 and still operates with the original membranes the ceramic fs technology is currently offered by at least five providers internationally cembrane ovivo denmark usa ceraflo singapore itn safbon germany china meidensha japan and liqtech denmark ceramic mt modules have also found use for niche industrial effluent treatment applications dating back to the 1990s or earlier lahiere and goodboy 1993 chang et al 1994 whilst the data available is constrained by the limited age of the majority of the installations evidence suggests that the membrane life of 15 20 years generally warrantied by most ceramic membrane product providers is not unreasonable and possibly even conservative for the most recent products 2 analysis 2 1 side by side studies of net permeability side by side comparisons of the performance of polymeric and ceramic membranes where the ceramic and polymeric membranes have been challenged with the same feedwater date back 30 years moulin et al 1991 a number of other comparative studies predominantly at bench scale have subsequently been reported bodzek and konieczny 1998 yuasa 1998 klomfas and konieczny 2004 hofs et al 2011 lee and kim 2014 oligny et al 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 outcomes from these studies table 1 have been conflicting regarding the relative sustainable permeability values for the two material types some studies principally those conducted prior to 2010 moulin et al 1991 bodzek and konieczny 1998 klomfas and konieczny 2004 have reported a higher overall permeability for the polymeric membrane over the ceramic material when challenged with the same feedwater this may reflect the intrinsically lower clean water permeability of a ceramic membrane compared with an equivalent polymeric one due to the greater membrane layer thickness and lower bulk porosity however these studies appear not to have been conducted under the same controlled hydrodynamic conditions for the two membrane materials it is well known that the membrane module volume to membrane surface area ratio v a significantly affects fouling ostensibly through the reynolds number re and hence permeability hofs et al 2011 alresheedi et al 2019 more recent studies hofs et al 2011 lee and kim 2014 oligny et al 2016 kenari and barbeau 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 where the hydrodynamic impacts are acknowledged and or accounted for have tended to demonstrate either comparable oligny et al 2016 or slightly lower hofs et al 2011 overall fouling propensity or fouling rate for the ceramic material compared with the polymeric one the work of lee and kim 2014 indicated the relative fouling propensity with reference to savannah river humic acid to be strongly influenced by the presence of calcium with the ceramic membrane more resistant to irreversible fouling at calcium concentrations of 10 mm the most recent published comparative study alresheedi et al 2019 demonstrated increased backwash efficiency for the ceramic membrane but little difference in chemical cleaning efficiency between the two materials recorded differences in overall net permeability appear to be marginal whether measured as the sustainable net permeability in lmh bar the overall fouling resistance lee and kim 2014 or the physical and chemical cleaning efficiency alresheedi et al 2020 in summary comparative tests of polymeric and ceramic membrane materials challenged with the same feedwater and operated under similar hydrodynamic conditions suggest that there is little difference in fouling propensity when representative backwashing cleaning is applied this confirms an earlier observation by guerra pellegrino 2013 based on the analysis of 209 published permeability data from studies conducted between 1997 and 2011 against this hydrodynamic conditions for full scale plants based on commercial membrane products are likely to differ between the two materials due to commensurately differing v a ratios and associated packing densities moreover much of the work in this area has focused on fouling characterisation in terms of the foulant physicochemistry rather than the study of hydrodynamics and membrane configuration impacts 2 2 side by side cost or technoeconomic analyses a few comparative economic assessments of polymeric and ceramic membranes have been presented in the past decade guerra and pellegrino 2013 park et al 2015 kurth et al 2018 the outcomes of these studies table 2 have tended to demonstrate the expected sensitivity of the cost benefit or penalty to the sustainable flux and the membrane cost an early cost comparison guerra and pellegrino 2013 demonstrated a 24 54 increase in the total water production cost tpc for the ceramic membrane compared with the polymeric one for a ten fold higher membrane cost and a 25 higher net flux 125 lmh for the ceramic compared with 100 lmh for the polymeric in the most recent study kurth et al 2018 a net flux of up to 381 lmh was assumed based on the outcomes of a pilot trial along with an implied cost of 175 usd per m2 for the ceramic membrane compared with 35 usd m 2 for the polymeric one operating at a net flux of 68 lmh based on these assumptions the authors calculated a net cost benefit of 7 15 for the ceramic membrane system the data from these three studies can be depicted as a correlation of cost penalty or negative cost benefit expressed as life cycle or total production cost lcc or tpc respectively against the membrane cost flux life cfl ratio fig 1 for the membrane cfl ratio the higher cost of the ceramic membrane is mitigated by its longer life and higher sustainable flux c o

assumptions regarding labour costs and other opex related parameters and f both the absolute capex capital expenditure and the capex per unit flow whilst assumptions around discounting and inflation are questionable the outputs for the ceramic membranes have been normalised against the polymeric ones determined for the same set of assumptions as such both sets of data are subject to similar absolute errors pertaining to assumed discounting and inflation the relative values should nonetheless be reasonably representative regarding f above the data of park et al 2015 and kurth et al 2018 respectively imply a normalised capex of 257 and 156 per m3 d flow for the polymeric membrane technology this compares to a rather lower value of 137 147 per m3 d flow determined from 14 full scale uk membrane installations judd and cara 2021 the chemical resistance of ceramic membranes permits more aggressive conditions for cleaning d than polymeric membranes increasing cleaning reagent strength combined with pre coagulant dosing has been shown to more than double the chemicals consumption cost compared with polymeric membranes to 29 per m3 d according to kurt et al 2018 however this study suggests that this cost penalty is surpassed by the cost benefit associated with the resultant doubling in the net flux the trials conducted by these authors and those of alresheedi et al 2019 table 1 suggest that there are clear cost benefits in fully optimising the backwash and cleaning protocols the impact of labour requirements e for polymeric membrane based installations can differ substantially from those for ceramic ones if significant membrane integrity loss takes place section 2 3 a labour effort of 2 5 fte full time equivalent was assumed by guerra and pellegrino 2013 for operation of a 18 9 mld plant with 0 5 fte assumed to be assigned to integrity monitoring and fibre repair of 24 polymeric membranes filaments per year thus 1 27 repairs per mld p a neither park et al 2015 nor kurth et al 2018 identified labour effort specifically in their respective reported analyses notwithstanding the above factors fig 1 implies a cost benefit of implementing ceramic over polymeric membranes when the membrane cfl ratio falls below 0 68 however the slope of the relationship must necessarily depend on opex and specifically the key parameters of energy and chemicals consumption and of labour effort energy consumption relates mainly to membrane permeability and hydraulic losses and chemical demand to membrane cleaning labour effort is strongly correlated with the maintenance incurred by membrane breaching 2 3 membrane integrity studies there are far fewer studies of membrane integrity than there are of membrane fouling however a number of studies have nonetheless demonstrated age related impaired integrity of polymeric membranes with an accompanying concomitant decrease in permeability and membrane mechanical strength for the more extensively studied pes membrane a few potable water studies have indicated increased fouling propensity touffet et al 2015 cui et al 2017 and reduced integrity generally quantified as the elongation at break εr causserand et al 2015 cui et al 2017 table 3 these changes have been associated with the loss of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp a widely used hydrophilic additive in membrane fabrication loss of pvp has been assumed to be promoted by hypochlorite ocl oxidation touffet et al 2015 ravesreau et al 2016 fu and zhang 2019 authors have observed reasonable correlation of pvp and mechanical strength loss with hypochlorite dose expressed as ct the product of the concentration g cl2 l and exposure time h and its action is attenuated to an extent by the ph regula et al 2014 ct is estimated to be around 2000 g h l over the life of a polymeric membrane potable water plant based on standard chemical cleaning protocols causserand et al 2015 robinson and bérubé 2020 in a recent study in this area robinson and bérubé 2020 samples of a specific pvdf membrane product were harvested from 8 full scale installations across an age range of 1 8 years results indicated a deterioration in permeability and a decline in mechanical strength at around 5 years of use associated with the decreased hydrophilic additive bulk and surface concentration similar observations of pvp loss have been made with mbr pvdf hf membranes mavukkandy et al 2016 marbelia et al 2019 integrity of ceramic membranes is largely unreported it is generally accepted that the ceramic membrane material itself is not susceptible to breaching pertaining to oxidative degradation though hypochlorite promoted failure of the seals has recently been demonstrated kramer et al 2019 for the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that whilst integrity monitoring is required for ceramic membrane installations no repair associated with integrity loss is incurred in practice membrane integrity is routinely assessed using established off line methods most usually using the pressure decay test pdt whilst pdts are automated examination and repair pinning of polymeric hf membranes failing the pdt is laborious and incurs significant labour effort and associated operating costs guerra and pellegrino 2013 judd and carra 2021 the proportion of the total opex that this cost component contributes increases with decreasing flow capacity judd and carra 2021 moreover the impact the breakage of a single fibre has on the treated water quality also increases with decreasing size since the proportion of the total number of fibres also increases gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 a crucially important aspect is thus the integrity loss manifested as required membrane filament repairs over the life of the installation fibre breakage rate data is rarely reported in the peer reviewed literature the small amount of available data fig 2 taken from brehant et al 2015 and two unpublished data sets pes 1 2 suggests wide ranging breakage rates from 10 to 80 per mld plant capacity per year which may increase exponentially or linearly with time these values are substantially higher than the estimate of 24 p a for an 18 9 mld capacity installation assumed by guerra and pellegrino 2013 evidence across a number of sites suggests that polymer integrity loss is more strongly associated with feedwater quality than membrane material specifically both permeability and integrity diminish at full scale polymeric membrane plants when feedwater turbidity increases brehant et al 2015 ferrer et al 2016 translating breakage rates into cost is challenged by the differing protocols used across different sites for identifying and isolating the module with the integrity breach removing the membrane element identifying and repairing the breach and reassembling the module skid however if an individual breach is assumed to incur 1 5 h of effort i e 75 assuming a gross cost of 50 h and thus comparable to the value of 70 for a single fibre breakage determiend by freeman 2012 then using the average values from the data depicted in fig 2 this corresponds to a range of 0 011 to 0 028 fte per mld assuming 1600 working hours per year i e 80 000 fte this equates to 0 0046 0 012 per m3 calculated overall opex values vary widely according to assumptions made table 4 the greatest sensitivity is to the electrical energy tariff followed by the membrane replacement and the labour effort the overall opex calculated by brehant et al 2015 is around a quarter of that determined by guerra and pellegrino 2013 due to the lower energy tariff and labour effort assumed judd and carra 2021 using data taken from full scale uk installations determined the normalised labour effort fte per mld or m3 to increase with decreasing flow capacity based on such assumptions fibre breakage may contribute up to 43 of the opex in labour costs alone and more still if membrane life is subsequently reduced 2 4 clogging sludging determination membrane channel clogging or sludging the agglomeration of solids in the membrane interstices has been widely recognised by mbr practitioners in municipal wastewater treatment for at least 14 years itokawa et al 2008 frechen et al 2008 sludging has been observed in both aerobic stone and livingston 2008 ewert 2014 and anaerobic mbrs giménez lorang et al 2021 it has recently become evident that the challenge also extends to potable water treatment where polymeric hf membranes are downstream of a coagulation step so called direct filtration thus far no research studies have been conducted on potable water membrane channel sludging however practitioner experience of operating installations in the uk and north america suggests that sludging presents a significant challenge on direct filtration of surface waters this slow accumulation of solids within the fibre bundle is manifested as an only fleetingly effective cip and has been quantified as an increase in the weight of the wetted membrane module at full scale potable water installations booker 2019 and pilot scale mbr studies zsirai et al 2014 2 5 full scale experience and pilot trial outcomes in practice membrane plants tend to operate at fluxes well below the design fluxes which are themselves also below the values tested and or assumed in some of the published studies kurth et al 2018 an example is the installation in the netherlands fig 3 which employs suspended ion exchange six upstream of the membrane skid for improved dissolved organic carbon removal this plant has a design peak flux of 110 lmh table 5 though in practice the flux is in the region of 65 90 lmh since the flow is demand driven cleaning is entirely through chemically enhanced backwashing ceb no recovery cip clean in place is currently installed at this site table 6 whilst operating under very conservative conditions experience at this site nonetheless indicates a no integrity loss integrity tests pressure decay measurement provide no evidence of damage to the membrane affecting its perm selectivity b manageable permeability decline the permeability from year 2 onwards has plateaued at 180 200 lmh bar during operation without an installed cip system trials with cip indicate that the permeability can be increased to as much as 400 lmh bar there have been no events associated with integrity loss and permeability decline the latter being associated with sludging at some polymeric membrane plants the fte for the site is 0 6 i e 0 005 fte mld which is somewhat lower than the value of 0 009 computed by judd and carra 2021 for a plant of similar size against this the chemicals consumption is higher than that reported for polymeric plants and so contributes a greater proportion of the opex at this site 0 010 m3 if a cost of 1000 per m3 of bulk reagent is assumed for both naocl and h2o2 available information from recent pilot scale studies based on at least one full scale membrane module suggest sustainable operating flux values generally between 150 and 250 lmh this range refers to optimised systems and specifically to optimised pre treatment whilst optimisation of pre treatment relies of foreknowledge of the feedwater organic matter characteristics peters et al 2021 evidence suggests that combined ozonation and coagulation presents a robust means of mitigating ceramic membrane fouling fan et al 2014 ng et al 2018 spencer et al 2019 lam et al 2021 shorney darby et al 2021 4 discussion a review of the available information relating to membrane filtration employed for potable water production suggests the following 1 bench scale trials have not conclusively demonstrated a significant difference in overall net permeability between the membranes especially for tests based on pristine materials oligny et al 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 2 polymeric membranes are subject to irreversible impairment of both mechanical strength and permeability due to loss of the hydrophilic agent polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp over a period of many years the loss of pvp roughly correlates with the total hypochlorite dose ct the product of the reagent concentration and total exposure time in practice the total ct for a polymeric membrane installation at the end of its life has been reported as being in the region of 200 gh l causserand et al 2015 robinson and bérubé 2020 3 since polymeric membranes decrease in mechanical strength with age it follows that pinning frequency must correspondingly increase incurring higher labour costs with time until the membranes are replaced this supplementary labour cost represents a significant additional component of the opex which does not arise in ceramic membrane installations 4 the irreversible loss of permeability also determines the membrane life as with membrane integrity long term permeability loss does not appear to arise for ceramic membranes 5 the chemical and mechanical robustness of ceramic membranes allows them to be exposed to high ct levels this then implies a higher chemical consumption than that associated with polymeric membranes such that it may become the primary opex component 6 there is additionally increasing anecdotal evidence unpublished and based only on practitioner experience to suggest that polymeric membranes challenged with pre coagulated nom laden surface waters may be subject to clogging or sludging as with permeability decline and integrity sludging appears to be age related and also incurs significant staff effort and thus labour cost for its amelioration judd and carra 2021 the above means that the actual opex for a polymeric membrane plant challenged with a surface water feed is likely to resemble the trend shown in fig 4 the ceramic membrane opex the dashed line in fig 4 is generally higher than the polymeric one due to the increased chemical consumption required to maintain membrane permeability but is independent of time lastly costs will be affected by investment in equipment to a suppress polymeric membrane sludging through installing clarification technologies such as dissolved air flotation employed upstream of the membrane filter and downstream of coagulant dosing at some plants b suppress organic fouling of ceramic membranes using pre coagulation six as at the netherlands site section 2 5 and or powdered activated carbon tested at pilot scale by campinas et al 2021 and c enhance oxidative membrane cleaning using ozonation such as at the choa chu kang waterworks cckw in singapore galjaard et al 2011 2013 lam et al 2021 as an alternative to hydrogen peroxide despite the envisaged significance of the above opex elements evidence suggests that an indication of the relative cost benefit or penalty of implementing a ceramic membrane system over a polymeric one is through the membrane cost flux life cfl ratio c o s t p e n a l t y 0 41 cfl 0 277 where c o s t p e n a l t y t o t a l c o s t p a r a m e t e r f o r c e r a

y m f l u x c e r a m f l u x p o l y m l i f e c e r a m l i f e however both the coefficient and intercept values in this equation must necessarily depend on factors impacting on the opex used to determine the overall cost penalty including the assumed energy and chemicals consumption and the labour effort 5 conclusions a review of available information pertinent to the key practical concern of the comparative operability and total life cycle cost of polymeric and ceramic membrane based installations for treating surface waters for potable water production has been conducted the following conclusions can be drawn 1 short term bench scale tests provide conflicting conclusions regarding the relative sustainable permeability of the two materials in part because of the differing hydrodynamic conditions employed bench scale trials also cannot precisely replicate the cleaning protocols of full scale plants or unless based on aged membranes sampled from full scale plants account for the reduced polymeric membrane hydrophilicity with age 2 there is a measurable correlation between impaired polymeric membrane performance both with respect to permeability and mechanical strength and the total exposure to hypochlorite over the life of a plant the impact of the hypochlorite is on the pvp content of the membrane which is denaturised and or leached from the membrane material bulk or surface through the action of the hypochlorite hypochlorite being widely used to recover membrane permeability when challenged with waters having a significant organic matter content such as surface waters the exposure to hypochlorite during the cleaning cycle appears to limit the membrane life to 6 8 years 3 contrary to the observations made regarding polymeric membranes evidence from existing full scale ceramic membrane installations suggests that ceramic membranes are sufficiently robust to allow aggressive permeability recovery measures without impairment of the warrantied membrane life of 15 20 years or more the increased intensity of the cleaning protocol which can extend to ozonation at some installations increases the contribution of this component to the opex 4 labour costs associated with maintaining polymeric membrane based installations depend on the rate and extent of the decline in permeability and mechanical strength there may also be additional costs associated with sludging the accumulation of solids within the polymeric hollow fibre bundle which incurs both significantly increased labour effort and chemicals consumption for cleaning as well as further reducing the membrane life 5 the cost benefit offered by a ceramic membrane system can be inferred from the ratio of the ceramic and polymer membrane cost mitigated by the flux and life ratios however this simple ratio excludes key operating parameters such as energy and chemicals consumption and in particular the labour costs ceramic membrane systems are associated with higher capex due to the higher cost membrane material but lower opex if both the membrane replacement and labour costs are accounted for fig 4 procurement processes which a favour or permit offsetting of capex and or b rely on accurate prediction of opex may therefore favour ceramic over polymeric membrane systems finally it should be acknowledged that the fabrication of commercial membranes is continuously evolving whilst the cost of ceramic membranes has decreased over the past 15 20 years the same is also true though perhaps to a lesser extent of polymeric membranes at the same time improvements in membrane materials and membrane module design have generally increased their robustness which challenges accurate predictions of the comparative costs of technologies based on the two different materials

16167,the continued technological developments and decreased purchase costs of ceramic membranes have seen increased recent interest in the technology as an alternative to the more widely used polymeric membranes this paper assesses the relative technical practical and economic merits of the two membrane materials in the context of potable water production from surface water sources the work focuses on phenomena of direct technoeconomic significance namely cleaning efficacy manifested as permeability recovery membrane integrity and incurred labour effort topics reviewed thus comprise a practical comparison of the two technologies challenged with the same feedwater b comparative technoeconomic analyses c membrane integrity studies of polymeric membranes incorporating aged samples extracted from operating installations d sludging incidents and e pilot and full scale data available relevant data reveal a bench scale comparative tests do not indicate a consistent significant difference in the net permeability between the two membranes b polymeric membranes are subject to a decline in both mechanical strength and permeability from the loss of the hydrophilic agent over a period of years from the action of hypochlorite used for cleaning c the decreased mechanical strength with age of polymeric membranes increases the manual repair requirement and shortens membrane life respectively impacting on labour and membrane replacement costs where the latter is also determined by the permeability d the chemical and mechanical robustness of ceramic membranes permits more aggressive chemical cleaning which then affects the chemicals consumption cost and e anecdotal evidence suggests that polymeric membranes challenged with pre coagulated surface waters may be subject to sludging the agglomeration of solids in the membrane channels which may also be age related notwithstanding the above data from published comparative technoeconomic studies indicate a linear relationship between the overall cost benefit and the membrane module cost ratio mitigated by the relative membrane life and operating flux graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic membranes polymeric membranes integrity cost life flux 1 introduction 1 1 background and rationale the relative benefits of ceramic and polymeric membranes for municipal water applications has attracted increasing interest over the past five years or so this is in part evidenced by the number of ceramic membrane based reviews published with at least six produced since the start of 2020 on topics ranging from pathogen rejection goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 and surface fouling hakami et al 2020 li et al 2020 arumugham et al 2021 asif and zhang 2021 to fabrication impacts on material characteristics liang et al 2021 whilst there has been a strong focus on fouling and its amelioration by the academic community in practice membrane fouling is rarely the sole limitation on membrane process implementation and operation in municipal applications recent studies suggest that a substantial part of the operating expenditure opex can be attributed to the labour effort incurred qiblawey and judd 2019 judd and carra 2021 particularly for small installations this in turn is strongly associated with process challenges such as clogging or sludging of the membrane interstices with solids buzatu et al 2012 and or in the case of potable water treatment membrane repair from integrity breaches ferrer et al 2015 lee et al 2019 given the technical and commercial significance of the different facets of the two materials it is instructive to examine papers where either a direct comparison in performance of ceramic and polymeric membranes has been made or b key aspects of each technology studied where differences in performance and or technical characteristics generally can be expected this paper aims to review available data pertaining to a and b above which reflect on the operability and cost of the two technologies primarily for municipal potable applications at full scale viz i side by side studies of ceramic and polymeric membranes challenged with the same feedwater ii comparative cost or technoeconomic studies iii membrane integrity studies iv membrane channel clogging or sludging v operability of pilot and full scale installations potable water applications considered relate to surface water feeds surface waters with seasonally or otherwise intermittently high levels of natural organic matter nom are widely recognised as being more challenging than borehole water due to the nom fouling propensity 1 2 a brief history low pressure membrane technology for genrating potable water from low salinity inland raw waters has predominantly been based on polymeric hollow fibre hf ultrafiltration microfiltration uf mf membranes awwa 2005 goswami and pugazhenthi 2020 judd asnd carra 2021 implementation for potable waters in europe began in 1988 with the 0 16 mld aquasource plant in amoncourt france letourneur and mehra 1993 the first 10 mld capacity system in the us was the memcor plant installed at saratoga five years later awwa 2005 ceramic membranes were first implemented for this duty in 1996 at miyazaki japan with a small 0 55 mld installation based on the original metawater ceramic membrane ceramac by mid 2009 there were 87 wtws in japan based on the metawater system delivering 400 mld of drinking water hattori 2010 this system is based on vertically orientated cylindrical monoliths with multiple tubular channels hence mt modules whilst other mt ceramic products are available the potable water market appears to be dominated by the metawater technology the mid late noughties saw the implementation of the flat sheet fs ceramic module binkle et al 2005 kaplan and kaschek 2009 with its subsequent implementation for industrial process water and effluent and municipal potable water and wastewater applications one of the earliest wastewater installations the 0 5 mld itn nanovation now part of safbon membrane bioreactor mbr plant at petersberg which started up in 2007 kaplan and kaschek 2009 and still operates with the original membranes the ceramic fs technology is currently offered by at least five providers internationally cembrane ovivo denmark usa ceraflo singapore itn safbon germany china meidensha japan and liqtech denmark ceramic mt modules have also found use for niche industrial effluent treatment applications dating back to the 1990s or earlier lahiere and goodboy 1993 chang et al 1994 whilst the data available is constrained by the limited age of the majority of the installations evidence suggests that the membrane life of 15 20 years generally warrantied by most ceramic membrane product providers is not unreasonable and possibly even conservative for the most recent products 2 analysis 2 1 side by side studies of net permeability side by side comparisons of the performance of polymeric and ceramic membranes where the ceramic and polymeric membranes have been challenged with the same feedwater date back 30 years moulin et al 1991 a number of other comparative studies predominantly at bench scale have subsequently been reported bodzek and konieczny 1998 yuasa 1998 klomfas and konieczny 2004 hofs et al 2011 lee and kim 2014 oligny et al 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 outcomes from these studies table 1 have been conflicting regarding the relative sustainable permeability values for the two material types some studies principally those conducted prior to 2010 moulin et al 1991 bodzek and konieczny 1998 klomfas and konieczny 2004 have reported a higher overall permeability for the polymeric membrane over the ceramic material when challenged with the same feedwater this may reflect the intrinsically lower clean water permeability of a ceramic membrane compared with an equivalent polymeric one due to the greater membrane layer thickness and lower bulk porosity however these studies appear not to have been conducted under the same controlled hydrodynamic conditions for the two membrane materials it is well known that the membrane module volume to membrane surface area ratio v a significantly affects fouling ostensibly through the reynolds number re and hence permeability hofs et al 2011 alresheedi et al 2019 more recent studies hofs et al 2011 lee and kim 2014 oligny et al 2016 kenari and barbeau 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 where the hydrodynamic impacts are acknowledged and or accounted for have tended to demonstrate either comparable oligny et al 2016 or slightly lower hofs et al 2011 overall fouling propensity or fouling rate for the ceramic material compared with the polymeric one the work of lee and kim 2014 indicated the relative fouling propensity with reference to savannah river humic acid to be strongly influenced by the presence of calcium with the ceramic membrane more resistant to irreversible fouling at calcium concentrations of 10 mm the most recent published comparative study alresheedi et al 2019 demonstrated increased backwash efficiency for the ceramic membrane but little difference in chemical cleaning efficiency between the two materials recorded differences in overall net permeability appear to be marginal whether measured as the sustainable net permeability in lmh bar the overall fouling resistance lee and kim 2014 or the physical and chemical cleaning efficiency alresheedi et al 2020 in summary comparative tests of polymeric and ceramic membrane materials challenged with the same feedwater and operated under similar hydrodynamic conditions suggest that there is little difference in fouling propensity when representative backwashing cleaning is applied this confirms an earlier observation by guerra pellegrino 2013 based on the analysis of 209 published permeability data from studies conducted between 1997 and 2011 against this hydrodynamic conditions for full scale plants based on commercial membrane products are likely to differ between the two materials due to commensurately differing v a ratios and associated packing densities moreover much of the work in this area has focused on fouling characterisation in terms of the foulant physicochemistry rather than the study of hydrodynamics and membrane configuration impacts 2 2 side by side cost or technoeconomic analyses a few comparative economic assessments of polymeric and ceramic membranes have been presented in the past decade guerra and pellegrino 2013 park et al 2015 kurth et al 2018 the outcomes of these studies table 2 have tended to demonstrate the expected sensitivity of the cost benefit or penalty to the sustainable flux and the membrane cost an early cost comparison guerra and pellegrino 2013 demonstrated a 24 54 increase in the total water production cost tpc for the ceramic membrane compared with the polymeric one for a ten fold higher membrane cost and a 25 higher net flux 125 lmh for the ceramic compared with 100 lmh for the polymeric in the most recent study kurth et al 2018 a net flux of up to 381 lmh was assumed based on the outcomes of a pilot trial along with an implied cost of 175 usd per m2 for the ceramic membrane compared with 35 usd m 2 for the polymeric one operating at a net flux of 68 lmh based on these assumptions the authors calculated a net cost benefit of 7 15 for the ceramic membrane system the data from these three studies can be depicted as a correlation of cost penalty or negative cost benefit expressed as life cycle or total production cost lcc or tpc respectively against the membrane cost flux life cfl ratio fig 1 for the membrane cfl ratio the higher cost of the ceramic membrane is mitigated by its longer life and higher sustainable flux c o

absolute errors pertaining to assumed discounting and inflation the relative values should nonetheless be reasonably representative regarding f above the data of park et al 2015 and kurth et al 2018 respectively imply a normalised capex of 257 and 156 per m3 d flow for the polymeric membrane technology this compares to a rather lower value of 137 147 per m3 d flow determined from 14 full scale uk membrane installations judd and cara 2021 the chemical resistance of ceramic membranes permits more aggressive conditions for cleaning d than polymeric membranes increasing cleaning reagent strength combined with pre coagulant dosing has been shown to more than double the chemicals consumption cost compared with polymeric membranes to 29 per m3 d according to kurt et al 2018 however this study suggests that this cost penalty is surpassed by the cost benefit associated with the resultant doubling in the net flux the trials conducted by these authors and those of alresheedi et al 2019 table 1 suggest that there are clear cost benefits in fully optimising the backwash and cleaning protocols the impact of labour requirements e for polymeric membrane based installations can differ substantially from those for ceramic ones if significant membrane integrity loss takes place section 2 3 a labour effort of 2 5 fte full time equivalent was assumed by guerra and pellegrino 2013 for operation of a 18 9 mld plant with 0 5 fte assumed to be assigned to integrity monitoring and fibre repair of 24 polymeric membranes filaments per year thus 1 27 repairs per mld p a neither park et al 2015 nor kurth et al 2018 identified labour effort specifically in their respective reported analyses notwithstanding the above factors fig 1 implies a cost benefit of implementing ceramic over polymeric membranes when the membrane cfl ratio falls below 0 68 however the slope of the relationship must necessarily depend on opex and specifically the key parameters of energy and chemicals consumption and of labour effort energy consumption relates mainly to membrane permeability and hydraulic losses and chemical demand to membrane cleaning labour effort is strongly correlated with the maintenance incurred by membrane breaching 2 3 membrane integrity studies there are far fewer studies of membrane integrity than there are of membrane fouling however a number of studies have nonetheless demonstrated age related impaired integrity of polymeric membranes with an accompanying concomitant decrease in permeability and membrane mechanical strength for the more extensively studied pes membrane a few potable water studies have indicated increased fouling propensity touffet et al 2015 cui et al 2017 and reduced integrity generally quantified as the elongation at break εr causserand et al 2015 cui et al 2017 table 3 these changes have been associated with the loss of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp a widely used hydrophilic additive in membrane fabrication loss of pvp has been assumed to be promoted by hypochlorite ocl oxidation touffet et al 2015 ravesreau et al 2016 fu and zhang 2019 authors have observed reasonable correlation of pvp and mechanical strength loss with hypochlorite dose expressed as ct the product of the concentration g cl2 l and exposure time h and its action is attenuated to an extent by the ph regula et al 2014 ct is estimated to be around 2000 g h l over the life of a polymeric membrane potable water plant based on standard chemical cleaning protocols causserand et al 2015 robinson and bérubé 2020 in a recent study in this area robinson and bérubé 2020 samples of a specific pvdf membrane product were harvested from 8 full scale installations across an age range of 1 8 years results indicated a deterioration in permeability and a decline in mechanical strength at around 5 years of use associated with the decreased hydrophilic additive bulk and surface concentration similar observations of pvp loss have been made with mbr pvdf hf membranes mavukkandy et al 2016 marbelia et al 2019 integrity of ceramic membranes is largely unreported it is generally accepted that the ceramic membrane material itself is not susceptible to breaching pertaining to oxidative degradation though hypochlorite promoted failure of the seals has recently been demonstrated kramer et al 2019 for the purposes of this analysis it is assumed that whilst integrity monitoring is required for ceramic membrane installations no repair associated with integrity loss is incurred in practice membrane integrity is routinely assessed using established off line methods most usually using the pressure decay test pdt whilst pdts are automated examination and repair pinning of polymeric hf membranes failing the pdt is laborious and incurs significant labour effort and associated operating costs guerra and pellegrino 2013 judd and carra 2021 the proportion of the total opex that this cost component contributes increases with decreasing flow capacity judd and carra 2021 moreover the impact the breakage of a single fibre has on the treated water quality also increases with decreasing size since the proportion of the total number of fibres also increases gijsbertsen abrahamse et al 2006 a crucially important aspect is thus the integrity loss manifested as required membrane filament repairs over the life of the installation fibre breakage rate data is rarely reported in the peer reviewed literature the small amount of available data fig 2 taken from brehant et al 2015 and two unpublished data sets pes 1 2 suggests wide ranging breakage rates from 10 to 80 per mld plant capacity per year which may increase exponentially or linearly with time these values are substantially higher than the estimate of 24 p a for an 18 9 mld capacity installation assumed by guerra and pellegrino 2013 evidence across a number of sites suggests that polymer integrity loss is more strongly associated with feedwater quality than membrane material specifically both permeability and integrity diminish at full scale polymeric membrane plants when feedwater turbidity increases brehant et al 2015 ferrer et al 2016 translating breakage rates into cost is challenged by the differing protocols used across different sites for identifying and isolating the module with the integrity breach removing the membrane element identifying and repairing the breach and reassembling the module skid however if an individual breach is assumed to incur 1 5 h of effort i e 75 assuming a gross cost of 50 h and thus comparable to the value of 70 for a single fibre breakage determiend by freeman 2012 then using the average values from the data depicted in fig 2 this corresponds to a range of 0 011 to 0 028 fte per mld assuming 1600 working hours per year i e 80 000 fte this equates to 0 0046 0 012 per m3 calculated overall opex values vary widely according to assumptions made table 4 the greatest sensitivity is to the electrical energy tariff followed by the membrane replacement and the labour effort the overall opex calculated by brehant et al 2015 is around a quarter of that determined by guerra and pellegrino 2013 due to the lower energy tariff and labour effort assumed judd and carra 2021 using data taken from full scale uk installations determined the normalised labour effort fte per mld or m3 to increase with decreasing flow capacity based on such assumptions fibre breakage may contribute up to 43 of the opex in labour costs alone and more still if membrane life is subsequently reduced 2 4 clogging sludging determination membrane channel clogging or sludging the agglomeration of solids in the membrane interstices has been widely recognised by mbr practitioners in municipal wastewater treatment for at least 14 years itokawa et al 2008 frechen et al 2008 sludging has been observed in both aerobic stone and livingston 2008 ewert 2014 and anaerobic mbrs giménez lorang et al 2021 it has recently become evident that the challenge also extends to potable water treatment where polymeric hf membranes are downstream of a coagulation step so called direct filtration thus far no research studies have been conducted on potable water membrane channel sludging however practitioner experience of operating installations in the uk and north america suggests that sludging presents a significant challenge on direct filtration of surface waters this slow accumulation of solids within the fibre bundle is manifested as an only fleetingly effective cip and has been quantified as an increase in the weight of the wetted membrane module at full scale potable water installations booker 2019 and pilot scale mbr studies zsirai et al 2014 2 5 full scale experience and pilot trial outcomes in practice membrane plants tend to operate at fluxes well below the design fluxes which are themselves also below the values tested and or assumed in some of the published studies kurth et al 2018 an example is the installation in the netherlands fig 3 which employs suspended ion exchange six upstream of the membrane skid for improved dissolved organic carbon removal this plant has a design peak flux of 110 lmh table 5 though in practice the flux is in the region of 65 90 lmh since the flow is demand driven cleaning is entirely through chemically enhanced backwashing ceb no recovery cip clean in place is currently installed at this site table 6 whilst operating under very conservative conditions experience at this site nonetheless indicates a no integrity loss integrity tests pressure decay measurement provide no evidence of damage to the membrane affecting its perm selectivity b manageable permeability decline the permeability from year 2 onwards has plateaued at 180 200 lmh bar during operation without an installed cip system trials with cip indicate that the permeability can be increased to as much as 400 lmh bar there have been no events associated with integrity loss and permeability decline the latter being associated with sludging at some polymeric membrane plants the fte for the site is 0 6 i e 0 005 fte mld which is somewhat lower than the value of 0 009 computed by judd and carra 2021 for a plant of similar size against this the chemicals consumption is higher than that reported for polymeric plants and so contributes a greater proportion of the opex at this site 0 010 m3 if a cost of 1000 per m3 of bulk reagent is assumed for both naocl and h2o2 available information from recent pilot scale studies based on at least one full scale membrane module suggest sustainable operating flux values generally between 150 and 250 lmh this range refers to optimised systems and specifically to optimised pre treatment whilst optimisation of pre treatment relies of foreknowledge of the feedwater organic matter characteristics peters et al 2021 evidence suggests that combined ozonation and coagulation presents a robust means of mitigating ceramic membrane fouling fan et al 2014 ng et al 2018 spencer et al 2019 lam et al 2021 shorney darby et al 2021 4 discussion a review of the available information relating to membrane filtration employed for potable water production suggests the following 1 bench scale trials have not conclusively demonstrated a significant difference in overall net permeability between the membranes especially for tests based on pristine materials oligny et al 2016 alresheedi et al 2019 2 polymeric membranes are subject to irreversible impairment of both mechanical strength and permeability due to loss of the hydrophilic agent polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp over a period of many years the loss of pvp roughly correlates with the total hypochlorite dose ct the product of the reagent concentration and total exposure time in practice the total ct for a polymeric membrane installation at the end of its life has been reported as being in the region of 200 gh l causserand et al 2015 robinson and bérubé 2020 3 since polymeric membranes decrease in mechanical strength with age it follows that pinning frequency must correspondingly increase incurring higher labour costs with time until the membranes are replaced this supplementary labour cost represents a significant additional component of the opex which does not arise in ceramic membrane installations 4 the irreversible loss of permeability also determines the membrane life as with membrane integrity long term permeability loss does not appear to arise for ceramic membranes 5 the chemical and mechanical robustness of ceramic membranes allows them to be exposed to high ct levels this then implies a higher chemical consumption than that associated with polymeric membranes such that it may become the primary opex component 6 there is additionally increasing anecdotal evidence unpublished and based only on practitioner experience to suggest that polymeric membranes challenged with pre coagulated nom laden surface waters may be subject to clogging or sludging as with permeability decline and integrity sludging appears to be age related and also incurs significant staff effort and thus labour cost for its amelioration judd and carra 2021 the above means that the actual opex for a polymeric membrane plant challenged with a surface water feed is likely to resemble the trend shown in fig 4 the ceramic membrane opex the dashed line in fig 4 is generally higher than the polymeric one due to the increased chemical consumption required to maintain membrane permeability but is independent of time lastly costs will be affected by investment in equipment to a suppress polymeric membrane sludging through installing clarification technologies such as dissolved air flotation employed upstream of the membrane filter and downstream of coagulant dosing at some plants b suppress organic fouling of ceramic membranes using pre coagulation six as at the netherlands site section 2 5 and or powdered activated carbon tested at pilot scale by campinas et al 2021 and c enhance oxidative membrane cleaning using ozonation such as at the choa chu kang waterworks cckw in singapore galjaard et al 2011 2013 lam et al 2021 as an alternative to hydrogen peroxide despite the envisaged significance of the above opex elements evidence suggests that an indication of the relative cost benefit or penalty of implementing a ceramic membrane system over a polymeric one is through the membrane cost flux life cfl ratio c o s t p e n a l t y 0 41 cfl 0 277 where c o s t p e n a l t y t o t a l c o s t p a r a m e t e r f o r c e r a

y m f l u x c e r a m f l u x p o l y m l i f e c e r a m l i f e however both the coefficient and intercept values in this equation must necessarily depend on factors impacting on the opex used to determine the overall cost penalty including the assumed energy and chemicals consumption and the labour effort 5 conclusions a review of available information pertinent to the key practical concern of the comparative operability and total life cycle cost of polymeric and ceramic membrane based installations for treating surface waters for potable water production has been conducted the following conclusions can be drawn 1 short term bench scale tests provide conflicting conclusions regarding the relative sustainable permeability of the two materials in part because of the differing hydrodynamic conditions employed bench scale trials also cannot precisely replicate the cleaning protocols of full scale plants or unless based on aged membranes sampled from full scale plants account for the reduced polymeric membrane hydrophilicity with age 2 there is a measurable correlation between impaired polymeric membrane performance both with respect to permeability and mechanical strength and the total exposure to hypochlorite over the life of a plant the impact of the hypochlorite is on the pvp content of the membrane which is denaturised and or leached from the membrane material bulk or surface through the action of the hypochlorite hypochlorite being widely used to recover membrane permeability when challenged with waters having a significant organic matter content such as surface waters the exposure to hypochlorite during the cleaning cycle appears to limit the membrane life to 6 8 years 3 contrary to the observations made regarding polymeric membranes evidence from existing full scale ceramic membrane installations suggests that ceramic membranes are sufficiently robust to allow aggressive permeability recovery measures without impairment of the warrantied membrane life of 15 20 years or more the increased intensity of the cleaning protocol which can extend to ozonation at some installations increases the contribution of this component to the opex 4 labour costs associated with maintaining polymeric membrane based installations depend on the rate and extent of the decline in permeability and mechanical strength there may also be additional costs associated with sludging the accumulation of solids within the polymeric hollow fibre bundle which incurs both significantly increased labour effort and chemicals consumption for cleaning as well as further reducing the membrane life 5 the cost benefit offered by a ceramic membrane system can be inferred from the ratio of the ceramic and polymer membrane cost mitigated by the flux and life ratios however this simple ratio excludes key operating parameters such as energy and chemicals consumption and in particular the labour costs ceramic membrane systems are associated with higher capex due to the higher cost membrane material but lower opex if both the membrane replacement and labour costs are accounted for fig 4 procurement processes which a favour or permit offsetting of capex and or b rely on accurate prediction of opex may therefore favour ceramic over polymeric membrane systems finally it should be acknowledged that the fabrication of commercial membranes is continuously evolving whilst the cost of ceramic membranes has decreased over the past 15 20 years the same is also true though perhaps to a lesser extent of polymeric membranes at the same time improvements in membrane materials and membrane module design have generally increased their robustness which challenges accurate predictions of the comparative costs of technologies based on the two different materials

16168,mercury hg and its compounds are a kind of worldwide concerned persistent toxic pollutants as the major primary producer in the ocean microalgae are expected to play an important role in the cycling and accumulation of hg in marine ecosystems by either uptake hg species from seawater or involving in the transformations of hg species however there is still lack of clear knowledge on whether microalgae can induce the methylation and demethylation of hg in aquatic environments in this study hg isotope dilution and isotope addition techniques were utilized to determine the methylation and demethylation potential of hg at concentrations comparable to that in natural environments by 15 common marine microalgae 8 species of diatoms 4 species of dinoflagellates 2 species of chlorophyta and 1 species of chrysophyte methylation of inorganic hg was found to be negligible in the culture of all tested marine microalgae while 6 species could significantly induce the demethylation of methylmercury mehg the rates of microalgae mediated mehg demethylation were at the same order of magnitude as that of photodemethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the degradation of mehg in marine environments further studies suggest that the demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be mainly caused by their extracellular secretions via photo induce demethylation and associated bacteria rather than the direct demethylation of mehg by microalgae cells in addition it was found that thiol groups may be the major component in microalgal

microalgae seawater used to prepare the modified f 2 medium lee and fisher 2016 wang and dei 2001 for culturing microalgae was collected from the offshore areas of the east china sea the seawater was firstly filtered through a 0 22 μm acetate fiber membrane and then autoclaved at 120 c for 20 min to eliminate particulate matters and microorganisms in order to avoid the possible interference and methylation demethylation of hg causing by the chemical reagents a modified f 2 medium i e edta trace metals and vitamins were eliminated from the medium lee and fisher 2016 wang and dei 2001 was

however uv can reach as deep as several to dozen meters in some coastal water aas and hojerslev 2001 wilhelm et al 1998 and in open ocean boelen et al 1999 obernosterer et al 2001 which may result in the underestimation of the contribution of photoreduction to some extent especially in surface water to prevent cell adhesion and avoid the differences in light at different locations of the incubator the flasks were shaken and their positions were changed randomly each day deng et al 2013 fifteen marine microalgae most of which are predominant phytoplankton species in coastal seas were adopted in

samples were continually cultured for 4 days the cell densities of cultured microalgae at day 0 and day 4 can be found in the table s2 double isotope addition method can reduce the effect of background values and simultaneously track both the methylation and demethylation processes samples were preserved at 0 4 hcl conc v v for mehg analysis and 0 5 hcl conc v v for thg analysis triplicates were adopted for each treatment the concentrations of me201hg and me199hg at day 0 and day 4 were determined to calculate the hg methylation and demethylation rates the concentrations of total 199hg t199hg and total 201hg t201hg at day 0 and day 4 were also determined to ensure that there was no any unwanted loss of added 199hg2 and me201hg during the culture period of microalgae 2 4

listed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 methylation of hg by the 15 tested marine microalgae concentrations of t199hg and me199hg in the 15 marine microalgal culture mixtures were presented in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a there was no significant difference in the concentrations of t199hg in all 15 microalgal culture mixtures at day 0 and day 4 t test p 0 05 indicating that there was no obvious loss of 199hg during the 4 day culture period me199hg did not significantly increase t test p 0 05 during the experimental period fig 2b suggesting that the tested 15 marine microalgae could not methylate hg2 to mehg 15 marine microalgae from 4 phyla including diatom dinoflagellate chlorophyta and chrysophyte were tested in this study and all of them did not show the ability of methylating inorganic hg this result indicates that phytoplankton may play a negligible role in the production of mehg in marine environments a previous study showed that fucus vesiculosus phaeophyta could not induce the methylation of hg at μg l 1 level of hg in this study p tricornutum was found to have no capability of methylating hg2 at 20 ng l 1 nevertheless methylation has been found in a previous study conducted at high concentrations of hg2 20 120 μg l 1 and little is known at this moment concerning the methylating mechanism deng et al 2013 the difference between the two studies might be due to the chemical methylation of hg at high concentrations of hg2 dom excreted by the microalgae is composed of a variety of ligands that can methylate hg through chemical reactions e g fatty acid and polypeptide krishnamurthy 1992 weber 1993 these ligands may cause the methylation of hg2 at high concentrations microorganisms with hgca and hgcb genes have been thought to play a major role in the biotic methylation of hg parks et al 2013 the genes hgca and hgcb encode a putative corrinoid protein hgca and a 2 4fe 4s ferredoxin hgcb consistent with roles as a methyl carrier and an electron donor required for corrinoid cofactor reduction respectively parks et al 2013 most of these hg methylators are anaerobic microorganisms gilmour et al 2013 podar et al 2015 since the microalgae were cultured at oxic condition while hgca and hgcb genes were mainly found in anaerobic bacteria parks et al 2013 it is not surprising that the methylation of hg by the microalgae associated microorganisms were not detected in this study 3 2 demethylation of hg by the 15 tested marine microalgae concentrations of t201hg and me201hg in 15 marine microalgae mixtures at day 0 and day 4 were presented in fig 3 similar to t199hg no loss of t201hg was observed during the 4 day culture of microalgae t test p 0 05 fig 3a the change in me201hg varied among the 15 tested microalgae as shown in fig 3b significant demethylation of me201hg p 0 05 was observed for 6 of the 15 tested microalgae including p tricornutum c curvisetus p triestinum p donghaiense a carterae and p parvum carter while the change of me201hg in the other 9 marine microalgal culture was negligible the demethylation rate constants of the 6 microalgae were in the order of p donghaiense 19 60 10 2 d 1 p parvum carter 15

than diatoms it has been previously reported that pico nanoplankton at an eutrophic lake consisted of cyanobacteria diatoms cryptophyta green algae and heterotrophic microorganisms can demethylate mehg at a rate of 4 and 12 per day cossart et al 2021 chlamydomonas reinhardti a freshwater chlorophyta and emiliania huxleyi a marine haptophyta has been previously reported to be able to demethylate mehg at nm level bravo et al 2014 lee and fisher 2016 3 3 the relative importance of microalgal cells associated bacteria and extracellular secretions in the demethylation of mehg to evaluate the relative importance of microalgal cells associated bacteria and extracellular secretions in the demethylation of mehg demethylation rates in the entire microalgal culture mixture modified f 2 medium microalgal culture solution and autoclaved microalgal culture solution were further measured and the results are presented in fig 4 among the 6 microalgae with the capability of demethylating mehg mehg demethylation by p parvumcarter p teriestinum and a carterae were mainly attributed to the extracellular secretions while associated bacteria played a major role in the demethylation of mehg by p donghaiense extracellular secretions and associated bacteria played a comparable role in the demethylation of mehg by c curvysetus while the extracellular secretions associated bacteria and microalgal cells contributed comparably to the demethylation of mehg by p tricornutum the extracellular secretions induced demethylation rates were dozens of times much higher more than that of associated bacteria and microalgal cells for p parvumcarter p teriestinum and a carterae most microalgae indicating that demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be important caused by their extracellular secretions this process may be more mainly important in natural sunlight in consideration that uv is not included in the light spectra of the incubator most previous studies suggested that associated bacteria in microalgal culture may the main pathway of mehg demethylation by microalgae bravo et al 2014 lee and fisher 2016 associated bacteria were not a significant pathway except for p donghaiense in this study the degradation of mehg in the coccolithophore cultures was probably attributable to bacterial cells that were observed to be growing in cultures of this clone bacteria containing the hg resistance mer operon merb which cleaves the c hg bond to yield ch4 and hg ii and mera which reduces hg ii to gaseous hg 0 might explain the demethylation and reduction of mehg in the coccoli thophore culture lee and fisher 2016 in a eutrophic lake demethylation of mehg was observed to correlate positively with the relative abundance of diatoms and heterotrophic microorganisms in the pico nanoplankton cossart et al 2021 the reductive process might occur through the mer operon considered as more common algal cell mediated demethylation of mehg by visible light was estimated to account for 20 to 55 of the total both visible and uv light photo chemically driven demethylation in the open ocean and transparent freshwater ecosystems with deep euphotic zones kritee et al 2018 3 4 mechanism of demethylation of mehg by the extracellular secretion of marine microalgae as shown in previous section demethylation induced by the extracellular secretion was a major pathway of microalgae induced demethylation of mehg the photodemethylation of mehg by dom has been reported to be the major pathway of mehg degradation in aquatic environments hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2006 li et al 2010 qian et al 2014 sellers et al 1996 the demethylation of mehg in the extracellular secretions of 15 microalgae under natural sunlight and in the dark were measured to identify the role of sunlight in mehg demethylation the results showed that no significant degradation of mehg was observed for all 15 microalgae in the dark fig 5 a indicating the demethylation of mehg by microalgal extracellular excretions is dominated by sunlight the k d of mehg degradation in light incubator was similar to that under visible for the 6 microalgae that can demethylate mehg fig 5b the difference between the experiments under natural sunlight and in the light incubator could be due to the higher intensities of visible light in sunlight average 400 500 μmol photon m2 s during the experimental period and the extra uv induced demethylation of mehg the difference between natural sunlight and artificial light in light spectra were showed in fig s2 the demethylation of mehg in the 15 microalgal culture under sunlight visible light uva and uvb were measured to identify the role of light spectra in mehg demethylation in comparison to visible light uv contributed more to the demethylation of mehg under sunlight for most microalgae fig s3 a b uv has been deemed to be the major spectrum of sunlight that can induce the photodemethylation of mehg in natural water black et al 2012 fernandez gomez et al 2013 in consistence with the finding of this study however it was found in this study that visible light can also play some role in the photodemethylation of mehg in microalgal extracellular excretions the rates of mehg photodemethylation in the extracellular secretions were observed to be in the order of d salina d brightwellii c closterium c curvisetus a japonica p mininum s costatum c venus kuetzing p subcordiforus p tricornutum p donghaiense c cryptica a carterae p triestinum p parvum carter fig 5a thiol and benzene groups in dom have been deemed to be the major components in dom that promote the photodegradation of mehg in previous studies qian et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the relationships of mehg photodemethylation rates with doc concentrations thiol concentrations and suv254 representing the aromaticity of microalgal extracellular secretion were further tested in this study mehg photodemethylation rates had a significant moderately positive relation p 0 01 with thiol concentrations fig 6 and an insignificant relation with the doc and suv254 fig s4 a b indicating that thiol may be the major component in microalgal excreted dom that dominate the degradation of mehg while other groups in dom also may play a certain role on mehg degradation as a soft lewis base thiol can form strong bonding with mehg melnick and parkin 2007 and subsequently promote the photodemethylation of mehg under solar radiation tossell 1998 in situ degradation of mehg photochemical and microbial pathways is an important process that can determine the level of mehg in marine environments dimento and mason 2017 the photodemethylation rates were previously reported to be 0 23 1 67 d 1 dimento and mason 2017 lehnherr et al 2011 whalin et al 2007 while microbial demethylation rates were in the range of 0 01 to 0 19 d 1 monperrus et al 2007 schaefer et al 2004 in this study the photodemethylation rates of mehg in the extracellular secretions of microalgae were determined to be in the range of 0 01 0 39 d 1 while the associated bacteria of some microalgae can also induce significant demethylation of mehg 0 03 0 14 d 1 these rates were comparable to that reported for the in situ mehg photodemethylation and microbial demethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the demethylation of mehg in marine environments 4 conclusion the methylation and demethylation potential of hg at concentrations comparable to that in natural environments by 15 common marine microalgae have been determined methylation of inorganic hg was found to be negligible in all tested marine microalgae while 6 species could significantly induce the demethylation of mehg the photodemethylation rates of mehg in the extracellular secretions of microalgae were determined to be in the range of 0 01 0 39 d 1 while the associated bacteria of some microalgae can also induce significant demethylation of mehg 0 03 0 14 d 1 however demethylation by extracellular secretion under both visible light and uv was the main pathway these rates were comparable to that reported for the in situ mehg photodemethylation and microbial demethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the demethylation of mehg in marine environments the demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be mainly caused by their extracellular secretions via photo mediated pathway and associated bacteria rather than the direct demethylation of mehg by microalgae cells in addition it was found that thiol groups may be the major component in microalgal extracellular secretions that lead to the photo demethylation of mehg declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was partially

demethylation of methylmercury mehg the rates of microalgae mediated mehg demethylation were at the same order of magnitude as that of photodemethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the degradation of mehg in marine environments further studies suggest that the demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be mainly caused by their extracellular secretions via

limited species of marine microalgae tested and high concentrations of hg added there is still lack of clear knowledge on whether marine microalgae are involved in the methylation and demethylation of hg in natural environments the major aims of this study were to identify whether inorganic hg and mehg can be methylated or demethylated by common marine microalgae and elucidate the mechanisms of microalgal dominated hg methylation and demethylation to fulfill these aims the methylation and demethylation of hg by 15 common marine microalgae under natural seawater levels of hg hg2 20 ng l 1

microalgae seawater used to prepare the modified f 2 medium lee and fisher 2016 wang and dei 2001 for culturing microalgae was collected from the offshore areas of the east china sea the seawater was firstly filtered through a 0 22 μm acetate fiber membrane and then autoclaved at 120 c for 20 min to eliminate particulate matters and microorganisms in order to avoid the possible interference and methylation demethylation of hg causing by the chemical reagents a modified f 2 medium i e edta trace metals and vitamins were eliminated from the medium lee and fisher 2016 wang and dei 2001 was adopted to culture the microalgae the microalgae in 500 ml flasks were placed in a light incubator at 20 1 c at a 14 h 10 h light dark cycle provided by a cool white fluorescent lamp light intensity 100 μmol photon m2 s the fluorescent lamp light used in the incubator can well mimic the visible sunlight in the euphotic zone where uv from sunlight is largely attenuated muaddi and jamal 1991 however uv can reach as deep as several to dozen meters in some coastal water aas and hojerslev 2001 wilhelm et al 1998 and in open ocean boelen et al 1999 obernosterer et al 2001 which may result in the underestimation of the contribution of photoreduction to some extent especially in surface water to prevent cell adhesion and avoid the differences in light at different locations of the incubator the flasks were shaken and their positions were changed randomly each day deng et al 2013 fifteen marine microalgae most of which are predominant phytoplankton species in coastal seas were adopted in

double stable isotope addition technique was adopted to measure hg methylation demethylation by microalgae 30 ml of pre cultured microalgal cultures at the exponential growth phase the pre cultured microalgae were cultured in the normal modified f 2 medium without adding any hg or mehg were added into 270 ml modified f 2 medium containing 199hg2 20 ng l 1 in hg and me201hg 2 ng l 1 in hg and the samples were continually cultured for 4 days the cell densities of cultured microalgae at day 0 and day 4 can be found in the table s2 double isotope addition method can reduce the effect of

microalgae in order to further explore the mechanism of microalgal extracellular secretion induced mehg demethylation demethylation rates in microalgal extracellular secretions under various light spectra were measured sterile extracellular secretion samples of the 15 microalgae were obtained by filtrating the microalgal culture mixtures at the exponential growth phase through a 0 22 μm polycarbonate membrane me201hg was added into these samples in 50 ml quartz bottles to form a final concentration of 10 ng l 1 besides the measurement of hg methylation demethylation rates in quartz

spectra of sunlight treatment 7 were measured 5 ml of samples were collected at 0 1 and 2 days after adding hcl conc to form a final concentration of 0 4 v v the samples were stored at 4 c until analysis triplicates were adopted for each treatment the uv a uv b and visible sunlight induced mehg photodegradation can then be calculated as the differences of rates between treatment 6 and

instrument zhejiang the par data in the incubation was shown in fig s1 dissolved organic carbon doc thiol concentrations and uv visible absorption spectra used to calculate suva254 of the samples at

concentrations and the other ancillary parameters concentrations of t199hg me199hg t201hg and me 201hg were determined using our previously developed isotope dilution method song et al 2017 briefly a known amount of 198hg2 and me198hg were added into the sample as the isotope diluents for thg and mehg isotopes respectively the samples were then equilibrated in the dark for 12 h at 4 c the thg and

the method detection limit three times of the standard deviation of the blanks was calculated to be 0 09 ng l 1 for thg and 0 006 ng l 1 for mehg microalgal culture mixture was filtrated immediately

listed in table s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 methylation of hg by the 15 tested marine microalgae concentrations of t199hg and me199hg in the 15 marine microalgal culture mixtures were presented in fig 2 as shown in fig 2a there was no significant difference in the concentrations of t199hg in all 15 microalgal culture mixtures at day 0 and day 4 t test p 0 05 indicating that there was no obvious loss of 199hg during the 4 day culture period me199hg did not significantly increase t test p 0 05 during the experimental period fig 2b suggesting that the tested 15 marine microalgae could not methylate hg2 to mehg 15 marine microalgae from 4 phyla including diatom dinoflagellate chlorophyta and chrysophyte were tested in this study and all of them did not show the ability of methylating inorganic hg this result indicates that phytoplankton may play a negligible role in the production of mehg in marine environments a previous study showed that fucus vesiculosus phaeophyta could not induce the methylation of hg at μg l 1 level of hg in this study p tricornutum was found to have no capability of methylating hg2 at 20 ng l 1 nevertheless methylation has been found in a previous study conducted at high concentrations of hg2 20 120 μg l 1 and little is known at this moment concerning the methylating mechanism deng et al 2013 the difference between the two studies might be due to the chemical methylation of hg at high concentrations of hg2 dom excreted by the microalgae is composed of a variety of ligands that can methylate hg through chemical reactions e g fatty acid and polypeptide krishnamurthy 1992 weber 1993 these ligands may cause the methylation of hg2 at high concentrations microorganisms with hgca and hgcb genes have been thought to play a major role in the biotic methylation of hg parks et al 2013 the genes hgca and hgcb encode a putative corrinoid protein hgca and a 2 4fe 4s ferredoxin hgcb consistent with roles as a methyl carrier and an electron donor required for corrinoid cofactor reduction respectively parks et al 2013 most of these hg methylators are anaerobic microorganisms gilmour et al 2013 podar et al 2015 since the microalgae were cultured at oxic condition while hgca and hgcb genes were mainly found in anaerobic bacteria parks et al 2013 it is not surprising that the methylation of hg by the microalgae associated microorganisms were not detected in this study 3 2 demethylation of hg by the 15 tested marine microalgae concentrations of t201hg and me201hg in 15 marine microalgae mixtures at day 0 and day 4 were presented in fig 3 similar to t199hg no loss of t201hg was observed during the 4 day culture of microalgae t test p 0 05 fig 3a the change in me201hg varied among the 15 tested microalgae as shown in fig 3b significant demethylation of me201hg p 0 05 was observed for 6 of the 15 tested microalgae including p tricornutum c curvisetus p triestinum p donghaiense a carterae and p parvum carter while the change of me201hg in the other 9 marine microalgal culture was negligible the demethylation rate constants of the 6 microalgae were in the order of p donghaiense 19 60 10 2 d 1 p parvum carter 15 71 10 2 d 1 p triestinum 14 43 10 2 d 1 a carterae 4 42 10 2 d 1 p tricornutum 3 88 10 2 d 1 c curvisetus 3 62 10 2 d 1 fig 4 in general dinoflagellates and chrysophyte had quicker demethylation rates than diatoms it has been previously reported that pico nanoplankton at an eutrophic lake consisted of cyanobacteria diatoms cryptophyta green algae and heterotrophic microorganisms can demethylate mehg at a rate of 4 and 12 per day cossart et al 2021 chlamydomonas reinhardti a freshwater chlorophyta and emiliania huxleyi a marine haptophyta has been previously reported to be able to demethylate mehg at nm level bravo et al 2014 lee and fisher 2016 3 3 the relative importance of microalgal cells associated bacteria and extracellular secretions in the demethylation of mehg to evaluate the relative importance of microalgal cells associated bacteria and extracellular secretions in the demethylation of mehg demethylation rates in the entire microalgal culture mixture modified f 2 medium microalgal culture solution and autoclaved microalgal culture solution were further measured and the results are presented in fig 4 among the 6 microalgae with the capability of demethylating mehg mehg demethylation by p parvumcarter p teriestinum and a carterae were mainly attributed to the extracellular secretions while associated bacteria played a major role in the demethylation of mehg by p donghaiense extracellular secretions and associated bacteria played a comparable role in the demethylation of mehg by c curvysetus while the extracellular secretions associated bacteria and microalgal cells contributed comparably to the demethylation of mehg by p tricornutum the extracellular secretions induced demethylation rates were dozens of times much higher more than that of associated bacteria and microalgal cells for p parvumcarter p teriestinum and a carterae most microalgae indicating that demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be important caused by their extracellular secretions this process may be more mainly important in natural sunlight in consideration that uv is not included in the light spectra of the incubator most previous studies suggested that associated bacteria in microalgal culture may the main pathway of mehg demethylation by microalgae bravo et al 2014 lee and fisher 2016 associated bacteria were not a significant pathway except for p donghaiense in this study the degradation of mehg in the coccolithophore cultures was probably attributable to bacterial cells that were observed to be growing in cultures of this clone bacteria containing the hg resistance mer operon merb which cleaves the c hg bond to yield ch4 and hg ii and mera which reduces hg ii to gaseous hg 0 might explain the demethylation and reduction of mehg in the coccoli thophore culture lee and fisher 2016 in a eutrophic lake demethylation of mehg was observed to correlate positively with the relative abundance of diatoms and heterotrophic microorganisms in the pico nanoplankton cossart et al 2021 the reductive process might occur through the mer operon considered as more common algal cell mediated demethylation of mehg by visible light was estimated to account for 20 to 55 of the total both visible and uv light photo chemically driven demethylation in the open ocean and transparent freshwater ecosystems with deep euphotic zones kritee et al 2018 3 4 mechanism of demethylation of mehg by the extracellular secretion of marine microalgae as shown in previous section demethylation induced by the extracellular secretion was a major pathway of microalgae induced demethylation of mehg the photodemethylation of mehg by dom has been reported to be the major pathway of mehg degradation in aquatic environments hammerschmidt and fitzgerald 2006 li et al 2010 qian et al 2014 sellers et al 1996 the demethylation of mehg in the extracellular secretions of 15 microalgae under natural sunlight and in the dark were measured to identify the role of sunlight in mehg demethylation the results showed that no significant degradation of mehg was observed for all 15 microalgae in the dark fig 5 a indicating the demethylation of mehg by microalgal extracellular excretions is dominated by sunlight the k d of mehg degradation in light incubator was similar to that under visible for the 6 microalgae that can demethylate mehg fig 5b the difference between the experiments under natural sunlight and in the light incubator could be due to the higher intensities of visible light in sunlight average 400 500 μmol photon m2 s during the experimental period and the extra uv induced demethylation of mehg the difference between natural sunlight and artificial light in light spectra were showed in fig s2 the demethylation of mehg in the 15 microalgal culture under sunlight visible light uva and uvb were measured to identify the role of light spectra in mehg demethylation in comparison to visible light uv contributed more to the demethylation of mehg under sunlight for most microalgae fig s3 a b uv has been deemed to be the major spectrum of sunlight that can induce the photodemethylation of mehg in natural water black et al 2012 fernandez gomez et al 2013 in consistence with the finding of this study however it was found in this study that visible light can also play some role in the photodemethylation of mehg in microalgal extracellular excretions the rates of mehg photodemethylation in the extracellular secretions were observed to be in the order of d salina d brightwellii c closterium c curvisetus a japonica p mininum s costatum c venus kuetzing p subcordiforus p tricornutum p donghaiense c cryptica a carterae p triestinum p parvum carter fig 5a thiol and benzene groups in dom have been deemed to be the major components in dom that promote the photodegradation of mehg in previous studies qian et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 the relationships of mehg photodemethylation rates with doc concentrations thiol concentrations and suv254 representing the aromaticity of microalgal extracellular secretion were further tested in this study mehg photodemethylation rates had a significant moderately positive relation p 0 01 with thiol concentrations fig 6 and an insignificant relation with the doc and suv254 fig s4 a b indicating that thiol may be the major component in microalgal excreted dom that dominate the degradation of mehg while other groups in dom also may play a certain role on mehg degradation as a soft lewis base thiol can form strong bonding with mehg melnick and parkin 2007 and subsequently promote the photodemethylation of mehg under solar radiation tossell 1998 in situ degradation of mehg photochemical and microbial pathways is an important process that can determine the level of mehg in marine environments dimento and mason 2017 the photodemethylation rates were previously reported to be 0 23 1 67 d 1 dimento and mason 2017 lehnherr et al 2011 whalin et al 2007 while microbial demethylation rates were in the range of 0 01 to 0 19 d 1 monperrus et al 2007 schaefer et al 2004 in this study the photodemethylation rates of mehg in the extracellular secretions of microalgae were determined to be in the range of 0 01 0 39 d 1 while the associated bacteria of some microalgae can also induce significant demethylation of mehg 0 03 0 14 d 1 these rates were comparable to that reported for the in situ mehg photodemethylation and microbial demethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the demethylation of mehg in marine environments 4 conclusion the methylation and demethylation potential of hg at concentrations comparable to that in natural environments by 15 common marine microalgae have been determined methylation of inorganic hg was found to be negligible in all tested marine microalgae while 6 species could significantly induce the demethylation of mehg the photodemethylation rates of mehg in the extracellular secretions of microalgae were determined to be in the range of 0 01 0 39 d 1 while the associated bacteria of some microalgae can also induce significant demethylation of mehg 0 03 0 14 d 1 however demethylation by extracellular secretion under both visible light and uv was the main pathway these rates were comparable to that reported for the in situ mehg photodemethylation and microbial demethylation indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the demethylation of mehg in marine environments the demethylation of mehg by the microalgae may be mainly caused by their extracellular secretions via photo mediated pathway and associated bacteria rather than the direct demethylation of mehg by microalgae cells in addition it was found that thiol groups may be the major component in microalgal extracellular secretions that lead to the photo demethylation of mehg declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments this research was partially

16169,recovering oil from oily wastewater is not only for economic gains but also for mitigating environmental pollution however demulsification of oil droplets stabilized with surfactants is challenging because of their low surface energy although the widely used oil water separation membrane technologies based on size screening have attracted considerable attention in the past few decades they are incapable of demulsification of stabilized oil emulsions and the membrane concentrates often require post processing herein the piezoelectric ceramic membrane pcm which can respond to the inherent transmembrane pressure in the pressure driven membrane processes was employed to transform hydraulic pressure pulses into electroactive responses to in situ demulsification the pulsed transmembrane pressure on the pcm results in the generation of considerable rapid voltage oscillations over 3 2 v and a locally high electric field intensity of 7 2 107 v m which is capable of electrocoalescence with no additional stimuli or high voltage devices negative dielectrophoresis dep force occurred in this membrane process and repelled the large size of oil after demulsification away from the pcm surface ensuring continuous membrane demulsification and oil water separation overall pcm provides a further opportunity to develop an environmentally friendly and energy saving

barium titanate demulsification oil water separation dielectrophoresis 1 introduction with the ever increasing demand for energy to meet the rapid progress of industry abundant oil related industrial or social activities have produced large amounts of oily wastewater gao et al 2014 kim et al 2020 it was reported by the international tanker owners pollution federation limited itopf over 5 73 million tons of oil were accidentally spilled on our earth in the last 50 years therefore oily wastewater has always been a worldwide concern lu et al 2021 yang et al 2019 surfactant stabilized emulsions are classified based on the diameter of oil droplets as free oil 150 μm dispersed oil 20 150 μm and emulsified oil 20 μm kota et al 2012 oil emulsions could form in different types and oil in water o w emulsion is the most common emulsion in oil production by water flooding and transportation he et al 2015 conventional techniques have been proposed for removing oil from emulsions such as coagulation gravity separation or skimming and ozonation etc but most of them may not effectively separate oil in water particularly when the emulsified oil is finely dispersed and the size of oil droplets is below 20 μm kota et al 2012 tanudjaja et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 membrane based separation is the most effective solution for removing emulsified oil droplets with a size range of 1 10 μm tanudjaja et al 2019a ceramic membranes have high chemical and thermal stability low energy consumption and high removal efficiency are particularly suitable for harsh water treatment such as the separation of o w emulsions chen et al 2020 however the current mainstay membrane technologies based on size screening for oil water separation inevitably produce concentrated oil droplets in water without demulsification which may not effectively address the issue of oil recovery after membrane separation brunet et al 2009 qiu et al 2020 tanudjaja et al 2019b meanwhile some studies have reported that by endowing the membranes with special microstructures surface charges hydrophilic hydrophobic membrane surfaces or response to external conditions such as temperature light or electricity etc for demulsification or oil water separation ma et al 2022 xu et al 2015 unfortunately most of these reports involve complicated membrane fabricating processes and may cause secondary chemical pollution by introduction of the low surface energy of harmful fluorine containing polymers qiu et al 2020 besides increasing the membrane sensitivities to external stimulus conditions and the membrane lifespan still remain the fundamental dilemmas for the reported responsive membranes qiu et al 2020 there are many driving forces for oil demulsification such as electrical chemical or biological means he et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 which often integrate the membrane unit to achieve better oil water separation performances kwon et al 2021 li et al 2021 tanudjaja et al 2019a among these electrocoalescence is widely used and plays an important role in the breaking of oil droplets in emulsions guha and varanasi 2019b kwon et al 2021 ren and kang 2018 the electrochemical demulsification is driven by a high electric field and the stable surface charged oil droplets undergo inhomogeneous polarization and droplets deformation leading to the effective thinning and rupture of intervening liquid films he et al 2015 yang et al 2021 however coalescence of two oil droplets may require the unsafe and inconvenient high electric field intensity of 107 v m and voltage on the scale of kilovolt chokkalingam et al 2014 srivastava et al 2018 more importantly most of the membranes used for water treatment such as the inorganic ceramic membranes al2o3 zro2 tio2 etc or the organic polymeric membranes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf cellulose acetate ca etc are non conductive padaki et al 2015 tanudjaja et al 2019a this brings integration difficulties in forming a high enough membrane electric field and may require applying an extremely high voltage of a few kilovolts which is also inconvenient and unsafe for operation electroresponsive membrane materials use external stimulus responsive materials as surface coatings or membranes which allow for in situ real time modification of the electric field on membrane surface for demulsification guha and varanasi 2019b ronen et al 2016 zhu and jassby 2019 nevertheless as electroresponsive membrane materials for the separation of oil water or emulsions demulsification the current reported studies require additional external power supply sources intimately coupled with pressure driven membrane processes which adds complexity to the system kwon et al 2021 li et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 for example electroresponsive membrane materials such as piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate pzt have been reported for oil water separation with the inevitable requirement of external stimuli power sources to generate ultrasonic vibration force mao et al 2018 mousa et al 2022 piezoelectric materials also possess the ability that allows mechanical forces to convert to electrical energy liao et al 2019 a potential envision may utilize pressure stimuli responsive membranes made from piezoelectric materials to induce an electrocoalescence of oil droplets response since the hydraulic pressure in pressure driven membrane processes is inherent ultimately the membrane in situ induces the force to generate electricity for the electrocoalescence of emulsions without the requirement of an additional power source or external driving force in this study a pcm was proposed and investigated for the demulsification of oil emulsion via a classical lead free piezoelectric material of barium titanium oxide batio3 transient pulses of hydraulic driving pressure were employed to stimulate the generation of a membrane piezoelectric demulsification response the predominant demulsification mechanisms are determined as the in situ generation of a high intensity of electric field followed by a negative dielectrophoresis dep force to ensure continuous demulsification and oil water separation more importantly the in situ demulsification method utilizes the inherent hydraulic transmembrane pressure as it requires no external high power supply is rapid and free of additional chemicals this novel

plc panasonic fp xhc30t f that controlled the target hydraulic pressure by adjusting the motor speed rotation direction and running time of the peristaltic pump for example one cycle hydraulic pressure means that the operation pressure stepwise increased from 0 to 1 bar within 10 s leveled off for 70 s at 1 bar and then returned to 0 bar in 2 s before the next cycle in practice the pressure can be automatically and conveniently adjusted by operating the valves rather than changing the pump speed permeate fluxes during the experiments were automatically recorded by a digital balance connected to a computer 2 5 computational simulation piezoelectric outputs of the membranes were simulated by the finite element method fem using comsol multi physics 5 6 the physical field of the piezoelectric device was established in a three dimensional domain and the columned morphology models with a trim membrane size 15 mm in radius and 2 mm in thickness were built after which impact

membrane according to the eds elemental mapping results in fig 1b the sintered al2o3 batio3 ceramic membrane has a similar irregular pore structure fig 1b as the traditional ceramic membranes such as al2o3 zro2 etc or their modified ceramic membranes for water treatment which can potentially be used as a ceramic membrane for water treatment zhu et al 2019 the hydrophilic membrane surface with an underwater oil angle over 140 0 and a membrane porosity of 26 6 contributes to a comparable water flux of approximately 1050 l m 2h 1bar 1 of the sintered al2o3 batio3 ceramic membrane fig 2 b figure s7 zhu et al 2016 the solid state sintering of batio3 particles nonpcm and the corresponding starting raw materials were further confirmed by x ray diffraction patterns xrd fig 2a according to the xrd patterns the split between the peaks of 002 and 200 at 2θ around 45 indicates that the solid state sintered batio3 has the known piezoelectric tetragonal phase bansal et al 2006 xiong et al 2014 due to the melting point of the physicochemical stable al2o3 2000 c is higher than batio3 1600 c about 400 c a small amount of al2o3 scattered in batio3 could play the role of structural skeleton support thus could be used for anti deformation of membranes and improve the batio3 grains rearrangement and close packing fig 2a during high temperature sintering process kinemuchi et al 2006 the sintered nonpcm polarized at 2 5 kv mm makes the polarization direction along the electric field direction leading to membrane piezoelectricity which is referred to as the pcm saito et al 2004 electrical treatment may affect the morphology of the material surface by recrystallization effect or change of lattice parameter according to the previous reports wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the morphology changes were found on the membrane surface after poling treatment and the surface of pcm was more rough than the nonpcm about ra value of 300 nm fig 2c underwater oil contact angle represents the underwater oil adhesion of the membrane surface and the contact angles are all over 140 with limited variation in underwater oleophobicity before and after membrane poling fig 2b gao et al 2016 3 2 membrane demulsification and oil water separation performance constant hydraulic transmembrane pressure is not capable of inducing a piezoelectric voltage in the pcm according to the working principle of piezoelectricity thomann 1990 thus a periodic hydraulic pressure pulse from the operating pressure of 1 bar to 0 and back was performed figure s4 the periodic hydraulic pressure pulse could effectively induce the pcm in situ generating piezoelectric voltage oscillations between 3 2 v and 5 6 v while the nonpcm showed no detectable voltage signal fig 3 a meanwhile the voltage signals of the pcm faded away when the hydraulic pressure became stable fig 3a the pcm demulsification capacity is based on the rapid voltage oscillations generated by the hydraulic pressure pulse for further visualization oil droplets with a mean size of 2 8 μm fig 3c figure s3 in the feed solution were dyed using a lipid soluble dye of oil red o the pcm under the hydraulic pressure pulse has an effective and continuous performance of demulsification during membrane filtration in 2 h fig 3b and the initial oil droplets with smaller size in the concentrated solution became sufficiently large to float to the air water interface and formed a continuous oil phase for recovery fig 3f for comparison the pcm with a constant operating hydraulic pressure fig 3d or the nonpcm under pulsed hydraulic pressure fig 3e showed limited demulsification performance with negligible oil droplet size change but more particles occurred in the concentrate this also confirms the critical role of material polarization and pulsed pressure for in situ membrane demulsification song et al 2006 thomann 1990 in conclusion these results suggest that the electro responsive piezoelectric membrane of the inherent transmembrane hydraulic pressure pulse stimuli was demonstrated here for effective demulsification during membrane separation to investigate the oil retention performance of the membranes we applied the same dyed oil using a lipid soluble dye of oil red o thus the color of the filtrated water could directly reflect the retention effect of the membranes the fluorescence spectra of the feed solution and filtrate after 120 min are shown in fig 4 a d by comparing the feem spectra the mean size of the oil droplets 2 80 μm figure s3 and the membrane pores 0 19 μm figure s6 most of the oil droplets were removed via size screening in the filtrate among different filtration processes and membranes the toc removal efficiency was further evaluated to qualitatively assess oil removal performance under different conditions fig 4e the toc removal rates for all the investigated membranes were maintained above 98 after 120 min and no obvious oil droplets were observed in either clean filtrate fig 4f the above findings reveal that pcm possesses in situ demulsification and oil water separation properties however the demulsification and oil water separation performance may be affected by different oil kinds concentrations oil droplet surface charge and the pulsed hydraulic pressure we prepared a positive charged 2000 ppm petroleum ether dyed with oil red o emulsion modified by ctab and changed the pulsed hydraulic pressure to 2 bar to verify whether pcm has universal demulsification and oil water separation performance as shown in figure s8a a higher membrane flux 1800 l m 2h 1 was shown under the pulsed hydraulic pressure of 2 bar the positive charged high concentration of composite oil emulsion of petroleum ether can still be demulsified by pcm figure s8a insert and the process of demulsification is not affected by the investigated conditions therefore pcm for membrane demulsification may have some universality meanwhile the results of figure s8b f also show that pcm has a high oil water separation performance for petroleum ether emulsion the filtrate is transparent and includes very few coloured oil droplets figure s8b insert and figure s8f with a toc removal rate over 95 at different filtration times figure s8b in brief the pcm could utilize the inherent transmembrane pressure in the membrane process to achieve high oil water separation performance allowing synchronized demulsification to recycle different floating oil compared to the nonpcm moreover the pulsed pcm is expected to have a long single use service life of 120 min to maintain efficient demulsification and separation compared to state of the art membranes fig 3b table s1 he et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 3 3 potential demulsification and oil water separation mechanisms it has been proved in previous studies that o w emulsions could demulsify in direct current or alternating current field eow and ghadiri 2002 guha and varanasi 2019a as the electrostatic repulsive force is vital for stabilizing the emulsions thus reducing the surface potential barrier of oil droplets is necessary for demulsification ren and kang 2018 venkataraman et al 2013 the external high voltage power supply caused a high electric field intensity for droplet polarization and deformation leading to an effective elongation of droplets with thinning rupture of intervening liquid films he et al 2015 yang et al 2021 meanwhile it induced opposite charges on oil droplets and the aggregation occurred because of the electrostatic attraction between oil droplets luo et al 2016 yang et al 2021 the capacitive current created by double layers surrounding pcm can minimize the piezo charge induced by hydraulic pressure furthermore the faradic current promoted the surrounding electrochemical process by transferring the pcm surface charge to the surrounding aqueous systems starr et al 2012 zhong et al 2017 thus on account of the aqueous environment could screen the most generated piezoelectric signals and have an interference for electrical signals detection we employed the comsol simulation based on the finite element method to investigate the potential piezoelectric voltage under the operating hydraulic pressure of 1 bar the simulation for the in situ generated piezoelectric voltage which could be directly used on the surface of pcm reached 20 7 v fig 5 a far above the detection values of 3 2 5 6 v fig 3a in addition the comsol simulation results indicate that the voltage fig 5b and electric field intensity fig 5c of the detected 3 2 v are densely distributed on the surface of the pcm when an individual droplet was subjected to the pcm region a self generated in situ high electric field intensity of 7 2 107 v m distributed on the pcm which could demulsify the stabilized oil droplets fig 5c chokkalingam et al 2014 srivastava et al 2018 more importantly the potential generated piezoelectric voltage could be greater than 3 2 v fig 5a which implies that a higher self generated electric field intensity over 7 2 107 v m could be more effectively in situ used the pcm for demulsification functions as a membrane electrode but without the aid of an external electric field or power supply to timely repel the large size of oil after demulsification away from the membrane surface is necessary to ensure continuous demulsification and oil water separation an important oil water separation mechanism is dep which occurs when dielectric oil droplets are induced by an inhomogeneous electric field jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 ren et al 2021 on the basis of the observed pulsed time dependent voltage oscillations fig 3a the uneven pcm surface fig 2c and the simulated result of high local electric field intensity fig 5c a nonuniform electric field could be generated to drive dep the dep force acting on spherical particles is effective at causing particles to levitate or move it is independent of the surface properties of particles type surface charge etc and membranes hydrophilic hydrophobic surface charge etc jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 zhao et al 2019 the moving direction to a higher or lower electric field strength depends on the permittivity of the particles and the medium jung and kwak 2007 in this case the dep force is negative because the permittivity of oil approximately 2 3 is much smaller than that of the surrounding water medium approximately 80 thus large size of oil after demulsification can be repelled from the pcm electrode surface ensuring continuous demulsification and oil water separation jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 to evaluate and visually display the dep force comparisons acting on the oil droplets between pcm and nonpcm particle membrane surface interaction models were constructed using comsol software fig 5d e for the dynamic motion particles see movie s1 in supporting information the dep force simulation results of the pcm reached 1 26 10 13 n while no dep force occurred in the nonpcm indicating that the large size of oil after demulsification could be repelled away from the pcm surface at a detected piezoelectric potential of 3 2 v because the magnitude of the dep force is proportional to the diameter of oil droplets large oil droplets after demulsification are more likely to be repelled away from the membrane surface which ensures continuous demulsification performance kendall 1996 zhao and li 2018 apart from the dominant size screening effect of all the examined membranes the negative dep force repelled the oil away from the pcm surface which may explain why the rejection rate of pcm is slightly higher than that of the nonpcm group fig 4e straightforwardly the dep force direction arrows of oil droplets are overall opposite to the pcm surface in the dynamic membrane process fig 5e movie s1 which also accelerates the repelling of oil from the membrane surface overall the pcm for in situ demulsification and oil water membrane separation are dominated by two primary mechanisms 1 the local nonhomogeneous high electric field intensity for oil droplet polarization and deformation leading to the elongation of oil droplets with thinning rupture of intervening liquid films it also induced opposite charges on the adjacent oil droplets in the emulsion and caused aggregation of the oil droplets 2 negative dep force is more efficient at repelling large size of oil after demulsification away from the pcm surface ensuring continuous demulsification and oil water membrane separation this is advantageous over the traditional electrocoalescence of oil emulsions which indispensably relies on the additional external unsafe and energy consuming high voltage integrated with membrane processes thus the in situ pulsed hydraulic pressure induced piezoelectric membrane demulsification and dep separation mechanisms illustrated here can be useful for guiding the development and application of new demulsification and oil water separation membranes 4 conclusions in summary an inherent transmembrane pressure responsive pcm with an in situ nonhomogeneous high electric field intensity and dep force was designed and used as a feasible and effective membrane technology for demulsification and oil water separation this integrated membrane technology utilizes the inherent transmembrane pressure in the pressure driven membrane process to replace external high voltage or stimuli devices for the electrocoalescence of emulsions it saves valuable energy caused by the electrocoalescence process and avoids conductive modification of the currently used large numbers of non conductive water treatment membranes meanwhile the in situ pulsed hydraulic pressure induced membrane demulsification is safer and more effective which also reduces the subsequent processing of membrane concentrate chakrabarty et al 2008 van der bruggen et al 2003 the working mechanisms of continuously effective demulsification benefit from the locally high inhomogeneous electric field that causes the oil droplets polarization deformation elongation and finally aggregation in addition the negative dep force timely repels large size of oil after demulsification away from the pcm surface which also ensures continuous demulsification and membrane separation performances this research unambiguously demonstrates the feasibility of pcm driven by the inherent transmembrane pressure in powering a locally nonhomogeneous high electric field for stable oil emulsion treatment the environmentally friendly and energy saving pcm could have wide applications in wastewater treatment and may provide great implications for constructing demulsification membranes and understanding the demulsification and oil water

emulsions are classified based on the diameter of oil droplets as free oil 150 μm dispersed oil 20 150 μm and emulsified oil 20 μm kota et al 2012 oil emulsions could form in different types and oil in water o w emulsion is the most common emulsion in oil production by water flooding and transportation he et al 2015 conventional techniques have been proposed for removing oil from emulsions such as coagulation gravity separation or skimming and ozonation etc but most of them may not effectively separate oil in water particularly when the emulsified oil is finely dispersed and the size of oil droplets is below 20 μm kota et al 2012 tanudjaja et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 membrane based separation is the most effective solution for removing emulsified oil droplets with a size range of 1 10 μm tanudjaja et al 2019a ceramic membranes have high chemical and thermal stability low energy consumption and high removal efficiency are particularly suitable for harsh water treatment such as the separation of o w emulsions chen et al 2020 however the current mainstay membrane technologies based on size screening for oil water separation inevitably produce concentrated oil droplets in water without demulsification which may not effectively address the issue of oil recovery after membrane separation brunet et al 2009 qiu et al 2020 tanudjaja et al 2019b meanwhile some studies have reported that by endowing the membranes with special microstructures surface charges hydrophilic hydrophobic membrane surfaces or response to external conditions such as temperature light or electricity etc for demulsification or oil water separation ma et al 2022 xu et al 2015 unfortunately most of these reports involve complicated membrane fabricating processes and may cause secondary chemical pollution by introduction of the low surface energy of harmful fluorine containing polymers qiu et al 2020 besides increasing the membrane sensitivities to external stimulus conditions and the membrane lifespan still remain the fundamental dilemmas for the reported responsive membranes qiu et al 2020 there are many driving forces for oil demulsification such as electrical chemical or biological means he et al 2015 qiu et al 2020 which often integrate the membrane unit to achieve better oil water separation performances kwon et al 2021 li et al 2021 tanudjaja et al 2019a among these electrocoalescence is widely used and plays an important role in the breaking of oil droplets in emulsions guha and varanasi 2019b kwon et al 2021 ren and kang 2018 the electrochemical demulsification is driven by a high electric field and the stable surface charged oil droplets undergo inhomogeneous polarization and droplets deformation leading to the effective thinning and rupture of intervening liquid films he et al 2015 yang et al 2021 however coalescence of two oil droplets may require the unsafe and inconvenient high electric field intensity of 107 v m and voltage on the scale of kilovolt chokkalingam et al 2014 srivastava et al 2018 more importantly most of the membranes used for water treatment such as the inorganic ceramic membranes al2o3 zro2 tio2 etc or the organic polymeric membranes polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf cellulose acetate ca etc are non conductive padaki et al 2015 tanudjaja et al 2019a this brings integration difficulties in forming a high enough membrane electric field and may require applying an extremely high voltage of a few kilovolts which is also inconvenient and unsafe for operation electroresponsive membrane materials use external stimulus responsive materials as surface coatings or membranes which allow for in situ real time modification of the electric field on membrane surface for demulsification guha and varanasi 2019b ronen et al 2016 zhu and jassby 2019 nevertheless as electroresponsive membrane materials for the separation of oil water or emulsions demulsification the current reported studies require additional external power supply sources intimately coupled with pressure driven membrane processes which adds complexity to the system kwon et al 2021 li et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 for example electroresponsive membrane materials such as piezoelectric lead zirconate titanate pzt have been reported for oil water separation with the inevitable requirement of external stimuli power sources to generate ultrasonic vibration force mao et al 2018 mousa et al 2022 piezoelectric materials also possess the ability that allows mechanical forces to convert to electrical energy liao et al 2019 a potential envision may utilize pressure stimuli responsive membranes made from piezoelectric materials to induce an electrocoalescence of oil droplets response since the hydraulic pressure in pressure driven membrane processes is inherent ultimately the membrane in situ induces the force to generate electricity for the electrocoalescence of emulsions without the requirement of an additional power source or external driving force in this study a pcm was proposed and investigated for the demulsification of oil emulsion via a classical lead free piezoelectric material of barium titanium oxide batio3 transient pulses of hydraulic driving pressure were employed to stimulate the generation of a membrane piezoelectric demulsification response the predominant demulsification mechanisms are determined as the in situ generation of a high intensity of electric field followed by a negative dielectrophoresis dep force to ensure continuous demulsification and oil water separation more importantly the in situ demulsification method utilizes the inherent hydraulic transmembrane pressure as it requires no external high power supply is rapid and free of additional chemicals this novel pulsed pcm presents here may provide some hints for designing a vast range of efficient electrochemical membrane treatment systems toward practical applications in wastewater treatment 2 materials and

week he et al 2015 as described in figure s4 the demulsification and oil water separation tests were conducted in a laboratory scale dead end flow system equipped with a programmable logic controller plc panasonic fp xhc30t f that controlled the target hydraulic pressure by adjusting the motor speed rotation direction and running time of the peristaltic pump for example one cycle hydraulic pressure means that the operation pressure stepwise increased from 0 to 1 bar within 10 s leveled off for 70 s at 1 bar and then returned to 0 bar in 2 s before the next cycle in practice the pressure can be automatically and conveniently adjusted by operating the valves rather than changing the pump speed permeate fluxes during the experiments were automatically recorded by a digital balance connected to a computer 2 5 computational simulation piezoelectric outputs of the membranes were simulated by the finite element method fem using comsol multi physics 5 6 the physical field of the piezoelectric device was established in a three dimensional domain and the columned morphology models with a trim membrane size 15 mm in radius and 2 mm in thickness were built after which impact loading at a pressure of 1 bar was applied subsequently a stationary solver was used to obtain the piezoelectric voltage of the membranes under a pressure of 1 bar the two dimensional contours of the electric field norm and voltage distribution for the pcm were obtained by the ac dc module applying the detected voltage value of 3 2 v fig 3a to the pcm the dep force comparisons were conducted in the steady mode coupling the creeping flow and fluid particle tracking modules potential conditions were applied at the boundaries of the membrane material property data were provided by the built in database of the comsol multi physics 5 6 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization esem results in fig 1b and figure s5 show the sintered ceramic membrane possesses an uneven surface with a mean pore size of 0 19 μm figure s6 al2o3 particles with a higher sintering temperature could reduce the membrane distortion when sintering with the batio3 particles and were scattered in the membrane according to the eds elemental mapping results in fig 1b the sintered al2o3 batio3 ceramic membrane has a similar irregular pore structure fig 1b as the traditional ceramic membranes such as al2o3 zro2 etc or their modified ceramic membranes for water treatment which can potentially be used as a ceramic membrane for water treatment zhu et al 2019 the hydrophilic membrane surface with an underwater oil angle over 140 0 and a membrane porosity of 26 6 contributes to a comparable water flux of approximately 1050 l m 2h 1bar 1 of the sintered al2o3 batio3 ceramic membrane fig 2 b figure s7 zhu et al 2016 the solid state sintering of batio3 particles nonpcm and the corresponding starting raw materials were further confirmed by x ray diffraction patterns xrd fig 2a according to the xrd patterns the split between the peaks of 002 and 200 at 2θ around 45 indicates that the solid state sintered batio3 has the known piezoelectric tetragonal phase bansal et al 2006 xiong et al 2014 due to the melting point of the physicochemical stable al2o3 2000 c is higher than batio3 1600 c about 400 c a small amount of al2o3 scattered in batio3 could play the role of structural skeleton support thus could be used for anti deformation of membranes and improve the batio3 grains rearrangement and close packing fig 2a during high temperature sintering process kinemuchi et al 2006 the sintered nonpcm polarized at 2 5 kv mm makes the polarization direction along the electric field direction leading to membrane piezoelectricity which is referred to as the pcm saito et al 2004 electrical treatment may affect the morphology of the material surface by recrystallization effect or change of lattice parameter according to the previous reports wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the morphology changes were found on the membrane surface after poling treatment and the surface of pcm was more rough than the nonpcm about ra value of 300 nm fig 2c underwater oil contact angle represents the underwater oil adhesion of the membrane surface and the contact angles are all over 140 with limited variation in underwater oleophobicity before and after membrane poling fig 2b gao et al 2016 3 2 membrane demulsification and oil water separation performance constant hydraulic transmembrane pressure is not capable of inducing a piezoelectric voltage in the pcm according to the working principle of piezoelectricity thomann 1990 thus a periodic hydraulic pressure pulse from the operating pressure of 1 bar to 0 and back was performed figure s4 the periodic hydraulic pressure pulse could effectively induce the pcm in situ generating piezoelectric voltage oscillations between 3 2 v and 5 6 v while the nonpcm showed no detectable voltage signal fig 3 a meanwhile the voltage signals of the pcm faded away when the hydraulic pressure became stable fig 3a the pcm demulsification capacity is based on the rapid voltage oscillations generated by the hydraulic pressure pulse for further visualization oil droplets with a mean size of 2 8 μm fig 3c figure s3 in the feed solution were dyed using a lipid soluble dye of oil red o the pcm under the hydraulic pressure pulse has an effective and continuous performance of demulsification during membrane filtration in 2 h fig 3b and the initial oil droplets with smaller size in the concentrated solution became sufficiently large to float to the air water interface and formed a continuous oil phase for recovery fig 3f for comparison the pcm with a constant operating hydraulic pressure fig 3d or the nonpcm under pulsed hydraulic pressure fig 3e showed limited demulsification performance with negligible oil droplet size change but more particles occurred in the concentrate this also confirms the critical role of material polarization and pulsed pressure for in situ membrane demulsification song et al 2006 thomann 1990 in conclusion these results suggest that the electro responsive piezoelectric membrane of the inherent transmembrane hydraulic pressure pulse stimuli was demonstrated here for effective demulsification during membrane separation to investigate the oil retention performance of the membranes we applied the same dyed oil using a lipid soluble dye of oil red o thus the color of the filtrated water could directly reflect the retention effect of the membranes the fluorescence spectra of the feed solution and filtrate after 120 min are shown in fig 4 a d by comparing the feem spectra the mean size of the oil droplets 2 80 μm figure s3 and the membrane pores 0 19 μm figure s6 most of the oil droplets were removed via size screening in the filtrate among different filtration processes and membranes the toc removal efficiency was further evaluated to qualitatively assess oil removal performance under different conditions fig 4e the toc removal rates for all the investigated membranes were maintained above 98 after 120 min and no obvious oil droplets were observed in either clean filtrate fig 4f the above findings reveal that pcm possesses in situ demulsification and oil water separation properties however the demulsification and oil water separation performance may be affected by different oil kinds concentrations oil droplet surface charge and the pulsed hydraulic pressure we prepared a positive charged 2000 ppm petroleum ether dyed with oil red o emulsion modified by ctab and changed the pulsed hydraulic pressure to 2 bar to verify whether pcm has universal demulsification and oil water separation performance as shown in figure s8a a higher membrane flux 1800 l m 2h 1 was shown under the pulsed hydraulic pressure of 2 bar the positive charged high concentration of composite oil emulsion of petroleum ether can still be demulsified by pcm figure s8a insert and the process of demulsification is not affected by the investigated conditions therefore pcm for membrane demulsification may have some universality meanwhile the results of figure s8b f also show that pcm has a high oil water separation performance for petroleum ether emulsion the filtrate is transparent and includes very few coloured oil droplets figure s8b insert and figure s8f with a toc removal rate over 95 at different filtration times figure s8b in brief the pcm could utilize the inherent transmembrane pressure in the membrane process to achieve high oil water separation performance allowing synchronized demulsification to recycle different floating oil compared to the nonpcm moreover the pulsed pcm is expected to have a long single use service life of 120 min to maintain efficient demulsification and separation compared to state of the art membranes fig 3b table s1 he et al 2019 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 3 3 potential demulsification and oil water separation mechanisms it has been proved in previous studies that o w emulsions could demulsify in direct current or alternating current field eow and ghadiri 2002 guha and varanasi 2019a as the electrostatic repulsive force is vital for stabilizing the emulsions thus reducing the surface potential barrier of oil droplets is necessary for demulsification ren and kang 2018 venkataraman et al 2013 the external high voltage power supply caused a high electric field intensity for droplet polarization and deformation leading to an effective elongation of droplets with thinning rupture of intervening liquid films he et al 2015 yang et al 2021 meanwhile it induced opposite charges on oil droplets and the aggregation occurred because of the electrostatic attraction between oil droplets luo et al 2016 yang et al 2021 the capacitive current created by double layers surrounding pcm can minimize the piezo charge induced by hydraulic pressure furthermore the faradic current promoted the surrounding electrochemical process by transferring the pcm surface charge to the surrounding aqueous systems starr et al 2012 zhong et al 2017 thus on account of the aqueous environment could screen the most generated piezoelectric signals and have an interference for electrical signals detection we employed the comsol simulation based on the finite element method to investigate the potential piezoelectric voltage under the operating hydraulic pressure of 1 bar the simulation for the in situ generated piezoelectric voltage which could be directly used on the surface of pcm reached 20 7 v fig 5 a far above the detection values of 3 2 5 6 v fig 3a in addition the comsol simulation results indicate that the voltage fig 5b and electric field intensity fig 5c of the detected 3 2 v are densely distributed on the surface of the pcm when an individual droplet was subjected to the pcm region a self generated in situ high electric field intensity of 7 2 107 v m distributed on the pcm which could demulsify the stabilized oil droplets fig 5c chokkalingam et al 2014 srivastava et al 2018 more importantly the potential generated piezoelectric voltage could be greater than 3 2 v fig 5a which implies that a higher self generated electric field intensity over 7 2 107 v m could be more effectively in situ used the pcm for demulsification functions as a membrane electrode but without the aid of an external electric field or power supply to timely repel the large size of oil after demulsification away from the membrane surface is necessary to ensure continuous demulsification and oil water separation an important oil water separation mechanism is dep which occurs when dielectric oil droplets are induced by an inhomogeneous electric field jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 ren et al 2021 on the basis of the observed pulsed time dependent voltage oscillations fig 3a the uneven pcm surface fig 2c and the simulated result of high local electric field intensity fig 5c a nonuniform electric field could be generated to drive dep the dep force acting on spherical particles is effective at causing particles to levitate or move it is independent of the surface properties of particles type surface charge etc and membranes hydrophilic hydrophobic surface charge etc jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 zhao et al 2019 the moving direction to a higher or lower electric field strength depends on the permittivity of the particles and the medium jung and kwak 2007 in this case the dep force is negative because the permittivity of oil approximately 2 3 is much smaller than that of the surrounding water medium approximately 80 thus large size of oil after demulsification can be repelled from the pcm electrode surface ensuring continuous demulsification and oil water separation jung and kwak 2007 leunissen et al 2007 to evaluate and visually display the dep force comparisons acting on the oil droplets between pcm and nonpcm particle membrane surface interaction models were constructed using comsol software fig 5d e for the dynamic motion particles see movie s1 in supporting information the dep force simulation results of the pcm reached 1 26 10 13 n while no dep force occurred in the nonpcm indicating that the large size of oil after demulsification could be repelled away from the pcm surface at a detected piezoelectric potential of 3 2 v because the magnitude of the dep force is proportional to the diameter of oil droplets large oil droplets after demulsification are more likely to be repelled away from the membrane surface which ensures continuous demulsification performance kendall 1996 zhao and li 2018 apart from the dominant size screening effect of all the examined membranes the negative dep force repelled the oil away from the pcm surface which may explain why the rejection rate of pcm is slightly higher than that of the nonpcm group fig 4e straightforwardly the dep force direction arrows of oil droplets are overall opposite to the pcm surface in the dynamic membrane process fig 5e movie s1 which also accelerates the repelling of oil from the membrane surface overall the pcm for in situ demulsification and oil water membrane separation are dominated by two primary mechanisms 1 the local nonhomogeneous high electric field intensity for oil droplet polarization and deformation leading to the elongation of oil droplets with thinning rupture of intervening liquid films it also induced opposite charges on the adjacent oil droplets in the emulsion and caused aggregation of the oil droplets 2 negative dep force is more efficient at repelling large size of oil after demulsification away from the pcm surface ensuring continuous demulsification and oil water membrane separation this is advantageous over the traditional electrocoalescence of oil emulsions which indispensably relies on the additional external unsafe and energy consuming high voltage integrated with membrane processes thus the in situ pulsed hydraulic pressure induced piezoelectric membrane demulsification and dep separation mechanisms illustrated here can be useful for guiding the development and application of new demulsification and oil water separation membranes 4 conclusions in summary an inherent transmembrane pressure responsive pcm with an in situ nonhomogeneous high electric field intensity and dep force was designed and used as a feasible and effective membrane technology for demulsification and oil water separation this integrated membrane technology utilizes the inherent transmembrane pressure in the pressure driven membrane process to replace external high voltage or stimuli devices for the electrocoalescence of emulsions it saves valuable energy caused by the electrocoalescence process and avoids conductive modification of the currently used large numbers of non conductive water treatment membranes meanwhile the in situ pulsed hydraulic pressure induced membrane demulsification is safer and more effective which also reduces the subsequent processing of membrane concentrate chakrabarty et al 2008 van der bruggen et al 2003 the working mechanisms of continuously effective demulsification benefit from the locally high inhomogeneous electric field that causes the oil droplets polarization deformation elongation and finally aggregation in addition the negative dep force timely repels large size of oil after demulsification away from the pcm surface which also ensures continuous demulsification and membrane separation performances this research unambiguously demonstrates the feasibility of pcm driven by the inherent transmembrane pressure in powering a locally nonhomogeneous high electric field for stable oil emulsion treatment the environmentally friendly and energy saving pcm could have wide applications in wastewater treatment and may provide great implications for constructing demulsification membranes and understanding the demulsification and oil water
