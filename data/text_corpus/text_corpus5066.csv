25330,neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics are mechanisms that in theory influence biodiversity in this research we focus on simulated phytoplankton assemblages that are species supersaturated because of these mechanisms we investigate how various water column processes alter mechanism functioning and consequently biodiversity the water column processes on which we focus are extinguishing light availability with depth vertical diffusivity upward diffusive flux of nutrients from lower layers and or the benthos particle sinking and a rescue effect we explore the influence of these water column processes on phytoplankton biodiversity by characterizing assemblages α and β level richness and diversity previous work found that intransitive systems richness and biodiversity were more sensitive to hydraulic mixing and immigration than those of neutrality and lumpy coexistence with our expanded modeling framework our findings are similar in regards to α richness and diversity but have a more complicated story from the perspective of β richness and diversity where the influence of spatial heterogeneity arising from various water column processes is dependent upon the phytoplankton assemblage type keywords phytoplankton biodiversity light extinction vertical diffusivity nutrient flux sinking rescue effect 1 introduction ecologists have long been fascinated with species rich ecosystems with few limiting resources an interest famously epitomized by the paradox of the plankton hutchinson 1961 based on theory species competition for resources will lead to a number of co existing species not greater than the number of limiting resources if the system arrives at a steady state hardin 1960 therefore a solution to the paradox of the plankton occurs when environments fluctuate thereby preventing steady state conditions from arising and stopping competitive exclusion tilman 1977 1981 1982 sommer 1984 1985 grover 1989 environmental fluctuations might arise through various abiotic and biotic processes that change seasonally contributing to periodic cycling of plankton populations smayda 1980 ning et al 2004 roelke and spatharis 2015 environmental fluctuations can also result in protracted periods of transient population dynamics hastings 2010 or chaotic population dynamics may and leonard 1975 periodic transient and chaotic population dynamics can all facilitate species richness there are however other mechanisms leading to high species richness that do not involve environmental fluctuations driven by other processes narwani et al 2009 a condition coined supersaturated coexistence sensu schippers et al 2001 refers to species rich assemblages that maintain a number of species higher than the number of limiting resources under conditions where external processes do not drive environmental fluctuations mechanisms leading to species supersaturation include neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics neutrality refers to the co occurrence of species within a given trophic level that are nearly identical in their competitive abilities in other words they are ecological equivalents hubbell 2001 because of this competitive near equality multiple species can coexist over time scales relevant to ecology thereby allowing higher biodiversity examples of neutral communities in nature include co occurring species of wasps saez and lozano 2005 fungi bickford et al 2007 and trees mcgill 2003 neutrality might also be a mechanism underlying high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages pueyo 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 vergnon et al 2009 lumpy coexistence describes scenarios where there are co occurring and competing species clusters along resource gradients within a cluster coexisting species are very similar in their competitive abilities like that of neutrality but clusters are sufficiently different from each other that competition occurs between them following traditional niche theory scheffer and van nes 2006 examples of lumpy communities in nature include plants in mediterranean type ecosystems valiente banuet et al 2006 aquatic beetles drost et al 1992 and prairie birds holling 1992 lumpy coexistence might also explain highly diverse phytoplankton systems as well havlicek and carpenter 2001 scheffer and van nes 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 muhl et al 2017 where recurrent environmental fluctuations may facilitate the formation of species clusters sakavara et al 2017 intransitive population dynamics result when competition between co existing species is non hierarchical in such systems no single species can displace all other species instead recurrent and out of phase oscillations in the population dynamics occur huisman et al 1999 huisman and weissing 2001 roelke and eldridge 2010 because there is no winner over time in this competitive non hierarchy this biodiversity sustaining mechanism is often coined rock paper scissors coexistence coral reef invertebrates jackson and buss 1975 side blotched lizards sinervo and lively 1996 and european drylands and agricultural grasslands soliveres et al 2015 are a few examples of naturally occurring systems that experience high species richness through intransitive dynamics this could be yet another mechanism leading to high richness in phytoplankton assemblages huisman and weissing 2001 the effect of migration on simulated phytoplankton assemblages whose biodiversity was sustained by neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity was studied by roelke and eldridge 2008 they explored a plankton model where the influence of migration was a function of hydraulic mixing using a two patch modeling framework they found that immigration at very low levels led to global homogenization and species extinctions with intransitive assemblages being the most sensitive they suggested that the sensitivity of these supersaturated assemblages to immigration questions the role of neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity as biodiversity sustaining mechanisms in spatially heterogeneous environments the two patch modeling framework used in roelke and eldridge 2008 however might have been too simple to allow for source sink patches to develop which are known to facilitate biodiversity mouquet and loreau 2003 incorporating a more spatially complex modeling framework one where source patches of immigrants might be maintained would better enable exploration of these supersaturated assemblage types to immigration a more spatially complex modeling framework would also allow for other process to be simulated for example in a water column framework one dimension vertical extinguishing light availability with depth vertical diffusivity of turbulence nutrient flux from the benthos or from a deeper water mass particle sinking and rescue effects from adjacent waters can all be simulated light extinction with depth and vertical diffusivity are both known to influence phytoplankton assemblage composition huisman and weissing 1994 1995 weissing and huisman 1994 han et al 1999 litchman and klausmeier 2001 flöder et al 2002 flöder and burns 2005 as are the nutrient gradients that result from vertical mixing and the uptake of resources by phytoplankton cullen 1982 klausmeier and litchman 2001 some nutrients distributed in the water column originate from the benthos rowe et al 1975 nowicki and nixon 1985 and previous works have explored vertical distribution of phytoplankton as a function of both light and benthic nutrient flux mellard et al 2011 klausmeier and litchman 2001 huisman et al 2006 in addition phytoplankton vary in their sinking rates as a function of their cell size and shape and physiological condition bienfang 1980 huisman and sommeijer 2002 padisak et al 2003 which influences the vertical distribution of cells and thus the richness and diversity huisman et al 2002 hsu and lou 2010 peng and zhao 2016 finally mixing with adjacent waters have been shown to be important to phytoplankton richness and diversity richerson et al 1970 codeco and grover 2001 petrovskii and malchow 2001 mckiver et al 2009 adjou et al 2012 as mentioned above roelke and eldridge 2008 suggested that the sensitivity of supersaturated assemblages sustained through neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity might preclude those mechanisms from being common in spatially heterogeneous environments with intransitive assemblages being the most sensitive roelke and eldridge s 2008 two patch modeling framework would not have enabled the development of source and sink patches whose presence might increase resilience of these species supersaturated assemblages in this research we expand their modeling framework into a one dimensional water column with the aim to further investigate the sensitivity of phytoplankton assemblages governed by neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics to this one dimensional framework processes of extinguishing light vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary particle sinking and a rescue effect were added separately and in combination 2 methods 2 1 water column physical framework the physical framework of the model is a generic water column here 10m this model domain can either represent shallow waters coming into contact with the benthos at 10m or it can represent a surface layer with underlying nutrient rich waters we keep to a generic physical framework because our focus in this research is on the comparative sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages to physical processes not precise depiction of those physical process in specific systems within the model domain phytoplankton compete for three growth limiting resources parameterizations regarding the first resource is based on nitrogen which included loading half saturation coefficient for phytoplankton growth and cellular composition discussed further below parameterizations regarding the other resources are assigned comparable values and so should be viewed as other growth limiting resources expressed in units of nitrogen equivalents the model domain experiences hydraulic flushing that brings new nutrients from an external source and hydraulically displaces resident phytoplankton and dilutes ambient nutrients e g discharge from rivers from this physical framework six models are created with the following water column processes added 1 extinguishing light availability with depth 2 vertical diffusivity 3 nutrient flux from a lower boundary combined with vertical diffusivity 4 particle sinking 5 rescue effect combined with vertical diffusivity and 6 all five processes combined a conceptual diagram of the 6th model all processes combined is shown in fig 1 in that diagram light enters the water column from the surface and diminishes with depth based on in part phytoplankton concentration interactions between layers include vertical diffusivity and sinking of cells rescue effects are from an adjacent water mass e g open ocean source bringing new phytoplankton cells finally a nutrient source in addition to hydraulic flushing is flux from a lower boundary representing either the benthos or an underlying nutrient rich water mass 2 2 phytoplankton assemblages for this research we employ 30 phytoplankton assemblages used previously roelke and eldridge 2008 that self organized from species rich pools to a species supersaturated state the high species richness in 10 of these assemblages is sustained through neutrality high species richness in another 10 of these assemblages is sustained through lumpy coexistence in the final 10 assemblages high species richness is sustained through intransitive population dynamics fig 2 shows representative population dynamics of a neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages at a specific depth when influenced only by hydraulic flushing i e no light vertical mixing sinking lower boundary nutrient flux or rescue effects 2 3 simulation analyses the six water column models are used in simulation analyses to explore sensitivities of the three biodiversity sustaining mechanisms i e neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics for all simulations an assemblage of a given biodiversity sustaining mechanism is initially distributed in the top five meters of the model domain and another assemblage of the same biodiversity sustaining mechanism is distributed in the lower five meters when the simulation is complete discussed further below an additional simulation is performed using the same two assemblages in which the initial distribution of assemblages is switched that is the assemblage previously initiated in the top five meters is now initiated in the lower five meters and vice versa key life history traits for species comprising the assemblages are provided in appendix a in supplementary file in the appendix neutral assemblages are identified numerically with 1 10 following the pairing approach to simulations assemblages 1 and 2 are paired 3 and 4 are paired then 5 and 6 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 thus for neutral assemblages there are five pairs simulated each with two varying initial distributions of populations this same procedure is followed for lumpy identified numerically with 11 20 appendix a in supplementary file and intransitive identified numerically with 21 30 appendix a in supplementary file assemblages generating five simulations of paired lumpy assemblages and five simulations of paired intransitive assemblages and again with each having two varying initial distributions of populations after each simulation biodiversity is evaluated as α and β level richness and diversity discussed further below 2 4 model descriptions when all water column process are considered equations for phytoplankton n and resources s follow the

nutrient flux from a lower boundary is depicted 2 4 1 light extinction for our simulations considering light extinction combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading r ws and κ z in eqs 3 and 4 are set to zero thereby removing the effects of rescue sinking and vertical diffusivity in regards to estimating μ i and in addition to considering resource limitation we employ a commonly used mathematical formula that links reproductive growth rate to par platt and jassby 1976 platt 1986 light at any given depth eqs 6 and 7 is determined by light incident upon the surface layer and light absorbing properties of the water including absorption by pure water tripton and colored dissolved organic matter cdom as well as phytoplankton olivieri and chavez 2000 implementing this formulation enables self shading in the phytoplankton assemblage at high biomass concentrations klausmeier and litchman 2001 sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to light harvesting efficiency is evaluated by performing simulations where α i the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve for phytoplankton is either α i 2 86 10 17 4 59 10 17 or 6 32 10 17 cm2 s quanta 1 day 1 platt et al 1982 platt 1986 moigis 1999 the sensitivities for the varied biodiversity sustaining mechanisms i e neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics are then compared 2 4 2 vertical diffusivity for our simulations considering vertical mixing combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and r and ws are set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 thereby removing the effects of light rescue and sinking in the vertical diffusivity model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to mixing of cells and resources is evaluated by performing simulations where κ z 1 16 10 4 1 16 10 3 1 16 10 2 2 31 10 2 5 79 10 2 0 116cm2 s 1 when values were higher i e over the range of 2 31 10 2 to 0 116cm2 s 1 which is observed in lakes and deeper depths of the surface ocean li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 cronin et al 2015 our model domain is completely homogenized regardless of assemblage type so for our sensitivity analysis we focus on the lower diffusivity values i e 1 16 10 4 to 1 16 10 2 cm2 s 1 we note that these diffusivity values are equivalent to the mixing rates used in roelke and eldridge 2008 thus enabling direct comparison between our water column physical framework and the two patch modeling domain used previously 2 4 3 nutrient flux from a lower boundary with vertical mixing for our simulations depicting nutrient flux from a lower boundary combined with vertical mixing hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading again ai is very large and r and w s are set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 thereby removing the effects of light rescue and sinking as stated previously the lower boundary of our modeled domain can depict fluxes from nutrient rich deeper waters or from the benthos benthic nutrient flux into the water column has been explored in previous work within coastal waters and lagoon systems rowe et al 1975 nowicki and nixon 1985 using our nutrient flux model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables is evaluated by performing simulations with nutrient flux rates across the lower boundary of 4 16 41 6 and 416μmol m2 h 1 which are values typical of previous observations in temperate coastal lagoons nowicki and nixon 1985 here we incorporate vertical diffusivity of 1 16 10 4 cm2 s 1 without some level vertical diffusivity nutrients fluxing from the lower boundary layer would not propagate into the model domain we choose the lowest mixing rate from the vertical mixing model to minimize the effects of vertical diffusivity 2 4 4 sinking for our simulations considering particle sinking combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and r and κ z are set to zero thereby removing the effects of light rescue and vertical diffusivity in the sinking model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to particle sinking is evaluated by performing simulations where sinking rates of w s 0 22 0 5 and 0 7m day 1 are used huisman and sommeijer 2002 by investigating a gradient of sinking rates we can explore differential sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages 2 4 5 rescue effect with vertical mixing for our simulations considering a rescue effect combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and w s is set to zero in eq 3 thereby removing the effects of light and particle sinking in the rescue effect model populations are introduced from an adjacent water mass at low levels for this the initial species composition for the simulation is used for the phytoplankton sources in this adjacent water mass that is if assemblage 1 is in patches 1 5 and assemblage 2 is in patches 6 10 at the start of the simulation then assemblage 1 is present in the offshore waters for layers 1 5 and assemblage 2 is present for offshore waters for layers 6 10 the population densities in the adjacent water mass are ni o 0 64 106 cells l 1 which is similar to what would be expected for nanoplankton when expressed as chlorophyll in open ocean waters van de poll et al 2013 rescue rates explored here are r 0 001 0 01 and 0 1day 1 similar to the benthic nutrient flux model we again incorporate vertical mixing at a low rate of 1 16 10 4 cm2 s 1 2 4 6 combined processes in the all processes combined model we assume a trade off between our five processes commensurate with differences expected in a vertically well mixed region such as an upwelling area versus a stratified region for the simulations more representative of an upwelling region the highest parameterizations are used for the phytoplankton light harvesting coefficient assuming cells are adapted to more turbid conditions rate of vertical diffusivity nutrient flux and rate of particle sinking assuming cells are larger with increased nutrient availability while the lowest parameterization is used for the rescue effect populations arriving from the open ocean are minimized with the upwelling plume for simulations more representative of a stratified region the lowest parameterizations are used for the phytoplankton light harvesting coefficient vertical diffusivity rate nutrient flux and particle sinking rates while the highest parameterization is used for the rescue effect a third scenario is also explored where intermediate parameterizations of all processes are used the sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to these combined differences in water column processes are then evaluated and again differential sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages are explored 2 5 other parameterizations initial conditions numerical solution throughout our model domain initial phytoplankton populations and resource concentrations are 0 1 106 cells liter 1 and 10μm respectively all cells are assumed to be 8μm in length and 4μm in width forming an elliptical shape this size range falls into the nanoplankton 2 20μm category chosen to remain consistent with reported cell sizes in coastal waters bec et al 2005 2011 pecqueur et al 2011 phytoplankton half saturation coefficients ks and fixed cellular content for a given substrate qi j are the same as reported in roelke and eldridge 2008 and all values are within the range of what is typical for microalgae and pelagic environments grover et al 1999 reynolds 2006 hydraulic flushing is constant at h 0 25day 1 and concentrations of resources ssrc j in the inflow are 10μm these parameterizations and the gradients of parameters used in the sensitivity analysis are consolidated in table a1 in supplementary file to solve our model eqs 3 and 4 were spatially discretized by partitioning the 10 m water column into 10 layers of 1m depth as described in fig 1 each with assumed spatial area of 1m2 discretized equations are provided in appendix b in supplementary file all simulations are run for a period of 3000days this duration is to ensure that transient dynamics common in the early periods of these simulations do not influence biodiversity evaluations differential equation sets are solved numerically using ordinary differential equation solving routines that are a part of a commercial software package matlab from the math works inc the routines are based on fourth order runge kutta procedures and use a variable time step that is based on a local error tolerance set at 10 6 2 6 response variables to evaluate the sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages to the water column processes mean α richness mean α diversity β richness and β diversity are evaluated because β biodiversity measures are the differentiation between local patches its calculations are typically represented by the multiplicative format β γ α where γ is gamma diversity whittaker 1972 jost 2007 so although our analysis looks at α and β biodiversity measures γ level calculations are also necessary to determine β values for richness we use the simplest calculation of α γ and β the number of species in each patch and of the entire system respectively because of this richness is simply the number of species remaining after completion of a simulation if a population is greater than 0 01 106 cells liter 1 it is considered present for diversity at time t we use the shannon index shannon and weaver 1949 8 h t i p i t ln p i t where p i t is the proportion of total population density attributed to species i at time t we modify the classic shannon weaver index so that α diversity exp h t where h t is the shannon weaver index calculation for a given water column layer at time t γ diversity exp h t total where h t total is the shannon weaver index calculated over the entire water column and β diversity is γ diversity divided by average α diversity jost 2006 jost 2007 for all calculations the population densities are first averaged over the last 500days this accounts for population oscillations characteristic in the intransitive assemblages in the neutral and lumpy assemblages populations are near unchanging during the last 500days after running all simulations we calculate the averaged percent difference between biodiversity metrics for simulations using the lowest and intermediate key parameterizations for each model then we calculate the averaged proportional difference between biodiversity metrics for simulations using the intermediate and highest key parameterizations for each model the absolute values of these proportional differences are then used as a measure of sensitivity by neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages to a given water column process 3 results 3 1 sensitivities to changes in the photosynthesis irradiance curve in our simulations light becomes growth limiting with depth as biomass accumulates in upper layers of the water column and shades lower layers in the extreme phytoplankton populations cannot persist at depth the impact of light limitation with depth is more pronounced with decreased slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve these intuitive findings are not shown regarding α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities to changes in the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve fig 3 a c in these light extinction simulations intransitive assemblages show population dynamics that are aperiodic this finding parts from the periodic population oscillations observed previously for these assemblages roelke and eldridge 2008 interestingly the aperiodic population dynamics observed here become protracted as the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve decreases fig 4 this results in fewer populations being counted as present within the 500 day window used to quantify presence absence in our analysis technique in turn this leads to a greater α richness and diversity sensitivity of intransitive assemblages compared to neutral and lumpy assemblages regarding β richness sensitivities to changes in the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages are very similar to each other fig 3b d lumpy and intransitive assemblages had slightly higher β diversity sensitivity than that of neutral assemblages 3 2 sensitivities to changes in vertical diffusivity even at the lowest value of vertical diffusivity employed here which is much lower than what is observed in many large lakes and coastal oceans phytoplankton composition and biomass to the naked eye are nearly uniform throughout the water column by the end of our simulations this is true for all assemblage types fig 5 illustrates representative dynamics of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages with any particular layer of the water column overall α and β richness and diversity are low and as such are less sensitive to changes in vertical diffusivity rate fig 3 within this small range at low sensitivity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities in combined α richness and diversity fig 3a c and combined β richness and diversity fig 3b d to changes in the vertical rate of diffusivity 3 3 sensitivities to changes in nutrient flux from a lower boundary with vertical mixing as with sensitivities to changes in vertical diffusivity α and β richness and diversity sensitivities for all assemblage types are lower in response to changes in the benthic nutrient flux when compared to the other water column processes fig 3 fig 6 illustrates typical population dynamics for the bottom layer for a neutral lumpy and an intransitive assemblage overall low sensitivities occur because the low rate of vertical mixing employed for these simulations confines the impact of the nutrient flux to lower layers of the model within this small range at low sensitivity and in regards to α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages are more sensitive than neutral and lumpy assemblages all three assemblage types show similar sensitivities to changes in nutrient flux in regards to β richness neutral assemblages however become vertically homogenized at all levels of benthic nutrient flux rate consequently β diversity is not sensitive to changes in benthic nutrient flux as it is for intransitive and lumpy assemblages this demonstrates species and biomass distribution variability between patches within and between simulations yielding higher variability between diversity scores for intransitive and lumpy assemblages 3 4 sensitivities to changes in sinking rate regardless of the orientation of the two initial assemblages throughout the water column layers 1 5 vs layers 6 10 the assemblage initiated in the upper layers becomes the dominant species throughout the water column this occurs because of the persistent unidirectional migration of cells from upper layers to lower layers fig 7 illustrates representative population dynamics of all three assemblage types from lower layers of the model domain regarding α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities to changes in sinking rate fig 3a similar to previous scenarios changes in sinking rates result in protracted population oscillations leading again to fewer populations being counted as present within the 500 day window used to quantify presence absence in our analysis technique contrary to previous models β richness sensitivity of lumpy assemblage types is higher than that of neutral or intransitive assemblages for lumpy assemblages biomasses are below our presence cutoff threshold for a given patch but not below this threshold when considering the water column as a whole this is not the case for neutral and intransitive assemblages this leads to the higher sensitivity observed for β richness in lumpy assemblages 3 5 sensitivities to changes in rescue effect with vertical mixing different from what was observed in the previous models in our simulations with rescue effects from an adjacent water mass neutral assemblages are the most sensitive when considering α richness and diversity fig 3a c and β richness and diversity fig 3b d for all assemblage types when the rescue rate is intermediate or high local populations in each patch that were present initially are able to persist to demonstrate a representative neutral assemblage in the seventh layer is shown for low fig 8 a intermediate fig 8b and high fig 8c rescue effect for lumpy and intransitive assemblage types when the rescue rate is low local populations in each patch that were present initially are still able to persist for neutral assemblages when the rescue rate was low and intermediate invading species from the competing assemblage are able to establish themselves and displace resident species fig 8 3 6 sensitivities to changes in all processes combined recall that the three scenarios explored for the sixth model have concurrent changes in water column processes where the light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate progressively increases while the rates of rescue from an offshore water mass progressively decrease intransitive assemblage types have the highest α richness and diversity sensitivity among the three assemblage types fig 3a c fig 9 depicts a representative intransitive assemblage type in the seventh layer of the water column for each of the three sets of the scenario explored when light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate are at lower values and the rescue rate is at its highest value populations originating from the lower layers of the water column did poorly with populations accumulating the same low amount of biomass fig 9a oscillations are maintained in populations originating from the upper layers for this scenario the rescue effect is able to maintain the resident biomasses countering the homogenizing effect of vertical mixing and the press perturbation of sinking that would otherwise enable the assemblage originating in the upper layers of the water column to dominate however as rescue rate decreases and light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking increase fig 9b population dynamics in general began to become aperiodic and the homogenizing effects of the vertical mixing and the press perturbation of sinking overwhelm populations originating in the lower layers finally as rescue rate decreases and light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking increases and the rescue rate decreases fig 9c assemblages originating from lower layers have greater ability to overcome the effects of vertical mixing and sinking oscillations in invading assemblages return but resident population dynamics are aperiodic lumpy and intransitive assemblage types have slightly higher β richness sensitivity fig 3d for both these assemblage types populations originating from lower water column layers are able to persist when the rate of horizontal diffusivity of cells with an adjacent water mass is highest not shown and as discussed when nutrient flux from a lower boundary is highest resident populations can persist fig 9c but for neutral assemblages populations originating from lower water column layers are consistently less able to persist at any rescue rate this leads to neutral assemblages having a lower β sensitivity to changes in the combined water column processes 4 discussion findings from roelke and eldridge 2008 show that in a minimalistic spatial framework lateral mixing between two patches species supersaturation in neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages is fragile to immigration here using a more complex spatial framework of a water column patches stacked vertically where it is possible for source patches to be maintained we observe similar trends that is at levels of vertical diffusivity commonly observed in mixed layers of larger lakes and coastal oceans and even at diffusivities observed in the pycnocline li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 cronin et al 2015 our model domain quickly homogenizes this occurs because the balance of resource availabilities with the resource demands of co occurring species in these supersaturated assemblages is delicate easily disrupted by the arrival of an immigrant with differing resource demands roelke and eldridge 2008 this high sensitivity to immigration even in our more complex water column modeling framework continues to suggests that the incidence of spatial heterogeneity where neighboring assemblages are characteristic of high biodiversity sustained through either neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity might be rare in most aquatic systems or at least constrained to shorter periods we note however that in this study we do not depict horizontal spatial variability that might better enable persistence of assemblage source patches see bhattacharyya et al 2018 at low rates of vertical diffusivity much lower than reported in the li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 and cronin et al 2015 studies homogenization of populations does not occur through the entire water column and sensitivity differences to water column processes among the three assemblage types are discernable as mentioned before intransitive assemblages were previously shown to be more sensitive to immigration than neutral and lumpy assemblages roelke and eldridge 2008 most of our findings relating to mean α richness and diversity build on that notion in our results intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate this occurs because of the very specific life history trait trade off combinations required among co occurring species for intransitive assemblages and how they dictate a necessary timing of population oscillations and fluctuations in ambient resource concentrations to sustain species supersaturation when growth rates are altered by varying light availability or nutrient supplies or with arrival of immigrants through vertical diffusivity or sinking this oscillation timing is disrupted and diversity is lost other studies also support the idea that intransitive assemblages are fragile for example intransitive assemblages are shown to lose richness when vertical mixing is high in theoretical escherichia coli kerr et al 2002 and quickly lose diversity when migration between populations reach a certain threshold in generic theoretical populations reichenbach et al 2007a 2007b but not all our findings support the notion that intransitive assemblages are more sensitive than neutral and lumpy assemblages still in relation to mean α richness and diversity we observe that neutral assemblages are the most sensitive to variations in the rescue effect stated differently having a constant source of resident populations seems to increase the resistance to immigration from other layers of the water column for intransitive assemblages more so than neutral assemblages this finding is in agreement with field reports of plankton assemblages found in the atlantic that typically only fell into neutral dynamics when immigration rates were low chust et al 2013 the trends observed when considering mean α richness and diversity are not observed when considering β richness and diversity for example in simulations with nutrient flux from a lower boundary neutral assemblages are the most sensitive in regards to β richness and lumpy assemblages are the most sensitive in regards to β diversity however intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in light harvesting efficiency in regards to β diversity while neutral assemblages are the least further inconstancies are that intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in vertical diffusivity for both β richness and diversity lumpy assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in sinking for both β richness and diversity and neutral assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in rescue rates for both β richness and diversity finally when all water column processes are combined only neutral assemblages can be differentiated being least sensitive in regards to β richness from these diverse findings regarding β richness and diversity it is clear that the influence of various water column processes on the vertical distribution of co occurring populations comprising distinct assemblages will be dependent upon the biodiversity sustaining mechanism for those assemblages stated differently how species supersaturated neutral assemblages become distributed through the water column and whether they remain intact will be different compared to species supersaturated lumpy assemblages and species supersaturated intransitive assemblages indeed some research implies that hierarchal competition can actually be a stabilizing mechanism in diversity allesina and levine 2011 and in some cases promoted by spatial heterogeneity schreiber and killingback 2013 potentially these mechanisms are at play here the variability in sensitivity also aligns with oceanic fieldwork that emphasizes the importance of environmental heterogeneity to β diversity in planktonic systems alves de souza et al 2017 these results open the avenue to explore new questions relating to the robustness of these specific supersaturated system types in the context of β richness and diversity given simultaneous environmental heterogeneity 5 conclusions this work mostly agrees with previous works in regards to α richness and diversity but has a more complicated story from the perspective of β richness and diversity although it is important to continuously assess which model type better fits a given community we agree with the sentiments of leibold and mcpeek 2006 that future work should focus more as this paper does on looking at the perspectives of these different assemblage types rather than only developing techniques to fit experimental data with neutral or non neutral dynamics or distributed along the continuum between neutral lumpy and niche theory e g chesson 2000 pueyo et al 2007 or even developing rules that unify theories mcgill 2010 as emphasized by bradbury and vehrencamp 2014 and justified further by this research we cannot assume looking at small components of a system necessarily results in the larger system behaving in a way in which the small components are simply added together reductionism hence our results indicate very different interpretations between α and β sensitivities even though they are intimately related appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online

25330,neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics are mechanisms that in theory influence biodiversity in this research we focus on simulated phytoplankton assemblages that are species supersaturated because of these mechanisms we investigate how various water column processes alter mechanism functioning and consequently biodiversity the water column processes on which we focus are extinguishing light availability with depth vertical diffusivity upward diffusive flux of nutrients from lower layers and or the benthos particle sinking and a rescue effect we explore the influence of these water column processes on phytoplankton biodiversity by characterizing assemblages α and β level richness and diversity previous work found that intransitive systems richness and biodiversity were more sensitive to hydraulic mixing and immigration than those of neutrality and lumpy coexistence with our expanded modeling framework our findings are similar in regards to α richness and diversity but have a more complicated story from the perspective of β richness and diversity where the influence of spatial heterogeneity arising from various water column processes is dependent upon the phytoplankton assemblage type keywords phytoplankton biodiversity light extinction vertical diffusivity nutrient flux sinking rescue effect 1 introduction ecologists have long been fascinated with species rich ecosystems with few limiting resources an interest famously epitomized by the paradox of the plankton hutchinson 1961 based on theory species competition for resources will lead to a number of co existing species not greater than the number of limiting resources if the system arrives at a steady state hardin 1960 therefore a solution to the paradox of the plankton occurs when environments fluctuate thereby preventing steady state conditions from arising and stopping competitive exclusion tilman 1977 1981 1982 sommer 1984 1985 grover 1989 environmental fluctuations might arise through various abiotic and biotic processes that change seasonally contributing to periodic cycling of plankton populations smayda 1980 ning et al 2004 roelke and spatharis 2015 environmental fluctuations can also result in protracted periods of transient population dynamics hastings 2010 or chaotic population dynamics may and leonard 1975 periodic transient and chaotic population dynamics can all facilitate species richness there are however other mechanisms leading to high species richness that do not involve environmental fluctuations driven by other processes narwani et al 2009 a condition coined supersaturated coexistence sensu schippers et al 2001 refers to species rich assemblages that maintain a number of species higher than the number of limiting resources under conditions where external processes do not drive environmental fluctuations mechanisms leading to species supersaturation include neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics neutrality refers to the co occurrence of species within a given trophic level that are nearly identical in their competitive abilities in other words they are ecological equivalents hubbell 2001 because of this competitive near equality multiple species can coexist over time scales relevant to ecology thereby allowing higher biodiversity examples of neutral communities in nature include co occurring species of wasps saez and lozano 2005 fungi bickford et al 2007 and trees mcgill 2003 neutrality might also be a mechanism underlying high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages pueyo 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 vergnon et al 2009 lumpy coexistence describes scenarios where there are co occurring and competing species clusters along resource gradients within a cluster coexisting species are very similar in their competitive abilities like that of neutrality but clusters are sufficiently different from each other that competition occurs between them following traditional niche theory scheffer and van nes 2006 examples of lumpy communities in nature include plants in mediterranean type ecosystems valiente banuet et al 2006 aquatic beetles drost et al 1992 and prairie birds holling 1992 lumpy coexistence might also explain highly diverse phytoplankton systems as well havlicek and carpenter 2001 scheffer and van nes 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 muhl et al 2017 where recurrent environmental fluctuations may facilitate the formation of species clusters sakavara et al 2017 intransitive population dynamics result when competition between co existing species is non hierarchical in such systems no single species can displace all other species instead recurrent and out of phase oscillations in the population dynamics occur huisman et al 1999 huisman and weissing 2001 roelke and eldridge 2010 because there is no winner over time in this competitive non hierarchy this biodiversity sustaining mechanism is often coined rock paper scissors coexistence coral reef invertebrates jackson and buss 1975 side blotched lizards sinervo and lively 1996 and european drylands and agricultural grasslands soliveres et al 2015 are a few examples of naturally occurring systems that experience high species richness through intransitive dynamics this could be yet another mechanism leading to high richness in phytoplankton assemblages huisman and weissing 2001 the effect of migration on simulated phytoplankton assemblages whose biodiversity was sustained by neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity was studied by roelke and eldridge 2008 they explored a plankton model where the influence of migration was a function of hydraulic mixing using a two patch modeling framework they found that immigration at very low levels led to global homogenization and species extinctions with intransitive assemblages being the most sensitive they suggested that the sensitivity of these supersaturated assemblages to immigration questions the role of neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity as biodiversity sustaining mechanisms in spatially heterogeneous environments the two patch modeling framework used in roelke and eldridge 2008 however might have been too simple to allow for source sink patches to develop which are known to facilitate biodiversity mouquet and loreau 2003 incorporating a more spatially complex modeling framework one where source patches of immigrants might be maintained would better enable exploration of these supersaturated assemblage types to immigration a more spatially complex modeling framework would also allow for other process to be simulated for example in a water column framework one dimension vertical extinguishing light availability with depth vertical diffusivity of turbulence nutrient flux from the benthos or from a deeper water mass particle sinking and rescue effects from adjacent waters can all be simulated light extinction with depth and vertical diffusivity are both known to influence phytoplankton assemblage composition huisman and weissing 1994 1995 weissing and huisman 1994 han et al 1999 litchman and klausmeier 2001 flöder et al 2002 flöder and burns 2005 as are the nutrient gradients that result from vertical mixing and the uptake of resources by phytoplankton cullen 1982 klausmeier and litchman 2001 some nutrients distributed in the water column originate from the benthos rowe et al 1975 nowicki and nixon 1985 and previous works have explored vertical distribution of phytoplankton as a function of both light and benthic nutrient flux mellard et al 2011 klausmeier and litchman 2001 huisman et al 2006 in addition phytoplankton vary in their sinking rates as a function of their cell size and shape and physiological condition bienfang 1980 huisman and sommeijer 2002 padisak et al 2003 which influences the vertical distribution of cells and thus the richness and diversity huisman et al 2002 hsu and lou 2010 peng and zhao 2016 finally mixing with adjacent waters have been shown to be important to phytoplankton richness and diversity richerson et al 1970 codeco and grover 2001 petrovskii and malchow 2001 mckiver et al 2009 adjou et al 2012 as mentioned above roelke and eldridge 2008 suggested that the sensitivity of supersaturated assemblages sustained through neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity might preclude those mechanisms from being common in spatially heterogeneous environments with intransitive assemblages being the most sensitive roelke and eldridge s 2008 two patch modeling framework would not have enabled the development of source and sink patches whose presence might increase resilience of these species supersaturated assemblages in this research we expand their modeling framework into a one dimensional water column with the aim to further investigate the sensitivity of phytoplankton assemblages governed by neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics to this one dimensional framework processes of extinguishing light vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary particle sinking and a rescue effect were added separately and in combination 2 methods 2 1 water column physical framework the physical framework of the model is a generic water column here 10m this model domain can either represent shallow waters coming into contact with the benthos at 10m or it can represent a surface layer with underlying nutrient rich waters we keep to a generic physical framework because our focus in this research is on the comparative sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages to physical processes not precise depiction of those physical process in specific systems within the model domain phytoplankton compete for three growth limiting resources parameterizations regarding the first resource is based on nitrogen which included loading half saturation coefficient for phytoplankton growth and cellular composition discussed further below parameterizations regarding the other resources are assigned comparable values and so should be viewed as other growth limiting resources expressed in units of nitrogen equivalents the model domain experiences hydraulic flushing that brings new nutrients from an external source and hydraulically displaces resident phytoplankton and dilutes ambient nutrients e g discharge from rivers from this physical framework six models are created with the following water column processes added 1 extinguishing light availability with depth 2 vertical diffusivity 3 nutrient flux from a lower boundary combined with vertical diffusivity 4 particle sinking 5 rescue effect combined with vertical diffusivity and 6 all five processes combined a conceptual diagram of the 6th model all processes combined is shown in fig 1 in that diagram light enters the water column from the surface and diminishes with depth based on in part phytoplankton concentration interactions between layers include vertical diffusivity and sinking of cells rescue effects are from an adjacent water mass e g open ocean source bringing new phytoplankton cells finally a nutrient source in addition to hydraulic flushing is flux from a lower boundary representing either the benthos or an underlying nutrient rich water mass 2 2 phytoplankton assemblages for this research we employ 30 phytoplankton assemblages used previously roelke and eldridge 2008 that self organized from species rich pools to a species supersaturated state the high species richness in 10 of these assemblages is sustained through neutrality high species richness in another 10 of these assemblages is sustained through lumpy coexistence in the final 10 assemblages high species richness is sustained through intransitive population dynamics fig 2 shows representative population dynamics of a neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages at a specific depth when influenced only by hydraulic flushing i e no light vertical mixing sinking lower boundary nutrient flux or rescue effects 2 3 simulation analyses the six water column models are used in simulation analyses to explore sensitivities of the three biodiversity sustaining mechanisms i e neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics for all simulations an assemblage of a given biodiversity sustaining mechanism is initially distributed in the top five meters of the model domain and another assemblage of the same biodiversity sustaining mechanism is distributed in the lower five meters when the simulation is complete discussed further below an additional simulation is performed using the same two assemblages in which the initial distribution of assemblages is switched that is the assemblage previously initiated in the top five meters is now initiated in the lower five meters and vice versa key life history traits for species comprising the assemblages are provided in appendix a in supplementary file in the appendix neutral assemblages are identified numerically with 1 10 following the pairing approach to simulations assemblages 1 and 2 are paired 3 and 4 are paired then 5 and 6 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 thus for neutral assemblages there are five pairs simulated each with two varying initial distributions of populations this same procedure is followed for lumpy identified numerically with 11 20 appendix a in supplementary file and intransitive identified numerically with 21 30 appendix a in supplementary file assemblages generating five simulations of paired lumpy assemblages and five simulations of paired intransitive assemblages and again with each having two varying initial distributions of populations after each simulation biodiversity is evaluated as α and β level richness and diversity discussed further below 2 4 model descriptions when all water column process are considered equations for phytoplankton n and resources s follow the

nutrient flux from a lower boundary is depicted 2 4 1 light extinction for our simulations considering light extinction combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading r ws and κ z in eqs 3 and 4 are set to zero thereby removing the effects of rescue sinking and vertical diffusivity in regards to estimating μ i and in addition to considering resource limitation we employ a commonly used mathematical formula that links reproductive growth rate to par platt and jassby 1976 platt 1986 light at any given depth eqs 6 and 7 is determined by light incident upon the surface layer and light absorbing properties of the water including absorption by pure water tripton and colored dissolved organic matter cdom as well as phytoplankton olivieri and chavez 2000 implementing this formulation enables self shading in the phytoplankton assemblage at high biomass concentrations klausmeier and litchman 2001 sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to light harvesting efficiency is evaluated by performing simulations where α i the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve for phytoplankton is either α i 2 86 10 17 4 59 10 17 or 6 32 10 17 cm2 s quanta 1 day 1 platt et al 1982 platt 1986 moigis 1999 the sensitivities for the varied biodiversity sustaining mechanisms i e neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics are then compared 2 4 2 vertical diffusivity for our simulations considering vertical mixing combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and r and ws are set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 thereby removing the effects of light rescue and sinking in the vertical diffusivity model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to mixing of cells and resources is evaluated by performing simulations where κ z 1 16 10 4 1 16 10 3 1 16 10 2 2 31 10 2 5 79 10 2 0 116cm2 s 1 when values were higher i e over the range of 2 31 10 2 to 0 116cm2 s 1 which is observed in lakes and deeper depths of the surface ocean li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 cronin et al 2015 our model domain is completely homogenized regardless of assemblage type so for our sensitivity analysis we focus on the lower diffusivity values i e 1 16 10 4 to 1 16 10 2 cm2 s 1 we note that these diffusivity values are equivalent to the mixing rates used in roelke and eldridge 2008 thus enabling direct comparison between our water column physical framework and the two patch modeling domain used previously 2 4 3 nutrient flux from a lower boundary with vertical mixing for our simulations depicting nutrient flux from a lower boundary combined with vertical mixing hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading again ai is very large and r and w s are set to zero in eqs 3 and 4 thereby removing the effects of light rescue and sinking as stated previously the lower boundary of our modeled domain can depict fluxes from nutrient rich deeper waters or from the benthos benthic nutrient flux into the water column has been explored in previous work within coastal waters and lagoon systems rowe et al 1975 nowicki and nixon 1985 using our nutrient flux model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables is evaluated by performing simulations with nutrient flux rates across the lower boundary of 4 16 41 6 and 416μmol m2 h 1 which are values typical of previous observations in temperate coastal lagoons nowicki and nixon 1985 here we incorporate vertical diffusivity of 1 16 10 4 cm2 s 1 without some level vertical diffusivity nutrients fluxing from the lower boundary layer would not propagate into the model domain we choose the lowest mixing rate from the vertical mixing model to minimize the effects of vertical diffusivity 2 4 4 sinking for our simulations considering particle sinking combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and r and κ z are set to zero thereby removing the effects of light rescue and vertical diffusivity in the sinking model sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to particle sinking is evaluated by performing simulations where sinking rates of w s 0 22 0 5 and 0 7m day 1 are used huisman and sommeijer 2002 by investigating a gradient of sinking rates we can explore differential sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages 2 4 5 rescue effect with vertical mixing for our simulations considering a rescue effect combined with hydraulic flushing and nutrient loading ai is very large and w s is set to zero in eq 3 thereby removing the effects of light and particle sinking in the rescue effect model populations are introduced from an adjacent water mass at low levels for this the initial species composition for the simulation is used for the phytoplankton sources in this adjacent water mass that is if assemblage 1 is in patches 1 5 and assemblage 2 is in patches 6 10 at the start of the simulation then assemblage 1 is present in the offshore waters for layers 1 5 and assemblage 2 is present for offshore waters for layers 6 10 the population densities in the adjacent water mass are ni o 0 64 106 cells l 1 which is similar to what would be expected for nanoplankton when expressed as chlorophyll in open ocean waters van de poll et al 2013 rescue rates explored here are r 0 001 0 01 and 0 1day 1 similar to the benthic nutrient flux model we again incorporate vertical mixing at a low rate of 1 16 10 4 cm2 s 1 2 4 6 combined processes in the all processes combined model we assume a trade off between our five processes commensurate with differences expected in a vertically well mixed region such as an upwelling area versus a stratified region for the simulations more representative of an upwelling region the highest parameterizations are used for the phytoplankton light harvesting coefficient assuming cells are adapted to more turbid conditions rate of vertical diffusivity nutrient flux and rate of particle sinking assuming cells are larger with increased nutrient availability while the lowest parameterization is used for the rescue effect populations arriving from the open ocean are minimized with the upwelling plume for simulations more representative of a stratified region the lowest parameterizations are used for the phytoplankton light harvesting coefficient vertical diffusivity rate nutrient flux and particle sinking rates while the highest parameterization is used for the rescue effect a third scenario is also explored where intermediate parameterizations of all processes are used the sensitivity of the α and β level richness and diversity response variables to these combined differences in water column processes are then evaluated and again differential sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages are explored 2 5 other parameterizations initial conditions numerical solution throughout our model domain initial phytoplankton populations and resource concentrations are 0 1 106 cells liter 1 and 10μm respectively all cells are assumed to be 8μm in length and 4μm in width forming an elliptical shape this size range falls into the nanoplankton 2 20μm category chosen to remain consistent with reported cell sizes in coastal waters bec et al 2005 2011 pecqueur et al 2011 phytoplankton half saturation coefficients ks and fixed cellular content for a given substrate qi j are the same as reported in roelke and eldridge 2008 and all values are within the range of what is typical for microalgae and pelagic environments grover et al 1999 reynolds 2006 hydraulic flushing is constant at h 0 25day 1 and concentrations of resources ssrc j in the inflow are 10μm these parameterizations and the gradients of parameters used in the sensitivity analysis are consolidated in table a1 in supplementary file to solve our model eqs 3 and 4 were spatially discretized by partitioning the 10 m water column into 10 layers of 1m depth as described in fig 1 each with assumed spatial area of 1m2 discretized equations are provided in appendix b in supplementary file all simulations are run for a period of 3000days this duration is to ensure that transient dynamics common in the early periods of these simulations do not influence biodiversity evaluations differential equation sets are solved numerically using ordinary differential equation solving routines that are a part of a commercial software package matlab from the math works inc the routines are based on fourth order runge kutta procedures and use a variable time step that is based on a local error tolerance set at 10 6 2 6 response variables to evaluate the sensitivities of neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages to the water column processes mean α richness mean α diversity β richness and β diversity are evaluated because β biodiversity measures are the differentiation between local patches its calculations are typically represented by the multiplicative format β γ α where γ is gamma diversity whittaker 1972 jost 2007 so although our analysis looks at α and β biodiversity measures γ level calculations are also necessary to determine β values for richness we use the simplest calculation of α γ and β the number of species in each patch and of the entire system respectively because of this richness is simply the number of species remaining after completion of a simulation if a population is greater than 0 01 106 cells liter 1 it is considered present for diversity at time t we use the shannon index shannon and weaver 1949 8 h t i p i t ln p i t where p i t is the proportion of total population density attributed to species i at time t we modify the classic shannon weaver index so that α diversity exp h t where h t is the shannon weaver index calculation for a given water column layer at time t γ diversity exp h t total where h t total is the shannon weaver index calculated over the entire water column and β diversity is γ diversity divided by average α diversity jost 2006 jost 2007 for all calculations the population densities are first averaged over the last 500days this accounts for population oscillations characteristic in the intransitive assemblages in the neutral and lumpy assemblages populations are near unchanging during the last 500days after running all simulations we calculate the averaged percent difference between biodiversity metrics for simulations using the lowest and intermediate key parameterizations for each model then we calculate the averaged proportional difference between biodiversity metrics for simulations using the intermediate and highest key parameterizations for each model the absolute values of these proportional differences are then used as a measure of sensitivity by neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages to a given water column process 3 results 3 1 sensitivities to changes in the photosynthesis irradiance curve in our simulations light becomes growth limiting with depth as biomass accumulates in upper layers of the water column and shades lower layers in the extreme phytoplankton populations cannot persist at depth the impact of light limitation with depth is more pronounced with decreased slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve these intuitive findings are not shown regarding α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities to changes in the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve fig 3 a c in these light extinction simulations intransitive assemblages show population dynamics that are aperiodic this finding parts from the periodic population oscillations observed previously for these assemblages roelke and eldridge 2008 interestingly the aperiodic population dynamics observed here become protracted as the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve decreases fig 4 this results in fewer populations being counted as present within the 500 day window used to quantify presence absence in our analysis technique in turn this leads to a greater α richness and diversity sensitivity of intransitive assemblages compared to neutral and lumpy assemblages regarding β richness sensitivities to changes in the slope of the photosynthesis irradiance curve of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages are very similar to each other fig 3b d lumpy and intransitive assemblages had slightly higher β diversity sensitivity than that of neutral assemblages 3 2 sensitivities to changes in vertical diffusivity even at the lowest value of vertical diffusivity employed here which is much lower than what is observed in many large lakes and coastal oceans phytoplankton composition and biomass to the naked eye are nearly uniform throughout the water column by the end of our simulations this is true for all assemblage types fig 5 illustrates representative dynamics of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages with any particular layer of the water column overall α and β richness and diversity are low and as such are less sensitive to changes in vertical diffusivity rate fig 3 within this small range at low sensitivity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities in combined α richness and diversity fig 3a c and combined β richness and diversity fig 3b d to changes in the vertical rate of diffusivity 3 3 sensitivities to changes in nutrient flux from a lower boundary with vertical mixing as with sensitivities to changes in vertical diffusivity α and β richness and diversity sensitivities for all assemblage types are lower in response to changes in the benthic nutrient flux when compared to the other water column processes fig 3 fig 6 illustrates typical population dynamics for the bottom layer for a neutral lumpy and an intransitive assemblage overall low sensitivities occur because the low rate of vertical mixing employed for these simulations confines the impact of the nutrient flux to lower layers of the model within this small range at low sensitivity and in regards to α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages are more sensitive than neutral and lumpy assemblages all three assemblage types show similar sensitivities to changes in nutrient flux in regards to β richness neutral assemblages however become vertically homogenized at all levels of benthic nutrient flux rate consequently β diversity is not sensitive to changes in benthic nutrient flux as it is for intransitive and lumpy assemblages this demonstrates species and biomass distribution variability between patches within and between simulations yielding higher variability between diversity scores for intransitive and lumpy assemblages 3 4 sensitivities to changes in sinking rate regardless of the orientation of the two initial assemblages throughout the water column layers 1 5 vs layers 6 10 the assemblage initiated in the upper layers becomes the dominant species throughout the water column this occurs because of the persistent unidirectional migration of cells from upper layers to lower layers fig 7 illustrates representative population dynamics of all three assemblage types from lower layers of the model domain regarding α richness and diversity intransitive assemblages show the highest sensitivities to changes in sinking rate fig 3a similar to previous scenarios changes in sinking rates result in protracted population oscillations leading again to fewer populations being counted as present within the 500 day window used to quantify presence absence in our analysis technique contrary to previous models β richness sensitivity of lumpy assemblage types is higher than that of neutral or intransitive assemblages for lumpy assemblages biomasses are below our presence cutoff threshold for a given patch but not below this threshold when considering the water column as a whole this is not the case for neutral and intransitive assemblages this leads to the higher sensitivity observed for β richness in lumpy assemblages 3 5 sensitivities to changes in rescue effect with vertical mixing different from what was observed in the previous models in our simulations with rescue effects from an adjacent water mass neutral assemblages are the most sensitive when considering α richness and diversity fig 3a c and β richness and diversity fig 3b d for all assemblage types when the rescue rate is intermediate or high local populations in each patch that were present initially are able to persist to demonstrate a representative neutral assemblage in the seventh layer is shown for low fig 8 a intermediate fig 8b and high fig 8c rescue effect for lumpy and intransitive assemblage types when the rescue rate is low local populations in each patch that were present initially are still able to persist for neutral assemblages when the rescue rate was low and intermediate invading species from the competing assemblage are able to establish themselves and displace resident species fig 8 3 6 sensitivities to changes in all processes combined recall that the three scenarios explored for the sixth model have concurrent changes in water column processes where the light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate progressively increases while the rates of rescue from an offshore water mass progressively decrease intransitive assemblage types have the highest α richness and diversity sensitivity among the three assemblage types fig 3a c fig 9 depicts a representative intransitive assemblage type in the seventh layer of the water column for each of the three sets of the scenario explored when light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate are at lower values and the rescue rate is at its highest value populations originating from the lower layers of the water column did poorly with populations accumulating the same low amount of biomass fig 9a oscillations are maintained in populations originating from the upper layers for this scenario the rescue effect is able to maintain the resident biomasses countering the homogenizing effect of vertical mixing and the press perturbation of sinking that would otherwise enable the assemblage originating in the upper layers of the water column to dominate however as rescue rate decreases and light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking increase fig 9b population dynamics in general began to become aperiodic and the homogenizing effects of the vertical mixing and the press perturbation of sinking overwhelm populations originating in the lower layers finally as rescue rate decreases and light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking increases and the rescue rate decreases fig 9c assemblages originating from lower layers have greater ability to overcome the effects of vertical mixing and sinking oscillations in invading assemblages return but resident population dynamics are aperiodic lumpy and intransitive assemblage types have slightly higher β richness sensitivity fig 3d for both these assemblage types populations originating from lower water column layers are able to persist when the rate of horizontal diffusivity of cells with an adjacent water mass is highest not shown and as discussed when nutrient flux from a lower boundary is highest resident populations can persist fig 9c but for neutral assemblages populations originating from lower water column layers are consistently less able to persist at any rescue rate this leads to neutral assemblages having a lower β sensitivity to changes in the combined water column processes 4 discussion findings from roelke and eldridge 2008 show that in a minimalistic spatial framework lateral mixing between two patches species supersaturation in neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblages is fragile to immigration here using a more complex spatial framework of a water column patches stacked vertically where it is possible for source patches to be maintained we observe similar trends that is at levels of vertical diffusivity commonly observed in mixed layers of larger lakes and coastal oceans and even at diffusivities observed in the pycnocline li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 cronin et al 2015 our model domain quickly homogenizes this occurs because the balance of resource availabilities with the resource demands of co occurring species in these supersaturated assemblages is delicate easily disrupted by the arrival of an immigrant with differing resource demands roelke and eldridge 2008 this high sensitivity to immigration even in our more complex water column modeling framework continues to suggests that the incidence of spatial heterogeneity where neighboring assemblages are characteristic of high biodiversity sustained through either neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity might be rare in most aquatic systems or at least constrained to shorter periods we note however that in this study we do not depict horizontal spatial variability that might better enable persistence of assemblage source patches see bhattacharyya et al 2018 at low rates of vertical diffusivity much lower than reported in the li 1984 lozovatsky et al 2006 obrador et al 2014 and cronin et al 2015 studies homogenization of populations does not occur through the entire water column and sensitivity differences to water column processes among the three assemblage types are discernable as mentioned before intransitive assemblages were previously shown to be more sensitive to immigration than neutral and lumpy assemblages roelke and eldridge 2008 most of our findings relating to mean α richness and diversity build on that notion in our results intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in light harvesting efficiency vertical diffusivity nutrient flux from a lower boundary and sinking rate this occurs because of the very specific life history trait trade off combinations required among co occurring species for intransitive assemblages and how they dictate a necessary timing of population oscillations and fluctuations in ambient resource concentrations to sustain species supersaturation when growth rates are altered by varying light availability or nutrient supplies or with arrival of immigrants through vertical diffusivity or sinking this oscillation timing is disrupted and diversity is lost other studies also support the idea that intransitive assemblages are fragile for example intransitive assemblages are shown to lose richness when vertical mixing is high in theoretical escherichia coli kerr et al 2002 and quickly lose diversity when migration between populations reach a certain threshold in generic theoretical populations reichenbach et al 2007a 2007b but not all our findings support the notion that intransitive assemblages are more sensitive than neutral and lumpy assemblages still in relation to mean α richness and diversity we observe that neutral assemblages are the most sensitive to variations in the rescue effect stated differently having a constant source of resident populations seems to increase the resistance to immigration from other layers of the water column for intransitive assemblages more so than neutral assemblages this finding is in agreement with field reports of plankton assemblages found in the atlantic that typically only fell into neutral dynamics when immigration rates were low chust et al 2013 the trends observed when considering mean α richness and diversity are not observed when considering β richness and diversity for example in simulations with nutrient flux from a lower boundary neutral assemblages are the most sensitive in regards to β richness and lumpy assemblages are the most sensitive in regards to β diversity however intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in light harvesting efficiency in regards to β diversity while neutral assemblages are the least further inconstancies are that intransitive assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in vertical diffusivity for both β richness and diversity lumpy assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in sinking for both β richness and diversity and neutral assemblages are the most sensitive to changes in rescue rates for both β richness and diversity finally when all water column processes are combined only neutral assemblages can be differentiated being least sensitive in regards to β richness from these diverse findings regarding β richness and diversity it is clear that the influence of various water column processes on the vertical distribution of co occurring populations comprising distinct assemblages will be dependent upon the biodiversity sustaining mechanism for those assemblages stated differently how species supersaturated neutral assemblages become distributed through the water column and whether they remain intact will be different compared to species supersaturated lumpy assemblages and species supersaturated intransitive assemblages indeed some research implies that hierarchal competition can actually be a stabilizing mechanism in diversity allesina and levine 2011 and in some cases promoted by spatial heterogeneity schreiber and killingback 2013 potentially these mechanisms are at play here the variability in sensitivity also aligns with oceanic fieldwork that emphasizes the importance of environmental heterogeneity to β diversity in planktonic systems alves de souza et al 2017 these results open the avenue to explore new questions relating to the robustness of these specific supersaturated system types in the context of β richness and diversity given simultaneous environmental heterogeneity 5 conclusions this work mostly agrees with previous works in regards to α richness and diversity but has a more complicated story from the perspective of β richness and diversity although it is important to continuously assess which model type better fits a given community we agree with the sentiments of leibold and mcpeek 2006 that future work should focus more as this paper does on looking at the perspectives of these different assemblage types rather than only developing techniques to fit experimental data with neutral or non neutral dynamics or distributed along the continuum between neutral lumpy and niche theory e g chesson 2000 pueyo et al 2007 or even developing rules that unify theories mcgill 2010 as emphasized by bradbury and vehrencamp 2014 and justified further by this research we cannot assume looking at small components of a system necessarily results in the larger system behaving in a way in which the small components are simply added together reductionism hence our results indicate very different interpretations between α and β sensitivities even though they are intimately related appendix a supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online

25331,recent theoretical research suggested that species supersaturated phytoplankton assemblages sustained through neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity were sensitive to immigration quickly losing diversity following invasions the presence of source patches however may facilitate persistence of species supersaturation in the face of invaders we explore that notion here through simulation analyses of more detailed spatially explicit models depicting one and two dimensional systems pipe and two eddy models respectively where water circulation is governed over a range of advection and turbulent diffusion for the pipe model when advection and turbulent diffusion are low and when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low resident assemblages are more resistant to invaders but at intermediate rates of advection and with increases to turbulent diffusion assemblages are more quickly impacted by invaders for the two eddy model when advection and turbulent diffusion are low resident assemblages are again resistant to invaders but only for lumpy assemblages in contrast to the pipe model resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion are high for both model configurations intransitive assemblages were much more sensitive to invaders suggesting that intransitivity might not be as prevalent a biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems keywords biodiversity species supersaturation spatial heterogeneity circulation invasion 1 introduction in theory exclusion through exploitative resource competition will lead to a number of co existing species not greater than the number of limiting resources as systems approach equilibrium high species richness characteristic of many biological systems challenges this idea coined the paradox of the plankton hutchinson 1961 one solution to this paradox occurs due to fluctuations in the environment thereby preventing equilibrium conditions tilman 1977 1981 1982 sommer 1984 1985 grover 1989 environmental fluctuations can arise through various abiotic and biotic processes that change seasonally contributing to periodic cycling of plankton populations smayda 1985 nixon 1995 roelke and spatharis 2015 the effects of these fluctuations can also result in protracted periods of transient population dynamics hastings 2010 or chaotic population dynamics may and leonard 1975 both of these dynamic types can facilitate species richness however there are other mechanisms that are not externally driven that lead to high species richness narwani et al 2009 for example competition for nutrients can create internal disequilibria that can sustain high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages huisman and weissing 1994 in addition neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics the focus of this research are biodiversity sustaining mechanisms which occur in assemblages based on competitive abilities of co occurring species neutrality refers to the co occurrence of species within a given trophic level that are nearly identical in their competitive abilities and can be considered ecological equivalents hubbell 2001 with neutrality multiple species can coexist over ecologically relevant time scales promoting higher biodiversity neutrality was shown for biological systems of wasps saez and lozano 2005 fungi bickford et al 2007 and trees mcgill 2003 and might also be a mechanism underlying high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages chust et al 2013 roelke and eldridge 2008 where there are co occurring and competing species clusters along resource gradients the condition is referred to as lumpy coexistence scheffer and van nes 2006 with lumpy coexistence species with very similar competitive abilities co occur within a cluster the clusters however are sufficiently different from each other so that competition occurs between them example communities showing lumpy coexistence include wetland plants in mediterranean type ecosystems valiente banuet et al 2006 aquatic beetles drost et al 1992 and prairie birds holling 1992 in theory lumpy coexistence can explain highly diverse phytoplankton systems as well scheffer and van nes 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 when competition for resources between co existing species is non hierarchical intransitive population dynamics can result with intransitive assemblages no single species can displace all other species and recurrent out of phase oscillations in population dynamics occur huisman et al 1999 huisman and weissing 2001a b roelke and eldridge 2010 biological systems involving coral reef invertebrates jackson and buss 1975 side blotched lizards sinervo and lively 1996 and herbaceous dicots fortner and weltzin 2007 are examples of naturally occurring intransitive systems in theory intransitivity supports high richness in phytoplankton assemblages as well huisman and weissing 2001a b in a previous modeling study roelke and eldridge 2008 explored the effect of migration on phytoplankton assemblages whose biodiversity was sustained either by neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity they explored a plankton model where the influence of migration was a function of hydraulic mixing using a two patch modeling framework they found that immigration even at very low levels led to global homogenization and species extinctions from these observations they questioned the role of neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity as biodiversity sustaining mechanisms in natural environments the two patch modeling framework used in roelke and eldridge 2008 however might have been too simple to allow for source sink patches to develop which are known to facilitate biodiversity mouquet and loreau 2003 in this research we develop two models of greater spatial complexity thus enabling source sink patch development the models employ one dimensional and two dimensional horizontal frameworks with various hydrology the distribution of organisms in our models are subject to advection and turbulent diffusion in advection the nutrients and the embedded phytoplankton cells are carried with the movement of water in turbulent diffusion the spatial mixing of nutrients and phytoplankton of adjacent patches occurs without a net overall transport of water advection and turbulent diffusion were shown to be important to phytoplankton richness and diversity codeco and grover 2001 petrovskii and malchow 2001 mckiver et al 2009 adjou et al 2012 here we explored these over spatial scales 100 km with 10 km2 areal resolution and at turbulent diffusion rates characteristic of large lakes bays and coastal oceans we employ one and two dimensional model frameworks our one dimensional model framework is best visualized as two pipes coming together at an outlet where flow through the pipes are advection and turbulent diffusion based fig 1 our two dimensional model framework is best visualized as two confined eddies that are in contact rotating in opposite directions and again with advective and turbulent diffusive flow fig 2 through simulation analyses we explore and compare the resistance of phytoplankton assemblage source patches initiated with neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages under varied hydraulic conditions 2

species 106 cells l 1 respectively in the k th patch at time t the rate of flushing and the rate of mixing between two adjacent patches are taken as d and d day 1 respectively these are discussed in detail further below the specific growth rate for the j th phytoplankton species in the k th patch is determined using the monod equation monod 1949 and liebig s law of the minimum liebig 1840 and is given by μ j k μ max j m i n i r i k a i j r i k where μ max j is the maximum specific growth rate day 1 of species j and a i j is the half saturation coefficient μm of species j growing on the substrate i here we use the notation a instead of the traditional notation k s for convenience with subscript appending finally q i j is the fixed cellular content of resource i μm 106 cells 1 for species j for our one dimensional physical framework we define the system as having an odd number 2n 1 of interconnecting patches out of which the direction of advection in the first and the last patches are pointed towards each other fig 1 in addition the n 1 th patch which receives advection originating from the first and last patches has an advection rate twice the rate of advection of all the other patches also there is a constant inflow to the first and last patches bringing new nutrients r i i n to the system finally the first and last patch only contain the initial phytoplankton assemblages described further below as the simulation proceeds these source assemblages disperse by means of advection and turbulent diffusion the one dimensional model is governed by sets of discretized ordinary differential equations necessary for representing both end member patches 1 st and 2n 1 th the central patch n 1 th and patches in between 2 nd n th n 2 th 2n th the rate of change of the nutrients in each of the patches is dependent on the advection driven nutrient input and flushing rate turbulent diffusion driven nutrient mixing rate with adjacent patches and nutrient consumption rate by phytoplankton the rate of change of the phytoplankton density in each of the patches is dependent on the growth rate of phytoplankton advection driven hydraulic displacement of

model framework we define the model domain as two eddies in contact one rotating clockwise and the other rotating counter clockwise fig 2 the patches of this modeling framework are of hexagonal geometry in this two dimensional model framework there are 2n number of circulation rings about each of the eddy cores patches a and b the indexing of the circulation rings start from the closest ring to the core of the eddy there are a total 2 2n 1 8n 1 patches in our two dimensional model framework represented by a grid with 2 2n 1 rows and 8n 1 columns each of the patches has a constant upward diffusion of nutrients r i i n by means of an assumed uniform vertical mixing at a rate v day 1 the sinking of phytoplankton species in each of the patches is also uniform at the rate v day 1 finally the patches a and b have the initial phytoplankton assemblages which spread to the adjacent patches by means of advection and turbulent diffusion in our two dimensional model r i k l t and p j k l t represent the concentration of the growth limiting i th resource μm and the population density of j th phytoplankton species 106 cells l 1 respectively in the patch k l at time t as with the one dimensional pipe model here the rate of change of the nutrients in each of the patches is dependent on advection driven nutrient input and flushing rate turbulent diffusion driven nutrient mixing rate

comprising phytoplankton assemblages in the initial condition was 0 1 106 cells liter 1 in patches 1 and 2n 1 for the one dimensional model and patches a and b for the two dimensional model all other patches in both models had zero phytoplankton initially initial resource concentrations in all patches was 10 μm for this research we have considered speciose assemblages each of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblage types roelke and eldridge 2008 for the one and two dimensional frameworks simulations are based on all possible combinations of assemblages chosen two at a time from a similar assemblage biodiversity type i e either neutral lumpy or intransitive there are 10 assemblages per assemblage biodiversity type thus there are 45 assemblage combinations for each 135 total assemblage combinations when considering all three assemblage diversity types the maximum specific growth rate μ max j of each phytoplankton species is taken as 1 day 1 the values of a i j and q i j were provided in roelke and eldridge 2008 for this research we have considered three resources where assigned values to parameters associated with the first resource r a and q are based on nitrogen and assigned values to parameters associated with the other two resources are considered as nitrogen equivalents for our simulation analyses we examined how source patch diversity is influenced by different rates of advection and turbulent diffusion the range of advection used in our simulations is from 0 to 1 day 1 not exceeding the maximum specific growth rate of phytoplankton species when considering 10 km2 patches with 3 162 km distances between central locations this range in advection rate is 0 0 1318 km h 1 the rates of turbulent diffusion explored here range from 0 05 to 0 3 d 1 which equates to 5 787 104 cm2 s 1 to 3 472 105 cm2 s 1 when considering 10 km2 areas of patches in the pipe configuration of the model and 5 012 104 cm2 s 1 to 3 007 105 cm2 s 1 when considering 8 660 km2 areas of patches in the two eddy configuration of the model still with 3 162 km distances between central locations these rates of turbulent diffusion are typical in large lakes bays and coastal oceans okubo 1971 peeters and hofmann 2015 matsuzaki and fujita 2017 peclet number pe a dimensionless measure of advection to turbulent diffusion over a target distance was as low as 0 in our simulations where there was no advection and as high as 20 for the pipe configuration at our highest advection rate and lowest turbulent diffusion rate and as high as 23 for the two eddy configuration at our highest advection rate and lowest turbulent diffusion rate this range in pe spans hydraulic conditions where delivery of nutrients to phytoplankton via fluid motion becomes increasingly important relative to diffusive flux alone i e pe 1 reynolds 2006 for the one dimensional framework we have considered 11 interconnecting patches n 5 whereas for the two dimensional treatment a total 170 patches are considered n 2 in 10 rows and 17 columns with four circulation rings about the eddy cores we employed numerical techniques to solve the mathematical equations of our one and two dimensional models using matlab ode solving routines based on fourth order runge kutta procedures with a variable time step based on a local error tolerance of 10 6 2 4 response variable we examine the change in diversity with time in each of the source patches as estimated according to shannon s diversity index shannon and weaver 1949 for the one dimensional model framework the shannon diversity index in source patch at day t is given by h t j p j t l n p j t where pj is the proportion the species j to the total phytoplankton to objectively quantify the amount of time until a resident phytoplankton assemblage became compromised by invaders we used the rate of change in diversity of the source patch we decided this approach after qualitatively observing diversity collapses in various simulations whose onset could be seen just after source patch diversity peaked to quantify we use a five point formula to determine the derivative of the diversity curve h k t from the source patch the set ω k t 0 t r f k t f k t 1 0 t t 0 represented the days after the initial t 0 days when there are changes in curvature of h k t where f k t h k t 2 8 h k t 1 8 h k t 1 h k t 2 12 the change in curvature of the diversity curve just after the initial t 0 days is given by t k in f ω k t 0 where t k exists if and only if ω k t 0 ϕ if ω k t 0 ϕ then the value of t k is set equal to the upper time limit of the model simulations if p j k r and p j k i represent the resident and invader species respectively in the source patch k where p j k p j k r p j k i then the total invader biomass at the t k th day is given by p k i σ j p j k i for all 45 different combinations of neutral assemblages we obtain a set of t k in days together with a set of total invader biomass p k i n e u t r a l 106 cells liter 1 the average of these values gives the number of days taken by the neutral assemblages after the initial t 0 days of simulation to lose its integrity and the corresponding average invader biomass for the 45 lumpy assemblage combinations we use the same procedure to find the average number of days after the initial t 0 days when there is a change in orientation of the diversity curve and the corresponding average invader biomass the average invader biomass in neutral and lumpy assemblages is given by p k a v g i 1 2 p k i n e u t r a l p k i l u m p y 10 c 2 since the 45 intransitive assemblage combinations have oscillatory dynamics we use p k a v g i as the threshold to find the average number of days taken by the total invader biomass of intransitive assemblages to cross the threshold value for the two dimensional model framework we use the same approach to find the average number of days taken by the three types of assemblages to start losing their identity due to the invaders 3 results resident phytoplankton assemblages in the source patches became compromised by invaders regardless of assemblage type but the assemblage types differed in how long that period was before becoming compromised in general neutral and lumpy assemblages in source patches took the longest amount of time to become compromised representative simulations are shown in fig 3 a and b the population dynamics were similar as well with smooth changes that asymptotically approached maxima or minima or changes that peaked before declining fig 3d and e in contrast intransitive assemblages in source patches took the shortest amount of time representative simulation shown in fig 3c with erratic population dynamics quickly approaching towards maxima or minima or towards a maximum before declining fig 3f for the pipe configuration of the model the period of time until assemblages became compromised by invaders varied as a function of hydrology but differentially between the assemblage types for example neutral assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when advection and turbulent diffusion were low and when advection was high and turbulent diffusion low both 1000 days fig 4 a otherwise the period of time until assemblages became compromised was 500 days lumpy assemblages in general showed greater resistance to invaders when turbulent diffusion was low regardless of advection with the period of time until assemblages became compromised ranging between 1000 to 1400 days fig 4b as turbulent diffusion increased lumpy assemblages became compromised more quickly taking 250 days when advection was low and 500 days when advection was high intransitive assemblages showed a trend similar to neutral assemblages but less pronounced with maxima and minima until assemblages became compromised by invaders with times of 600 and 400 days respectively fig 4c regardless of assemblage type nutrient concentrations in source patches were at their maxima i e 10 μm when advection was highest and turbulent diffusion lowest which is the value of nutrient concentrations in the sources and asymptotically decreased to minima 0 1 μm when advection was low not shown for the two eddy configuration of the model the period of time until assemblages became compromised by invaders again varied as a function of hydrology and again differentially between the assemblage types for this model configuration neutral assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when advection and turbulent diffusion were higher 600 days fig 5 a the period of time until neutral assemblages became compromised was least when turbulent diffusion was low ranging between 275 and 300 days lumpy assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when turbulent diffusion and advection were low and when turbulent diffusion and advection were high 400 days fig 5b the period of time until lumpy assemblages became compromised was least when turbulent diffusion was low and advection high 225 days as with the pipe configuration of the model intransitive assemblages showed the greatest sensitivity to invaders in the two eddy configuration there was little difference in the times until assemblages became compromised however which was 150 days at all combinations of advection and turbulent diffusion fig 5c regardless of assemblage type advection rate and turbulent diffusion rate nutrient concentrations in source patches were depleted 0 1 μm not shown 4 discussion for the pipe configuration of the model resident assemblages in the source patches are more resistant to invaders at the lowest and at higher advection rates and when turbulent diffusion rates are low interestingly at intermediate rates of advection and while turbulent diffusion is low resident assemblages are less resistant to invasions this was true for all assemblage types this trend at low turbulent diffusion rates occurs because as advection rate increases from a low value greater hydraulic displacement of residents leads to lower biomass of resident populations in turn this leads to greater concentrations of nutrients thereby lessening competitive advantages established residents might have had over invaders this then facilitates invasions even as invaders originating from a downstream location must overcome a stronger current but as advection rates further increase from intermediate to higher values invaders become less able to overcome currents even though nutrient concentrations in the source patch continue to increase with further decreases in biomass of residents invaders are simply unable to arrive there in significant numbers and resistance of resident assemblages increases so there is an interplay between advection and turbulent diffusion rate in the pipe configuration of the model where at low rates of turbulent diffusion an intermediate level of advection best facilitates invasion our findings from the pipe configuration of the model are consistent in part with findings from others for example increased nutrient loadings with increased hydraulic displacements were shown to stimulate accumulation of downstream invader biomass in a model of similar configuration grover et al 2017 our findings showing poorer invasion success when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low have also been observed in other models of similar configuration lutscher et al 2005 grover et al 2011 2017 in those models increasing advection rates served as a mechanism preventing accumulation of downstream invader populations those models however depicted unidirectional advection throughout the model domain and employed hydraulic storage zones or source populations neither of which are used here the persistence of resident populations at higher advection rates in our model was due to sustained higher growth rates that occur with the higher nutrient loading rates which has been described previously reynolds 1990 grover et al 2009 hsu et al 2013 our observation that assemblages become less resistant to downstream invaders as turbulent diffusion increases is also consistent with previous work grover et al 2017 for the two eddy configuration of the model when advection and turbulent diffusion rates are low resident assemblages in source patches are again resistant to invaders but only for lumpy assemblages this is different from the pipe configuration of the model also in contrast to the pipe configuration model resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion rates are high factors leading to persistence of populations within circulating gyres as depicted by our simulated eddies show that circular advection and turbulent diffusion processes in combination lead to ageostrophic patterns that serve to retain populations within gyres when particles are positively buoyant zhong et al 2012 beron vera et al 2015 here our particles are not positively buoyant but our imposed sinking rate is not in excess of realized reproductive growth rates the result is the same in that resident populations are retained within eddies at higher rates of circular advection and turbulent diffusion which leads to greater resistance to invaders but again only for neutral and lumpy phytoplankton assemblages our findings show that resistance to invaders for neutral and lumpy assemblages are strongly dependent on the flow configurations intransitive assemblages in the pipe configuration of the model are also dependent on the flow configurations but less so in both configurations of the model intransitive assemblages were more sensitive to invaders and unable to maintain source patches the underpinning mechanism of high species diversity in intransitive phytoplankton assemblages that is intrinsic disturbances sustained by and promulgating species interactions huisman and weissing 1999 2001a b were shown to require peculiar circumstances in regards to life history traits of co occurring species and hydraulic conditions schippers et al 2001 roelke et al 2003 roelke and eldridge 2008 2010 when those circumstances were violated species diversity was lost those previous studies however were not of a configuration where source patches were depicted because they lacked adequate spatial domains here we show that with a more complex spatial domain and over a wide range of hydrological conditions where source patches could be sustained intransitive assemblages are still quite sensitive to invasions 5 conclusions our observations along with those of roelke and eldridge 2008 suggest that intransitivity should not be a prevalent biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems as it is much more sensitive to invaders than either neutrality or lumpy coexistence on the other hand neutral and lumpy coexistence mechanisms are more robust suggesting a higher probability that they are biodiversity mechanisms in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems in fact in a recent modeling study spatially homogeneous it was shown that differences in nutrient supply fluctuation periodicities determined whether phytoplankton assemblages were comprised of near neutral species or in species clusters along a temporally varying niche sakavara et al 2017 in addition a forthcoming analysis of plankton from eight lakes revealed persistence of species clusters in phytoplankton assemblages muhl et al 2017 we note however that even with our greater spatial complexity in this research effort it may be that our modeling framework is still too simple to rule out intransitivity as a biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous phytoplankton systems there are likely other processes influential that are not depicted here for example recently it was shown that interacting processes of light extinction vertical mixing particle sinking and benthic nutrient flux showed certain scenarios where the β richness and β diversity of intransitive assemblages are more resistant to environmental changes than for neutral or lumpy assemblages withrow et al 2018 similarly in the muhl et al 2017 study mentioned above it was shown that intransitive assemblages are more resistant to allelopathic interactions than either neutral or lumpy assemblages suggesting another condition by which intransitive assemblages might occur in spatially heterogeneous plankton environments so we can conclude from observations in the present study combined with observations from these other studies that when a system is primarily driven by two dimensional hydrology and exploitative competition the incidence of supersaturated assemblages governed by intransitivity is less likely than the incidence of supersaturated assemblages governed by either neutrality or lumpy coexistence this is not to say that speciose phytoplankton assemblages sustained by intransitivity do not occur in nature as there are other environmental conditions and types of species interactions that may facilitate them 
25331,recent theoretical research suggested that species supersaturated phytoplankton assemblages sustained through neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity were sensitive to immigration quickly losing diversity following invasions the presence of source patches however may facilitate persistence of species supersaturation in the face of invaders we explore that notion here through simulation analyses of more detailed spatially explicit models depicting one and two dimensional systems pipe and two eddy models respectively where water circulation is governed over a range of advection and turbulent diffusion for the pipe model when advection and turbulent diffusion are low and when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low resident assemblages are more resistant to invaders but at intermediate rates of advection and with increases to turbulent diffusion assemblages are more quickly impacted by invaders for the two eddy model when advection and turbulent diffusion are low resident assemblages are again resistant to invaders but only for lumpy assemblages in contrast to the pipe model resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion are high for both model configurations intransitive assemblages were much more sensitive to invaders suggesting that intransitivity might not be as prevalent a biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems keywords biodiversity species supersaturation spatial heterogeneity circulation invasion 1 introduction in theory exclusion through exploitative resource competition will lead to a number of co existing species not greater than the number of limiting resources as systems approach equilibrium high species richness characteristic of many biological systems challenges this idea coined the paradox of the plankton hutchinson 1961 one solution to this paradox occurs due to fluctuations in the environment thereby preventing equilibrium conditions tilman 1977 1981 1982 sommer 1984 1985 grover 1989 environmental fluctuations can arise through various abiotic and biotic processes that change seasonally contributing to periodic cycling of plankton populations smayda 1985 nixon 1995 roelke and spatharis 2015 the effects of these fluctuations can also result in protracted periods of transient population dynamics hastings 2010 or chaotic population dynamics may and leonard 1975 both of these dynamic types can facilitate species richness however there are other mechanisms that are not externally driven that lead to high species richness narwani et al 2009 for example competition for nutrients can create internal disequilibria that can sustain high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages huisman and weissing 1994 in addition neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitive population dynamics the focus of this research are biodiversity sustaining mechanisms which occur in assemblages based on competitive abilities of co occurring species neutrality refers to the co occurrence of species within a given trophic level that are nearly identical in their competitive abilities and can be considered ecological equivalents hubbell 2001 with neutrality multiple species can coexist over ecologically relevant time scales promoting higher biodiversity neutrality was shown for biological systems of wasps saez and lozano 2005 fungi bickford et al 2007 and trees mcgill 2003 and might also be a mechanism underlying high species richness in phytoplankton assemblages chust et al 2013 roelke and eldridge 2008 where there are co occurring and competing species clusters along resource gradients the condition is referred to as lumpy coexistence scheffer and van nes 2006 with lumpy coexistence species with very similar competitive abilities co occur within a cluster the clusters however are sufficiently different from each other so that competition occurs between them example communities showing lumpy coexistence include wetland plants in mediterranean type ecosystems valiente banuet et al 2006 aquatic beetles drost et al 1992 and prairie birds holling 1992 in theory lumpy coexistence can explain highly diverse phytoplankton systems as well scheffer and van nes 2006 roelke and eldridge 2008 when competition for resources between co existing species is non hierarchical intransitive population dynamics can result with intransitive assemblages no single species can displace all other species and recurrent out of phase oscillations in population dynamics occur huisman et al 1999 huisman and weissing 2001a b roelke and eldridge 2010 biological systems involving coral reef invertebrates jackson and buss 1975 side blotched lizards sinervo and lively 1996 and herbaceous dicots fortner and weltzin 2007 are examples of naturally occurring intransitive systems in theory intransitivity supports high richness in phytoplankton assemblages as well huisman and weissing 2001a b in a previous modeling study roelke and eldridge 2008 explored the effect of migration on phytoplankton assemblages whose biodiversity was sustained either by neutrality lumpy coexistence or intransitivity they explored a plankton model where the influence of migration was a function of hydraulic mixing using a two patch modeling framework they found that immigration even at very low levels led to global homogenization and species extinctions from these observations they questioned the role of neutrality lumpy coexistence and intransitivity as biodiversity sustaining mechanisms in natural environments the two patch modeling framework used in roelke and eldridge 2008 however might have been too simple to allow for source sink patches to develop which are known to facilitate biodiversity mouquet and loreau 2003 in this research we develop two models of greater spatial complexity thus enabling source sink patch development the models employ one dimensional and two dimensional horizontal frameworks with various hydrology the distribution of organisms in our models are subject to advection and turbulent diffusion in advection the nutrients and the embedded phytoplankton cells are carried with the movement of water in turbulent diffusion the spatial mixing of nutrients and phytoplankton of adjacent patches occurs without a net overall transport of water advection and turbulent diffusion were shown to be important to phytoplankton richness and diversity codeco and grover 2001 petrovskii and malchow 2001 mckiver et al 2009 adjou et al 2012 here we explored these over spatial scales 100 km with 10 km2 areal resolution and at turbulent diffusion rates characteristic of large lakes bays and coastal oceans we employ one and two dimensional model frameworks our one dimensional model framework is best visualized as two pipes coming together at an outlet where flow through the pipes are advection and turbulent diffusion based fig 1 our two dimensional model framework is best visualized as two confined eddies that are in contact rotating in opposite directions and again with advective and turbulent diffusive flow fig 2 through simulation analyses we explore and compare the resistance of phytoplankton assemblage source patches initiated with neutral lumpy and intransitive phytoplankton assemblages under varied hydraulic conditions 2

given by μ j k μ max j m i n i r i k a i j r i k where μ max j is the maximum specific growth rate day 1 of species j and a i j is the half saturation coefficient μm of species j growing on the substrate i here we use the notation a instead of the traditional notation k s for convenience with subscript appending finally q i j is the fixed cellular content of resource i μm 106 cells 1 for species j for our one dimensional physical framework we define the system as having an odd number 2n 1 of interconnecting patches out of which the direction of advection in the first and the last patches are pointed towards each other fig 1 in addition the n 1 th patch which receives advection originating from the first and last patches has an advection rate twice the rate of advection of all the other patches also there is a constant inflow to the first and last patches bringing new nutrients r i i n to the system finally the first and last patch only contain the initial phytoplankton assemblages described further below as the simulation proceeds these source assemblages disperse by means of advection and turbulent diffusion the one dimensional model is governed by sets of discretized ordinary differential equations necessary for representing both end member patches 1 st and 2n 1 th the central patch n 1 th and patches in between 2 nd n th n 2 th 2n th the rate of

model framework we define the model domain as two eddies in contact one rotating clockwise and the other rotating counter clockwise fig 2 the patches of this modeling framework are of hexagonal geometry in this two dimensional model framework there are 2n number of circulation rings about each of the eddy cores patches a and b the indexing of the circulation rings start from the closest ring to the core of the eddy there are a total 2 2n 1 8n 1 patches in our two dimensional model framework represented by a grid with 2 2n 1 rows and 8n 1 columns each of the patches has a constant upward diffusion of nutrients r i i n by means of an assumed uniform vertical mixing at a rate v day 1 the sinking of phytoplankton species in each of the patches is also uniform at the rate v day 1 finally the patches a and b have the initial phytoplankton assemblages which spread to the adjacent patches by means of advection and turbulent diffusion in our two dimensional model r i k l t and p j k l t represent the concentration of the growth limiting i th resource μm and the population density of j th phytoplankton species 106 cells l 1 respectively in the patch k l at time t as with the one

comprising phytoplankton assemblages in the initial condition was 0 1 106 cells liter 1 in patches 1 and 2n 1 for the one dimensional model and patches a and b for the two dimensional model all other patches in both models had zero phytoplankton initially initial resource concentrations in all patches was 10 μm for this research we have considered speciose assemblages each of neutral lumpy and intransitive assemblage types roelke and eldridge 2008 for the one and two dimensional frameworks simulations are based on all possible combinations of assemblages chosen two at a time from a similar assemblage biodiversity type i e either neutral lumpy or intransitive there are 10 assemblages per assemblage biodiversity type thus there are 45 assemblage combinations for each 135 total assemblage combinations when considering all three assemblage diversity types the maximum specific growth rate μ max j of each phytoplankton species is taken as 1 day 1 the values of a i j and q i j were provided in roelke and eldridge 2008 for this research we have considered three resources where assigned values to parameters associated with the first resource r a and q are based on nitrogen and assigned values to parameters associated with the other two resources are considered as nitrogen equivalents for our simulation analyses we examined how source patch diversity is influenced by different rates of advection and turbulent diffusion the range of advection used in our simulations is from 0 to 1 day 1 not exceeding the maximum specific growth rate of phytoplankton species when considering 10 km2 patches with 3 162 km distances between central locations this range in advection rate is 0 0 1318 km h 1 the rates of turbulent diffusion explored here range from 0 05 to 0 3 d 1 which equates to 5 787 104 cm2 s 1 to 3 472 105 cm2 s 1 when considering 10 km2 areas of patches in the pipe configuration of the model and 5 012 104 cm2 s 1 to 3 007 105 cm2 s 1 when considering 8 660 km2 areas of patches in the two eddy configuration of the model still with 3 162 km distances between central locations these rates of turbulent diffusion are typical in large lakes bays and coastal oceans okubo 1971 peeters and hofmann 2015 matsuzaki and fujita 2017 peclet number pe a dimensionless measure of advection to turbulent diffusion over a target distance was as low as 0 in our simulations where there was no advection and as high as 20 for the pipe configuration at our highest advection rate and lowest turbulent diffusion rate and as high as 23 for the two eddy configuration at our highest advection rate and lowest turbulent diffusion rate this range in pe spans hydraulic conditions where delivery of nutrients to phytoplankton via fluid motion becomes increasingly important relative to diffusive flux alone i e pe 1 reynolds 2006 for the one dimensional framework we have considered 11 interconnecting patches n 5 whereas for the two dimensional treatment a total 170 patches are considered n 2 in 10 rows and 17 columns with four circulation rings about the eddy cores we employed numerical techniques to solve the mathematical equations of our one and two dimensional models using matlab ode solving routines based on fourth order runge kutta procedures with a variable time step based on a local error tolerance of 10 6 2 4 response variable we examine the change in diversity with time in each of the source patches as estimated according to shannon s diversity index shannon and weaver 1949 for the one dimensional model framework the shannon diversity index in source patch at day t is given by h t j p j t l n p j t where pj is the proportion the species j to the total phytoplankton to objectively quantify the amount of time until a resident phytoplankton assemblage became compromised by invaders we used the rate of change in diversity of the source patch we decided this approach after qualitatively observing diversity collapses in various simulations whose onset could be seen just after source patch diversity peaked to quantify we use a five point formula to determine the derivative of the diversity curve h k t from the source patch the set ω k t 0 t r f k t f k t 1 0 t t 0 represented the days after the initial t 0 days when there are changes in curvature of h k t where f k t h k t 2 8 h k t 1 8 h k t 1 h k t 2 12 the change in curvature of the diversity curve just after the initial t 0 days is given by t k in f ω k t 0 where t k exists if and only if ω k t 0 ϕ if ω k t 0 ϕ then the value of t k is set equal to the upper time limit of the model simulations if p j k r and p j k i represent the resident and invader species respectively in the source patch k where p j k p j k r p j k i then the total invader biomass at the t k th day is given by p k i σ j p j k i for all 45 different combinations of neutral assemblages we obtain a set of t k in days together with a set of total invader biomass p k i n e u t r a l 106 cells liter 1 the average of these values gives the number of days taken by the neutral assemblages after the initial t 0 days of simulation to lose its integrity and the corresponding average invader biomass for the 45 lumpy assemblage combinations we use the same procedure to find the average number of days after the initial t 0 days when there is a change in orientation of the diversity curve and the corresponding average invader biomass the average invader biomass in neutral and lumpy assemblages is given by p k a v g i 1 2 p k i n e u t r a l p k i l u m p y 10 c 2 since the 45 intransitive assemblage combinations have oscillatory dynamics we use p k a v g i as the threshold to find the average number of days taken by the total invader biomass of intransitive assemblages to cross the threshold value for the two dimensional model framework we use the same approach to find the average number of days taken by the three types of assemblages to start losing their identity due to the invaders 3 results resident phytoplankton assemblages in the source patches became compromised by invaders regardless of assemblage type but the assemblage types differed in how long that period was before becoming compromised in general neutral and lumpy assemblages in source patches took the longest amount of time to become compromised representative simulations are shown in fig 3 a and b the population dynamics were similar as well with smooth changes that asymptotically approached maxima or minima or changes that peaked before declining fig 3d and e in contrast intransitive assemblages in source patches took the shortest amount of time representative simulation shown in fig 3c with erratic population dynamics quickly approaching towards maxima or minima or towards a maximum before declining fig 3f for the pipe configuration of the model the period of time until assemblages became compromised by invaders varied as a function of hydrology but differentially between the assemblage types for example neutral assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when advection and turbulent diffusion were low and when advection was high and turbulent diffusion low both 1000 days fig 4 a otherwise the period of time until assemblages became compromised was 500 days lumpy assemblages in general showed greater resistance to invaders when turbulent diffusion was low regardless of advection with the period of time until assemblages became compromised ranging between 1000 to 1400 days fig 4b as turbulent diffusion increased lumpy assemblages became compromised more quickly taking 250 days when advection was low and 500 days when advection was high intransitive assemblages showed a trend similar to neutral assemblages but less pronounced with maxima and minima until assemblages became compromised by invaders with times of 600 and 400 days respectively fig 4c regardless of assemblage type nutrient concentrations in source patches were at their maxima i e 10 μm when advection was highest and turbulent diffusion lowest which is the value of nutrient concentrations in the sources and asymptotically decreased to minima 0 1 μm when advection was low not shown for the two eddy configuration of the model the period of time until assemblages became compromised by invaders again varied as a function of hydrology and again differentially between the assemblage types for this model configuration neutral assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when advection and turbulent diffusion were higher 600 days fig 5 a the period of time until neutral assemblages became compromised was least when turbulent diffusion was low ranging between 275 and 300 days lumpy assemblages showed greater resistance to invaders when turbulent diffusion and advection were low and when turbulent diffusion and advection were high 400 days fig 5b the period of time until lumpy assemblages became compromised was least when turbulent diffusion was low and advection high 225 days as with the pipe configuration of the model intransitive assemblages showed the greatest sensitivity to invaders in the two eddy configuration there was little difference in the times until assemblages became compromised however which was 150 days at all combinations of advection and turbulent diffusion fig 5c regardless of assemblage type advection rate and turbulent diffusion rate nutrient concentrations in source patches were depleted 0 1 μm not shown 4 discussion for the pipe configuration of the model resident assemblages in the source patches are more resistant to invaders at the lowest and at higher advection rates and when turbulent diffusion rates are low interestingly at intermediate rates of advection and while turbulent diffusion is low resident assemblages are less resistant to invasions this was true for all assemblage types this trend at low turbulent diffusion rates occurs because as advection rate increases from a low value greater hydraulic displacement of residents leads to lower biomass of resident populations in turn this leads to greater concentrations of nutrients thereby lessening competitive advantages established residents might have had over invaders this then facilitates invasions even as invaders originating from a downstream location must overcome a stronger current but as advection rates further increase from intermediate to higher values invaders become less able to overcome currents even though nutrient concentrations in the source patch continue to increase with further decreases in biomass of residents invaders are simply unable to arrive there in significant numbers and resistance of resident assemblages increases so there is an interplay between advection and turbulent diffusion rate in the pipe configuration of the model where at low rates of turbulent diffusion an intermediate level of advection best facilitates invasion our findings from the pipe configuration of the model are consistent in part with findings from others for example increased nutrient loadings with increased hydraulic displacements were shown to stimulate accumulation of downstream invader biomass in a model of similar configuration grover et al 2017 our findings showing poorer invasion success when advection is high and turbulent diffusion is low have also been observed in other models of similar configuration lutscher et al 2005 grover et al 2011 2017 in those models increasing advection rates served as a mechanism preventing accumulation of downstream invader populations those models however depicted unidirectional advection throughout the model domain and employed hydraulic storage zones or source populations neither of which are used here the persistence of resident populations at higher advection rates in our model was due to sustained higher growth rates that occur with the higher nutrient loading rates which has been described previously reynolds 1990 grover et al 2009 hsu et al 2013 our observation that assemblages become less resistant to downstream invaders as turbulent diffusion increases is also consistent with previous work grover et al 2017 for the two eddy configuration of the model when advection and turbulent diffusion rates are low resident assemblages in source patches are again resistant to invaders but only for lumpy assemblages this is different from the pipe configuration of the model also in contrast to the pipe configuration model resistance to invaders of neutral and lumpy assemblages is high when advection and turbulent diffusion rates are high factors leading to persistence of populations within circulating gyres as depicted by our simulated eddies show that circular advection and turbulent diffusion processes in combination lead to ageostrophic patterns that serve to retain populations within gyres when particles are positively buoyant zhong et al 2012 beron vera et al 2015 here our particles are not positively buoyant but our imposed sinking rate is not in excess of realized reproductive growth rates the result is the same in that resident populations are retained within eddies at higher rates of circular advection and turbulent diffusion which leads to greater resistance to invaders but again only for neutral and lumpy phytoplankton assemblages our findings show that resistance to invaders for neutral and lumpy assemblages are strongly dependent on the flow configurations intransitive assemblages in the pipe configuration of the model are also dependent on the flow configurations but less so in both configurations of the model intransitive assemblages were more sensitive to invaders and unable to maintain source patches the underpinning mechanism of high species diversity in intransitive phytoplankton assemblages that is intrinsic disturbances sustained by and promulgating species interactions huisman and weissing 1999 2001a b were shown to require peculiar circumstances in regards to life history traits of co occurring species and hydraulic conditions schippers et al 2001 roelke et al 2003 roelke and eldridge 2008 2010 when those circumstances were violated species diversity was lost those previous studies however were not of a configuration where source patches were depicted because they lacked adequate spatial domains here we show that with a more complex spatial domain and over a wide range of hydrological conditions where source patches could be sustained intransitive assemblages are still quite sensitive to invasions 5 conclusions our observations along with those of roelke and eldridge 2008 suggest that intransitivity should not be a prevalent biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems as it is much more sensitive to invaders than either neutrality or lumpy coexistence on the other hand neutral and lumpy coexistence mechanisms are more robust suggesting a higher probability that they are biodiversity mechanisms in spatially heterogeneous plankton systems in fact in a recent modeling study spatially homogeneous it was shown that differences in nutrient supply fluctuation periodicities determined whether phytoplankton assemblages were comprised of near neutral species or in species clusters along a temporally varying niche sakavara et al 2017 in addition a forthcoming analysis of plankton from eight lakes revealed persistence of species clusters in phytoplankton assemblages muhl et al 2017 we note however that even with our greater spatial complexity in this research effort it may be that our modeling framework is still too simple to rule out intransitivity as a biodiversity sustaining mechanism in spatially heterogeneous phytoplankton systems there are likely other processes influential that are not depicted here for example recently it was shown that interacting processes of light extinction vertical mixing particle sinking and benthic nutrient flux showed certain scenarios where the β richness and β diversity of intransitive assemblages are more resistant to environmental changes than for neutral or lumpy assemblages withrow et al 2018 similarly in the muhl et al 2017 study mentioned above it was shown that intransitive assemblages are more resistant to allelopathic interactions than either neutral or lumpy assemblages suggesting another condition by which intransitive assemblages might occur in spatially heterogeneous plankton environments so we can conclude from observations in the present study combined with observations from these other studies that when a system is primarily driven by two dimensional hydrology and exploitative competition the incidence of supersaturated assemblages governed by intransitivity is less likely than the incidence of supersaturated assemblages governed by either neutrality or lumpy coexistence this is not to say that speciose phytoplankton assemblages sustained by intransitivity do not occur in nature as there are other environmental conditions and types of species interactions that may facilitate them 
25332,positive relationship between diversity and biomass was often observed by empirical experiments at the community level but the effects of species interactions on community total biomass have been rarely explored from a network perspective weak interaction and specific non monotonic interactions have been proposed to be stabilizing mechanisms in maintaining persistence in more complex ecosystems but it is unclear how they contribute to the high level of biomass or productivity of these systems in this study we examined the effects of various interactions specifically dome shaped shifting from positive to negative effect with increase of density and satiated interactions on biomass and biomass flow with the increase of complexity in theoretical networks our results indicated that as compared to linear or satiated interactions dome shaped interactions maintained both higher persistence and biomass or biomass flow in more complex networks but resulted in larger variations of species biomass however variation of network biomass was much smaller than that of species biomass our results suggest that species interaction shifting between mutualism at low density and competition or predation at high density could be a driving force for maintaining high levels of persistence diversity biomass and biomass flow in natural ecosystems keywords non monotonic interaction complexity diversity stability persistence biomass ecological network 1 introduction diversity stability debate has been a long standing topic in ecology empirical observation leads early ecologists to conclude that complex ecosystems should be more stable than simpler ones macarthur 1955 but theoretical network analysis led to the opposite conclusion may 1972 this paradox has stimulated tremendous studies to investigate key factors in determining the diversity stability relationship several hypotheses on the stabilizing mechanisms of ecological networks have been proposed such as modularity sometime called compartmentation nestedness omnivory diversity of interaction types weak interaction hypothesis and so on bascompte et al 2003 mccann 2000 mougi and kondoh 2012 for theoretical linear ecological networks the local stability that measures the tendency of the system to return to equilibrium after perturbations decreases abruptly with increase of complexity that is composed of number of species number of interaction links and interaction strength allesina and tang 2012 may 1972 mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 thus weak interaction less connectance or interaction strength is often speculated to be necessary to maintain stable ecological networks with more species yan and zhang 2014 proposed an alternative stabilizing mechanism for complex ecological networks that some specific non monotonic interactions such as shifting signs from positive to negative dome shaped function or to neutral satiated function with increase of density could significantly increase the persistence of ecological networks the underlying stabilizing mechanism of these non monotonic interactions might be that they can increase probability of species coexistence by producing more stable equilibrium points and by reducing the chance of unbounded mutualistic feedbacks which are often observed in traditional linear models yan and zhang 2014 zhang 2003 zhang et al 2015 besides the diversity stability paradox the relationship between diversity and biomass is another hot topic in ecological literature community total biomass i e the mass of all species is an important aspect of natural ecosystems by representing the ecosystem function or productivity for a long time ecologists have focused on testing the relationships between species richness and community biomass in natural communities mostly in plant communities both empirical and experimental evidence suggest that there is usually a positive species richness biomass productivity relationship grime 1973 michalet et al 2006 mittelbach et al 2001 the theoretical exploration on this relationship has led to two major hypotheses 1 functional niche complementarity the complementarity effect stresses that niche differentiation or facilitation increases the performance of communities above that expected from the performance of individual species and 2 selective processes such as interspecific competition can cause dominance of species with very high biomass loreau 2000 loreau and hector 2001 however the relationship between biomass and species interactions has rarely been investigated probably due to the difficulty of simultaneously quantifying species interactions and community biomass in natural ecosystems this issue is also rarely explored in a multi species context by using theoretical models in random linear models of ecological networks weak interaction is essential in maintaining a stable complex network but its effects on biomass or biomass flow are largely unknown by using a theoretical model of two species zhang 2003 suggested that dome shaped interaction i e mutualism at low density but competition at high density would not only increase probability of species coexistence but also the carrying capacity of the two competitors therefore non monotonic interactions are likely to promote both persistence and biomass of ecological networks but this has never been studied in the context of ecological networks in nature there have been growing evidences of dome shaped or satiated interactions between species for instance in rodent seed interactions some rodent species show positive effects on seed tree species by scatter hoarding seeds at low density levels but showed negative effects by over consuming seeds at high density levels li and zhang 2007 other examples were seen in ant aphid interactions addicott 1951 pollinator mediated plants thompson 1988 and plant mycorrhizae interaction neuhauser and fargione 2004 the purpose of this study emphasized their effects on persistence biomass and biomass flow of theoretical ecological networks with the increase of complexity as compared to the linear interactions 2 method 2 1 interaction functions following the classical lotka volttera equations we defined signed interaction strength a as the per capita effect of one species on another species we applied four types of functions to interaction strength a the first one was derived from a linear function in which the interaction strength a was independent of population density l function fig 1 a the second one was derived from the holling s type 2 functional response defined as the satiated function in this study assuming the strength was satiated by the density n of prey or resource species here named as the h function fig 1b where h controls the satiation rate which was set to be 1 the third one was a simplified dome shaped non monotonic function provided in the work by yan and zhang 2014 i e shifting interaction from positive to negative effect when population density was higher than a threshold value n t but the magnitude of strength is fixed hereafter named as the nm1 function fig 1c the fourth one was a dome shaped non monotonic function shifting interaction from positive to negative effect smoothly when the population density was higher than a threshold value n t and the magnitude of strength was weakest around threshold density hereafter named as the nm2 function fig 1d where b controlled the shifting rate of strength which was set to be 0 8 the interaction functions representing the changes of interaction strength against nj were shown below l a a h a h n a 1 h n nm 1 a n n t a n n t 0 n n t a n n t nm 2 a b n n t a 1 e b n n t 1 e b n n t 2 2 network construction following may s model may 1972 we constructed the randomly connected networks based on an interaction matrix m of size s s the number of species s 10 20 40 60 or 80 we defined connectance c 0 2 0 4 0 6 or 0 8 as the proportion of realized interaction links in the off diagonal elements of m the values of interaction strengths were drawn from a normal distribution mean 0 and standard deviation 0 0625 0 125 0 25 or 0 5 and we used standard deviation to represent the magnitude of interaction strength is to test the effects of non monotonic interactions on various properties of networks we introduced a certain proportion 20 50 and 80 of non monotonic interactions into the connected elements respectively by replacing the l or h interactions functions these resulted in six kinds of networks containing different interaction functions or their combinations l l nm1 l nm2 h h nm1 and h nm2 similarly we introduced non monotonic interactions into 26 networks with empirical food web structure established by thompson and townsend 2003 downloaded from an online interaction web database www nceas ucsb edu interactionweb we have conducted 200 replicates of random networks for each combination of species number connectance and interaction strength magnitude and 50 replicates of each food web with empirical structure for each level of interaction strength all the parameters of our simulations were summarized in table a 1 2 3 community dynamics simulations the community dynamics was applied by using a set of multi species differential equations eq 1a and eq 2a described community dynamics with only l or h functions of interaction strength as shown below 1a d n i d t n i r i n i j 1 j i s a i j n j 2a d n i d t n i r i n i l 1 l i l a i l n l 1 n l k 1 k i k a i k n k 1 n i where n i is population density of species i r i is the intrinsic growth rate a ij is the interaction effect of species j on species i in eq 1a a i l is the positive effect of the species l on species i in eq 2a and a i k is the negative effect of the species k on species i in eq 2a in eq 2a l and k indicate the number of species that show positive and negative effects on species i respectively eqs 1b and 1c described the community dynamics when non monotonic interactions were introduced into networks with linear interactions l nm1 l nm2 and eqs 2b and 2c described the community dynamics when non monotonic interactions were introduced into networks with satiated interaction function h nm1 h nm2 as shown below 1b d n i d t n i r i n i j 1 j i j a i j n j m 1 m i m n

represents the original interaction strength of species m on species i n m is the species m showing a non monotonic effect on species i and n t is the threshold density where the species m shifting between positive and negative effects in above equations j indicates the number of species that have linear interactions with species i l and k indicate the number of species that show positive and negative effects on species i respectively m indicates the number of species that have non monotonic interactions nm1 or nm2 with species i because multiple nonlinear equations can hardly be solved analytically we adopted simulation methods to study population dynamics of above models in six kinds of networks l l nm1 l nm2 h h nm1 and h nm2 networks following previous study yan and zhang 2014 the simulation of population dynamics was integrated by 4th order runge kutta method for 25 000 time units implemented by desolve package in r version 3 4 karline soetaert et al 2010 r development core team 2010 initial population density was randomly drawn from uniform distribution 1 10 the parameters summarized in table a 1 used in simulations followed previous study yan and zhang 2014 2 4 network statistics the complexity of an ecological network was measured by number of species connectance number of realized interaction links and interaction strength see above in network construction may 1972 persistence representing network stability of an ecological network was calculated as the number of survived population density 10 6 species initial number of species s at the end the 25000th time step of each numerical simulation yan and zhang 2014 previous studies showed that intrinsic growth rate r has a close relationship with species body mass hennemann 1983 niklas and enquist 2001 van m savage et al 2004 we have set a narrow range 0 8 1 1 of the parameter r in our study and the difference of biomass between species was assumed to be negligible which allowed us to use the population density to represent biomass thus we used the sum of population density of survived species at the end of each numerical simulation to represent the network biomass in this study we defined the biomass flow as biomass increase or decrease rates of one species caused by not necessarily transferred from the other species which represents the net turnover rate of biomass of a species caused by interspecific interactions this definition is different from energy or matter flow between species in food webs of ecosystems in which either input or output flow is calculated they are equivalent because such positive and negative biomass flow are often asymmetric and not equivalent e g between competitors or mutualists both positive and negative biomass flow were summarized thus the network biomass flow was calculated by summing the absolute values of input positive and output negative biomass flow of all species i e absolute value of interaction strength multiplied by the biomass for each species at the end of each numerical simulation the per capita biomass flow which would represent the per capita biomass flow efficiency of a network at the end of simulation was calculated by the criteria network biomass flow network biomass which is a relative efficiency adjusted by community total biomass 1 time unit for each survived species we could calculate coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean for the last 5000 time steps time window of 20000th 25000th population level or species level biomass variation pcv was calculated as the mean value of the cvs of all survived species for the last 5000 time steps while the network level biomass variation ncv was calculated as the cv of network biomass for the last 5000 time steps for random networks each data point of network statistic is summarized as mean and standard error se very small at most cases due to large sample size from 3200 4000 and 4000 simulated networks at each level of species number connectance and interaction strength respectively for food webs each data point was summarized from 1300 simulations to test the robustness of our results we also estimated the persistence network biomass and per capita biomass flow at the 22000th 23000th or 24000th time step and to estimate the pcv and ncv by using at the time windows of from 20000th to 22000th from 20000th to 23000th or 20000th to 24000th step the additional analyses indicated that the results were similar by using different time steps or time windows suggesting our results were robust 3 results 3 1 random networks because introducing 50 figs 2 6 20 fig a 1 and 80 fig a 2 of non monotonic interactions into our simulated ecological networks produced similar results here we only presented the results with a proportion of 50 non monotonic interactions for the random networks the persistence of all networks showed a decrease with increase of network complexity i e species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength more rapidly in l networks but more slowly in h networks fig 2 at high levels of complexity the l nm1 and l nm2 networks showed a much higher persistence than l networks but lower persistence than h h nm1 and h nm2 networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating satiated interaction or combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining a higher network persistence in more complex networks i e with higher network complexity the total network biomass all showed a positive relationship with species number and connectance except l networks showing a dome shaped response but a dome shaped relationship with the magnitude of interaction strength except h networks fig 3 in general the order of network biomass was shown as h nm1 and h nm2 networks l nm1 and l nm2 network l and h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating that dome shaped interaction or combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining higher network biomass in more complex networks satiated interaction alone produced low network biomass even lower than l networks at many cases as shown in fig 4 the biomass flow and per capita biomass flow of all networks showed an increase with the increase of species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength except that l networks showed a decrease when connectance and magnitude of strength reached a certain threshold 0 4 and 0 2 respectively in general l nm1 l nm2 h nm1 and h nm2 networks had a higher biomass flow or per capita biomass flow than h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting that dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining higher biomass flow or per capita biomass flow in more complex networks satiated interactions showed lower biomass flow or per capita biomass flow the pcv and ncv of all networks showed an increase with the increase of species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength fig 5 in general the order of both pcv and ncv was shown as l nm1 and h nm1 l nm2 and h nm2 l and h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating that dome shaped interactions increased variations of both population and network level biomass the values of ncv were much lower than those of pcv in all networks these results showed that dome shaped interactions tended to increase pcv and ncv but ncv was much smaller than pcv indicating asynchronous oscillations within community in general in more complex random networks satiated interaction performed better in maintaining high persistence but poorly in maintaining biomass or biomass flow dome shaped interaction performed better in maintaining both high persistence and biomass or biomass flow a combination of dome shaped and satiated interactions would benefit network biomass dome shaped interaction would cause large variation of both species and network biomass but the latter was much smaller than the former additional analyses suggest the results were similar by using different time steps or time windows fig a 3 a 5 3 2 food webs for the food webs with empirical structure similar results to those of the random networks were obtained but with some slight differences fig 6 the persistence of all food webs showed a decrease with increase of the magnitude of is the order of persistence is h nm2 h nm1 h l nm2 l nm1 l food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high persistence than other interactions in particular than the l or h interactions the network biomass in food webs decreased with the increase of the magnitude of is in l and h food webs but increased with the magnitude of is in l nm1 l nm2 h nm1 and h nm2 food webs the order of network biomass is h nm1 h nm2 l nm1 l nm2 h l food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high biomass of networks the biomass flow and per capita biomass flow of all food webs showed an increase with the increase of the magnitude of is the order of biomass flow is l nm1 l nm2 and h nm1 h nm2 l h food webs the order of per capita biomass flow is l nm1 l nm2 l h nm1 h nm2 and h food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high these results suggested that dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high biomass and per capita biomass of networks the pcv and ncv of food webs showed little change with the increase of the magnitude of is except that l nm1 and h nm1 food webs showed an increasing trend the pcv and ncv values of l nm1 and h nm1 food webs were larger than other types of food webs when the magnitude of is reached a high level for l nm1 and h nm1 food webs ncv was much lower than pcv these results indicated that dome shaped interaction would result in larger variations of both species and network biomass in more complex networks the variation of network biomass was much smaller than that of species biomass in general in the food web networks dome shaped interaction also performed better in maintaining both high diversity and biomass or biomass flow but it would increase variation of species and network biomass 4 discussion we have theoretically studied the effects of specific non monotonic interactions on both persistence and biomass our simulation results indicated that as compared to the linear or satiated interactions the dome shaped interaction shifting positive to negative interaction with increase of density maintained higher persistence biomass and biomass flow in more complex ecological networks but it resulted in larger variations of both species and network biomass these results were consistent with the empirical observations in natural conditions highlighting the significant role of transition between positive and negative interaction in maintaining biodiversity and stability of ecosystems therefore it is necessary to make further investigation on dome shaped interactions in future studies previous theoretical studies have shown that as the species number and their interactions increase the interaction strength precisely the magnitude of interaction strength must become weak so as to maintain a higher stability in more complex ecological networks allesina and tang 2012 may 1972 mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 the weak interaction can also be achieved by introducing the holling s type 2 or 3 functional response holland et al 2006 which is a way to satiate the per capita interaction strength when prey or resource species population increases soria díaz et al 2017 weak interaction strength either by static weak strength or functional satiation could increase persistence of ecological communities weak interaction has been one of dominant hypotheses in solving the diversity stability debate mccann 2000 alternatively previous theoretical exploration of non monotonic interaction in two species systems suggested the dome shaped interaction might serve as an alternative mechanism for persistence of ecological networks zhang 2003 yan and zhang 2014 reported specific non monotonic interactions e g dome shaped function increased persistence of ecological networks similarly in this study we showed that introduction of dome shaped interactions nm1 and nm2 could increase persistence of networks but the nm2 interaction showed a stronger effect in promoting persistence than nm1 interaction functions in the l networks while in h networks both dome shaped interactions showed similar effects on persistence the difference between nm1 and nm2 interactions indicated that the satiation of interaction strength and non monotonicity are both important stabilizing forces previous studies on the relationship between diversity and biomass have been mainly conducted in natural communities mostly in plant communities such as positive species richness biomass productivity relationships grime 1973 michalet et al 2006 mittelbach et al 2001 however the relationship between community biomass and species interactions is rarely explored consistent to some natural observations we found the network biomass increased with species number of networks for all types of interactions the network biomass showed a minor increase with connectance except in l networks and a mainly dome shaped relationship with interaction strength except in h networks these results suggested that network biomass depended on not only species number but also species interactions the dome shaped relationship of biomass with connectance in l networks and with interaction strength in most types of networks was probably due to reduced number of survived species when connectance and interaction strength were too high at different levels of species number connectance and interaction strength we observed that introduction of dome shaped non monotonic interaction into either l or h networks could increase the network biomass it is notable that although the satiated interaction performed best in maintaining a high persistence in more complex networks it resulted in a very low network biomass suggesting that weak interaction may increase network persistence at the cost of biomass reduction which is not consistent with empirical observations nonetheless dome shaped non monotonic interactions performed better than the other interactions in maintaining both high persistence and biomass in more complex networks which is consistent with empirical observations it has been a long standing view to see natural ecosystems as energy flow systems odum 1968 energy matter flow is related to activity and efficiency of input energy for ecosystems finn 1976 in this study we used the sum of input and output biomass of all species which was the multiplication of interaction strength and species biomass representing the net biomass turn over in the networks therefore it was reasonable that the network biomass flow would increase with increase of species number links and interaction strength the decrease of biomass flow in more complex l networks i e with higher levels of species number links and interaction strength was due to the lower number of survived species i e lower persistence the dome shaped non monotonic interactions showed higher levels of both biomass flow and per capita biomass flow while the h functions showed the lowest biomass flow a higher level of biomass flow for a system indicates a more efficient usage of input energy or matter therefore dome shaped interaction would benefit the ecological efficiency of an ecosystem on the temporal variation of biomass it is widely recognized that high diversity reduces the variation of the total biomass of communities gross et al 2014 hector et al 2010 but there is still debate on the relationship between species richness and population level biomass jiang and pu 2009 in our modeling framework the temporal variation of biomass at population and network level was zero or quite low in l and h networks because population dynamics reached stable equilibriums which is not consistent with empirical observations as suggested in our previous studies dome shaped non monotonic interaction could increase temporal variation of single populations yan and zhang 2014 in this study we found the population and network level temporal variation increased with species number connectance and interaction strength the dome shaped non monotonic functions assumed that the signs of interaction were density dependent which made the population dynamics more difficult to reach equilibriums in more complex networks and then resulted in larger variation of single populations and also higher biomass within a study using the classical rosenzweig macarthur model biomass and productivity were also found to be higher at complex dynamic regimes with chaotic and possibly greater oscillations de feo and rinaldi 1997 however we found the network level biomass variations were much lower than those of population level variations in models with dome shaped interactions these results indicate that in networks with dome shaped interactions more species would help to reduce network biomass variation due to compensation effects among these fluctuating populations or asynchronous oscillation traditionally the mutualistic interaction is believed to be unstable in ecological models because of unbounded population growth caused by inherent positive feedback may 2001 recent studies demonstrated that mutualistic interactions might be stabilizing when they are mixed with antagonistic interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 sauve et al 2014 in fact facilitation effects in plant community have also been extensively reported brooker et al 2008 zhang and yan 2014 discussed the effects of different forms of non monotonic interactions on species coexistence and network persistence among the six non monotonic interactions the density dependent shifting from positive to negative interaction i e dome shaped function has been reported to occur in natural ecosystems such as rodent seed interactions li and zhang 2007 ant aphid interactions addicott 1951 pollinator mediated plants thompson 1988 plant mycorrhizae interaction neuhauser and fargione 2004 from our analyses we demonstrated that the dome shaped non monotonic interaction was important in maintaining not only high persistence but also high biomass in more complex ecosystems our results suggest that positive interactions at low density benefit biomass accumulation while negative interactions at high density benefit persistence species adjusting strategies between mutualisms at low density and competition or predation at high density would be selected by nature at community and network levels this implies the dome shaped interaction may be an alternative mechanism in the evolution of mutualism and in shaping the structure and function of ecosystems we thus appeal for more efforts to study the non monotonic interactions and their roles in maintaining biodiversity persistence and productivity of ecosystems in future studies acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 31500347 31330013

ecosystems but it is unclear how they contribute to the high level of biomass or productivity of these systems in this study we examined the effects of various interactions specifically dome shaped shifting from positive to negative effect with increase of density and satiated interactions on biomass and biomass flow with the increase of complexity in theoretical networks our results indicated that as compared to linear or satiated interactions dome shaped interactions maintained both higher persistence and biomass or biomass flow in more complex networks but resulted in larger variations of species biomass however variation of network biomass was much smaller than that of species biomass our results suggest that species interaction shifting between mutualism at low density and competition or predation at high density could be a driving force for maintaining high levels of persistence diversity biomass and biomass flow in natural ecosystems keywords non monotonic interaction complexity diversity stability persistence biomass ecological network 1 introduction diversity stability debate has been a long standing topic in ecology empirical observation leads early ecologists to conclude that complex ecosystems should be more stable than simpler ones macarthur 1955 but theoretical network analysis led to the opposite conclusion may 1972 this paradox has stimulated tremendous studies to investigate key factors in determining the diversity stability relationship several hypotheses on the stabilizing mechanisms of ecological networks have been proposed such as modularity sometime called compartmentation nestedness omnivory diversity of interaction types weak interaction hypothesis and so on bascompte et al 2003 mccann 2000 mougi and kondoh 2012 for theoretical linear ecological networks the local stability that measures the tendency of the system to return to equilibrium after perturbations decreases abruptly with increase of complexity that is composed of number of species number of interaction links and interaction strength allesina and tang 2012 may 1972 mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 thus weak interaction less connectance or interaction strength is often speculated to be necessary to maintain stable ecological networks with more species yan and zhang 2014 proposed an alternative stabilizing mechanism for complex ecological networks that some specific non monotonic interactions such as shifting signs from positive to negative dome shaped function or to neutral satiated function with increase of density could significantly increase the persistence of ecological networks the underlying stabilizing mechanism of these non monotonic interactions might be that they can increase probability of species coexistence by producing more stable equilibrium points and by reducing the chance of unbounded mutualistic feedbacks which are often observed in traditional linear models yan and zhang 2014 zhang 2003 zhang et al 2015 besides the diversity stability paradox the relationship between diversity and biomass is another hot topic in ecological literature community total biomass i e the mass of all species is an important aspect of natural ecosystems by representing the ecosystem function or productivity for a long time ecologists have focused on testing the relationships between species richness and community biomass in natural communities mostly in plant communities both empirical and experimental evidence suggest that there is usually a positive species richness biomass productivity relationship grime 1973 michalet et al 2006 mittelbach et al 2001 the theoretical exploration on this relationship has led to two major hypotheses 1 functional niche complementarity the complementarity effect stresses that niche differentiation or facilitation increases the performance of communities above that expected from the performance of individual species and 2 selective processes such as interspecific competition can cause dominance of species with very high biomass loreau 2000 loreau and hector 2001 however the relationship between biomass and species interactions has rarely been investigated probably due to the difficulty of simultaneously quantifying species interactions and community biomass in natural ecosystems this issue is also rarely explored in a multi species context by using theoretical models in random linear models of ecological networks weak interaction is essential in maintaining a stable complex network but its effects on biomass or biomass flow are largely unknown by using a theoretical model of two species zhang 2003 suggested that dome shaped interaction i e mutualism at low density but competition at high density would not only increase probability of species coexistence but also the carrying capacity of the two competitors therefore non monotonic interactions are likely to promote both persistence and biomass of ecological networks but this has never been studied in the context of ecological networks in nature there have been growing evidences of dome shaped or satiated interactions between species for instance in rodent seed interactions some rodent species show positive effects on seed tree species by scatter hoarding seeds at low density levels but showed negative effects by over consuming seeds at high density levels li and zhang 2007 other examples were seen in ant aphid interactions addicott 1951 pollinator mediated plants thompson 1988 and plant mycorrhizae interaction neuhauser and fargione 2004 the purpose of this study emphasized their effects on persistence biomass and biomass flow of theoretical ecological networks with the increase of complexity as compared to the linear interactions 2 method 2 1 interaction functions following the classical lotka volttera equations we defined signed interaction strength a as the per capita effect of one species on another species we applied four types of functions to interaction strength a the first one was derived from a linear function in which the interaction strength a was independent of population density l function fig 1 a the second one was derived from the holling s type 2 functional response defined as the satiated function in this study assuming the strength was satiated by the density n of prey or resource species here named as the h function fig 1b where h controls the satiation rate which was set to be 1 the third one was a simplified dome shaped non monotonic function provided in the work by yan and zhang 2014 i e shifting interaction from positive to negative effect when population density was higher than a threshold value n t but the magnitude of strength is fixed hereafter named as the nm1 function fig 1c the fourth one was a dome shaped non monotonic function shifting interaction from positive to negative effect smoothly when the population density was higher than a threshold value n t and the magnitude of strength was weakest around threshold density hereafter named as the nm2 function fig 1d where b controlled the shifting rate of strength which was set to be 0 8 the interaction functions representing the changes of interaction strength against nj were shown below l a a h a h n a 1 h n nm 1 a n n t a n n t 0 n n t a n n t nm 2 a b n n t a 1 e b n n t 1 e b n n t 2 2 network construction following may s model may 1972 we constructed the randomly connected networks based on an interaction matrix m of size s s the number of species s 10 20 40 60 or 80 we defined connectance c 0 2 0 4 0 6 or 0 8 as the proportion of realized interaction links in the off diagonal elements of m the values of interaction strengths were drawn from a normal distribution mean 0 and standard deviation 0 0625 0 125 0 25 or 0 5 and we used standard deviation to represent the magnitude of interaction strength is to test the effects of non monotonic interactions on various properties of networks we introduced a certain proportion 20 50 and 80 of non monotonic interactions into the connected elements respectively by replacing the l or h interactions functions these resulted in six kinds of networks containing different interaction functions or their combinations l l nm1 l nm2 h h nm1 and h nm2 similarly we introduced non monotonic interactions into 26 networks with empirical food web structure established by thompson and townsend 2003 downloaded from an online interaction web database www nceas ucsb edu interactionweb we have conducted 200 replicates of random networks for each combination of species number connectance and interaction strength magnitude and 50 replicates of each food web with empirical structure for each level of interaction strength all the parameters of our simulations were summarized in table a 1 2 3 community dynamics simulations the community dynamics was applied by using a set of multi species differential equations eq 1a and eq 2a described community dynamics with only l or h functions of interaction strength as shown below 1a d n i d t n i r i n i j 1 j i s a i j n j 2a d n i d t n i r i n i l 1 l i l a i l n l 1 n l k 1 k i k

species l on species i in eq 2a and a i k is the negative effect of the species k on species i in eq 2a in eq 2a l and k indicate the number of species that show positive and negative effects on species i respectively eqs 1b and 1c described the community dynamics when non monotonic interactions were introduced into networks with linear interactions l nm1 l nm2 and eqs 2b and 2c described the community dynamics when non monotonic interactions were introduced into networks with satiated interaction function h nm1 h nm2 as shown below 1b d n i d t n i r i n i j 1 j i j a i j n j m 1 m i m n

represents the original interaction strength of species m on species i n m is the species m showing a non monotonic effect on species i and n t is the threshold density where the species m shifting between positive and negative effects in above equations j indicates the number of species that have linear interactions with species i l and k indicate the number of species that show positive and negative effects on species i respectively m indicates the number of species that have non monotonic interactions nm1 or nm2 with species i because multiple nonlinear equations can hardly be solved analytically we adopted simulation methods to study population dynamics of above models in six kinds of networks l l nm1 l nm2 h h nm1 and h nm2 networks following previous study yan and zhang 2014 the simulation of population dynamics was integrated by 4th order runge kutta method for 25 000 time units implemented by desolve package in r version 3 4 karline soetaert et al 2010 r development core team 2010 initial population density was randomly drawn from uniform distribution 1 10 the parameters summarized in table a 1 used in simulations followed previous study yan and zhang 2014 2 4 network statistics the complexity of an ecological network was measured by number of species connectance number of realized interaction links and interaction strength see above in network construction may 1972 persistence representing network stability of an ecological network was calculated as the number of survived population density 10 6 species initial number of species s at the end the 25000th time step of each numerical simulation yan and zhang 2014 previous studies showed that intrinsic growth rate r has a close relationship with species body mass hennemann 1983 niklas and enquist 2001 van m savage et al 2004 we have set a narrow range 0 8 1 1 of the parameter r in our study and the difference of biomass between species was assumed to be negligible which allowed us to use the population density to represent biomass thus we used the sum of population density of survived species at the end of each numerical simulation to represent the network biomass in this study we defined the biomass flow as biomass increase or decrease rates of one species caused by not necessarily transferred from the other species which represents the net turnover rate of biomass of a species caused by interspecific interactions this definition is different from energy or matter flow between species in food webs of ecosystems in which either input or output flow is calculated they are equivalent because such positive and negative biomass flow are often asymmetric and not equivalent e g between competitors or mutualists both positive and negative biomass flow were summarized thus the network biomass flow was calculated by summing the absolute values of input positive and output negative biomass flow of all species i e absolute value of interaction strength multiplied by the biomass for each species at the end of each numerical simulation the per capita biomass flow which would represent the per capita biomass flow efficiency of a network at the end of simulation was calculated by the criteria network biomass flow network biomass which is a relative efficiency adjusted by community total biomass 1 time unit for each survived species we could calculate coefficient of variation cv standard deviation mean for the last 5000 time steps time window of 20000th 25000th population level or species level biomass variation pcv was calculated as the mean value of the cvs of all survived species for the last 5000 time steps while the network level biomass variation ncv was calculated as the cv of network biomass for the last 5000 time steps for random networks each data point of network statistic is summarized as mean and standard error se very small at most cases due to large sample size from 3200 4000 and 4000 simulated networks at each level of species number connectance and interaction strength respectively for food webs each data point was summarized from 1300 simulations to test the robustness of our results we also estimated the persistence network biomass and per capita biomass flow at the 22000th 23000th or 24000th time step and to estimate the pcv and ncv by using at the time windows of from 20000th to 22000th from 20000th to 23000th or 20000th to 24000th step the additional analyses indicated that the results were similar by using different time steps or time windows suggesting our results were robust 3 results 3 1 random networks because introducing 50 figs 2 6 20 fig a 1 and 80 fig a 2 of non monotonic interactions into our simulated ecological networks produced similar results here we only presented the results with a proportion of 50 non monotonic interactions for the random networks the persistence of all networks showed a decrease with increase of network complexity i e species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength more rapidly in l networks but more slowly in h networks fig 2 at high levels of complexity the l nm1 and l nm2 networks showed a much higher persistence than l networks but lower persistence than h h nm1 and h nm2 networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating satiated interaction or combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining a higher network persistence in more complex networks i e with higher network complexity the total network biomass all showed a positive relationship with species number and connectance except l networks showing a dome shaped response but a dome shaped relationship with the magnitude of interaction strength except h networks fig 3 in general the order of network biomass was shown as h nm1 and h nm2 networks l nm1 and l nm2 network l and h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating that dome shaped interaction or combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining higher network biomass in more complex networks satiated interaction alone produced low network biomass even lower than l networks at many cases as shown in fig 4 the biomass flow and per capita biomass flow of all networks showed an increase with the increase of species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength except that l networks showed a decrease when connectance and magnitude of strength reached a certain threshold 0 4 and 0 2 respectively in general l nm1 l nm2 h nm1 and h nm2 networks had a higher biomass flow or per capita biomass flow than h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting that dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining higher biomass flow or per capita biomass flow in more complex networks satiated interactions showed lower biomass flow or per capita biomass flow the pcv and ncv of all networks showed an increase with the increase of species number connectance and magnitude of interaction strength fig 5 in general the order of both pcv and ncv was shown as l nm1 and h nm1 l nm2 and h nm2 l and h networks and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high indicating that dome shaped interactions increased variations of both population and network level biomass the values of ncv were much lower than those of pcv in all networks these results showed that dome shaped interactions tended to increase pcv and ncv but ncv was much smaller than pcv indicating asynchronous oscillations within community in general in more complex random networks satiated interaction performed better in maintaining high persistence but poorly in maintaining biomass or biomass flow dome shaped interaction performed better in maintaining both high persistence and biomass or biomass flow a combination of dome shaped and satiated interactions would benefit network biomass dome shaped interaction would cause large variation of both species and network biomass but the latter was much smaller than the former additional analyses suggest the results were similar by using different time steps or time windows fig a 3 a 5 3 2 food webs for the food webs with empirical structure similar results to those of the random networks were obtained but with some slight differences fig 6 the persistence of all food webs showed a decrease with increase of the magnitude of is the order of persistence is h nm2 h nm1 h l nm2 l nm1 l food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting combination of satiated and dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high persistence than other interactions in particular than the l or h interactions the network biomass in food webs decreased with the increase of the magnitude of is in l and h food webs but increased with the magnitude of is in l nm1 l nm2 h nm1 and h nm2 food webs the order of network biomass is h nm1 h nm2 l nm1 l nm2 h l food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high suggesting dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high biomass of networks the biomass flow and per capita biomass flow of all food webs showed an increase with the increase of the magnitude of is the order of biomass flow is l nm1 l nm2 and h nm1 h nm2 l h food webs the order of per capita biomass flow is l nm1 l nm2 l h nm1 h nm2 and h food webs and the difference was much larger when network complexity was high these results suggested that dome shaped interactions performed better in maintaining high biomass and per capita biomass of networks the pcv and ncv of food webs showed little change with the increase of the magnitude of is except that l nm1 and h nm1 food webs showed an increasing trend the pcv and ncv values of l nm1 and h nm1 food webs were larger than other types of food webs when the magnitude of is reached a high level for l nm1 and h nm1 food webs ncv was much lower than pcv these results indicated that dome shaped interaction would result in larger variations of both species and network biomass in more complex networks the variation of network biomass was much smaller than that of species biomass in general in the food web networks dome shaped interaction also performed better in maintaining both high diversity and biomass or biomass flow but it would increase variation of species and network biomass 4 discussion we have theoretically studied the effects of specific non monotonic interactions on both persistence and biomass our simulation results indicated that as compared to the linear or satiated interactions the dome shaped interaction shifting positive to negative interaction with increase of density maintained higher persistence biomass and biomass flow in more complex ecological networks but it resulted in larger variations of both species and network biomass these results were consistent with the empirical observations in natural conditions highlighting the significant role of transition between positive and negative interaction in maintaining biodiversity and stability of ecosystems therefore it is necessary to make further investigation on dome shaped interactions in future studies previous theoretical studies have shown that as the species number and their interactions increase the interaction strength precisely the magnitude of interaction strength must become weak so as to maintain a higher stability in more complex ecological networks allesina and tang 2012 may 1972 mccann et al 1998 neutel et al 2002 the weak interaction can also be achieved by introducing the holling s type 2 or 3 functional response holland et al 2006 which is a way to satiate the per capita interaction strength when prey or resource species population increases soria díaz et al 2017 weak interaction strength either by static weak strength or functional satiation could increase persistence of ecological communities weak interaction has been one of dominant hypotheses in solving the diversity stability debate mccann 2000 alternatively previous theoretical exploration of non monotonic interaction in two species systems suggested the dome shaped interaction might serve as an alternative mechanism for persistence of ecological networks zhang 2003 yan and zhang 2014 reported specific non monotonic interactions e g dome shaped function increased persistence of ecological networks similarly in this study we showed that introduction of dome shaped interactions nm1 and nm2 could increase persistence of networks but the nm2 interaction showed a stronger effect in promoting persistence than nm1 interaction functions in the l networks while in h networks both dome shaped interactions showed similar effects on persistence the difference between nm1 and nm2 interactions indicated that the satiation of interaction strength and non monotonicity are both important stabilizing forces previous studies on the relationship between diversity and biomass have been mainly conducted in natural communities mostly in plant communities such as positive species richness biomass productivity relationships grime 1973 michalet et al 2006 mittelbach et al 2001 however the relationship between community biomass and species interactions is rarely explored consistent to some natural observations we found the network biomass increased with species number of networks for all types of interactions the network biomass showed a minor increase with connectance except in l networks and a mainly dome shaped relationship with interaction strength except in h networks these results suggested that network biomass depended on not only species number but also species interactions the dome shaped relationship of biomass with connectance in l networks and with interaction strength in most types of networks was probably due to reduced number of survived species when connectance and interaction strength were too high at different levels of species number connectance and interaction strength we observed that introduction of dome shaped non monotonic interaction into either l or h networks could increase the network biomass it is notable that although the satiated interaction performed best in maintaining a high persistence in more complex networks it resulted in a very low network biomass suggesting that weak interaction may increase network persistence at the cost of biomass reduction which is not consistent with empirical observations nonetheless dome shaped non monotonic interactions performed better than the other interactions in maintaining both high persistence and biomass in more complex networks which is consistent with empirical observations it has been a long standing view to see natural ecosystems as energy flow systems odum 1968 energy matter flow is related to activity and efficiency of input energy for ecosystems finn 1976 in this study we used the sum of input and output biomass of all species which was the multiplication of interaction strength and species biomass representing the net biomass turn over in the networks therefore it was reasonable that the network biomass flow would increase with increase of species number links and interaction strength the decrease of biomass flow in more complex l networks i e with higher levels of species number links and interaction strength was due to the lower number of survived species i e lower persistence the dome shaped non monotonic interactions showed higher levels of both biomass flow and per capita biomass flow while the h functions showed the lowest biomass flow a higher level of biomass flow for a system indicates a more efficient usage of input energy or matter therefore dome shaped interaction would benefit the ecological efficiency of an ecosystem on the temporal variation of biomass it is widely recognized that high diversity reduces the variation of the total biomass of communities gross et al 2014 hector et al 2010 but there is still debate on the relationship between species richness and population level biomass jiang and pu 2009 in our modeling framework the temporal variation of biomass at population and network level was zero or quite low in l and h networks because population dynamics reached stable equilibriums which is not consistent with empirical observations as suggested in our previous studies dome shaped non monotonic interaction could increase temporal variation of single populations yan and zhang 2014 in this study we found the population and network level temporal variation increased with species number connectance and interaction strength the dome shaped non monotonic functions assumed that the signs of interaction were density dependent which made the population dynamics more difficult to reach equilibriums in more complex networks and then resulted in larger variation of single populations and also higher biomass within a study using the classical rosenzweig macarthur model biomass and productivity were also found to be higher at complex dynamic regimes with chaotic and possibly greater oscillations de feo and rinaldi 1997 however we found the network level biomass variations were much lower than those of population level variations in models with dome shaped interactions these results indicate that in networks with dome shaped interactions more species would help to reduce network biomass variation due to compensation effects among these fluctuating populations or asynchronous oscillation traditionally the mutualistic interaction is believed to be unstable in ecological models because of unbounded population growth caused by inherent positive feedback may 2001 recent studies demonstrated that mutualistic interactions might be stabilizing when they are mixed with antagonistic interactions mougi and kondoh 2012 sauve et al 2014 in fact facilitation effects in plant community have also been extensively reported brooker et al 2008 zhang and yan 2014 discussed the effects of different forms of non monotonic interactions on species coexistence and network persistence among the six non monotonic interactions the density dependent shifting from positive to negative interaction i e dome shaped function has been reported to occur in natural ecosystems such as rodent seed interactions li and zhang 2007 ant aphid interactions addicott 1951 pollinator mediated plants thompson 1988 plant mycorrhizae interaction neuhauser and fargione 2004 from our analyses we demonstrated that the dome shaped non monotonic interaction was important in maintaining not only high persistence but also high biomass in more complex ecosystems our results suggest that positive interactions at low density benefit biomass accumulation while negative interactions at high density benefit persistence species adjusting strategies between mutualisms at low density and competition or predation at high density would be selected by nature at community and network levels this implies the dome shaped interaction may be an alternative mechanism in the evolution of mutualism and in shaping the structure and function of ecosystems we thus appeal for more efforts to study the non monotonic interactions and their roles in maintaining biodiversity persistence and productivity of ecosystems in future studies acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china 31500347 31330013

25333,rhombomys opimus r opimus a social rodent is the main reservoir host for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl in most parts of the middle east and central asia the difficulties in monitoring rodent population patterns have hindered the effective application of preventive measures of zcl this study presents a spatially explicit agent based simulation model of r opimus behaviors that is integrated with geographic automata system gas and a heuristic optimization method cuckoo search cs the model is used to explore the relationships among rodent population dynamics zcl incidence and authority interventions using statistical data generated from simulated rodent societies rather than observational data which are difficult to obtain through field surveys the model simulation considers three agent types rodents colonies and cell agents the model components and overall approach are calibrated investigated with sensitivity analysis and validated with empirical field data in a zcl endemic area in isfahan central iran the results suggest that unsupervised and sporadic preventive measures could cause rodent emigration towards human population centers and start new waves of infections keywords zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis agent based model rhombomys opimus socio ecological interactions optimization 1 introduction cutaneous leishmaniasis cl a vector borne disease infects an estimated 1 5 million people annually in 98 countries throughout latin america africa asia and southern europe who 2010 and unlike most of the neglected tropical diseases it has an increasing incidence karimkhani et al 2016 zoonotic cl zcl infections mainly occur when people are camping hiking or working in areas where species of phlebotomine sand fly and infected mammalian species exist bailey and lockwood 2007 gholamrezaei et al 2016 the infection results in skin lesions within a few weeks or months after a sand fly bites a human the transmission cycle starts when sand flies bite mammalian reservoir hosts for a blood meal and become leishmania parasite vectors this is common in semi arid or desert conditions of old world zcl endemic areas where sand flies tend to live in underground burrows of rodents in order to survive the hot temperature outside especially during the daylight in spring and summer rodents create colonies inside semi permanent underground burrows which can be occupied for many years some burrows can also be empty of colony members and be used just as food storage or shelter these burrows could be located up to 400 m away from the main colony randall and rogovin 2002 the burrow systems can have different geographical sizes and usually have a circular shape with 15 40 m diameter addink et al 2010 sand flies usually roam around the burrows looking for food when there is no direct sunshine environmental modifications such as deforestation agricultural practices and urbanization can concentrate zcl transmission by forcing vectors to feed on humans reithinger et al 2007 both reservoir and vector control are considered by the world health organization to be an important action tool to reduce the zcl transmission risk who 2010 although most of the prevention and control strategies have focused on reducing human vector interactions by using insecticide treated materials and repellents they only provide 50 65 protection against zcl and their long term sustainability is debatable reyburn et al 2000 kolaczinski et al 2004 moreover sand flies have a wide ecological range and are able to find cool shaded humid microhabitats in various places killick kendrick 1999 furthermore reservoir hosts have a more localized epizoological context and habitat distribution reithinger et al 2007 and as the main origin of leishmania protozoan controlling them is a more sustainable strategy however many variables should be considered in reservoir controls which make them complex ashford 1997 and rarely investigated reithinger et al 2007 faulde et al 2009 the latter constructed the main motivation for this study the main zcl reservoir host in the middle east and central asia is the rodent rhombomys opimus gramiccia and gradoni 2005 and its biology needs to be considered by healthcare authorities when developing large scale preventive measures however the large underground colonies adaptability to a wide variety of environmental conditions as well as landscape changes and sociability of this species have hindered efforts by healthcare authorities to suppress the disease burden thus despite the implementation of several control strategies and interventions i e habitat loss and degradation poisoning and destroying of active rodent colonies the disease continues to spread and has caused several re emergences in non endemic areas desjeux 2001 reithinger et al 2007 yaghoobi ershadi et al 2015 chalghaf et al 2016 therefore there is a need to better understand and estimate the patterns of rodent populations and colonizing behaviors i e the rodent distribution and relationships among the landscape rodent colonies and rodent movements exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of rodent populations by performing field surveys is costly and time consuming and requires special equipment and skilled staff in addition rodents are smart social and protective and information regarding potential threats is communicated among colony members making it difficult to catch or monitor rodents tchabovsky et al 2001 most of the countries that host endemic zcl areas have difficulties providing the required equipment and resources making disease control programs difficult to implement and sustain the who described the needs for the development of innovative tools for the control of leishmaniasis reservoirs and for the investigation of preventive ecological interventions who 2010 accordingly the main aim of the present study is to simulate rodent behavior in the rodent environment as a socio ecological system to provide stochastic data on the local variation of rodent populations under different landscape conditions and changes agent based models abms represent a system s individual components as unique and autonomous agents that usually interact with each other and their environment locally railsback and grimm 2011 abms have the flexibility and capacity to explicitly represent a simulation of behaviors and local interactions of individual animals deangelis and grimm 2014 grimm and railsback 2005 and to consider individual behaviors together with landscape characteristics to signify a stochastic representation of species population dynamics as complex socio ecological systems geographic automata systems gas provide a spatial approach to bottom up modeling of complex geographic systems that are comprised of both static and dynamic entities torrens and benenson 2005 in the present study an agent based modeling approach is developed and integrated with a gas approach to model detailed rodent behavior in a spatially heterogeneous and dynamic landscape 2 background abms have been applied to model population structure in a variety of species some of the earlier uses of abms in ecology involved the integration of species behavior and landscape properties into population models however in those works inter species interactions and social behaviors were considered according to predefined static rules or were represented homogenously for the entire population other studies have explicitly modeled complex behaviors and socio ecological interactions of individual species dynamically based on the heterogeneous properties of the landscape providing new insights into population variations watkins et al 2015 carter et al 2015 federico et al 2012 nevertheless the individual based and group based behaviors of social species have not been addressed in such studies although recent studies have incorporated fine scale movements of individuals in a dynamic environment based on a behavioral modeling or decision making process nonaka and holme 2007 tang and bennett 2010 hooten et al 2010 the effects of immediate landscape changes on existing population equilibrium and potential side effects such as public health problems have received little attention however ecological individual based models have been frequently applied to address public health problems and control zoonosis and vector borne diseases maneerat and daudé 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2014 most of the studies using such models have followed the pragmatic approach defined in deangelis and grimm 2014 explicitly representing the individuals for general management purposes however still lacking is a paradigmatic approach deangelis and grimm 2014 for exploring a disease epidemic as a phenomenon within which a socio ecological system is one of the underlying causes of its dynamicity moreover most of the socio ecological individual models use pattern oriented modeling pom approaches to inform their models with real world patterns grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 and investigating these models with a disease pattern has yet to be explored in addition the behavioral model of r opimus and its population dynamics as the main host for widespread diseases such as zcl and plague have been only rarely explored laperrière et al 2016 this study thus presents a simulation of r opimus circadian activity in a spatially heterogeneous environment moreover the modeling of rodent behavior incorporates both individual based and group based interactions rodents form colonies and interact with their colony mates and interact with other colonies to survive by applying the model to isfahan province central iran fig 1 where empirical data on rodents their habitat and zcl incidence have been collected this study demonstrates the application of an abm in simulating rodent population dynamics in association with a public health problem isfahan province has long been known as one of the most important endemic areas of zcl arjmand et al 2014 nadim and faghih 1968 and r opimus is the main reservoir host of zcl in this area emami et al 2009 the area is a semi arid plain located at an altitude of 1400 1600 m and comprises several desertification areas it is surrounded by chains of mountains mostly on the north east and south and contains zayanderud river the largest river in central iran and several cultivated lands irrigated in the river s basin the numbers of infections in isfahan have been high in recent decades including approximately 2000 4000 annual cases and the disease has recently emerged in non endemic regions of the province emami et al 2009 arjmand et al 2014 ramezankhani et al 2017 this study does not incorporate humans as agents however human induced changes are included to explore the consequences of landscape changes on rodent population dynamics e g healthcare related interventions as such the model can be a useful tool for informing healthcare authorities in planning intervention strategies to control the spread of zcl 3 the model this section presents the model developed in this study using the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 3 1 purpose the model purpose is to simulate the dynamics of rodent populations in a heterogeneous landscape agents are designed to reflect the behavior and variations of a population of rodents in a virtual environment that is informed by real landscape data the model considers the effects of landscape changes resulting from healthcare interventions on the distribution and structure of rodent habitats in the landscape and it forecasts population level behaviors of rodents and the potential impacts of the landscape changes on their community 3 2 entities state variables and scales the model is developed based on a multi agent simulation approach and consists of five modeling units three agent types i e rodent colonies rodent agents and cell agents and two geographical components i e landscape characteristics rodent food resources each modeling unit is assigned specific attributes behaviors and parameters as illustrated in supplementary document s1 environment is defined as a combination of cell based and object based representations gas of the components that impact rodent population dynamics cell based modeling is applied when a continuous field conceptual model of geography is needed for example the habitat suitability analysis of rodents is performed in a cell based representation of the landscape object based modeling is applied when a discrete object conceptual model of geography is required for example food resources are represented using object based representation the behavioral rules of agents in this study are first investigated under a static environment within which the landscape remains constant while agent interactions are occurring through time then a dynamic environment is incorporated in the model to explore the impacts of possible landscape changes on the rodent population variations the cellular representation of environment comprises a grid of m n square cells with each cell representing an area of 200 200 m the cell size was chosen based on the minimum distance rodents were expected to move when exploring randomly table 1 landscape class represents the preferred habitat types of rodents including areas undergoing desertification riverside areas and landfills and topographical properties of the study area rodent agent class represents the individual rodent species as basic units assigned to a colony when the colony is created rodents make decisions regarding their colony duties and choose a current state from among the following 1 searching for food 2 carrying food 3 resting to recharge energy 4 helping other rodents 5 random search 6 waiting inside underground burrows for resting or having a vigilant mode in case of threats and 7 dead rodent decisions incorporate parameters that can impact their perception range and energy level rodents from the same colony share a similar habitat preference and similar foraging behavior each rodent agent is described by the following variables age state target current location and current activity behaviorally rodent agents decide on a specific activity at a given time depending on their priorities and move towards targets to fulfill their goals each cell agent represents a cellular automaton that dynamically calculates the habitat suitability of the local environment based on the information collected from the landscape the value of habitat suitability indicates the safety and suitability of the environment for r opimus each cell agent also calculates the local food availability based on the landscape data and produces a food resource object for each cell with a value indicating food quantity habitat suitability values were used to inhabit colonies and least cost movement of their members in a neighborhood subsequently the inhabitation process continues with colony agents seeking optimized locations according to landscape characteristics each cell in this study can contain maximum 4 colony agents table 1 3 3 process overview and scheduling the model processes start after the required parameters and data are prepared for the simulation by a scheduler the scheduler initializes the model by instantiating mobile agents and cell agents and acts as the simulation controller and observer the scheduler also acts as a daily updater for the agents in accordance with their properties according to the incorporated circadian activities of rodents 24 time steps per day are executed in the model the 1 h temporal resolution was considered for this study based on the shortest events that expects to be explored in the rodent agents that is mostly related to their foraging behaviors the model is designed to run over a single rodent activity period starting from early spring until early fall the time frames linked to the simulated processes are illustrated in supplementary document s2 and outlined below each day cell agents use the information received from the scheduler to estimate the rodent habitat suitability and food resource availability then the scheduler locates the colonies with their members across the landscape and the colonies attempt to create rodents next the optimization process starts and during that everything resets at the end of each optimization run for the colonies and their members until an optimal solution i e colony sites was found nevertheless every hour each rodent identifies the goal that best suits its needs according to the rodent s current state and then moves towards a desired target if none of the targets fulfill the rodent s needs it then moves randomly every hour rodent agents update their state which depends on the time of day the behavioral rules of each rodent agent and its movement decision are established in a decision making process see section 3 7 2 3 4 design concepts 3 4 1 emergence rodent population dynamics emerge from the colony level and individual level behaviors of rodents in the environment colony level behaviors emerge from the habitats food distribution and communication of rodents the habitat suitability and food availability change over time according to the effects of interventions of health care authorities on the landscape 3 4 2 adaptation rodents adapt to habitat changes and the presence of adjacent colonies rodent colonies are designed to find optimum places according to the energy consumption and survival probability of the rodent members and resource availability the adaptation process is developed through a fitness seeking process 3 4 3 fitness a fitness seeking process grimm et al 2006 is used in rodent colonies to determine their members landscape properties habitat suitability and food resource availability define the social behaviors and mortality risk as the main parameters for fitness evaluation rodent movement decisions influence the survival of the moving rodent agent and the survival of the colony hence each colony s fitness is indirectly modeled as rodents accessibility to more food with lower cost energy activities 3 4 4 sensing cell agents sense landscape characteristics and mobile agents within their neighborhood cell agents monitor intervention locations and use this memory when estimating habitat suitability rodents sense food resources colony members and their requests the colony agent senses habitat suitability as cell agents and senses its members as rodent agents the colony agent receives the agents collected food and senses neighboring colonies 3 4 5 interactions the scheduler controls the daily light according to the time of day which influences the choice of activity for a rodent cell agents work as a proxy for interactions between rodent and colony agents and the environment because landscape characteristics are accessible only via cell agents i e habitat suitability food resource availability rodent agents interact with each other by sensing each other s requests and by collecting food for a common colony the interactions occur in each time step and allow agents to change their state or make decisions dynamically while interacting with other agents 3 4 6 stochasticity stochastic processes are incorporated into the rodent behaviors to simulate natural variation probability equations assess the probability of an agent moving and foraging the movement location and the likelihoods of habitat change and interventions moreover agents have a 1 chance of selecting a random choice instead of the decision made by the respective sub model a daily random mortality rate is applied to the rodent agents processed by the scheduler in addition a random draw from a uniform distribution determines the order of agent movements 3 4 7 observation individual and colony level processes are observed in each time step and the associated activities such as resting searching for food and helping other agents are recorded in each time step for post processing analysis 3 5 initialization the model is initialized with the characteristics of the study area including topography land cover and zcl incidence table 1 the scheduler loads the information and uses it to instantiate all of the cell agents and to instantiate the colonies the scheduler also modifies the cell agent s attributes in the event of any environmental or human made change 3 6 input data topographic and landscape data such as data on roads rivers villages and cities used for estimating the habitat suitability and food resource availability of rodents were acquired as digitized esri shape file format esri 1998 data from the iranian national cartographic center ncc and the iranian national forest and rangeland organization the zcl notification data together with the intervention activities and active rodent colonies information in isfahan were acquired from the iranian ministry of health moh 3 7 sub models 3 7 1 estimate habitat suitability and food availability landscape characteristics influence the attraction level of each area for different rodent behaviors rodents are attracted to moist areas that can be found in riverbeds and shrubby areas each cell agent has parameters that reflect the habitat suitability and food availability according to the landscape characteristics areas that are subject to intervention activities e g poisoning destroying habitats are recorded in the memory of the cell agents for a predefined time period i e 100 days and their 5 km neighborhood are included as temporary constraints in the model these temporary constraints are assigned lowest suitability and food availability regardless of their landscape characteristics the model uses two sets of landscape data as presented in table 2 together with sample data from known rodent colonies as training data to estimate the habitat suitability and food availability of each cell agent using a logistic regression lr approach lr is used to find the most appropriate model to describe the relationships between a set of independent parameters and both the presence absence of rodent habitats and the availability of food resources the lr involves fitting the dependent variable using an equation of the form hθ x g θtx where g is the sigmoid function defined as g z 1 1 e z and θ t x θ 0 θ 1 x 1 θ n x n is a linear regression of a vector of independent variables and their corresponding coefficients accordingly two logistic regression models were generated with two binary dependent variables indicating the suitability also equivalent to cost of movement subtracted from one in each area and the availability of food resources for rodents supplementary document s3 the final model was assessed for its predictive performance using the area under the roc receiver operating characteristics curve auc and it exhibited good predictive performance with auc 0 875 3 7 2 rodent decision making processes when a rodent agent is assigned to a colony it starts a foraging process based on the current time the availability of food resources and requests received from colony mates accordingly rodents detect a goal and approach it following a set of successive behaviors supplementary document s4 connectivity measures from meta population ecology and least cost path algorithms from graph theory drielsma et al 2007 have been included in the decision making process based on the assumption that animals take the route of least resistance when exploring landscapes watkins et al 2015 3 7 2 1 behavior i deciding on whether to exit burrows the activities of rodents inside and outside of their underground corridors vary with time of day rodent activity outside the burrows during daylight is lower in the spring and summer when direct sun exposure forces them to stay inside their burrows the temperature is regulated inside the underground corridors being neither too hot nor too cold which is favorable for rodent survival in the hot summers and cold winters of the middle east and central asia it is therefore possible that rodents perform some activities even when they are inside corridors in spring and summer rodents are active outside of their burrows at night for longer periods than they are in winter and spring consequently the number of active rodents around each neighborhood is highest two hours before sunset and two hours after sunrise at other times the number of active rodents is lower and it reaches its minimum value around noon thus the probability of exiting the burrows for each rodent was calculated according to the time of day with time steps closer to sunrise or sunset generating a higher probability of agents moving outside of the burrows in the form p 1 min t i t max d where ti is the current time tmax is sundown or sunrise and d represents a 12 h time period a rodent would decide to exit the colony when u 0 1 p where u 0 1 is a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 3 7 2 2 behavior ii estimating a potential perception range the perception range was estimated within the maximum perception range pmax of the rodents using a stochastic function u 0 pmax to generate a uniform random deviate between 0 and pmax table 1 perception range here refers to a buffer zone centered on the rodent and represents the environment agents objects and help requests that a rodent agent can sense 3 7 2 3 behavior iii search for potential targets the agents search for all food objects and help requests within their designated perception range behavior ii if there are none a random deviate u 0 100 is generated and the rodent will decide either to stay underground 50 or search for a new perception range 50 which will be estimated between the current perception range and the maximum perception range if all of the potential targets are far away then the agent starts a random search and selects four targets from the closest available objects 3 7 2 4 behavior iv select a target to select one of the candidates acquired from behavior iii the agent performs a suitability analysis to prioritize the sensed objects the rodent divides the available objects into i requests and ii food objects and compares each set separately with the help requests given higher priority the spatial links drielsma et al 2007 between the colony and each of the candidate targets are calculated using dijkstra 1959 s least cost paths algorithm over the habitat suitability grid next the accumulated costs of the paths dij to targets are calculated using drielsma et al 2007 s proposed method then the link value of the path is calculated using a dispersal kernel l ij f i f j e αd ij based on the food availability at the target fi and at the colony fi the accessibility of each target dij and agent s perception range α thus the selection probability of a certain target pj from among all considered objects n is calculated as p i e l j j 1 n e l j zarembka 1974 li et al 2015 next a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 is created if the deviate is smaller than the selection probability pi the agent selects object i as its target 3 7 2 5 behavior v movement the movement paths of each agent towards a desired target and back to the colony are set based on the spatial links drielsma et al 2007 calculated via dijkstra 1959 s least cost paths algorithm within a raster spatial data format in each time step the rodent moves within the range of u 1 25 cells and selects the first order moore neighborhood weisstein 2005 cells following a pre specified least cost path behavior iv towards a target during the movement the rodent updates its energy level according to the cost of underlying cell using the equation current energy cost 0 1 when a rodent reaches a target recharges its energy and when it returns to colony depletes the 50 of food availability of the previously approached target 3 7 3 reproduction and dispersal colonies increase their population in a reproduction process and communicate with other colonies via a dispersal process for each successful foraging process of a rodent the colony agent enables the rodent agent to reproduce according to a predefined litter size in a range of u 4 7 table 1 the dispersal process starts when a colony reaches its maximum population size and more than half of its population is successfully searching for food during dispersal the colony agent looks for the closest colonies that were found during the optimization process and assigns u 0 0 43 proportion of its population to that colony table 1 3 7 4 cuckoo search rodent colonies are attracted to sites that potentially offer a more suitable environment and available food thus the suitability of a location for a rodent colony is determined by the suitability of the underlying cell the availability of food in the neighborhood the suitability of the paths to the food resources and the level of reproduction and iteraction with other colonies in addition the colonies search space comprises various properties of landscapes in a real world like environment which makes the process of searching for suitable colony sites difficult slow and often inefficient hence the search process of colony agents is considered as an optimization problem in this study and a meta heuristic approach called cuckoo search cs proposed by yang and deb 2009 is adopted for the colonizing behavior of rodent populations the algorithm is based on the obligate brood parasitic behavior of some cuckoo species in combination with the lèvy flight behavior of some birds and fruit flies yang and deb 2009 lèvy flight presents a more efficient exploration of large search spaces applying a fast local search approach followed by a randomization process which makes sure the model will not be trapped in a local optimum the colony agent searches for optimal neighborhoods of habitat suitability and uses a heuristic fitness seeking approach using cs based on the survival and foraging activities of its members to evaluate the current site once the colony agent locates a neighborhood with optimal properties it stops the search process however the agent constantly monitors colony fitness and restarts the search process once a threat is identified thus a solution for the cs is defined as a colony with its neighborhood consisting of a collection of cell agents that are suitable for meeting the rodents socio ecological requirements colonies are assigned a primary number of members with a minimum of five members and the members begin reproducing and extending their colony range once a colony creates them the mortality risk is assigned to colony members based on their age using the equation mortality 0 001 age and a rodent agent without energy dies if there was no food resources or colony within its maximum perception range 3 7 4 1 cuckoo search algorithm yang and deb 2009 proposed three main rules as the basic steps of cuckoo search 1 each cuckoo lays one egg at a time and dumps it in a randomly chosen nest 2 the best nests with high quality of eggs will carry over to the next generation 3 the number of available host nest is fixed and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with the probability of paє 0 1 for generating new solution x t 1 for cuckoo i a lèvy flight is performed as 1 x i t 1 x i t α l è vy λ where α is the step size and α o 1 is used in this study the product deals with entry wise multiplications process however lèvy flights provide a random walk whereas their random step lengths are drawn from a lèvy distribution which has an infinite variance with an infinite mean 2 l è vy u t λ w h e r e 1 λ 3 each egg in a nest represents a solution i e colony site and a cuckoo egg represent a new solution the aim is to use the new and potentially better solutions cuckoos to replace a not so good solution in the nests the quality or fitness of a solution is defined to be proportional to the value of an objective function which aims to maximize the survival of a colony using habitat value collected food by the members and reproduction of rodents in each run the pa fraction of the nests is replaced with new random solutions at new locations here the consecutive jumps of a cuckoo form a random walk process which obeys a power law step length distribution with a heavy tail pseudo code of the cuckoo search algorithm is presented in supplementary document s5 3 7 5 spatially explicit environment a geographic automata system gas torrens and benenson 2005 was used to benefit from both cellular automata and agent based techniques to represent rodent population dynamics the broader objective was to provide a spatially explicit approach for representing the spatial heterogeneity of the environment as comprised of landscape attributes e g land cover topography disease cases intervention areas and agent objects i e rodent colonies rodents cell agents thus the model is enabled to consider the heterogeneity of space and spatial behaviors explicitly rajabi et al 2016 according to torrens and benenson 2005 a gas consists of the seven following components 3 g a s k s t s l m l n r n where k indicates a set of automata types in gas the first pair denotes a set of states s and state transition rules ts that are associated with gas in the second pair l dictates the location of automata in the system and ml denotes the movement rules for automata in the third pair n represents the neighbors of automata and rn represents the rules that govern changes of the automata relative to other automata 3 8 model implementation the model was implemented using the object oriented programming language java http java sun com within the repast agent based modeling toolkit version 2 3 1 http repast sourceforge net all of the geographical information and spatial analysis was performed using arcgis software version 10 3 and the data were then integrated into the model 3 9 simulation experiments the simulation represents the spatial patterns of rodent activities within the spring and summer in isfahan central iran isfahan is one of the most important zcl endemic areas in iran and several rodent colonies have been identified within this area fig 2 a shows the number of zcl infections that occurred over a 7 year period although many rodent colonies are destroyed annually during healthcare interventions the colonies are continuing to spread across isfahan causing many zcl infections fig 2b isfahan is a highly populated area of iran and an important region of agriculture most of the victims of zcl are villagers who are at their farms or orchards during the early morning or evenings moh 2013 fig 2c fig 2 represents a general view of zcl endemicity in isfahan highlighting that densly populated areas in norhwestern part of the study area comprise highest amount of rodent colonies and also suffer from high number of zcl cases the dense areas in northeastern part of isfahan also suffer from high number of disease cases even though the rodent colonies are fewer in this part there are also several villages in less populated areas of southern isfahan with sporadic but growing numbers of zcl infections and active colonies which has raised concern over zcl emergence in these areas there is a need for prevention measures to diminish the prevalence of the disease which mainly originates from r opimus colonies in this context the distribution and activities of rodent colonies in isfahan were simulated during the simulation rodent colonies were subjected to healthcare interventions and their members activities were observed 3 10 model calibration primary information on rodent colonies and their behaviors in the study area were acquired from healthcare authorities and field surveys and were used to calibrate and validate the simulation model developed in this study the simulation started by introducing the entities and classes to the simulation environment and by calibrating the sub models using the disease incidence and rodent pattern data 3 11 model performance evaluation the model performance was evaluated according to the approach presented by bennett et al 2013 for evaluating environmental models the predicted patterns of rodent activities were firstly examined using observed rodent colonies in the proximity of three most infected areas in isfahan including paygah ejhiye and varzaneh to examine the simulation results two popular performance investigation indices were used i hit rate and ii kappa statistics bennett et al 2013 the hit rate was applied with the ideal value equal to 1 as suggested by li et al 2015 to assess the ratio of simulated rodent activities in the neighborhood of three targeted endemic sites to all observed rodent activities on the other side the kappa statistic was applied to evaluate the similarities between observed and predicted rodent activity patterns locally moreover the relative change of simulated rodent activities after the implementation of interventions was also evaluated using observed zcl infections hence a rate of change was calculated for both observed zcl infections and simulated rodent activities after the interventions and then spearman s rho were used to assess whether they are significantly correlated a near perfect correlation would be indicated by a rho value close to 1 with p 0 05 li et al 2015 3 12 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis in this study was focused on the parameters of the models that influenced the main outputs a sensitivity score was calculated following the approach presented in railsback and grimm 2011 by using the default parameter values with 20 variation and monitoring the changes in rodent patterns 4 results 4 1 predicted pattern results the model was run for 1000 daily time steps with the default settings and values of habitat suitability and food availability across isfahan supplementary document s3 the simulation pattern was considered to reach equilibrium when the colonies were located at optimal locations fig 3 a at this stage the cuckoo search process was stopped and a fresh model run was triggered within which the activity patterns of agents were observed fig 3 figure 3b during the first 100 150 days after the equilibrium the rodent population experienced significant variation in size because the colony agents were allowed to start reproduction behavior again according to their neighborhood characteristics fig 4 a all of the colony members were expected to perform their assigned circadian activities and their states were observed during each time step fig 5 a the results indicated that most of the rodents were either carrying food to their colonies or resting inside their burrows during model run the random activities were at a low frequency during this time because of the optimized locations of the colonies and there were always a high proportion of members helping other colony mates in this way the rodent daily activities and movement flows created a spatial pattern that represented their activity range and territories fig 3b accordingly the majority of rodent activities were simulated to primarily occur in desertification areas located far from the major human population centers this reflected the suitability of the desertification areas for circadian activities which caused most rodent agents to select a limited search range and remain close to their colonies colonies at closer distances to a desertification area acquired higher reproduction rates and started to extend their colonies by extending their social communication and generating several nested colonies with their dispersal behavior fig 6 a the most central colony was identified in ejhiye where the central colony interacted with most of the colonies in study area and also dispersed quite a lot of rodents towards its nested colonies fig 6b however the most populated area with rodent members was at the varzaneh area where most of the nested colonies were crowded and highly connected via dispersals on the other side some big colonies were also simulated at the paygah area with small nested colonies fig 6a moreover existing of a few sporadic colonies in the southern part of varzaneh and a centralized weakly connected colony in the western ejhiye at nikabad region also was worth mentioning to explore the population dynamics of rodents after a change in their neighborhood the locations of all interventions were acquired from the iranian ministry of health and entered into the simulations fig 3c the interventions in isfahan mostly include poisoning thus the physical characteristics of the environment e g land cover remained unchanged however the intervened areas received penalty for the habitat suitability and food availability hence the spatial distribution of rodent colonies optimized after an intervention event and the rodent activities were tracked fig 3d after the change in the environment the cuckoo search process was triggered again to find the new optimal sites for rodent colonization the spatial pattern of rodent activities indicated that the intensity of their activities was decreased generally however their activity ranges were expanded and new parts of study area were covered by rodent activities thus the activities of rodents decreased significantly during the intervention and the results highlighted that rodents explored areas located far from their colonies in their search processes fig 3d during the intervention the amount of food in the colonies was set to zero the optimized search process was activated to relocate the rodents home ranges this caused a significant decrease in the total rodent population as represented by the spike in the population diagram in fig 4b after the intervention occurred at day 350 although large numbers of rodents died after the interventions the colonies were located at another optimal location for their members subsequently reaching a new equilibrium at this stage the rodents returned to their normal daily activities with fewer colony mates fig 4b the states of colonies after the interventions were also monitored and the results indicated that the remaining rodents were mostly staying underground which simulates the vigilant mode of rodents in real world when they sense a threat fig 5b moreover a high proportion of rodents were searching for food and almost the same amount of rodents helping their colony mates increased number of dead rodents and random searches could also be notified in their activities after the intervention fig 5b however the number of food carriers was low which explains why so many rodents were at the search mode the non food carriers had to return to their colonies to refuel and many of them died possibly due to the lack of food in newly searched areas accordingly the rodent agents invested more time in foraging activities outside of the burrows and their movement ranges expanded towards the population centers where the habitat suitability values were higher fig 7 simulated colonies provided rodent releases in both human resident and non resident areas figs figure 2c 7 across the study area the results indicate that the rodent activity pattern after the interventions was largely influenced by the geographical characteristics of desertification areas over the intervention period with the exception of colonies adjacent to desertification areas all of the rodent colonies displayed rodent activities in human resident neighborhoods the structure and interactions between colonies after the intervention indicated that the sporadic colonies in the southern part of varzaneh were disappeared and colonies around paygah region strengthen their interconnections fig 7 the main reason for this could be because of the lack of intervention activities around this area because of military issues hence the sporadic intervention activities around this area made the colonies more connected and pushed them to the vicinity of population centers the most prominent change after intervention was the movement of colonies in southern part of paygah towards the big city of isfahan fig 7b and appearance of a strongly connected in the western part of ejhiye fig 7c on the other side the ejhiye colonies kept their centrality in the study area and instead increased their internal relationships however colonies in this area mostly migrated towards the farms and orchards in the southern ejhiye in the vicinity of zayande river in the varzaneh area the interventions made the colonies to change their locations towards population centers and made their dispersal interactions weaker which shows the limited amount of food availability around these part of study area fig 7d 4 2 sensitivity analysis results a sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed before and after the interventions and their sensitivity was found to be different at these two situations table 3 the largest disparity in response was observed for the parameters movement length and perception range however parameter litter size had also a high sensitivity score the results indicated that for the before intervention case the sensitivity scores were lower and the after intervention case was much more sensitive to changes in all of the parameters table 3 rodent activities were slightly sensitive to the changes in the litter sizes of rodent agents and perception range and the model sensitivity to food availability was very weak increases in the litter sizes of rodents influenced the reproduction rate of colony agents and contributed to increases of movements in almost all areas with suitable food the latter explains the higher sensitivity of model after the interventions occurred when high proportions of agents are searching for colony and food increases in perception range and movement length influenced rodent activity near colonies and increased rodent activity in areas far from colonies overall the results indicated a reasonable stability in the model and highlighted the parameters which should be noticed during data collection and model calibration parameters cell size colony size energy decrease and initial number of colonies acted similarly with or without interventions finally the model appeared to be least sensitive to variation in cell size and initial number of colonies 4 3 evaluation and validation of results following bennett et al 2013 the model performance was assessed visually at the initial step in which the identification of several under or non detected patterns would indicate poor performance and challenge the reliability of the model thus the observed distributions of rodents and observed rodent activities were explored to obtain an overview of the model performance fig 3 general consistency between the simulated activities and observed colonies was observed for most of the areas in isfahan comparison between observed zcl infections and simulated rodent activities indicated that most of the villages and districts with high numbers of infections were located in vicinity of highest rodent activity areas there were also a few undetected patterns in areas with relatively high numbers of infections which might due to the simplified rodents decision making or heuristic nature of colony search process the quantitative assessment of model performance is presented in table 4 the calculated matrices for the selected endemic areas indicate satisfactory performance regarding the model predictions as to the rodents activity all three hit rates were higher than 0 8 regarding kappa indices the values indicated moderate agreement between rodent activity prediction and observation 0 6 the spearman s rho values were all significant p 0 05 and their values were all higher than 0 65 which supports the correlation and similarity between the predicted change in rodent activity and observed zcl cases after the interventions at each endemic site table 4 5 discussion the model presented here represents a spatially explicit agent based model of rodent population dynamics in a real world context a pattern oriented modeling approach was adapted into the simulation the stochastic nature of the model enabled the assessment of interventions and their specific effects on rodent population persistence and resilience over time as well as their population level spatiotemporal patterns and interactions the whole model application was validated using coarse level observations of rodent activities the validation results indicated that the behavior of the simulated rodent groups were consistent with the patterns of the zcl disease and colonies in isfahan the performance of the model was also tested using the spatial distribution of rodent s activities and relative change of the zcl infections after interventions and overall satisfactory results were achieved the results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the stability of the model when simulating the dynamics of rodent populations in the study area the results highlight the importance of considering spatially explicit environments when investigating the implications of healthcare preventive measures on population dynamics areas with the highest rodent activity were generally near desertification areas human resident areas close to desertification areas were found to be sensitive to future intervention changes in rodent colonies in relation to zcl infections thus these areas should be prioritized in the future plans of healthcare authorities however the number of zcl infections in areas far from major rodent colonies has the potential to greatly increase after interventions due to the rodent migrations on the other side the simulated structure of colonies and their connections highlighted the social interactions of colonies and individual based nature of model indicated their behaviors before and after interventions hence sparse interventions in some cases such as paygah region led to expansion of home ranges and strengthening of the rodents social interactions which consequently could result in higher number of infections in these areas in varzaneh area the interventions pushed the colonies towards farms and orchards which possibly could turn them into agricultural pests it should also be noticed most of the colonies appeared after the interventions and leishmania parasites persist in r opimus for a long time up to 25 month abai et al 2010 thus even with a short absence the infections might emerge in non endemic areas although this study does not include direct impacts of vector population on the zcl spread the effect of interventions on zcl prevalence can be discussed from a vector related perspective indirectly it is worth mentioning that interventions also influence the vector population cohabiting with the rodent communities in their underground burrows the interventions by reducing the population of rodent hosts could shift biting behavior of sandflies towards other blood sources including humans this could cause a short term spike in the number of zcl cases in some parts of study area the predictions from the current study could be used to support strategic planning for regional and national level public health management for zcl disease for which full detailed observation data on rodent activity is largely missing it could also be used to design future data collection scenarios for fine scale investigations moreover the model can be modified to include the effects of a variety of change elements on rodent populations such as urban growth climate change and forms of human disturbance such as infrastructure projects and farming near rodent colonies there is a need for future investigations to identify key environmental changes that might impact the spatiotemporal pattern of rodent activities and thus the status of zcl infections the seasonal variation of leishmania parasites in r opimus population shall also be considered in understanding zcl spread and planning control strategies akhavan et al 2010 showed the dynamicity of leishmania infections in rodent population in an endemic area in central iran with lowest rate in summer and highest rate in fall this dynamicity could also be coupled with intervention scenarios in future studies of zcl the current model exhibits a flexible loosely coupled structure that allows it to be readily integrated with other models for example researchers could couple the present model with an entomological model for sand fly population simulation and integrate it with human behaviors to simulate the entire zcl disease transmission cycle mclane et al 2011 outlined the necessary elements of an abm in wildlife ecology applications i representation of the environment ii animal behavior iii animal movement rules and iv memory and learning the model is discussed below with respect to these elements 5 1 representation of the environment a real world representation of the environment is applied in this study in which both object based and cell based representations are defined the rodent behaviors are simulated in a dynamic environment to derive the activity patterns and explore the effects of interventions however the intervention information was only available at a coarse level and thus future research conducted with intervention information at a finer scale is encouraged although data collection processes for rodent colonies can be costly and time consuming future studies could explore how finer scale information on rodent colonies could be used in socio ecological studies moreover the environmental categories considered in the habitat analysis of rodents could be extended for example industrial complexes and housing sites in suburbs might be suitable locations for rodent foraging behaviors and thus could be considered in future studies 5 2 animal behavior the modeling of rodent behaviors is a major challenge that should have been addressed earlier in socio ecological studies the continual adaptation and change in state of rodent agents and their decision rules are defined here based on a decision making process the colonization of rodents was simulated as a direct fitness seeking behavior using the cs optimization approach however due to data limitation the reproduction of rodents is simulated only at colony level in the current model in future studies the individual level reproduction behaviors of rodents could be included allowing the social behaviors of rodents in developing their colonies and rodent population growth to be represented in greater detail the migratory behavior of rodents upon encountering intervention changes was considered as an indirect fitness seeking behavior in the current model another indirect fitness seeking trait considered in this model was rodent dispersal in which part of a rodent population decides to move away and generate a new colony without facing any threat or change the main focus of this study was on the behaviors of rodent species as the main reservoir host for zcl disease in the context of scenario planning for interventions by healthcare authorities however public health scenarios also involve multi species interactions between rodents and sand flies which should motivate additional studies in the future moreover interactions among rodents sand flies and other animals e g livestock that could contribute to high densities of sand fly populations even among animals that are not reservoirs could be evaluated in future studies 5 3 animal movement rules there were two types of rodent movements in this study the movement of colonies towards an optimal site and the movement of rodent agents in the vicinity of their colony sites these movements were designed as responses to long term goals such as avoidance of population extinction and short term objectives such as foraging survival and reproduction however other short term or long term goals such as avoiding local predators or habitat saturation might also influence rodent movements and be addressed in future studies a cost benefit scenario was applied to the individual level movements of rodents to integrate both habitat quantity and spatial configuration information the integrated approach was used in a predefined network of decisions according to rodents internal states once a rodent s internal state allow it to move toward a particular goal a least cost path to the target was considered the short and mid range rodent movements in this study were mostly goal oriented and less than 1 of the movements were random hence random walk scenarios could be utilized for the random movements of rodents in future studies however for the colony level movements a scale free type of random walk called lèvy flight was applied under a cuckoo search optimization to explore the entire study area for colonization 5 4 memory and learning rodents especially r opimus are intelligent species that can adapt to different situations using their effective memory and quick learning abilities an episodic memory is considered for the cell agents in this study where the past experiences of interventions are retained in memory for a certain time period although goal oriented movements of rodents and their colonies were designed based on principles from meta population and landscape ecology the cognitive abilities of rodents could also be included in future studies for example the individual and community level sensation and perception behaviors of the rodents under different stress levels e g under vigilance remain largely unknown and could be explored in the future due to a lack of information on the learning ability of r opimus rodents their learning processes and spatial memory were not considered in the present study artificial neural networks anns are powerful approaches that could be applied to mimic rodent learning behaviors in future studies however the limited availability of training data involving rodent learning behavior remains a major challenge for ann methods 5 5 limitations an important challenge in agent based modeling is model performance evaluation especially in a data poor context additional observational data on rodent activity would facilitate the detailed quantitative evaluation of rodent behaviors in future studies the low availability of such data is a recurring challenge in modeling efforts bennett et al 2013 li et al 2015 filatova et al 2013 qualitative model evaluation might be an alternative for future model developments li et al 2015 the qualitative performance of simulation models that focus on a species of public health could be assessed using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua saltelli et al 2008 to identify the origin of uncertainties and provide insights for future data collection processes 6 conclusions an agent based model was developed to explore rodent population activities by synthesizing theories regarding habitat suitability analysis optimization and behavior modeling within a spatially explicit environment validation was performed using field data and indicated a significant correlation between the simulated rodent activity existing colonies and zcl infections the model was applied to isfahan and the results showed that i colonies with a high level of activity are those close to desertification areas and ii interventions can eliminate weakly connected colonies and sporadic interventions could expand the home ranges of current colonies the results reveal how habitat configurations and human made changes impact rodent communities and provide insight into rodent population dynamics the model presents a flexible and predictive framework for the management of rodent related public health problems acknowledgements the first author of this study acknowledges the

25333,rhombomys opimus r opimus a social rodent is the main reservoir host for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis zcl in most parts of the middle east and central asia the difficulties in monitoring rodent population patterns have hindered the effective application of preventive measures of zcl this study presents a spatially explicit agent based simulation model of r opimus behaviors that is integrated with geographic automata system gas and a heuristic optimization method cuckoo search cs the model is used to explore the relationships among rodent population dynamics zcl incidence and authority interventions using statistical data generated from simulated rodent societies rather than observational data which are difficult to obtain through field surveys the model simulation considers three agent types rodents colonies and cell agents the model components and overall approach are calibrated investigated with sensitivity analysis and validated with empirical field data in a zcl endemic area in isfahan central iran the results suggest that unsupervised and sporadic preventive measures could cause rodent emigration towards human population centers and start new waves of infections keywords zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis agent based model rhombomys opimus socio ecological interactions optimization 1 introduction cutaneous leishmaniasis cl a vector borne disease infects an estimated 1 5 million people annually in 98 countries throughout latin america africa asia and southern europe who 2010 and unlike most of the neglected tropical diseases it has an increasing incidence karimkhani et al 2016 zoonotic cl zcl infections mainly occur when people are camping hiking or working in areas where species of phlebotomine sand fly and infected mammalian species exist bailey and lockwood 2007 gholamrezaei et al 2016 the infection results in skin lesions within a few weeks or months after a sand fly bites a human the transmission cycle starts when sand flies bite mammalian reservoir hosts for a blood meal and become leishmania parasite vectors this is common in semi arid or desert conditions of old world zcl endemic areas where sand flies tend to live in underground burrows of rodents in order to survive the hot temperature outside especially during the daylight in spring and summer rodents create colonies inside semi permanent underground burrows which can be occupied for many years some burrows can also be empty of colony members and be used just as food storage or shelter these burrows could be located up to 400 m away from the main colony randall and rogovin 2002 the burrow systems can have different geographical sizes and usually have a circular shape with 15 40 m diameter addink et al 2010 sand flies usually roam around the burrows looking for food when there is no direct sunshine environmental modifications such as deforestation agricultural practices and urbanization can concentrate zcl transmission by forcing vectors to feed on humans reithinger et al 2007 both reservoir and vector control are considered by the world health organization to be an important action tool to reduce the zcl transmission risk who 2010 although most of the prevention and control strategies have focused on reducing human vector interactions by using insecticide treated materials and repellents they only provide 50 65 protection against zcl and their long term sustainability is debatable reyburn et al 2000 kolaczinski et al 2004 moreover sand flies have a wide ecological range and are able to find cool shaded humid microhabitats in various places killick kendrick 1999 furthermore reservoir hosts have a more localized epizoological context and habitat distribution reithinger et al 2007 and as the main origin of leishmania protozoan controlling them is a more sustainable strategy however many variables should be considered in reservoir controls which make them complex ashford 1997 and rarely investigated reithinger et al 2007 faulde et al 2009 the latter constructed the main motivation for this study the main zcl reservoir host in the middle east and central asia is the rodent rhombomys opimus gramiccia and gradoni 2005 and its biology needs to be considered by healthcare authorities when developing large scale preventive measures however the large underground colonies adaptability to a wide variety of environmental conditions as well as landscape changes and sociability of this species have hindered efforts by healthcare authorities to suppress the disease burden thus despite the implementation of several control strategies and interventions i e habitat loss and degradation poisoning and destroying of active rodent colonies the disease continues to spread and has caused several re emergences in non endemic areas desjeux 2001 reithinger et al 2007 yaghoobi ershadi et al 2015 chalghaf et al 2016 therefore there is a need to better understand and estimate the patterns of rodent populations and colonizing behaviors i e the rodent distribution and relationships among the landscape rodent colonies and rodent movements exploring the spatiotemporal dynamics of rodent populations by performing field surveys is costly and time consuming and requires special equipment and skilled staff in addition rodents are smart social and protective and information regarding potential threats is communicated among colony members making it difficult to catch or monitor rodents tchabovsky et al 2001 most of the countries that host endemic zcl areas have difficulties providing the required equipment and resources making disease control programs difficult to implement and sustain the who described the needs for the development of innovative tools for the control of leishmaniasis reservoirs and for the investigation of preventive ecological interventions who 2010 accordingly the main aim of the present study is to simulate rodent behavior in the rodent environment as a socio ecological system to provide stochastic data on the local variation of rodent populations under different landscape conditions and changes agent based models abms represent a system s individual components as unique and autonomous agents that usually interact with each other and their environment locally railsback and grimm 2011 abms have the flexibility and capacity to explicitly represent a simulation of behaviors and local interactions of individual animals deangelis and grimm 2014 grimm and railsback 2005 and to consider individual behaviors together with landscape characteristics to signify a stochastic representation of species population dynamics as complex socio ecological systems geographic automata systems gas provide a spatial approach to bottom up modeling of complex geographic systems that are comprised of both static and dynamic entities torrens and benenson 2005 in the present study an agent based modeling approach is developed and integrated with a gas approach to model detailed rodent behavior in a spatially heterogeneous and dynamic landscape 2 background abms have been applied to model population structure in a variety of species some of the earlier uses of abms in ecology involved the integration of species behavior and landscape properties into population models however in those works inter species interactions and social behaviors were considered according to predefined static rules or were represented homogenously for the entire population other studies have explicitly modeled complex behaviors and socio ecological interactions of individual species dynamically based on the heterogeneous properties of the landscape providing new insights into population variations watkins et al 2015 carter et al 2015 federico et al 2012 nevertheless the individual based and group based behaviors of social species have not been addressed in such studies although recent studies have incorporated fine scale movements of individuals in a dynamic environment based on a behavioral modeling or decision making process nonaka and holme 2007 tang and bennett 2010 hooten et al 2010 the effects of immediate landscape changes on existing population equilibrium and potential side effects such as public health problems have received little attention however ecological individual based models have been frequently applied to address public health problems and control zoonosis and vector borne diseases maneerat and daudé 2016 wang et al 2016 li et al 2014 most of the studies using such models have followed the pragmatic approach defined in deangelis and grimm 2014 explicitly representing the individuals for general management purposes however still lacking is a paradigmatic approach deangelis and grimm 2014 for exploring a disease epidemic as a phenomenon within which a socio ecological system is one of the underlying causes of its dynamicity moreover most of the socio ecological individual models use pattern oriented modeling pom approaches to inform their models with real world patterns grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 and investigating these models with a disease pattern has yet to be explored in addition the behavioral model of r opimus and its population dynamics as the main host for widespread diseases such as zcl and plague have been only rarely explored laperrière et al 2016 this study thus presents a simulation of r opimus circadian activity in a spatially heterogeneous environment moreover the modeling of rodent behavior incorporates both individual based and group based interactions rodents form colonies and interact with their colony mates and interact with other colonies to survive by applying the model to isfahan province central iran fig 1 where empirical data on rodents their habitat and zcl incidence have been collected this study demonstrates the application of an abm in simulating rodent population dynamics in association with a public health problem isfahan province has long been known as one of the most important endemic areas of zcl arjmand et al 2014 nadim and faghih 1968 and r opimus is the main reservoir host of zcl in this area emami et al 2009 the area is a semi arid plain located at an altitude of 1400 1600 m and comprises several desertification areas it is surrounded by chains of mountains mostly on the north east and south and contains zayanderud river the largest river in central iran and several cultivated lands irrigated in the river s basin the numbers of infections in isfahan have been high in recent decades including approximately 2000 4000 annual cases and the disease has recently emerged in non endemic regions of the province emami et al 2009 arjmand et al 2014 ramezankhani et al 2017 this study does not incorporate humans as agents however human induced changes are included to explore the consequences of landscape changes on rodent population dynamics e g healthcare related interventions as such the model can be a useful tool for informing healthcare authorities in planning intervention strategies to control the spread of zcl 3 the model this section presents the model developed in this study using the odd overview design concepts details protocol grimm et al 2006 2010 3 1 purpose the model purpose is to simulate the dynamics of rodent populations in a heterogeneous landscape agents are designed to reflect the behavior and variations of a population of rodents in a virtual environment that is informed by real landscape data the model considers the effects of landscape changes resulting from healthcare interventions on the distribution and structure of rodent habitats in the landscape and it forecasts population level behaviors of rodents and the potential impacts of the landscape changes on their community 3 2 entities state variables and scales the model is developed based on a multi agent simulation approach and consists of five modeling units three agent types i e rodent colonies rodent agents and cell agents and two geographical components i e landscape characteristics rodent food resources each modeling unit is assigned specific attributes behaviors and parameters as illustrated in supplementary document s1 environment is defined as a combination of cell based and object based representations gas of the components that impact rodent population dynamics cell based modeling is applied when a continuous field conceptual model of geography is needed for example the habitat suitability analysis of rodents is performed in a cell based representation of the landscape object based modeling is applied when a discrete object conceptual model of geography is required for example food resources are represented using object based representation the behavioral rules of agents in this study are first investigated under a static environment within which the landscape remains constant while agent interactions are occurring through time then a dynamic environment is incorporated in the model to explore the impacts of possible landscape changes on the rodent population variations the cellular representation of environment comprises a grid of m n square cells with each cell representing an area of 200 200 m the cell size was chosen based on the minimum distance rodents were expected to move when exploring randomly table 1 landscape class represents the preferred habitat types of rodents including areas undergoing desertification riverside areas and landfills and topographical properties of the study area rodent agent class represents the individual rodent species as basic units assigned to a colony when the colony is created rodents make decisions regarding their colony duties and choose a current state from among the following 1 searching for food 2 carrying food 3 resting to recharge energy 4 helping other rodents 5 random search 6 waiting inside underground burrows for resting or having a vigilant mode in case of threats and 7 dead rodent decisions incorporate parameters that can impact their perception range and energy level rodents from the same colony share a similar habitat preference and similar foraging behavior each rodent agent is described by the following variables age state target current location and current activity behaviorally rodent agents decide on a specific activity at a given time depending on their priorities and move towards targets to fulfill their goals each cell agent represents a cellular automaton that dynamically calculates the habitat suitability of the local environment based on the information collected from the landscape the value of habitat suitability indicates the safety and suitability of the environment for r opimus each cell agent also calculates the local food availability based on the landscape data and produces a food resource object for each cell with a value indicating food quantity habitat suitability values were used to inhabit colonies and least cost movement of their members in a neighborhood subsequently the inhabitation process continues with colony agents seeking optimized locations according to landscape characteristics each cell in this study can contain maximum 4 colony agents table 1 3 3 process overview and scheduling the model processes start after the required parameters and data are prepared for the simulation by a scheduler the scheduler initializes the model by instantiating mobile agents and cell agents and acts as the simulation controller and observer the scheduler also acts as a daily updater for the agents in accordance with their properties according to the incorporated circadian activities of rodents 24 time steps per day are executed in the model the 1 h temporal resolution was considered for this study based on the shortest events that expects to be explored in the rodent agents that is mostly related to their foraging behaviors the model is designed to run over a single rodent activity period starting from early spring until early fall the time frames linked to the simulated processes are illustrated in supplementary document s2 and outlined below each day cell agents use the information received from the scheduler to estimate the rodent habitat suitability and food resource availability then the scheduler locates the colonies with their members across the landscape and the colonies attempt to create rodents next the optimization process starts and during that everything resets at the end of each optimization run for the colonies and their members until an optimal solution i e colony sites was found nevertheless every hour each rodent identifies the goal that best suits its needs according to the rodent s current state and then moves towards a desired target if none of the targets fulfill the rodent s needs it then moves randomly every hour rodent agents update their state which depends on the time of day the behavioral rules of each rodent agent and its movement decision are established in a decision making process see section 3 7 2 3 4 design concepts 3 4 1 emergence rodent population dynamics emerge from the colony level and individual level behaviors of rodents in the environment colony level behaviors emerge from the habitats food distribution and communication of rodents the habitat suitability and food availability change over time according to the effects of interventions of health care authorities on the landscape 3 4 2 adaptation rodents adapt to habitat changes and the presence of adjacent colonies rodent colonies are designed to find optimum places according to the energy consumption and survival probability of the rodent members and resource availability the adaptation process is developed through a fitness seeking process 3 4 3 fitness a fitness seeking process grimm et al 2006 is used in rodent colonies to determine their members landscape properties habitat suitability and food resource availability define the social behaviors and mortality risk as the main parameters for fitness evaluation rodent movement decisions influence the survival of the moving rodent agent and the survival of the colony hence each colony s fitness is indirectly modeled as rodents accessibility to more food with lower cost energy activities 3 4 4 sensing cell agents sense landscape characteristics and mobile agents within their neighborhood cell agents monitor intervention locations and use this memory when estimating habitat suitability rodents sense food resources colony members and their requests the colony agent senses habitat suitability as cell agents and senses its members as rodent agents the colony agent receives the agents collected food and senses neighboring colonies 3 4 5 interactions the scheduler controls the daily light according to the time of day which influences the choice of activity for a rodent cell agents work as a proxy for interactions between rodent and colony agents and the environment because landscape characteristics are accessible only via cell agents i e habitat suitability food resource availability rodent agents interact with each other by sensing each other s requests and by collecting food for a common colony the interactions occur in each time step and allow agents to change their state or make decisions dynamically while interacting with other agents 3 4 6 stochasticity stochastic processes are incorporated into the rodent behaviors to simulate natural variation probability equations assess the probability of an agent moving and foraging the movement location and the likelihoods of habitat change and interventions moreover agents have a 1 chance of selecting a random choice instead of the decision made by the respective sub model a daily random mortality rate is applied to the rodent agents processed by the scheduler in addition a random draw from a uniform distribution determines the order of agent movements 3 4 7 observation individual and colony level processes are observed in each time step and the associated activities such as resting searching for food and helping other agents are recorded in each time step for post processing analysis 3 5 initialization the model is initialized with the characteristics of the study area including topography land cover and zcl incidence table 1 the scheduler loads the information and uses it to instantiate all of the cell agents and to instantiate the colonies the scheduler also modifies the cell agent s attributes in the event of any environmental or human made change 3 6 input data topographic and landscape data such as data on roads rivers villages and cities used for estimating the habitat suitability and food resource availability of rodents were acquired as digitized esri shape file format esri 1998 data from the iranian national cartographic center ncc and the iranian national forest and rangeland organization the zcl notification data together with the intervention activities and active rodent colonies information in isfahan were acquired from the iranian ministry of health moh 3 7 sub models 3 7 1 estimate habitat suitability and food availability landscape characteristics influence the attraction level of each area for different rodent behaviors rodents are attracted to moist areas that can be found in riverbeds and shrubby areas each cell agent has parameters that reflect the habitat suitability and food availability according to the landscape characteristics areas that are subject to intervention activities e g poisoning destroying habitats are recorded in the memory of the cell agents for a predefined time period i e 100 days and their 5 km neighborhood are included as temporary constraints in the model these temporary constraints are assigned lowest suitability and food availability regardless of their landscape characteristics the model uses two sets of landscape data as presented in table 2 together with sample data from known rodent colonies as training data to estimate the habitat suitability and food availability of each cell agent using a logistic regression lr approach lr is used to find the most appropriate model to describe the relationships between a set of independent parameters and both the presence absence of rodent habitats and the availability of food resources the lr involves fitting the dependent variable using an equation of the form hθ x g θtx where g is the sigmoid function defined as g z 1 1 e z and θ t x θ 0 θ 1 x 1 θ n x n is a linear regression of a vector of independent variables and their corresponding coefficients accordingly two logistic regression models were generated with two binary dependent variables indicating the suitability also equivalent to cost of movement subtracted from one in each area and the availability of food resources for rodents supplementary document s3 the final model was assessed for its predictive performance using the area under the roc receiver operating characteristics curve auc and it exhibited good predictive performance with auc 0 875 3 7 2 rodent decision making processes when a rodent agent is assigned to a colony it starts a foraging process based on the current time the availability of food resources and requests received from colony mates accordingly rodents detect a goal and approach it following a set of successive behaviors supplementary document s4 connectivity measures from meta population ecology and least cost path algorithms from graph theory drielsma et al 2007 have been included in the decision making process based on the assumption that animals take the route of least resistance when exploring landscapes watkins et al 2015 3 7 2 1 behavior i deciding on whether to exit burrows the activities of rodents inside and outside of their underground corridors vary with time of day rodent activity outside the burrows during daylight is lower in the spring and summer when direct sun exposure forces them to stay inside their burrows the temperature is regulated inside the underground corridors being neither too hot nor too cold which is favorable for rodent survival in the hot summers and cold winters of the middle east and central asia it is therefore possible that rodents perform some activities even when they are inside corridors in spring and summer rodents are active outside of their burrows at night for longer periods than they are in winter and spring consequently the number of active rodents around each neighborhood is highest two hours before sunset and two hours after sunrise at other times the number of active rodents is lower and it reaches its minimum value around noon thus the probability of exiting the burrows for each rodent was calculated according to the time of day with time steps closer to sunrise or sunset generating a higher probability of agents moving outside of the burrows in the form p 1 min t i t max d where ti is the current time tmax is sundown or sunrise and d represents a 12 h time period a rodent would decide to exit the colony when u 0 1 p where u 0 1 is a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 3 7 2 2 behavior ii estimating a potential perception range the perception range was estimated within the maximum perception range pmax of the rodents using a stochastic function u 0 pmax to generate a uniform random deviate between 0 and pmax table 1 perception range here refers to a buffer zone centered on the rodent and represents the environment agents objects and help requests that a rodent agent can sense 3 7 2 3 behavior iii search for potential targets the agents search for all food objects and help requests within their designated perception range behavior ii if there are none a random deviate u 0 100 is generated and the rodent will decide either to stay underground 50 or search for a new perception range 50 which will be estimated between the current perception range and the maximum perception range if all of the potential targets are far away then the agent starts a random search and selects four targets from the closest available objects 3 7 2 4 behavior iv select a target to select one of the candidates acquired from behavior iii the agent performs a suitability analysis to prioritize the sensed objects the rodent divides the available objects into i requests and ii food objects and compares each set separately with the help requests given higher priority the spatial links drielsma et al 2007 between the colony and each of the candidate targets are calculated using dijkstra 1959 s least cost paths algorithm over the habitat suitability grid next the accumulated costs of the paths dij to targets are calculated using drielsma et al 2007 s proposed method then the link value of the path is calculated using a dispersal kernel l ij f i f j e αd ij based on the food availability at the target fi and at the colony fi the accessibility of each target dij and agent s perception range α thus the selection probability of a certain target pj from among all considered objects n is calculated as p i e l j j 1 n e l j zarembka 1974 li et al 2015 next a uniform random deviate between 0 and 1 is created if the deviate is smaller than the selection probability pi the agent selects object i as its target 3 7 2 5 behavior v movement the movement paths of each agent towards a desired target and back to the colony are set based on the spatial links drielsma et al 2007 calculated via dijkstra 1959 s least cost paths algorithm within a raster spatial data format in each time step the rodent moves within the range of u 1 25 cells and selects the first order moore neighborhood weisstein 2005 cells following a pre specified least cost path behavior iv towards a target during the movement the rodent updates its energy level according to the cost of underlying cell using the equation current energy cost 0 1 when a rodent reaches a target recharges its energy and when it returns to colony depletes the 50 of food availability of the previously approached target 3 7 3 reproduction and dispersal colonies increase their population in a reproduction process and communicate with other colonies via a dispersal process for each successful foraging process of a rodent the colony agent enables the rodent agent to reproduce according to a predefined litter size in a range of u 4 7 table 1 the dispersal process starts when a colony reaches its maximum population size and more than half of its population is successfully searching for food during dispersal the colony agent looks for the closest colonies that were found during the optimization process and assigns u 0 0 43 proportion of its population to that colony table 1 3 7 4 cuckoo search rodent colonies are attracted to sites that potentially offer a more suitable environment and available food thus the suitability of a location for a rodent colony is determined by the suitability of the underlying cell the availability of food in the neighborhood the suitability of the paths to the food resources and the level of reproduction and iteraction with other colonies in addition the colonies search space comprises various properties of landscapes in a real world like environment which makes the process of searching for suitable colony sites difficult slow and often inefficient hence the search process of colony agents is considered as an optimization problem in this study and a meta heuristic approach called cuckoo search cs proposed by yang and deb 2009 is adopted for the colonizing behavior of rodent populations the algorithm is based on the obligate brood parasitic behavior of some cuckoo species in combination with the lèvy flight behavior of some birds and fruit flies yang and deb 2009 lèvy flight presents a more efficient exploration of large search spaces applying a fast local search approach followed by a randomization process which makes sure the model will not be trapped in a local optimum the colony agent searches for optimal neighborhoods of habitat suitability and uses a heuristic fitness seeking approach using cs based on the survival and foraging activities of its members to evaluate the current site once the colony agent locates a neighborhood with optimal properties it stops the search process however the agent constantly monitors colony fitness and restarts the search process once a threat is identified thus a solution for the cs is defined as a colony with its neighborhood consisting of a collection of cell agents that are suitable for meeting the rodents socio ecological requirements colonies are assigned a primary number of members with a minimum of five members and the members begin reproducing and extending their colony range once a colony creates them the mortality risk is assigned to colony members based on their age using the equation mortality 0 001 age and a rodent agent without energy dies if there was no food resources or colony within its maximum perception range 3 7 4 1 cuckoo search algorithm yang and deb 2009 proposed three main rules as the basic steps of cuckoo search 1 each cuckoo lays one egg at a time and dumps it in a randomly chosen nest 2 the best nests with high quality of eggs will carry over to the next generation 3 the number of available host nest is fixed and the egg laid by a cuckoo is discovered by the host bird with the probability of paє 0 1 for generating new solution x t 1 for cuckoo i a lèvy flight is performed as 1 x i t 1 x i t α l è vy λ where α is the step size and α o 1 is used in this study the product deals with entry wise multiplications process however lèvy flights provide a random walk whereas their random step lengths are drawn from a lèvy distribution which has an infinite variance with an infinite mean 2 l è vy u t λ w h e r e 1 λ 3 each egg in a nest represents a solution i e colony site and a cuckoo egg represent a new solution the aim is to use the new and potentially better solutions cuckoos to replace a not so good solution in the nests the quality or fitness of a solution is defined to be proportional to the value of an objective function which aims to maximize the survival of a colony using habitat value collected food by the members and reproduction of rodents in each run the pa fraction of the nests is replaced with new random solutions at new locations here the consecutive jumps of a cuckoo form a random walk process which obeys a power law step length distribution with a heavy tail pseudo code of the cuckoo search algorithm is presented in supplementary document s5 3 7 5 spatially explicit environment a geographic automata system gas torrens and benenson 2005 was used to benefit from both cellular automata and agent based techniques to represent rodent population dynamics the broader objective was to provide a spatially explicit approach for representing the spatial heterogeneity of the environment as comprised of landscape attributes e g land cover topography disease cases intervention areas and agent objects i e rodent colonies rodents cell agents thus the model is enabled to consider the heterogeneity of space and spatial behaviors explicitly rajabi et al 2016 according to torrens and benenson 2005 a gas consists of the seven following components 3 g a s k s t s l m l n r n where k indicates a set of automata types in gas the first pair denotes a set of states s and state transition rules ts that are associated with gas in the second pair l dictates the location of automata in the system and ml denotes the movement rules for automata in the third pair n represents the neighbors of automata and rn represents the rules that govern changes of the automata relative to other automata 3 8 model implementation the model was implemented using the object oriented programming language java http java sun com within the repast agent based modeling toolkit version 2 3 1 http repast sourceforge net all of the geographical information and spatial analysis was performed using arcgis software version 10 3 and the data were then integrated into the model 3 9 simulation experiments the simulation represents the spatial patterns of rodent activities within the spring and summer in isfahan central iran isfahan is one of the most important zcl endemic areas in iran and several rodent colonies have been identified within this area fig 2 a shows the number of zcl infections that occurred over a 7 year period although many rodent colonies are destroyed annually during healthcare interventions the colonies are continuing to spread across isfahan causing many zcl infections fig 2b isfahan is a highly populated area of iran and an important region of agriculture most of the victims of zcl are villagers who are at their farms or orchards during the early morning or evenings moh 2013 fig 2c fig 2 represents a general view of zcl endemicity in isfahan highlighting that densly populated areas in norhwestern part of the study area comprise highest amount of rodent colonies and also suffer from high number of zcl cases the dense areas in northeastern part of isfahan also suffer from high number of disease cases even though the rodent colonies are fewer in this part there are also several villages in less populated areas of southern isfahan with sporadic but growing numbers of zcl infections and active colonies which has raised concern over zcl emergence in these areas there is a need for prevention measures to diminish the prevalence of the disease which mainly originates from r opimus colonies in this context the distribution and activities of rodent colonies in isfahan were simulated during the simulation rodent colonies were subjected to healthcare interventions and their members activities were observed 3 10 model calibration primary information on rodent colonies and their behaviors in the study area were acquired from healthcare authorities and field surveys and were used to calibrate and validate the simulation model developed in this study the simulation started by introducing the entities and classes to the simulation environment and by calibrating the sub models using the disease incidence and rodent pattern data 3 11 model performance evaluation the model performance was evaluated according to the approach presented by bennett et al 2013 for evaluating environmental models the predicted patterns of rodent activities were firstly examined using observed rodent colonies in the proximity of three most infected areas in isfahan including paygah ejhiye and varzaneh to examine the simulation results two popular performance investigation indices were used i hit rate and ii kappa statistics bennett et al 2013 the hit rate was applied with the ideal value equal to 1 as suggested by li et al 2015 to assess the ratio of simulated rodent activities in the neighborhood of three targeted endemic sites to all observed rodent activities on the other side the kappa statistic was applied to evaluate the similarities between observed and predicted rodent activity patterns locally moreover the relative change of simulated rodent activities after the implementation of interventions was also evaluated using observed zcl infections hence a rate of change was calculated for both observed zcl infections and simulated rodent activities after the interventions and then spearman s rho were used to assess whether they are significantly correlated a near perfect correlation would be indicated by a rho value close to 1 with p 0 05 li et al 2015 3 12 sensitivity analysis the sensitivity analysis in this study was focused on the parameters of the models that influenced the main outputs a sensitivity score was calculated following the approach presented in railsback and grimm 2011 by using the default parameter values with 20 variation and monitoring the changes in rodent patterns 4 results 4 1 predicted pattern results the model was run for 1000 daily time steps with the default settings and values of habitat suitability and food availability across isfahan supplementary document s3 the simulation pattern was considered to reach equilibrium when the colonies were located at optimal locations fig 3 a at this stage the cuckoo search process was stopped and a fresh model run was triggered within which the activity patterns of agents were observed fig 3 figure 3b during the first 100 150 days after the equilibrium the rodent population experienced significant variation in size because the colony agents were allowed to start reproduction behavior again according to their neighborhood characteristics fig 4 a all of the colony members were expected to perform their assigned circadian activities and their states were observed during each time step fig 5 a the results indicated that most of the rodents were either carrying food to their colonies or resting inside their burrows during model run the random activities were at a low frequency during this time because of the optimized locations of the colonies and there were always a high proportion of members helping other colony mates in this way the rodent daily activities and movement flows created a spatial pattern that represented their activity range and territories fig 3b accordingly the majority of rodent activities were simulated to primarily occur in desertification areas located far from the major human population centers this reflected the suitability of the desertification areas for circadian activities which caused most rodent agents to select a limited search range and remain close to their colonies colonies at closer distances to a desertification area acquired higher reproduction rates and started to extend their colonies by extending their social communication and generating several nested colonies with their dispersal behavior fig 6 a the most central colony was identified in ejhiye where the central colony interacted with most of the colonies in study area and also dispersed quite a lot of rodents towards its nested colonies fig 6b however the most populated area with rodent members was at the varzaneh area where most of the nested colonies were crowded and highly connected via dispersals on the other side some big colonies were also simulated at the paygah area with small nested colonies fig 6a moreover existing of a few sporadic colonies in the southern part of varzaneh and a centralized weakly connected colony in the western ejhiye at nikabad region also was worth mentioning to explore the population dynamics of rodents after a change in their neighborhood the locations of all interventions were acquired from the iranian ministry of health and entered into the simulations fig 3c the interventions in isfahan mostly include poisoning thus the physical characteristics of the environment e g land cover remained unchanged however the intervened areas received penalty for the habitat suitability and food availability hence the spatial distribution of rodent colonies optimized after an intervention event and the rodent activities were tracked fig 3d after the change in the environment the cuckoo search process was triggered again to find the new optimal sites for rodent colonization the spatial pattern of rodent activities indicated that the intensity of their activities was decreased generally however their activity ranges were expanded and new parts of study area were covered by rodent activities thus the activities of rodents decreased significantly during the intervention and the results highlighted that rodents explored areas located far from their colonies in their search processes fig 3d during the intervention the amount of food in the colonies was set to zero the optimized search process was activated to relocate the rodents home ranges this caused a significant decrease in the total rodent population as represented by the spike in the population diagram in fig 4b after the intervention occurred at day 350 although large numbers of rodents died after the interventions the colonies were located at another optimal location for their members subsequently reaching a new equilibrium at this stage the rodents returned to their normal daily activities with fewer colony mates fig 4b the states of colonies after the interventions were also monitored and the results indicated that the remaining rodents were mostly staying underground which simulates the vigilant mode of rodents in real world when they sense a threat fig 5b moreover a high proportion of rodents were searching for food and almost the same amount of rodents helping their colony mates increased number of dead rodents and random searches could also be notified in their activities after the intervention fig 5b however the number of food carriers was low which explains why so many rodents were at the search mode the non food carriers had to return to their colonies to refuel and many of them died possibly due to the lack of food in newly searched areas accordingly the rodent agents invested more time in foraging activities outside of the burrows and their movement ranges expanded towards the population centers where the habitat suitability values were higher fig 7 simulated colonies provided rodent releases in both human resident and non resident areas figs figure 2c 7 across the study area the results indicate that the rodent activity pattern after the interventions was largely influenced by the geographical characteristics of desertification areas over the intervention period with the exception of colonies adjacent to desertification areas all of the rodent colonies displayed rodent activities in human resident neighborhoods the structure and interactions between colonies after the intervention indicated that the sporadic colonies in the southern part of varzaneh were disappeared and colonies around paygah region strengthen their interconnections fig 7 the main reason for this could be because of the lack of intervention activities around this area because of military issues hence the sporadic intervention activities around this area made the colonies more connected and pushed them to the vicinity of population centers the most prominent change after intervention was the movement of colonies in southern part of paygah towards the big city of isfahan fig 7b and appearance of a strongly connected in the western part of ejhiye fig 7c on the other side the ejhiye colonies kept their centrality in the study area and instead increased their internal relationships however colonies in this area mostly migrated towards the farms and orchards in the southern ejhiye in the vicinity of zayande river in the varzaneh area the interventions made the colonies to change their locations towards population centers and made their dispersal interactions weaker which shows the limited amount of food availability around these part of study area fig 7d 4 2 sensitivity analysis results a sensitivity analysis of model parameters was performed before and after the interventions and their sensitivity was found to be different at these two situations table 3 the largest disparity in response was observed for the parameters movement length and perception range however parameter litter size had also a high sensitivity score the results indicated that for the before intervention case the sensitivity scores were lower and the after intervention case was much more sensitive to changes in all of the parameters table 3 rodent activities were slightly sensitive to the changes in the litter sizes of rodent agents and perception range and the model sensitivity to food availability was very weak increases in the litter sizes of rodents influenced the reproduction rate of colony agents and contributed to increases of movements in almost all areas with suitable food the latter explains the higher sensitivity of model after the interventions occurred when high proportions of agents are searching for colony and food increases in perception range and movement length influenced rodent activity near colonies and increased rodent activity in areas far from colonies overall the results indicated a reasonable stability in the model and highlighted the parameters which should be noticed during data collection and model calibration parameters cell size colony size energy decrease and initial number of colonies acted similarly with or without interventions finally the model appeared to be least sensitive to variation in cell size and initial number of colonies 4 3 evaluation and validation of results following bennett et al 2013 the model performance was assessed visually at the initial step in which the identification of several under or non detected patterns would indicate poor performance and challenge the reliability of the model thus the observed distributions of rodents and observed rodent activities were explored to obtain an overview of the model performance fig 3 general consistency between the simulated activities and observed colonies was observed for most of the areas in isfahan comparison between observed zcl infections and simulated rodent activities indicated that most of the villages and districts with high numbers of infections were located in vicinity of highest rodent activity areas there were also a few undetected patterns in areas with relatively high numbers of infections which might due to the simplified rodents decision making or heuristic nature of colony search process the quantitative assessment of model performance is presented in table 4 the calculated matrices for the selected endemic areas indicate satisfactory performance regarding the model predictions as to the rodents activity all three hit rates were higher than 0 8 regarding kappa indices the values indicated moderate agreement between rodent activity prediction and observation 0 6 the spearman s rho values were all significant p 0 05 and their values were all higher than 0 65 which supports the correlation and similarity between the predicted change in rodent activity and observed zcl cases after the interventions at each endemic site table 4 5 discussion the model presented here represents a spatially explicit agent based model of rodent population dynamics in a real world context a pattern oriented modeling approach was adapted into the simulation the stochastic nature of the model enabled the assessment of interventions and their specific effects on rodent population persistence and resilience over time as well as their population level spatiotemporal patterns and interactions the whole model application was validated using coarse level observations of rodent activities the validation results indicated that the behavior of the simulated rodent groups were consistent with the patterns of the zcl disease and colonies in isfahan the performance of the model was also tested using the spatial distribution of rodent s activities and relative change of the zcl infections after interventions and overall satisfactory results were achieved the results of the sensitivity analysis demonstrated the stability of the model when simulating the dynamics of rodent populations in the study area the results highlight the importance of considering spatially explicit environments when investigating the implications of healthcare preventive measures on population dynamics areas with the highest rodent activity were generally near desertification areas human resident areas close to desertification areas were found to be sensitive to future intervention changes in rodent colonies in relation to zcl infections thus these areas should be prioritized in the future plans of healthcare authorities however the number of zcl infections in areas far from major rodent colonies has the potential to greatly increase after interventions due to the rodent migrations on the other side the simulated structure of colonies and their connections highlighted the social interactions of colonies and individual based nature of model indicated their behaviors before and after interventions hence sparse interventions in some cases such as paygah region led to expansion of home ranges and strengthening of the rodents social interactions which consequently could result in higher number of infections in these areas in varzaneh area the interventions pushed the colonies towards farms and orchards which possibly could turn them into agricultural pests it should also be noticed most of the colonies appeared after the interventions and leishmania parasites persist in r opimus for a long time up to 25 month abai et al 2010 thus even with a short absence the infections might emerge in non endemic areas although this study does not include direct impacts of vector population on the zcl spread the effect of interventions on zcl prevalence can be discussed from a vector related perspective indirectly it is worth mentioning that interventions also influence the vector population cohabiting with the rodent communities in their underground burrows the interventions by reducing the population of rodent hosts could shift biting behavior of sandflies towards other blood sources including humans this could cause a short term spike in the number of zcl cases in some parts of study area the predictions from the current study could be used to support strategic planning for regional and national level public health management for zcl disease for which full detailed observation data on rodent activity is largely missing it could also be used to design future data collection scenarios for fine scale investigations moreover the model can be modified to include the effects of a variety of change elements on rodent populations such as urban growth climate change and forms of human disturbance such as infrastructure projects and farming near rodent colonies there is a need for future investigations to identify key environmental changes that might impact the spatiotemporal pattern of rodent activities and thus the status of zcl infections the seasonal variation of leishmania parasites in r opimus population shall also be considered in understanding zcl spread and planning control strategies akhavan et al 2010 showed the dynamicity of leishmania infections in rodent population in an endemic area in central iran with lowest rate in summer and highest rate in fall this dynamicity could also be coupled with intervention scenarios in future studies of zcl the current model exhibits a flexible loosely coupled structure that allows it to be readily integrated with other models for example researchers could couple the present model with an entomological model for sand fly population simulation and integrate it with human behaviors to simulate the entire zcl disease transmission cycle mclane et al 2011 outlined the necessary elements of an abm in wildlife ecology applications i representation of the environment ii animal behavior iii animal movement rules and iv memory and learning the model is discussed below with respect to these elements 5 1 representation of the environment a real world representation of the environment is applied in this study in which both object based and cell based representations are defined the rodent behaviors are simulated in a dynamic environment to derive the activity patterns and explore the effects of interventions however the intervention information was only available at a coarse level and thus future research conducted with intervention information at a finer scale is encouraged although data collection processes for rodent colonies can be costly and time consuming future studies could explore how finer scale information on rodent colonies could be used in socio ecological studies moreover the environmental categories considered in the habitat analysis of rodents could be extended for example industrial complexes and housing sites in suburbs might be suitable locations for rodent foraging behaviors and thus could be considered in future studies 5 2 animal behavior the modeling of rodent behaviors is a major challenge that should have been addressed earlier in socio ecological studies the continual adaptation and change in state of rodent agents and their decision rules are defined here based on a decision making process the colonization of rodents was simulated as a direct fitness seeking behavior using the cs optimization approach however due to data limitation the reproduction of rodents is simulated only at colony level in the current model in future studies the individual level reproduction behaviors of rodents could be included allowing the social behaviors of rodents in developing their colonies and rodent population growth to be represented in greater detail the migratory behavior of rodents upon encountering intervention changes was considered as an indirect fitness seeking behavior in the current model another indirect fitness seeking trait considered in this model was rodent dispersal in which part of a rodent population decides to move away and generate a new colony without facing any threat or change the main focus of this study was on the behaviors of rodent species as the main reservoir host for zcl disease in the context of scenario planning for interventions by healthcare authorities however public health scenarios also involve multi species interactions between rodents and sand flies which should motivate additional studies in the future moreover interactions among rodents sand flies and other animals e g livestock that could contribute to high densities of sand fly populations even among animals that are not reservoirs could be evaluated in future studies 5 3 animal movement rules there were two types of rodent movements in this study the movement of colonies towards an optimal site and the movement of rodent agents in the vicinity of their colony sites these movements were designed as responses to long term goals such as avoidance of population extinction and short term objectives such as foraging survival and reproduction however other short term or long term goals such as avoiding local predators or habitat saturation might also influence rodent movements and be addressed in future studies a cost benefit scenario was applied to the individual level movements of rodents to integrate both habitat quantity and spatial configuration information the integrated approach was used in a predefined network of decisions according to rodents internal states once a rodent s internal state allow it to move toward a particular goal a least cost path to the target was considered the short and mid range rodent movements in this study were mostly goal oriented and less than 1 of the movements were random hence random walk scenarios could be utilized for the random movements of rodents in future studies however for the colony level movements a scale free type of random walk called lèvy flight was applied under a cuckoo search optimization to explore the entire study area for colonization 5 4 memory and learning rodents especially r opimus are intelligent species that can adapt to different situations using their effective memory and quick learning abilities an episodic memory is considered for the cell agents in this study where the past experiences of interventions are retained in memory for a certain time period although goal oriented movements of rodents and their colonies were designed based on principles from meta population and landscape ecology the cognitive abilities of rodents could also be included in future studies for example the individual and community level sensation and perception behaviors of the rodents under different stress levels e g under vigilance remain largely unknown and could be explored in the future due to a lack of information on the learning ability of r opimus rodents their learning processes and spatial memory were not considered in the present study artificial neural networks anns are powerful approaches that could be applied to mimic rodent learning behaviors in future studies however the limited availability of training data involving rodent learning behavior remains a major challenge for ann methods 5 5 limitations an important challenge in agent based modeling is model performance evaluation especially in a data poor context additional observational data on rodent activity would facilitate the detailed quantitative evaluation of rodent behaviors in future studies the low availability of such data is a recurring challenge in modeling efforts bennett et al 2013 li et al 2015 filatova et al 2013 qualitative model evaluation might be an alternative for future model developments li et al 2015 the qualitative performance of simulation models that focus on a species of public health could be assessed using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua saltelli et al 2008 to identify the origin of uncertainties and provide insights for future data collection processes 6 conclusions an agent based model was developed to explore rodent population activities by synthesizing theories regarding habitat suitability analysis optimization and behavior modeling within a spatially explicit environment validation was performed using field data and indicated a significant correlation between the simulated rodent activity existing colonies and zcl infections the model was applied to isfahan and the results showed that i colonies with a high level of activity are those close to desertification areas and ii interventions can eliminate weakly connected colonies and sporadic interventions could expand the home ranges of current colonies the results reveal how habitat configurations and human made changes impact rodent communities and provide insight into rodent population dynamics the model presents a flexible and predictive framework for the management of rodent related public health problems acknowledgements the first author of this study acknowledges the

25334,intensified hydrodynamic turbulence through artificial mixing has been widely used to suppress toxic microcystis blooms in contrast attenuations of turbulent mixing by reservoir impoundment would lead to the shift from chlorella to microcystis however the intervention mechanisms of the turbulence on the competitions between buoyant microcystis and sinking chlorella are still unclear in this study we develop a mathematical model between microcystis and chlorella competing for light by incorporating the buoyancy regulation of microcystis with different sizes the results from numerical simulations indicate that a better vertical distribution help competing algae win the competition most of buoyant microcystis float upwards into the upper layer to have fully photosynthesis and dominate while most of sinking chlorella stay in the lower layer in relatively calm water however faster growing chlorella dominates in the relatively turbulent water because both coexisting species are distributed uniformly over depth in addition the competitive advantage pictures reveal that water turbulence together with water depth reflect the dominant algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable keywords hydrodynamic turbulence competition model buoyancy regulation regime shift phytoplankton shift 1 introduction colony forming and toxic cyanobacterial blooms such as microcystis blooms often threaten slow flowing water or stratified deep lakes all over the world huisman et al 2004 yu et al 2015a such as dianchi lake in china yu et al 2017a lake erie in north america conroy et al 2014 and lake george in uganda yunes et al 1996 one hundred and eight countries at least have reported cyanobacterial blooms harke et al 2016 in contrast the green algae and diatoms which are nontoxic or less toxic usually appear in relatively turbulent water whitehead et al 2015 in high bloom seasons usually in summer with high temperature the smelly blue green scums will cover the water surface of lakes and relatively calm water microcystis blooms are a kind of harmful algal blooms habs which would bring many serious problems to aquatic ecosystems and human life paerl et al 2011 visser et al 2015 medina et al 2016 first microcystis would release toxic microcystin merel et al 2013 which would harm human health and livestocks visser et al 2015 in addition it would lead to drinking water crises and water shortages for surrounding communities and for industrial and agricultural production qin et al 2010 the die off of cyanobacterial will consume oxygen which would in result kill fishes and other aquatic animals paerl and huisman 2008 medina et al 2016 moreover the blue green scums would influence visual feeling which reduces the recreational use of water paerl et al 2011 in the nutrient rich and temperature suitable water variations in physical characteristics of water e g the turbulence and the depth are often accompanied by the shifts in dominant phytoplankton huisman et al 2004 yu et al 2017a with the global warming the duration time of microcystis blooms will be extended and the threat periods will also be lengthened paerl and huisman 2008 because warming of the surface water would enhance the stratification and reduce the mixing mojica et al 2015 reynolds et al 1983 classified microcystis into groups which are not adapted to turbulent and mixing water the buoyancy regulation supported by gas vesicles helps microcystis gain the competitive advantage in deep lakes which are usually calm however microcystis usually loses its advantage in relatively turbulent rivers where diatoms take the advantage it seems like that the buoyancy regulation does not help microcystis gain an advantage in turbulent water intensified hydrodynamics through artificial mixing has been often adopted in the calm water to suppress cyanobacterial blooms harris and baxter 1996 yu et al 2017a microcystis is replaced by green algae and diatoms in lake nieuwe meer by artificial mixing huisman et al 2004 the dominant microcystis from the dianchi lake at the upper reaches of tanglang river is replaced by green algae and centric diatoms in the middle and lower reaches yu et al 2017a the increasing hydrodynamic conditions account for the species variations the intervention mechanisms of the turbulence on the shift in phytoplankton are still unclear how does microcystis compete with other sinking algae in calm and turbulent water respectively it is widely accepted that the buoyancy regulation controlled by the cell ballast helps microcystis win the competition against other sinking algae in calm water visser et al 1997 many studies have indicated that the buoyancy regulation makes microcystis rise in the daytime while sink in the night ibelings et al 1991 which helps microcystis absorb light in the daytime and prevents other algae from being exposed to the light yu et al 2015b however this characteristic of the buoyancy regulation is rarely taken account into the models of competition among algae species huisman et al 1999 2004 first developed a competition model between microcystis and sinking algae however they did not consider the buoyancy regulation of microcystis as they assumed that microcystis rises at a constant velocity which is contrary to the field observations ibelings et al 1991 found that microcystis in lake vinkeveen sank with different proportions at different depths in addition ryabov and blasius 2014 found that maximum biomass of cyanobacteria not always stay on the surface but the subsurface and the depth of maximum biomass significantly influences the competition results the depth of maximum biomass is also not considered in the competition model developed by huisman et al 2004 second the colony size was not considered in huisman s model in natural water the size of microcystis colonies are different in relatively calm water and in turbulent water respectively yu et al 2017a yu et al 2017a found that the size of colonies in tanglang river downstream were smaller than that in the upstream near lake dianchi microcystis colony consists of unicell if the aquatic environment is suitable the units would gather to form large colonies on the contrary the large colonies might break into pieces of small colonies when water is disturbed yu et al 2015a third they did not consider the diurnal variations of light intensity on the water surface on the contrary a constant light intensity was considered which ignored the respiration of species in the night all of the aforementioned factors may influence the competing outcomes and need to be considered in the competition models in this work we develop a coupled competition model driven by hydrodynamic turbulence and incident light intensity between buoyant microcystis and sinking chlorella chlorella is chosen as the representative of the sinking green algae and diatoms both the colony size and buoyancy regulation of microcystis are considered in the model in addition the diurnal variation of light intensity is also taken into account in the model the objective of this paper is to study the intervention mechanisms of the hydrodynamic turbulence on the light competition between buoyancy regulation microcystis colonies and sinking chlorella on the basis of model simulations in addition competitive advantage pictures are drawn through numerous simulations of these two competing species to analyze their corresponding suitable aquatic environment 2 numerical model the coupled model consists of four components 1 the advection diffusion equations in the vertical huisman et al 2004 2 the cell density model of microcystis visser et al 1997 3 light intensity variation on the water surface and 4 the vertical migration velocity of microcystis colonies and chlorella aparicio medrano et al 2013 we assume that the nutrients are rich and the uniform water temperature is higher than 20 c which are suitable for both microcystis and chlorella hence the growth rates of the competing species are limited by the incident light intensity alone in addition we assume that the buoyancy regulation of microcystis is caused by the temporal variations of carbohydrate in cells visser et al 1997 aparicio medrano et al 2013 the conceptual model for light competition between microcystis and chlorella is shown in fig 1 in contrast to the model developed by huisman et al 2004 the model is modified by coupling buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies with different sizes and diurnal variation of light intensity on the water surface which involves respiration of species in the night the vertical population dynamics of the competing species can be described by the following equations huisman et al 2004 1 c i t v i c i z d 2 c i z 2 s i 2 s i p i i z c i l i c i 3 p i i z p i max i z h i z where i 1 2 n ci is the abundance of the species i vi is the vertical migration velocity of species i vi

max is the maximal growth rate of species i and h is the light half saturation constant if the incident light intensity is higher than the compensation irradiance microcystis cell accumulates carbohydrate and then the cell density increases on the contrary if the intensity of the incident light is lower than the compensation irradiance microcystis cell releases the carbohydrate and then the cell density decreases visser et al 1997 the changes in cell density can be described as eq 4 visser et al 1997 4 i z i c d ρ cell d t v c 1 i z e i z i 0 c 2 i z i c d ρ cell d t v c 3 ρ 1 c 4 where i z is the incident light intensity at the depth z calculated with eq 5 i 0 is the optimal irradiance i c is the compensation irradiance ρ cell is the density of the microcystis cell ρ 1 is the initial density of the microcystis cell c1 is a normative factor c2 is the rate of density change when i z 0 c3 is the slope and c4 is the theoretical rate of density changes with no carbohydrate storage in the cells light intensity in the water not only decreases with the depth of water due to the absorb of water suspended solids and phytoplankton but also varies with the light intensity on the surface at a specific time within one day in the vertical lambert beer s law is applied huisman et al 1999 on the surface of water the light intensity varies both with time and periods of the photoperiod hence we modify the equation which can simulate surface light intensity for consecutive days yu et al 2015b 5 i z max i m sin π mod t 86400 d l exp k bg z i 1 n 0 z k i c i σ t d σ 0 where k bg is the background turbidity of the water except self shading of all the species ki is the light attenuation coefficient of species i i m is the maximal diurnal light intensity on the surface of water and dl is the length of the photoperiod according to their actual shapes both microcystis colonies and chlorella can be treated as spheroids hence the vertical movement velocity of microcystis colonies can be calculated with stokes equation in eq 6 ρ col is the density of microcystis colonies which can be calculated using eq 7 aparicio medrano et al 2013 6 v i d z d t 2 g r 2 ρ col ρ w 9 μ

colony μ is the viscosity of water ф is the form resistance of colony ρ muc is the density of mucilage n cell is the volume percentage of cell in the colony and n gas is the volume percentage of gas vesicle in cell the vertical velocity of chlorella is also calculated using eq 6 however considering that chlorella is an individual unit rather than colonies ρ col in eq 6 is replaced by the density of the unicellular chlorella the density of chlorella does not vary with the vertical location and corresponding light intensity hence the sinking velocity of chlorella stays constant as 1 389 10 5 m s according to its radius with 8 μm the equations listed above are discretized with an implicit difference scheme we assume that there is no flux exchange at the surface and the bottom of the water where the following boundary condition function is specified as eq 8 8 v i c i d c i z 0 3 results 3 1 model verification 3 1 1 verification of microcystis colonies the distinct modification of this present model is the coupled buoyancy regulation model of microcystis colonies to verify the model we compare the simulation results using the modified model with the collected data of microcystis populations in situ and in laboratory first we simulate vertical population distributions of microcystis colonies and then compare the simulation results with the field data collected by cong et al 2009 the dominant phytoplankton in the yuqiao reservoir is microcystis microcystis blooms usually happen between july and october cong et al 2009 measured the vertical microcystis distributions in the yuqiao reservoir in situ in august 2006 besides they also collected water samples from the yuqiao reservoir the water samples were artificially disturbed and then stood for several days in the laboratory cong et al 2009 measured the vertical redistributions of microcystis in the laboratory when water was relatively calm hence we set d 0 08 cm2 s to reflect the relatively calm water column other parameters used in this verification are listed in table 1 considering the water sample was totally disturbed we assume that microcystis is uniformly distributed in the vertical at the beginning the initial population is supposed as 1 2 107 cells l in this verification second we simulate variations of microcystis population on the surface and then compare the predictions with field data observed by ibelings et al 1991 ibelings et al 1991 collected numbers of microcystis colonies on the surface of lake vinkeveen on august 23 24 1989 the surface area and maximum depth of lake vinkeveen were 0 6 km2 and 14 m respectively they found that the surface numbers of microcystis colonies varied within a day different with values listed in table 1 the value of i m is 1516 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the value of k is 1 5 m 1 d l is 57600 s aparicio medrano et al 2013 and d is 0 579 cm2 s serizawa et al 2008 the others are the same with those listed in table 1 fig 2 presents the vertical distribution of microcystis population comparisons between simulation results and the collected data the simulation results conducted by the model coincide well with the collected data the largest population of microcystis shows up 2 m below the water surface the vertical population in the reality presents a unimodal distribution as in huisman s model microcystis flows upwards at a constant velocity hence most of the algae stay on the surface while only a small amount of algae is entrained by water to deeper positions which is not consistent with the real situation fig 2 shows that the results of our model are more close to the reality fig 3 presents the comparisons between predictions using this coupled model and the diurnal population dynamics of microcystis colonies acquired on the surface of lake vinkeveen in the netherlands the sizes of microcystis colonies consist of the colonies with different diameters which are shown in fig 4 we simulate the population of microcystis both on the water surface and at the 1 m depth below the surface with the diameters of 20 50 70 100 150 and 200 μm then we compute the final simulation results which is shown in fig 3 taking a weighted average of the size distribution in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the buoyancy regulation model could simulate the decrease of the population on the surface in the daytime and the increase of the population in the night the model predictions fit well with the field data collected in lake vinkeveen ibelings et al 1991 3 1 2 verification of chlorella to verify the vertical distribution of chlorella we simulate the vertical distributions using this coupled model and compare the simulations results with the experimental data collected by lu et al 2013 in the laboratory experiment lu et al 2013 found that the 65 of size of chlorella is smaller than 4 5 μm hence we assume that the radius of chlorella is 4 μm and the sinking velocity is 3 47 10 6 m s using stokes equation the water depth is 4 3 m which is the height of the experimental facility the values of other parameters are the same with those in table 1 the data collected by lu et al 2013 in fig 5 is the relative value by normalization processing which shows the vertical variation trend of chlorella fig 5 shows that the simulation results fit well with processed data and reflect the vertical distribution trends under different light intensities on the surface if there is no light intensity on the surface most of chlorella stay in the lower layer due to sedimentation when the light intensity increases more population of chlorella gather on the upper layer because that chlorella has stronger photosynthesis in the upper layer than in the lower layer in calm water 3 1 3 verification of competition model compared with huisman s work the competition model is evaluated by comparing model simulations with the predictions using huisman s model huisman et al 2004 to compare these two models we set the initial values of parameters and the characteristics of species as the same with those in huisman s model first we set the rising velocity of microcystis colonies to a constant which assumes that microcystis has no buoyancy regulation ability and microcystis only floats upwards at a constant velocity with 1 389 10 4 m s huisman et al 2004 second we set the light intensity on the surface water as a constant which assumes no light variation within a day huisman et al 2004 that is eqs 4 6 and 7 are not used in this verification in addition we set all of the variables as the same values as in huisman et al 2004 the parameters used exclusively in this simulation model are listed in table 2 other parameters are selected the values in table 1 it is worth mentioning that huisman et al 2004 set d 0 17 cm2 s and d 5 1 cm2 s as the representatives of calm water and turbulent water respectively we set the same values to represent turbulent diffusions of calm water and turbulent water in this research as well figs 6 and 7 show that the simulations by our model fit well with predictions conducted by huisman et al 2004 when water is relatively calm microcystis takes the obvious advantage fig 6 most of microcystis accumulates at the surface because we assume that it moves upward at a constant velocity however when water is turbulent chlorella takes the advantage with relatively uniform distribution in the vertical fig 7 the largest population of microcystis still shows up on the surface on the other hand we find that the vertical distribution of microcystis is more uniform in turbulent water than that in calm water 3 2 vertical distributions it s obvious that the competition model in section 3 1 3 could not simulate the diurnal population dynamics of microcystis colonies as well as their real vertical distributions as aforementioned the buoyancy regulation model of microcystis colonies has been incorporated into the competition model in this work in addition we also involve the light intensity variation on the water surface within one day in this model ibelings et al 1991 found that some of microcystis colonies would also move downwards over the water column which could not be simulated by competition model in section 3 1 3 alone but can be reflected in fig 3 using this modified model we use the coupled model developed in this work to simulate the competitions between microcystis and chlorella the simulated vertical distributions are presented in fig 8 when we compare the vertical distributions in fig 8 with those in figs 6 and 7 we find the advantage species in water before mixing and after mixing is the same the differences are vertical distributions of microcystis and competitive chlorella in consequence according to our analysis the location of the largest population is the place where the density of microcystis equals to the density of water in the water above the largest population place if the density of microcystis colony is larger than that of water microcystis colony sinks on the contrary if the density of microcystis colony is smaller than that of water microcystis rises as we have aforementioned our coupled model has two obvious modification compared with that in huisman et al 2004 considering both the buoyancy regulation of microcystis with different sizes and light intensity variations on the water surface within one day these two modifications have significant impacts on the simulation results leading to which more close to the reality figs 9 b and 10 b show the vertical simulations only considering buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies figs 9 c and 10 c show simulations only considering light intensity variations within one day figs 9 d and 10 d show simulations considering both factors in the calm water before artificial mixing most of microcystis colonies concentrate on the largest population position with the population of 5 82 106cells l according to fig 9 b after ten day simulations microcystis does not take the obvious advantage due to the smaller initial populations on the contrary chlorella above the largest population position of microcystis has strong photosynthesis in view of lacking competition hence the population of chlorella increase and then it sinks due to the gravity which leads to the special vertical distribution in fig 9 b fig 9 b reveals that buoyancy regulation of microcystis determines the vertical population distributions according to fig 9 c most of microcystis gather on the surface without considering buoyancy regulation which leads to significant increase in population of microcystis and obvious decrease of chlorella in result in addition we find that the population of microcystis does not increase without limit this is because that microcystis has respiration in the night and only has photosynthesis when the light intensity is larger than the compensation irradiance if we do not consider the light intensity variations on the surface the population of microcystis will increase without limit which is contrary to the reality involving light intensity variations on the surface will reasonably limit the growth of microcystis according to fig 9 d the simulation results are consistent with the real distributions and microcystis colonies win the competition within ten days after artificial intervention in the lake both microcystis and chlorella distribute relatively uniformly in the vertical even though there still is the largest population position of microcystis in fig 10 b and d we can still find that light intensity variations on the surface limit growth of both competitive species both figs 9 and 10 show the importance of buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies and light intensity variations within one day in the competition among other species which is the biggest improvements of this model compared with the model developed by huisman et al 2004 3 3 competitive advantage pictures we draw the competitive advantage pictures fig 11 through numerous simulations based on this coupled model a parameter sensitivity analysis on the largest population of the competing species in the vertical also reflect the vertical distributions of population has been taken yu et al 2017b size of microcystis colonies has a significant impact on the competitive population of microcystis but has little impact on that of chlorella in calm water the microcystis colonies with larger sizes will be easier to win the competition and the smaller one will take a longer time to win its competition with chlorella in calm water that is the size of colonies will not influence the final winning species but will change the time to win the competition in addition the size of colonies has little effect on the competition in turbulent water hence we set a constant radius of microcystis colonies to draw the pictures the competition objects are the buoyancy regulated microcystis colony with the radius of 100 μm and chlorella with the constant sinking velocity and the radius of 8 μm respectively the velocity of microcystis colony varies with the incident light intensity while the sinking velocity of chlorella is 1 389 10 5 m s the simulation time is 10 days d and the water depth two important parameters reflecting the hydrodynamic characteristics of a waterbody as aforementioned are the corresponding variables on the x axis and y axis respectively the water depth ranges between 0 1 and 100 m while d ranges from 0 01 to 100 cm2 s in all the simulations the critical value of the population of microcystis colonies is 1 15 107 cells l anzecc 1992 therefore this value as the initial threshold is used to determine whether the algae abundance is harmful to animals and partially reflect the eutrophic conditions of water more specifically if the population of microcystis or chlorella is larger than 1 15 107 cells l the water is eutrophic considering different natural phenomenon we set another two initial values as well 1 15 104 cells l is the representative of oligotrophic water and 1 15 1010 cells l is the representative of eutrophic water the concrete values of other variables are listed in tables 1 and 2 fig 11 shows the outcomes of the competitions for light between microcystis and chlorella with different initial abundances in fig 11 microcystis wins means that the total abundances of microcystis over the entire water column increase while those of chlorella decrease after 10 day simulation chlorella wins means that the total abundances of chlorella increase in the vertical direction of water while those of microcystis decrease after 10 day simulation both win means that both the abundances of microcystis and chlorella over depth increase no blooms means that the abundances of both competing species decrease in the vertical direction and the algae abundances are lower than the population level of blooms 1 15 107 cells l both lose means that the abundances of both competing species in the vertical direction decrease but the abundances may be higher than the population level of blooms due to the high initial abundances as shown in fig 11 we summarize the suitable environment for microcystis and chlorella despite of different initial abundances 1 microcystis is adapted to the calm and deep water 2 chlorella is adapted to the turbulent and shallow water 3 both microcystis and chlorella are suitable to survive in the calm and shallow water 4 neither microcystis nor chlorella are adapted to the turbulent and deep water that is seldom existed in the nature except the man made river type reservoirs xie et al 2013 along with the increase in the initial abundances 1 15 104 1 15 1010 cells l the regime area of no blooms enlarges on the other hand the regime area of microcystis wins and chlorella wins shrink because both microcystis and chlorella would be shaded by the increased self shading the initial scale of microcystis and chlorella is 1 1 which rarely happens in the nature however we find that the initial scale will not influence the dominant algae figs 6 and 7 which means that both the depth and the turbulence of the water determine the final dominant algae if the nutrient is rich and the water temperature is higher than 20 c there are the other two distinct differences between our competitive advantage pictures and that in huisman et al 2004 besides different initial abundances of species first of all when the water is shallow the depth is between 0 and 6 m and calm d is smaller than 0 02 cm2 s fig 11 b shows that both populations of competitive species will increase because the light intensity at the bottom is abundant and both species can absorb enough light to grow on the contrary the simulation result in huisman et al 2004 shows that microcystis colony wins the competition because they assume that microcystis only flows upwards without buoyancy regulation hence microcystis gathers on the water surface and avoids light penetrating into deeper water secondly when the depth of water is deeper than 40 m and water is turbulent d is between 6 and 8 cm2 s fig 11 b shows that there are no blooms which means both populations of competitive species decrease on the contrary the simulation result in huisman et al 2004 shows that chlorella representative of diatoms and green algae wins the competition the aforementioned simulations reflect that our simulations coincide with the natural phenomenon better 4 discussion 4 1 intervention mechanisms of hydrodynamic turbulence on light competition between buoyant microcystis and sinking algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable higher than 20 c light is the main or even single limited resource for coexisting species to compete for a better vertical position will help the competing species absorb enough light nutrient loading increasing temperature and enough incident light intensity are all primary drivers of algae blooms yu et al 2015b harke et al 2016 in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs where microcystis blooms usually dominate nutrients and temperature are enough hence the algae that takes the advantage of absorbing light would win the competition as incident light would be attenuated in the vertical suspended species background water and solids all avoid light penetrating into the lower layer hence the algae in the upper layer would take the advantage as shown in fig 8 b most of microcystis gather in the upper layer while most of chlorella stay at the bottom that is the vertical distributions of species are very important to the species competition a better vertical position will help the competing species absorb enough light artificial mixing has been widely used to curb cyanobacterial blooms visser et al 2015 because hydrodynamic turbulence significantly change the vertical population distributions the vertical distributions of all coexisted species tend to be uniform the loss rate is larger than the growth rate of microcystis hence the populations decrease the main determinant factor of population distributions in the vertical is different in calm water and in turbulent water respectively self migration is the main factor that determines the vertical population distributions of coexisting species in calm water in the deep and calm aquatic environment where turbulent diffusion is very small the buoyant microcystis would migrate in the upper layer of the water column while the sinking chlorella would sink in the deeper water fig 8 b as incident light is hindered by water the suspended solids and algae the intensity of the incident light decreases with the distance from the water surface hence microcystis floating upwards into the upper layer could have enough light and have fully photosynthesis then they grow abundantly so as to shield the deeper water from the light in consequence therefore the growth rate of chlorella in the deeper water would be subject to the limited incident light in the deeper layer the abundances of chlorella over depth would decrease in addition sedimentation is a primary loss way of green algae and diatoms visser et al 2015 compared to microcystis with buoyancy regulation the self velocity of chlorella and other sinking algae is towards the bottom and against the solar irradiance hence like sediments most diatoms and green algae mainly stay in the lower layer of calm and stratified water sedimentation loss of diatoms and green algae is large in calm water besides microcystis colonies would minimize the grazing by zooplankton harke et al 2016 in calm water microcystis cells or small sized microcystis colonies would gather into colonies with larger sizes yu et al 2015a hence the grazing loss of microcystis is small while grazing loss of diatoms and green algae with small sizes is relatively large all of these lead to the domination of microcystis in calm and stratified water on the contrary it s hydrodynamic turbulence that mainly influences the vertical population distributions in relatively turbulent water if water is very turbulent the competing species would be entrained by eddies to the depth where the population is smaller in addition the intensified turbulence will entrain the algae in the bottom back to the water thus both microcystis and chlorella are distributed more uniformly over the entire water column fig 8 c microcystis assemblages would be split into smaller colonies or even units by intensified turbulent eddies the turbulent diffusions overweight the buoyancy regulation of microcystis the buoyancy regulation of microcystis has less effects hence the competition species have the same opportunity to absorb the incident light therefore chlorella with faster growth rate has an advantage over the slower growing microcystis colonies chlorella grows abundantly the large amounts of chlorella will hinder the light with the self shading the growth rate of competing microcystis would get slower until the loss rate is larger than the growth rate the amount of microcystis gradually decreases chlorella wins the competition in the turbulent water 4 2 suitable aquatic environment of buoyant microcystis and sinking algae in relatively shallow water with depth lower than 10 m chlorella takes the advantage to win the competition and is prone to blooms on the other hand if water is deeper than 10 m and water is not turbulent microcystis colonies are easy to win the competition with chlorella when eutrophic water with microcystis blooms is artificially disturbed microcystis might not be replaced by chlorella it is because that the variation between species depends on turbulent diffusion of water after disturbance water depth and population of microcystis colonies if water depth is the same the range of d is smaller to convert microcystis to chlorella when population of microcystis is larger as shown in fig 11 many cases can confirm the phytoplankton shifts caused by the regime shifts in fig 11 take fig 11 b as an example there are three corresponding scenarios in the nature the first scenario is that the depth keeps similar while the hydrodynamic turbulence is intensified the intensified mixing of water and the turbulent river downstream from a eutrophic lake in the nature follow this scenario the artificial mixing of lake nieuwe meer leads to the shift from microcystis to chlorella huisman et al 2004 the dominant microcystis from the eutrophic dianchi lake upstream is replaced by green algae and diatoms in the turbulent tanglang river downstream yu et al 2017a the second scenario is that the depth increases while the turbulence weakens the impoundment of the channel in the pool reach of the hydropower station falls into this category for example the dominant algae shifts from chlorella to microcystis in several tributaries of the yangtze river after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir tgr zheng et al 2011 liu et al 2012 the last scenario is that the depth is small while the turbulence keeps intensified in the case the dominant algae is chlorella if the initial abundance is very high the growth rates of both competing species in the water will be suppressed according to fig 11 c acuña et al 2011 has found that higher velocity would inhibit the growth of algae in the pampean stream the field experiment conducted by mitrovic et al 2011 also confirms this shift prediction in phytoplankton in this work we concentrate on the influence of hydrodynamics on the light competition between microcystis and chlorella without considering vertical water temperature stratification considering its importance we will include the water temperature layering in the future to improve the model there are two types of vertical temperature distributions first of all there is relatively uniform temperature in the vertical in tgr xie et al 2013 which is a special phenomenon this is due to the large amounts of discharges flowing through the reservoir during the flooding season the uniform water temperature has no significant impacts on the competition results between microcystis and chlorella secondly most of lakes reservoirs in the nature have stable temperature stratifications the water temperature in the deep water is between 5 10 c li et al 2016 according to table a 4 in introduction to fluid mechanics shaughnessy et al 2005 the water density is between 999 7 1000 kg m 3 we assume that the water density in the deep water is 1000 kg m 3 considering the density of chlorella does not vary with the light intensity the density of chlorella is between 1088 1102 kg m 3 oliver et al 1981 reynolds 2006 in this work the density of chlorella is set to be 1098 kg m 3 which is larger than that of water therefore chlorella sinks in the whole vertical water on the contrary the density of microcystis colony varies with the light intensity where it exists the density of microcystis colony in the deep water is about 992 kg m 3 yu et al 2015b it is because that in the deep water where the light intensity is lower than 10 9 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the cellular respiration surpasses oxygenic photosynthesis the density of microcystis colony is much smaller than that of water hence microcystis colony floats upwards contrarily due to the very small turbulent diffusion in the deep and layering lakes reservoirs most of chlorella stay in the deeper positions and seldom be entrained by eddies to the shallower water therefore microcystis colony will win the competition in the deep and layering water in conclusion the vertical distribution of water temperature does not influence the final winning species shown in fig 11 5 conclusions in this study a mathematical algae competition model for light by incorporating the buoyancy regulation of microcystis is developed microcystis and chlorella are chosen as the representatives of cyanobacteria and green algae and diatoms respectively the nutrients are assumed to be rich and the water temperature is higher than 20 c hence the growth rates of the competing species are only limited by the incident light intensity alone we find that the vertical distributions of population mainly influence the final advantage species in the calm water self migration is the main factor that determines vertical population distributions of coexisting species there exists a position with the largest population of microcystis the position is usually below water surface and in the upper layer however most of chlorella stays near the bottom on the contrary it s hydrodynamic turbulence that mainly influences vertical population distributions in turbulent water all of the species distribute uniformly in the vertical the faster growing chlorella takes the advantage in addition the competitive advantage pictures show that water turbulence together with water depth reflect the dominant algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable microcystis colonies adapt to deep and calm water environment while chlorella gains the advantage in shallow and relatively turbulent aquatic environment if water is deep and relatively turbulent none of species would live the competitive advantage pictures using this coupled model could explain many nature

25334,intensified hydrodynamic turbulence through artificial mixing has been widely used to suppress toxic microcystis blooms in contrast attenuations of turbulent mixing by reservoir impoundment would lead to the shift from chlorella to microcystis however the intervention mechanisms of the turbulence on the competitions between buoyant microcystis and sinking chlorella are still unclear in this study we develop a mathematical model between microcystis and chlorella competing for light by incorporating the buoyancy regulation of microcystis with different sizes the results from numerical simulations indicate that a better vertical distribution help competing algae win the competition most of buoyant microcystis float upwards into the upper layer to have fully photosynthesis and dominate while most of sinking chlorella stay in the lower layer in relatively calm water however faster growing chlorella dominates in the relatively turbulent water because both coexisting species are distributed uniformly over depth in addition the competitive advantage pictures reveal that water turbulence together with water depth reflect the dominant algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable keywords hydrodynamic turbulence competition model buoyancy regulation regime shift phytoplankton shift 1 introduction colony forming and toxic cyanobacterial blooms such as microcystis blooms often threaten slow flowing water or stratified deep lakes all over the world huisman et al 2004 yu et al 2015a such as dianchi lake in china yu et al 2017a lake erie in north america conroy et al 2014 and lake george in uganda yunes et al 1996 one hundred and eight countries at least have reported cyanobacterial blooms harke et al 2016 in contrast the green algae and diatoms which are nontoxic or less toxic usually appear in relatively turbulent water whitehead et al 2015 in high bloom seasons usually in summer with high temperature the smelly blue green scums will cover the water surface of lakes and relatively calm water microcystis blooms are a kind of harmful algal blooms habs which would bring many serious problems to aquatic ecosystems and human life paerl et al 2011 visser et al 2015 medina et al 2016 first microcystis would release toxic microcystin merel et al 2013 which would harm human health and livestocks visser et al 2015 in addition it would lead to drinking water crises and water shortages for surrounding communities and for industrial and agricultural production qin et al 2010 the die off of cyanobacterial will consume oxygen which would in result kill fishes and other aquatic animals paerl and huisman 2008 medina et al 2016 moreover the blue green scums would influence visual feeling which reduces the recreational use of water paerl et al 2011 in the nutrient rich and temperature suitable water variations in physical characteristics of water e g the turbulence and the depth are often accompanied by the shifts in dominant phytoplankton huisman et al 2004 yu et al 2017a with the global warming the duration time of microcystis blooms will be extended and the threat periods will also be lengthened paerl and huisman 2008 because warming of the surface water would enhance the stratification and reduce the mixing mojica et al 2015 reynolds et al 1983 classified microcystis into groups which are not adapted to turbulent and mixing water the buoyancy regulation supported by gas vesicles helps microcystis gain the competitive advantage in deep lakes which are usually calm however microcystis usually loses its advantage in relatively turbulent rivers where diatoms take the advantage it seems like that the buoyancy regulation does not help microcystis gain an advantage in turbulent water intensified hydrodynamics through artificial mixing has been often adopted in the calm water to suppress cyanobacterial blooms harris and baxter 1996 yu et al 2017a microcystis is replaced by green algae and diatoms in lake nieuwe meer by artificial mixing huisman et al 2004 the dominant microcystis from the dianchi lake at the upper reaches of tanglang river is replaced by green algae and centric diatoms in the middle and lower reaches yu et al 2017a the increasing hydrodynamic conditions account for the species variations the intervention mechanisms of the turbulence on the shift in phytoplankton are still unclear how does microcystis compete with other sinking algae in calm and turbulent water respectively it is widely accepted that the buoyancy regulation controlled by the cell ballast helps microcystis win the competition against other sinking algae in calm water visser et al 1997 many studies have indicated that the buoyancy regulation makes microcystis rise in the daytime while sink in the night ibelings et al 1991 which helps microcystis absorb light in the daytime and prevents other algae from being exposed to the light yu et al 2015b however this characteristic of the buoyancy regulation is rarely taken account into the models of competition among algae species huisman et al 1999 2004 first developed a competition model between microcystis and sinking algae however they did not consider the buoyancy regulation of microcystis as they assumed that microcystis rises at a constant velocity which is contrary to the field observations ibelings et al 1991 found that microcystis in lake vinkeveen sank with different proportions at different depths in addition ryabov and blasius 2014 found that maximum biomass of cyanobacteria not always stay on the surface but the subsurface and the depth of maximum biomass significantly influences the competition results the depth of maximum biomass is also not considered in the competition model developed by huisman et al 2004 second the colony size was not considered in huisman s model in natural water the size of microcystis colonies are different in relatively calm water and in turbulent water respectively yu et al 2017a yu et al 2017a found that the size of colonies in tanglang river downstream were smaller than that in the upstream near lake dianchi microcystis colony consists of unicell if the aquatic environment is suitable the units would gather to form large colonies on the contrary the large colonies might break into pieces of small colonies when water is disturbed yu et al 2015a third they did not consider the diurnal variations of light intensity on the water surface on the contrary a constant light intensity was considered which ignored the respiration of species in the night all of the aforementioned factors may influence the competing outcomes and need to be considered in the competition models in this work we develop a coupled competition model driven by hydrodynamic turbulence and incident light intensity between buoyant microcystis and sinking chlorella chlorella is chosen as the representative of the sinking green algae and diatoms both the colony size and buoyancy regulation of microcystis are considered in the model in addition the diurnal variation of light intensity is also taken into account in the model the objective of this paper is to study the intervention mechanisms of the hydrodynamic turbulence on the light competition between buoyancy regulation microcystis colonies and sinking chlorella on the basis of model simulations in addition competitive advantage pictures are drawn through numerous simulations of these two competing species to analyze their corresponding suitable aquatic environment 2 numerical model the coupled model consists of four components 1 the advection diffusion equations in the vertical huisman et al 2004 2 the cell density model of microcystis visser et al 1997 3 light intensity variation on the water surface and 4 the vertical migration velocity of microcystis colonies and chlorella aparicio medrano et al 2013 we assume that the nutrients are rich and the uniform water temperature is higher than 20 c which are suitable for both microcystis and chlorella hence the growth rates of the competing species are limited by the incident light intensity alone in addition we assume that the buoyancy regulation of microcystis is caused by the temporal variations of carbohydrate in cells visser et al 1997 aparicio medrano et al 2013 the conceptual model for light competition between microcystis and chlorella is shown in fig 1 in contrast to the model developed by huisman et al 2004 the model is modified by coupling buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies with different sizes and diurnal variation of light intensity on the water surface which involves respiration of species in the night the vertical population dynamics of the competing species can be described by the following equations huisman et al 2004 1 c i t v i c i z d 2 c i z 2 s i 2 s i p i i z c i l i c i 3 p i i z p i max i z h i z where i 1 2 n ci is the abundance of the species i vi is the vertical migration velocity of species i vi

max is the maximal growth rate of species i and h is the light half saturation constant if the incident light intensity is higher than the compensation irradiance microcystis cell accumulates carbohydrate and then the cell density increases on the contrary if the intensity of the incident light is lower than the compensation irradiance microcystis cell releases the carbohydrate and then the cell density decreases visser et al 1997 the changes in cell density can be described as eq 4 visser et al 1997 4 i z i c d ρ cell d t v c 1 i z e i z i 0 c 2 i z i c d ρ cell d t v c 3 ρ 1 c 4 where i z is the incident light intensity at the depth z calculated with eq 5 i 0 is the optimal irradiance i c is the compensation irradiance ρ cell is the density of the microcystis cell ρ 1 is the initial density of the microcystis cell c1 is a normative factor c2 is the rate of density change when i z 0 c3 is the slope and c4 is the theoretical rate of density changes with no carbohydrate storage in the cells light intensity in the water not only decreases with the depth of water due to the absorb of water suspended solids and phytoplankton but also varies with the light intensity on the surface at a specific time within one day in the vertical lambert beer s law is applied huisman et al 1999 on the surface of water the light intensity varies both with time and periods of the photoperiod hence we modify the equation which can simulate surface light intensity for consecutive days yu et al 2015b 5 i z max i m sin π mod t 86400 d l exp k bg z i 1 n 0 z k i c i σ t d σ 0 where k bg is the background turbidity of the water except self shading of all the species ki is the light attenuation coefficient of species i i m is the maximal diurnal light intensity on the surface of water and dl is the length of the photoperiod according to their actual shapes both microcystis colonies and chlorella can be treated as spheroids hence the vertical movement velocity of microcystis colonies can be calculated with stokes equation in eq 6 ρ col is the density of microcystis colonies which can be calculated using eq 7 aparicio medrano et al 2013 6 v i d z d t 2 g r 2 ρ col ρ w 9 μ

colony μ is the viscosity of water ф is the form resistance of colony ρ muc is the density of mucilage n cell is the volume percentage of cell in the colony and n gas is the volume percentage of gas vesicle in cell the vertical velocity of chlorella is also calculated using eq 6 however considering that chlorella is an individual unit rather than colonies ρ col in eq 6 is replaced by the density of the unicellular chlorella the density of chlorella does not vary with the vertical location and corresponding light intensity hence the sinking velocity of chlorella stays constant as 1 389 10 5 m s according to its radius with 8 μm the equations listed above are discretized with an implicit difference scheme we assume that there is no flux exchange at the surface and the bottom of the water where the following boundary condition function is specified as eq 8 8 v i c i d c i z 0 3 results 3 1 model verification 3 1 1 verification of microcystis colonies the distinct modification of this present model is the coupled buoyancy regulation model of microcystis colonies to verify the model we compare the simulation results using the modified model with the collected data of microcystis populations in situ and in laboratory first we simulate vertical population distributions of microcystis colonies and then compare the simulation results with the field data collected by cong et al 2009 the dominant phytoplankton in the yuqiao reservoir is microcystis microcystis blooms usually happen between july and october cong et al 2009 measured the vertical microcystis distributions in the yuqiao reservoir in situ in august 2006 besides they also collected water samples from the yuqiao reservoir the water samples were artificially disturbed and then stood for several days in the laboratory cong et al 2009 measured the vertical redistributions of microcystis in the laboratory when water was relatively calm hence we set d 0 08 cm2 s to reflect the relatively calm water column other parameters used in this verification are listed in table 1 considering the water sample was totally disturbed we assume that microcystis is uniformly distributed in the vertical at the beginning the initial population is supposed as 1 2 107 cells l in this verification second we simulate variations of microcystis population on the surface and then compare the predictions with field data observed by ibelings et al 1991 ibelings et al 1991 collected numbers of microcystis colonies on the surface of lake vinkeveen on august 23 24 1989 the surface area and maximum depth of lake vinkeveen were 0 6 km2 and 14 m respectively they found that the surface numbers of microcystis colonies varied within a day different with values listed in table 1 the value of i m is 1516 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the value of k is 1 5 m 1 d l is 57600 s aparicio medrano et al 2013 and d is 0 579 cm2 s serizawa et al 2008 the others are the same with those listed in table 1 fig 2 presents the vertical distribution of microcystis population comparisons between simulation results and the collected data the simulation results conducted by the model coincide well with the collected data the largest population of microcystis shows up 2 m below the water surface the vertical population in the reality presents a unimodal distribution as in huisman s model microcystis flows upwards at a constant velocity hence most of the algae stay on the surface while only a small amount of algae is entrained by water to deeper positions which is not consistent with the real situation fig 2 shows that the results of our model are more close to the reality fig 3 presents the comparisons between predictions using this coupled model and the diurnal population dynamics of microcystis colonies acquired on the surface of lake vinkeveen in the netherlands the sizes of microcystis colonies consist of the colonies with different diameters which are shown in fig 4 we simulate the population of microcystis both on the water surface and at the 1 m depth below the surface with the diameters of 20 50 70 100 150 and 200 μm then we compute the final simulation results which is shown in fig 3 taking a weighted average of the size distribution in fig 4 as shown in fig 3 the buoyancy regulation model could simulate the decrease of the population on the surface in the daytime and the increase of the population in the night the model predictions fit well with the field data collected in lake vinkeveen ibelings et al 1991 3 1 2 verification of chlorella to verify the vertical distribution of chlorella we simulate the vertical distributions using this coupled model and compare the simulations results with the experimental data collected by lu et al 2013 in the laboratory experiment lu et al 2013 found that the 65 of size of chlorella is smaller than 4 5 μm hence we assume that the radius of chlorella is 4 μm and the sinking velocity is 3 47 10 6 m s using stokes equation the water depth is 4 3 m which is the height of the experimental facility the values of other parameters are the same with those in table 1 the data collected by lu et al 2013 in fig 5 is the relative value by normalization processing which shows the vertical variation trend of chlorella fig 5 shows that the simulation results fit well with processed data and reflect the vertical distribution trends under different light intensities on the surface if there is no light intensity on the surface most of chlorella stay in the lower layer due to sedimentation when the light intensity increases more population of chlorella gather on the upper layer because that chlorella has stronger photosynthesis in the upper layer than in the lower layer in calm water 3 1 3 verification of competition model compared with huisman s work the competition model is evaluated by comparing model simulations with the predictions using huisman s model huisman et al 2004 to compare these two models we set the initial values of parameters and the characteristics of species as the same with those in huisman s model first we set the rising velocity of microcystis colonies to a constant which assumes that microcystis has no buoyancy regulation ability and microcystis only floats upwards at a constant velocity with 1 389 10 4 m s huisman et al 2004 second we set the light intensity on the surface water as a constant which assumes no light variation within a day huisman et al 2004 that is eqs 4 6 and 7 are not used in this verification in addition we set all of the variables as the same values as in huisman et al 2004 the parameters used exclusively in this simulation model are listed in table 2 other parameters are selected the values in table 1 it is worth mentioning that huisman et al 2004 set d 0 17 cm2 s and d 5 1 cm2 s as the representatives of calm water and turbulent water respectively we set the same values to represent turbulent diffusions of calm water and turbulent water in this research as well figs 6 and 7 show that the simulations by our model fit well with predictions conducted by huisman et al 2004 when water is relatively calm microcystis takes the obvious advantage fig 6 most of microcystis accumulates at the surface because we assume that it moves upward at a constant velocity however when water is turbulent chlorella takes the advantage with relatively uniform distribution in the vertical fig 7 the largest population of microcystis still shows up on the surface on the other hand we find that the vertical distribution of microcystis is more uniform in turbulent water than that in calm water 3 2 vertical distributions it s obvious that the competition model in section 3 1 3 could not simulate the diurnal population dynamics of microcystis colonies as well as their real vertical distributions as aforementioned the buoyancy regulation model of microcystis colonies has been incorporated into the competition model in this work in addition we also involve the light intensity variation on the water surface within one day in this model ibelings et al 1991 found that some of microcystis colonies would also move downwards over the water column which could not be simulated by competition model in section 3 1 3 alone but can be reflected in fig 3 using this modified model we use the coupled model developed in this work to simulate the competitions between microcystis and chlorella the simulated vertical distributions are presented in fig 8 when we compare the vertical distributions in fig 8 with those in figs 6 and 7 we find the advantage species in water before mixing and after mixing is the same the differences are vertical distributions of microcystis and competitive chlorella in consequence according to our analysis the location of the largest population is the place where the density of microcystis equals to the density of water in the water above the largest population place if the density of microcystis colony is larger than that of water microcystis colony sinks on the contrary if the density of microcystis colony is smaller than that of water microcystis rises as we have aforementioned our coupled model has two obvious modification compared with that in huisman et al 2004 considering both the buoyancy regulation of microcystis with different sizes and light intensity variations on the water surface within one day these two modifications have significant impacts on the simulation results leading to which more close to the reality figs 9 b and 10 b show the vertical simulations only considering buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies figs 9 c and 10 c show simulations only considering light intensity variations within one day figs 9 d and 10 d show simulations considering both factors in the calm water before artificial mixing most of microcystis colonies concentrate on the largest population position with the population of 5 82 106cells l according to fig 9 b after ten day simulations microcystis does not take the obvious advantage due to the smaller initial populations on the contrary chlorella above the largest population position of microcystis has strong photosynthesis in view of lacking competition hence the population of chlorella increase and then it sinks due to the gravity which leads to the special vertical distribution in fig 9 b fig 9 b reveals that buoyancy regulation of microcystis determines the vertical population distributions according to fig 9 c most of microcystis gather on the surface without considering buoyancy regulation which leads to significant increase in population of microcystis and obvious decrease of chlorella in result in addition we find that the population of microcystis does not increase without limit this is because that microcystis has respiration in the night and only has photosynthesis when the light intensity is larger than the compensation irradiance if we do not consider the light intensity variations on the surface the population of microcystis will increase without limit which is contrary to the reality involving light intensity variations on the surface will reasonably limit the growth of microcystis according to fig 9 d the simulation results are consistent with the real distributions and microcystis colonies win the competition within ten days after artificial intervention in the lake both microcystis and chlorella distribute relatively uniformly in the vertical even though there still is the largest population position of microcystis in fig 10 b and d we can still find that light intensity variations on the surface limit growth of both competitive species both figs 9 and 10 show the importance of buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies and light intensity variations within one day in the competition among other species which is the biggest improvements of this model compared with the model developed by huisman et al 2004 3 3 competitive advantage pictures we draw the competitive advantage pictures fig 11 through numerous simulations based on this coupled model a parameter sensitivity analysis on the largest population of the competing species in the vertical also reflect the vertical distributions of population has been taken yu et al 2017b size of microcystis colonies has a significant impact on the competitive population of microcystis but has little impact on that of chlorella in calm water the microcystis colonies with larger sizes will be easier to win the competition and the smaller one will take a longer time to win its competition with chlorella in calm water that is the size of colonies will not influence the final winning species but will change the time to win the competition in addition the size of colonies has little effect on the competition in turbulent water hence we set a constant radius of microcystis colonies to draw the pictures the competition objects are the buoyancy regulated microcystis colony with the radius of 100 μm and chlorella with the constant sinking velocity and the radius of 8 μm respectively the velocity of microcystis colony varies with the incident light intensity while the sinking velocity of chlorella is 1 389 10 5 m s the simulation time is 10 days d and the water depth two important parameters reflecting the hydrodynamic characteristics of a waterbody as aforementioned are the corresponding variables on the x axis and y axis respectively the water depth ranges between 0 1 and 100 m while d ranges from 0 01 to 100 cm2 s in all the simulations the critical value of the population of microcystis colonies is 1 15 107 cells l anzecc 1992 therefore this value as the initial threshold is used to determine whether the algae abundance is harmful to animals and partially reflect the eutrophic conditions of water more specifically if the population of microcystis or chlorella is larger than 1 15 107 cells l the water is eutrophic considering different natural phenomenon we set another two initial values as well 1 15 104 cells l is the representative of oligotrophic water and 1 15 1010 cells l is the representative of eutrophic water the concrete values of other variables are listed in tables 1 and 2 fig 11 shows the outcomes of the competitions for light between microcystis and chlorella with different initial abundances in fig 11 microcystis wins means that the total abundances of microcystis over the entire water column increase while those of chlorella decrease after 10 day simulation chlorella wins means that the total abundances of chlorella increase in the vertical direction of water while those of microcystis decrease after 10 day simulation both win means that both the abundances of microcystis and chlorella over depth increase no blooms means that the abundances of both competing species decrease in the vertical direction and the algae abundances are lower than the population level of blooms 1 15 107 cells l both lose means that the abundances of both competing species in the vertical direction decrease but the abundances may be higher than the population level of blooms due to the high initial abundances as shown in fig 11 we summarize the suitable environment for microcystis and chlorella despite of different initial abundances 1 microcystis is adapted to the calm and deep water 2 chlorella is adapted to the turbulent and shallow water 3 both microcystis and chlorella are suitable to survive in the calm and shallow water 4 neither microcystis nor chlorella are adapted to the turbulent and deep water that is seldom existed in the nature except the man made river type reservoirs xie et al 2013 along with the increase in the initial abundances 1 15 104 1 15 1010 cells l the regime area of no blooms enlarges on the other hand the regime area of microcystis wins and chlorella wins shrink because both microcystis and chlorella would be shaded by the increased self shading the initial scale of microcystis and chlorella is 1 1 which rarely happens in the nature however we find that the initial scale will not influence the dominant algae figs 6 and 7 which means that both the depth and the turbulence of the water determine the final dominant algae if the nutrient is rich and the water temperature is higher than 20 c there are the other two distinct differences between our competitive advantage pictures and that in huisman et al 2004 besides different initial abundances of species first of all when the water is shallow the depth is between 0 and 6 m and calm d is smaller than 0 02 cm2 s fig 11 b shows that both populations of competitive species will increase because the light intensity at the bottom is abundant and both species can absorb enough light to grow on the contrary the simulation result in huisman et al 2004 shows that microcystis colony wins the competition because they assume that microcystis only flows upwards without buoyancy regulation hence microcystis gathers on the water surface and avoids light penetrating into deeper water secondly when the depth of water is deeper than 40 m and water is turbulent d is between 6 and 8 cm2 s fig 11 b shows that there are no blooms which means both populations of competitive species decrease on the contrary the simulation result in huisman et al 2004 shows that chlorella representative of diatoms and green algae wins the competition the aforementioned simulations reflect that our simulations coincide with the natural phenomenon better 4 discussion 4 1 intervention mechanisms of hydrodynamic turbulence on light competition between buoyant microcystis and sinking algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable higher than 20 c light is the main or even single limited resource for coexisting species to compete for a better vertical position will help the competing species absorb enough light nutrient loading increasing temperature and enough incident light intensity are all primary drivers of algae blooms yu et al 2015b harke et al 2016 in eutrophic lakes or reservoirs where microcystis blooms usually dominate nutrients and temperature are enough hence the algae that takes the advantage of absorbing light would win the competition as incident light would be attenuated in the vertical suspended species background water and solids all avoid light penetrating into the lower layer hence the algae in the upper layer would take the advantage as shown in fig 8 b most of microcystis gather in the upper layer while most of chlorella stay at the bottom that is the vertical distributions of species are very important to the species competition a better vertical position will help the competing species absorb enough light artificial mixing has been widely used to curb cyanobacterial blooms visser et al 2015 because hydrodynamic turbulence significantly change the vertical population distributions the vertical distributions of all coexisted species tend to be uniform the loss rate is larger than the growth rate of microcystis hence the populations decrease the main determinant factor of population distributions in the vertical is different in calm water and in turbulent water respectively self migration is the main factor that determines the vertical population distributions of coexisting species in calm water in the deep and calm aquatic environment where turbulent diffusion is very small the buoyant microcystis would migrate in the upper layer of the water column while the sinking chlorella would sink in the deeper water fig 8 b as incident light is hindered by water the suspended solids and algae the intensity of the incident light decreases with the distance from the water surface hence microcystis floating upwards into the upper layer could have enough light and have fully photosynthesis then they grow abundantly so as to shield the deeper water from the light in consequence therefore the growth rate of chlorella in the deeper water would be subject to the limited incident light in the deeper layer the abundances of chlorella over depth would decrease in addition sedimentation is a primary loss way of green algae and diatoms visser et al 2015 compared to microcystis with buoyancy regulation the self velocity of chlorella and other sinking algae is towards the bottom and against the solar irradiance hence like sediments most diatoms and green algae mainly stay in the lower layer of calm and stratified water sedimentation loss of diatoms and green algae is large in calm water besides microcystis colonies would minimize the grazing by zooplankton harke et al 2016 in calm water microcystis cells or small sized microcystis colonies would gather into colonies with larger sizes yu et al 2015a hence the grazing loss of microcystis is small while grazing loss of diatoms and green algae with small sizes is relatively large all of these lead to the domination of microcystis in calm and stratified water on the contrary it s hydrodynamic turbulence that mainly influences the vertical population distributions in relatively turbulent water if water is very turbulent the competing species would be entrained by eddies to the depth where the population is smaller in addition the intensified turbulence will entrain the algae in the bottom back to the water thus both microcystis and chlorella are distributed more uniformly over the entire water column fig 8 c microcystis assemblages would be split into smaller colonies or even units by intensified turbulent eddies the turbulent diffusions overweight the buoyancy regulation of microcystis the buoyancy regulation of microcystis has less effects hence the competition species have the same opportunity to absorb the incident light therefore chlorella with faster growth rate has an advantage over the slower growing microcystis colonies chlorella grows abundantly the large amounts of chlorella will hinder the light with the self shading the growth rate of competing microcystis would get slower until the loss rate is larger than the growth rate the amount of microcystis gradually decreases chlorella wins the competition in the turbulent water 4 2 suitable aquatic environment of buoyant microcystis and sinking algae in relatively shallow water with depth lower than 10 m chlorella takes the advantage to win the competition and is prone to blooms on the other hand if water is deeper than 10 m and water is not turbulent microcystis colonies are easy to win the competition with chlorella when eutrophic water with microcystis blooms is artificially disturbed microcystis might not be replaced by chlorella it is because that the variation between species depends on turbulent diffusion of water after disturbance water depth and population of microcystis colonies if water depth is the same the range of d is smaller to convert microcystis to chlorella when population of microcystis is larger as shown in fig 11 many cases can confirm the phytoplankton shifts caused by the regime shifts in fig 11 take fig 11 b as an example there are three corresponding scenarios in the nature the first scenario is that the depth keeps similar while the hydrodynamic turbulence is intensified the intensified mixing of water and the turbulent river downstream from a eutrophic lake in the nature follow this scenario the artificial mixing of lake nieuwe meer leads to the shift from microcystis to chlorella huisman et al 2004 the dominant microcystis from the eutrophic dianchi lake upstream is replaced by green algae and diatoms in the turbulent tanglang river downstream yu et al 2017a the second scenario is that the depth increases while the turbulence weakens the impoundment of the channel in the pool reach of the hydropower station falls into this category for example the dominant algae shifts from chlorella to microcystis in several tributaries of the yangtze river after the impoundment of the three gorges reservoir tgr zheng et al 2011 liu et al 2012 the last scenario is that the depth is small while the turbulence keeps intensified in the case the dominant algae is chlorella if the initial abundance is very high the growth rates of both competing species in the water will be suppressed according to fig 11 c acuña et al 2011 has found that higher velocity would inhibit the growth of algae in the pampean stream the field experiment conducted by mitrovic et al 2011 also confirms this shift prediction in phytoplankton in this work we concentrate on the influence of hydrodynamics on the light competition between microcystis and chlorella without considering vertical water temperature stratification considering its importance we will include the water temperature layering in the future to improve the model there are two types of vertical temperature distributions first of all there is relatively uniform temperature in the vertical in tgr xie et al 2013 which is a special phenomenon this is due to the large amounts of discharges flowing through the reservoir during the flooding season the uniform water temperature has no significant impacts on the competition results between microcystis and chlorella secondly most of lakes reservoirs in the nature have stable temperature stratifications the water temperature in the deep water is between 5 10 c li et al 2016 according to table a 4 in introduction to fluid mechanics shaughnessy et al 2005 the water density is between 999 7 1000 kg m 3 we assume that the water density in the deep water is 1000 kg m 3 considering the density of chlorella does not vary with the light intensity the density of chlorella is between 1088 1102 kg m 3 oliver et al 1981 reynolds 2006 in this work the density of chlorella is set to be 1098 kg m 3 which is larger than that of water therefore chlorella sinks in the whole vertical water on the contrary the density of microcystis colony varies with the light intensity where it exists the density of microcystis colony in the deep water is about 992 kg m 3 yu et al 2015b it is because that in the deep water where the light intensity is lower than 10 9 μmol photons m 2 s 1 the cellular respiration surpasses oxygenic photosynthesis the density of microcystis colony is much smaller than that of water hence microcystis colony floats upwards contrarily due to the very small turbulent diffusion in the deep and layering lakes reservoirs most of chlorella stay in the deeper positions and seldom be entrained by eddies to the shallower water therefore microcystis colony will win the competition in the deep and layering water in conclusion the vertical distribution of water temperature does not influence the final winning species shown in fig 11 5 conclusions in this study a mathematical algae competition model for light by incorporating the buoyancy regulation of microcystis is developed microcystis and chlorella are chosen as the representatives of cyanobacteria and green algae and diatoms respectively the nutrients are assumed to be rich and the water temperature is higher than 20 c hence the growth rates of the competing species are only limited by the incident light intensity alone we find that the vertical distributions of population mainly influence the final advantage species in the calm water self migration is the main factor that determines vertical population distributions of coexisting species there exists a position with the largest population of microcystis the position is usually below water surface and in the upper layer however most of chlorella stays near the bottom on the contrary it s hydrodynamic turbulence that mainly influences vertical population distributions in turbulent water all of the species distribute uniformly in the vertical the faster growing chlorella takes the advantage in addition the competitive advantage pictures show that water turbulence together with water depth reflect the dominant algae when nutrients are rich and water temperature is suitable microcystis colonies adapt to deep and calm water environment while chlorella gains the advantage in shallow and relatively turbulent aquatic environment if water is deep and relatively turbulent none of species would live the competitive advantage pictures using this coupled model could explain many nature
