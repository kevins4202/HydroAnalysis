17710,phosphonates discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have attracted increasing concerns because of their potential impact on eutrophication and potential risks to aquatic ecosystems however very few studies are available on their occurrence and transformation in wwtps partly due to the lack of sensitive methods for phosphonate analysis in complex matrices herein based on our recent progress in phosphonate analysis the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates along the full scale wastewater treatment processes of two textile dyeing wwtps were revealed a set of typical phosphonates including six phosphonate chelators pcs and four potential degradation products of pcs dp pcs were quantified in different units and the final dewatered sludge three pcs 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp at upmost mg l and a considerable amount of four dp pcs 9 12 608 μg l were detected in the influents of both wwtps in the subsequent treatment ntmp could be removed more efficiently than pbtc and hedp especially in the coagulation unit and the dissolved phosphonates were eliminated more readily than other dissolved organic phosphorus fractions of particular note the toxicologically critical dp pc i e aminomethylphosphonic acid was produced during the coagulation and biological treatment units the final precipitation unit seemed essential to ensure satisfactory removal of pcs and dp pcs in addition a significant accumulation of phosphonates in dewatered sludge up to 7 81 g kg and the widespread occurrence of harmful dp pcs also reminded us to pay more concerns on their potential risks during further sludge disposal in future graphical abstract image graphical

performance liquid chromatography wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting factor for the growth of all aquatic organisms and effective removal of excessive p from wastewater is imperative to prevent water eutrophication rott et al 2018b as one of the main sources of p to the receiving water bodies wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been facing increasingly stringent discharge standard of the total phosphorus tp in the effluent e g tp 0 1 0 5 mg l especially for sensitive areas that suffer from eutrophication or serve as drinking water sources oleszkiewicz et al 2006 li et al 2012 rott et al 2018b in wwtps tp removal could be enhanced by improving biological processes increasing the precipitant dosage and or adopting more efficient separation technologies rott et al 2018b gu et al 2011 however the efficiency of the above strategies is greatly dependent upon the chemistry of the wastewater particularly the fractions of tp e g abundant inorganic and organic p species rott et al 2018b traditional processes such as biological treatment adsorption and precipitation coagulation could efficiently remove inorganic phosphorus ip but usually work worse for organic phosphorus op species neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 rott et al 2018b for instance biological processes and coagulation could not enable an efficient removal of high content of op from flotation wastewater and flame retardant cloth washing wastewater ma et al 2017 duan et al 2019 thus it is fundamental and imperative to understand the composition of various p species in wastewater for the ongoing development of advanced p treatment technologies nowadays a wide variety of op species have been identified and classified into five categories nucleic acids nucleotides inositol phosphates phospholipids and phosphonates baldwin 2013 phosphonates are a broad class of op compounds that contain one or more phosphonic acid groups c po oh 2 substantially increasing fraction of dissolved organic phosphorus dop was detected in the effluents of european wwtps with the phosphonate chelators pcs coming into use in early 1980s neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 the main pcs include 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp ethylenediamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid edtmp hexamethylenediamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid hdtmp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp with their molecular structure depicted in fig 1 they are commonly used in paper and textile production household cleaning products membrane filtration and cooling water systems rott et al 2018b the global consumption of pcs was 56 000 t a in 1998 davenport et al 2000 and enormously increased to 94 000 t a in 2012 epa 2013 meanwhile pcs are often discussed in connection with various environmental issues including possible remobilization of heavy metals gledhill and feijtel 1992 bordas and bourg 1998 nowack 2003 the interference with phosphate precipitation wenger oehn et al 2005 nowack and stone 2006 rott et al 2018b as well as the contribution to eutrophication ternan et al 1998 davenport et al 2000 knepper and weil 2001 jaworska et al 2002 rott et al 2018b when pcs are discharged from various industries the degradation products of phosphonate chelators dp pcs may be generated via various pathways such as microbial metabolism grandcoin et al 2017 drzyzga and lipok 2017 catalytic oxidation nowack 2002a and photodegradation sun et al 2019 kuhn et al 2017 the potential dp pcs include glyphosate glyp aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid 2 aep and iminodi methylenephosphonic acid idmp fig 1 rott et al 2018b grandcoin et al 2017 drzyzga and lipok 2017 ampa and idmp also represent synthesis intermediates of commercial pcs armbruster et al 2019a and 2 aep is an important biogenic phosphonate cembella and antia 1986 although pcs at environmental levels are usually harmless for a wide variety of aquatic organisms it is not the case for dp pcs for example glyp was classified as a probable human carcinogen iarc 2015 and ampa was considered to have genotoxic effects grandcoin et al 2017 mañas et al 2009 wwtps are one of the main sinks of pcs and dp pcs rott et al 2018b armbruster et al 2019a up to now very limited studies are available on the concentrations of pcs in wastewater this is possibly due to the lack of simple and sensitive methods applicable for pcs analysis in complicated matrices rott et al 2018b most available methods featured high limits of detection lods for instance 25 40 µg l fürhacker et al 2005 and 15 57 µg l nowack 1997 1998 2002b very recently rott et al 2020 reported the concentration variations of five pcs pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp during municipal wastewater treatment by using an ion exchange chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ic ms ms method of relatively low limits of quantification loqs 0 6 2 3 µg l armbruster et al 2019b however the contribution of different treatment units on the fate of pcs remains unclear moreover to the best of our knowledge there is no open literature reporting the concentration of pcs coupled with their degradation products in wwtps thus further studies are required on the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates i e pcs and dp pcs in wastewater along the combined processes in full scale wwtps also the presence of phosphonates in sludge should be concerned where considerable amounts of phosphonates were transferred via adsorption nowack 1998 rott et al 2018b in our recent study we reported a new method of low loqs 5 0 200 ng l and strong practicability i e pre methylation and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms to determinate pcs in industrial effluents wang et al 2019 which enabled us to perform this study on the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates in wwtps herein two typical textile dyeing wwtps were concerned because textile dyeing wastewater is listed as the third largest sources 2 billion m3 a of chinese industrial wastewater featuring high usage and discharge of phosphonates liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 xue et al 2019 nowack 1998 rott et al 2018b the unit dependent removal of phosphonates including six pcs and four dp pcs was particularly considered and the contents of pcs and dp pcs in sludge were also determined 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents pbtc of analytical standard aqueous solution 50 in mass with purity

ehrenstorfer augsburg germany hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were provided by merck co germany all other chemicals were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and were at reagent grade or of higher purity ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was employed throughout the study except for the hplc ms grade water merck co germany which was used for preparation of the mobile phase the preparation methods of stock solutions are listed in text s1 2 2 sample collection wastewater and sludge samples were collected from two wwtps located in a cotton textile printing dyeing plant in jiaxing city wwtpa and a textile printing dyeing industry zone using natural and chemical fibers as raw material in tongxiang city wwtpb zhejiang province of china the process flow schemes of both wwtps are very popular in the textile dyeing industry in china fig 2 both wwtps employed the grating chemical precipitation processes using iron or aluminum salts as the primary treatment the combined anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o processes and hydrolysis acidification ha sequencing batch reactor sbr processes were adopted as the secondary treatment for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively for further p removal the secondary chemical precipitation using aluminum salt was adopted after biological treatment for both wwtps note that the influent of wwtpa was deliberately divided into two parts according to different chemical oxygen demand cod values the high part 3000 mg l and low part 2000 mg l at the volume ratio of 1 2 furthermore air flotation and naclo oxidation were also employed in wwtpa the secondary clarifier effluent of wwtpb was subjected to sand filtration sf and 50 of the filtered effluent was further treated by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro for water reclamation another half was mixed with the 50 ro concentrate equal to 25 of the sf effluent of wwtpb and pumped to the centralized wwtps for further treatment the same as the final effluent of wwtpa other details about two wwtps is available in table s1 grab samples were taken along the treatment processes within several hours considering the residence time of each unit such sampling strategies could ensure the same source of each sample furthest a total of 19 wastewater samples one sample at each sampling point were collected from the two wwtps with the sampling points illustrated in fig 2 and the properties of each sample available in table s2 the dewatered sludge samples from both wwtps were also collected all the samples were transferred to brown glass bottles and stored at 4 c for further processing 2 3 analytical methods wastewater all the samples were membrane filtered 0 45 μm pore size prior to the analysis various dissolved fractions of p in the aqueous samples were determined according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 4500 p apha 1998 with the terms and definitions summarized in scheme s1 molybdenum blue method was used to quantify the dissolved reactive phosphorus drp mainly referred to as orthophosphate after 0 45 μm filtration the total dissolved phosphorus tdp after potassium persulfate acid digestion the dissolved acid hydrolysable phosphorus dahp calculated as the difference between that from the colorimetric determination after h2so4 hydrolysis and drp and the dop calculated as the difference between tdp and that from colorimetric determination after h2so4 hydrolysis the concentrations of various pcs and dp pcs in the samples were determined by two separate analytical methods according to the previous studies wang et al 2016 2018b 2019 in brief six pcs including pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp hdtmp and dtpmp were measured by lc ms ms after h cation exchange and tmschn2 methylation when necessary solid phase extraction spe was applied to concentrate the analytes from the interfering matrix as detailed in table s3 four dp pcs idmp glyp ampa and 2 aep were determined by lc ms ms after fmoc cl derivatization wang et al 2016 2018b skeff et al 2016 nowack 2002a details on the sample pretreatment extraction and analysis is described in text s2 sludge the fractionation of p in the sludge including the tp op and ip was analyzed according to a harmonized protocol proposed by the standards measurements and testing smt programme european commission details of the extraction procedures are available in scheme s2 gonzález medeiros et al 2005 a blank test was performed along with every batch of samples phosphate in the extracts was determined on a uv vis spectrophotometer based on the molybdenum blue method extraction method for pcs and dp pcs from sludge samples was slightly modified from previous studies armbruster et al 2019 gonzález medeiros et al 2005 briefly 0 1 g of freeze dried sludge powder was mixed with a 100 ml solution containing 0 25 mol l naoh and 0 05 mol l edta and the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 16 h the suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the alkaline extracted sample was separated and neutralized by hcl after dilution at 10 times or higher six pcs and four dp pcs in the resultant water extracts were determined according to the procedures described above quantitative analysis of samples was conducted by a dionex ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc system coupled with a high resolution q exactive focus orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer ms ms thermo fisher scientific inc germany the derivatives were separated on a reversed phase zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 100 mm 4 6 mm

are shown in figs s1 s4 2 4 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quantification of the target phosphonates was performed with the internal standard method the regression coefficients r2 for 7 to 10 point calibration standards were higher than 0 98 for all the target analytes relative standard deviations rsds of the triplicate determination for each sample were 15 accuracy were checked by spiking recovery for each uhplc ms ms analysis the recoveries fell in the ranges of 74 123 and 77 123 for all analytes in the wastewater and sludge respectively the loqs ranged from 0 010 μg l pbtc to 5 0 μg l idmp and from 0 080 mg kg pbtc to 40 mg kg idmp for the wastewater and sludge respectively table s8 the concentrations of the target chemicals in sludge are reported on a dry weight basis the calibration curves of target analytes were re established every week after mass calibration a method blank was analyzed with every batch of samples and an instrumental blank consisting of pure water only was injected after every 20 sample tests details on qa qc methods including internal standard correction spiking recovery calibration curve and the determination of loqs are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of various p fractions during wastewater treatment it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the employed processes for removing various p fractions since it affects the final tdp in the effluent the fate of various dissolved p fractions drp dop and dahp along the treatment processes of both wwtps is illustrated in fig 3 with experimental data listed in table s9 and their elimination rates for each unit are shown in table 1 generally the composition and concentration of tdp 3 88 17 3 mg l in the influents of two wwtps differed significantly in terms of dop wwtpa 41 and 47 wwtpb 26 drp wwtpa 47 and 39 wwtpb 72 and dahp wwtpa 12 and 14 wwtpb 1 5 among the dissolved p fractions dahp was readily removed via hydrolysis into orthophosphate or adsorption onto coagulants since its concentration dropped down successively along with the units of both wwtps in case of drp relatively low removal was observed after the primary treatment i e the first chemical precipitation unit it is possibly because phosphonate is very competitive with phosphate for adsorption sites of the formed flocks during precipitation rott et al 2018b the concentrations of drp were further decreased after biological treatment and almost all the drp could be removed after the second chemical precipitation in both wwtps the removal of dop in both wwtps showed different profiles probably due to their different compositions and different processes in wwtpa dop of two influents was initially removed after the primary treatment and further removed by the biological treatment after the secondary clarification the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes contributed to the reduction of all the p fractions significantly with the residual dop of 0 11 0 01 mg l in the final effluent accounting for 46 of tdp on the contrary the processes of wwtpb worked ineffectively for removing dop after the secondary clarification dop contributed to most of the remaining tdp and its removal was not enhanced by sf and uf stages ro is a robust unit as the terminal step for reuse of the reclaimed water which enabled the separation of almost all the dissolved organic matters from the uf effluent resulting in a great drop of dop note that higher concentrations of several concerned compounds detected in the final effluent resulted from the mixture with the ro concentrate dop 1 19 0 03 mg l accounting for 97 of its tdp p fractions in the sludge of both textile dyeing wwtps were also concerned in this study tp contents in the dewatered sludge were 11 1 0 3 and 7 23 0 16 g kg for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively and ip was the principal component of tp in the dewatered sludge in both wwtps 7 46 0 36 and 4 58 0 09 g kg for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively as for op its concentrations were 3 32 0 04 and 2 93 0 10 g kg accounting for 30 and 40 of tp in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the op tp ratios were slightly higher than the average value of the municipal sludge samples 26 8 wang et al 2018a the sum of p contents in ip and op fractions agreed with 4 0 with the tp fraction in textile dyeing wastewater dahp is a negligible component in the final effluent and drp can be nearly completely removed through the combined processes in this case dop turned to be a limiting factor to achieve lower p level of the final effluent meanwhile op in sludge samples also accounted for a considerable proportion of tp thus it is necessitated to better understand the occurrence and transformation of different op fractions in the textile dyeing wastewater and sludge considering the massive amount of pcs used in the textile printing and dyeing processes the following sections are mainly focused on various phosphonates i e pcs and dp pcs in wastewater and sludge samples 3 2 occurrence of phosphonates in wwtp influents in this study six pcs and four dp pcs were determined in each wwtp influent figs 4 5 tables s10 s11 in general high concentrations of hedp and ntmp were detected in two influents of wwtpa 3 79 0 05 mg l hedp and 4 57 0 17 mg l ntmp in the high concentration influent and 0 820 0 028 mg l hedp and 1 34 0 09 mg l ntmp in the low concentration influent in wwtpb the concentration of pbtc hedp and ntmp fell in the range of 59 227 µg l pcs reaching as high as mg l level in wwtpa was similar to that reported in three chinese textile dyeing wwtps wang et al 2019 in a german wwtp receiving wastewater from textile factories ntmp was detected at 60 330 µg l nowack 2002b nowack 1998 determined the pcs in seven swiss wwtps and reported their highest concentration of 1 26 mg l in the influent of a wwtp receiving the textile effluent the concentrations of pcs in the concerned municipal wwtps were detailed as ntmp 20 224 µg l edtmp 48 65 µg l and dtpmp 74 109 µg l furthermore edtmp was detected at 49 and 167 µg l in two austrian municipal wwtps fürhacker et al 2005 very recently pbtc 22 119 µg l hedp 57 231 µg l ntmp 0 6 15 µg l edtmp 1 4 11 µg l and dtpmp 14 71 µg l were reported in two germany municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 obviously pcs is ubiquitous in municipal and textile dyeing wastewaters with much higher concentration in the latter one among four dp pcs measured three of them ampa 2 aep and idmp were detectable in all the influent samples from both wwtps idmp wwtpa 608 40 µg l and 545 10 µg l wwtpb 162 5 µg l and ampa wwtpa 146 4 µg l and 34 2 3 6 µg l wwtpb 51 8 1 8 µg l were the main dp pcs in the influents while 2 aep ranked 3rd in the influent samples wwtpa 87 6 3 2 µg l and 39 2 3 2 µg l wwtpb 17 5 1 9 µg l glyp was detected in wwtpa influents 9 12 1 27 and 11 4 0 2 µg l but negligible in wwtpb as for the source of the above dp pcs armbruster et al 2019a investigated the impurity of the commercial ntmp based chelators used in drinking water treatment plants and evidenced the presence of idmp ntmp eliminating one methylenephosphonic acid group ntmp mep and ampa ntmp 2mep armbruster et al 2019a thus idmp and ampa in the wwtp influents were probably derived from the chelator impurities in addition the abundance of potential dp pcs including 2 aep glyp and a small portion of idmp and ampa possibly resulted from the slight biotic and abiotic degradation of aminopolyphosphonates drzyzga and lipok 2017 grandcoin et al 2017 3 3 removal of phosphonates from wastewater 3 3 1 overall removal efficiency based on the concentration profile of pcs in the influents and final effluents figs 4 and table s10 the overall removal efficiency of the pcs was obtained table 1 which was in line with the values 80 in wwtps operated with chemical precipitation in a recent review rott et al 2018b the pcs removal followed the orders of ntmp hedp pbtc similar high removal rates of 99 3 99 6 ntmp 98 2 99 4 hedp and 95 8 99 7 pbtc were reported in three textile dying wwtps wang et al 2019 rott et al 2020 found that pbtc showed the lowest elimination a median of 84 9 of all five pcs pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp in two municipal wwtps the removal of ntmp was reported at 80 via chemical precipitation in five swiss wwtps nowack 1998 and one german wwtp nowack 2002b comparatively the removal of pcs seemed challenging via biological treatment only in a laboratory test reichert 1996 found that the maximum pbtc adsorption was only 50 in activated sludge process at the initial concentration of 50 mg l indicating its weaker affinity towards activated sludge than polyphosphonates the elimination of hedp in european wwtps has been previously investigated in two field studies involving spiking with 2 g l hedp in the influents with the efficiency differing significantly 90 after biological treatment and chemical precipitation müller et al 1984 and only 25 70 in the oxidation ditch metzner 1990 at a spiked concentration of 2 mg l in the influent of a wwtp only 60 of the ntmp was eliminated based on the activated sludge process metzner 1990 in general pcs could be removed with relatively high efficiency in wwtps operated with chemical precipitation as for dp cps they were all below the loqs except ampa in the effluent of both wwtps fig 5 and table s11 the overall removal efficiencies of glyp and ampa idmp and 2 aep are listed in table 1 although most dps and dp pcs were finally removed for both wwtps it should be concerned that some units also play a role in the recurrence of new compounds therefore their removal at different units should also be considered to better understand and further improve the performance of each unit 3 3 2 unit dependent removal of phosphonates fig 4 depicts the profile of the dissolved pcs along the combined processes of two wwtps data detailed in table s10 and corresponding elimination rates are shown in table 1 in general the total concentration of pcs decreased along the combined processes in both wwtps in the first chemical precipitation unit the removal of different pcs followed the orders of ntmp hedp in wwtpa and ntmp hedp pbtc in wwtpb it implies that ntmp could be removed more readily by chemical precipitation than hedp and pbtc the subsequent biological treatment resulted in enhanced removal of the residual pcs during the a a o processes in wwtpa the total removal of hedp and ntmp rapidly rose up after the anoxic unit and were further improved after the oxic unit as for the ha sbr processes adopted in wwtpb ha led to negligible elimination for hedp and ntmp and even a slight increase of pbtc in fact a slight desorption of pbtc was also observed from the digested sludge under anaerobic conditions in a laboratory test reichert 1996 implying the possible accumulation of pbtc in the wwtp after the sbr unit most of the pcs were effectively removed previous studies nowack 2003 rott et al 2018b suggested that the biological removal of various pcs in wwtps predominantly resulted from their adsorption onto the activated and digested sludge a further removal of the dissolved pcs could be achieved by secondary chemical precipitation in both wwtps similarly the majority of total pc elimination a median of 89 2 occurred in the biological treatment of two municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 as for the water reclaim units in wwtpb no significant removal of pcs occurred during the sf and uf since both units mainly targeted at physical removal of suspended solids rott et al 2020 all the pcs were present below loqs in the ro effluent very low concentrations of pcs were present in the final effluent of wwtpa hedp 13 3 0 3 µg l ntmp 3 37 0 15 µg l and wwtpb pbtc 14 1 0 3 µg l hedp 13 1 0 4 µg l ntmp 1 04 0 06 µg l the removal of dp pcs along the treatment processes in both wwtps are described in fig 5 the concentrations and elimination rates are detailed in table s11 and table 1 during the primary treatment glyp 2 aep and idmp were eliminated significantly however ampa showed a low elimination rate in wwtpb and even an apparent negative removal was observed in wwtpa the precipitation efficiency of ampa during coagulation remains uncertain because it was simultaneously formed from degradation of other phosphonates after the secondary treatment the concentrations of glyp and 2 aep were below the loqs in both wwtps because of their potential biodegradability wang et al 2016 2018b idmp containing two phosphonic acid groups possesses similar properties to the parent pcs and it could be readily removed by adsorption onto sludge after biological treatment idmp was almost completely removed in both wwtps however it is worth noting that the concentration of ampa increased up to 732 759 and 46 8 74 5 µg l an increase of 0 44 to 9 times after biological treatment in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the increasing ampa concentration implies that the transformation of other phosphonates into ampa be faster than its bio elimination in both wwtps biodegradation and sludge adsorption may work in parallel for the dp pcs removal from wastewater but their sole contributions are still obscure ampa and idmp were further removed after the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes and coagulation sedimentation in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively in the additional water reclaim units of wwtpb the removal of ampa was insignificant by sf and uf units whereas dp pcs were below loqs in ro effluent finally only 15 7 0 6 µg l and 5 89 0 53 µg l ampa were residual in the final effluent of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively accordingly the secondary chemical precipitation plays a crucial role in eliminating ampa generated during primary and secondary treatments as ampa has been classified as a critical degradation product from the toxicological point of view further studies are needed to assess the potential risk of ampa generated during wastewater treatment 3 3 3 ampa formation and elimination pathways in wwtps as mentioned above toxicologically critical ampa was formed during the coagulation and biological treatment units generally degradation of related phosphonates whether biotic or abiotic is associated with ampa formation under natural conditions grandcoin et al 2017 the main ampa formation during coagulation is probably via the photodegradation of fe ntmp due to the presence of iron salt as the coagulant generally most pcs including ntmp edtmp and dtpmp could serve as the ligand to bind fe iii and the resultant fe iii complexes were sensitive to photo degradation where ampa was one of the main products nowack 2003 jaworska et al 2002 grandcoin et al 2017 in addition ampa was known as a metabolite of glyphosate and it also possibly came from microbial degradation of pcs generally pcs could not be readily biodegraded because of the strong c p bond however various microorganisms have been identified to enable the use pcs as their only p source for instance schowanek and verstraete 1990 found that majority of the enriched cultures from the environmental samples peat soil activated sludge digested sludge etc could solely degrade one phosphonate group from the polyphosphonates while only a few ones could enable a complete c p bond cleavage of all the phosphonate groups in addition forlani et al 2011 successfully used spirulina strains to remove 50 of polyphosphonate from wastewater therefore the microbial degradation of aminophosphonates including ntmp idmp glyp and other related phosphonates is supposed to be the main pathway for ampa formation during biological treatment from the adsorption point of view ampa seemed to have lower adsorption tendency than glyp idmp or ntmp by the sludge and or suspended particulate matter spm in wwtps physicochemical properties of each phosphonate are listed in table s12 popov et al 2001 nowack and stone 1999 skeff et al 2018 rott et al 2018a 2018b poiger et al 2020 as a result the dissolved ampa in water was also possibly derived from the degradation of other phosphonates adsorbed on solid phase finally most ampa generated during primary and secondary treatments was removed for both wwtps however ampa removal through coagulation and biological treatment is rarely documented in this study the final chemical precipitation seemed essential to ensure high elimination of ampa hall and camm 2007 reported the removal efficiencies of glyp and ampa during coagulation clarification ranged from 10 to 80 depending on ph coagulant type and dose therefore chemical precipitation is possibly an effective pathway of ampa removal in addition ampa removal has been observed by adsorption onto sludge instead of biodegradation during activated sludge treatment with the efficiency of 36 89 a median of 64 poiger et al 2020 thus we believe that the formation and elimination of ampa were likely to occur simultaneously during biological treatment 3 4 accumulation of phosphonates in sludge given that pc removal in wwtps was mainly achieved by adsorption onto sludge instead of biodegradation or chemical transformation rott et al 2018b the presence of pcs and dp pcs in sludge was considered in this study here six pcs and four dp pcs in the dewatered sludge were determined and the results are listed in table 2 surprisingly high phosphonate loads could be observed in the sludge of both wwtps with the sum of pcs at 7 33 0 57 and 3 28 0 25 g kg and that of dp pcs at 0 481 0 050 and 0 288 0 016 g kg in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively to date an average load of 1 2 1 5 g pc kg dry sludge was estimated in european municipal wwtps on the basis of the model calculation epa 2013 nowack 1998 2002b rott et al 2018b to the best of our knowledge no open reference is available on the analysis of the actual pc concentrations in sludge from wwtps due to the impurity of commercial pcs armbruster et al 2019a and the bio degradation of pcs drzyzga and lipok 2017 grandcoin et al 2017 some dp pcs of concern such as idmp ampa and 2 aep were also accumulated in sludge expect for glyp which was at μg l level in the influent of the secondary treatment in wwtpa and could not be detectable in sludge it also implied that biodegradation was effective for glyp removal generally pcs and dp pcs could be concentrated in sludge and a comprehensive risk assessment should be carried out when the sludge is used as fertilizer or for soil improvement in addition remarkable phosphonate loads were also reported in spm of wastewater recently rott et al 2020 reported the total phosphonate concentration of 223 2555 mg kg in the spm of municipal wastewaters and up to the triple digit mg kg adsorbed phosphonates were detected in the wastewater of a teaching and research wwtp armbruster et al 2019b since phosphonate is one of the essential components of tp in wastewaters rott et al 2020 it would be better to quantify the adsorbed phosphonates in spm 3 5 contribution of phosphonate p to the op fraction on the basis of the aforementioned discussion the op accounts for considerable proportion of tp in wastewater and sludge samples of both wwtps to further understand the composition of the op we calculated the concentration ratios of phosphonate p i e the sum of the target pcs and dp pcs to the total op along the water treatment processes fig 6 in the two influents of wwtpa the ratios were 26 and 40 and dropped down to 10 and 11 respectively after the combined air floatation coagulation processes however large amounts of ampa generated during the biological treatment resulted in a significant increase in the ratios by up to 47 after further removal of phosphonates in the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes it declined to 8 4 in the final effluent a similar trend of such ratios was observed for wwtpb except for a slight increase in the sbr process the ratio decreased from 16 initially to 0 4 in the final effluent of wwtpb obviously the generally declining trend of the ratio indicated that the processes employed in both wwtps were more effective for removal of dissolved phosphonates than for other dop fractions in addition the concentration ratio of phosphonate p to the op fraction was 71 and 35 in the sludge samples of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively much higher than the corresponding phosphonate p dop ratios in the influents of both wwtps it also implied that most of the phosphonate was removed by separation i e adsorption and coagulation or partial degradation instead of mineralization a recent study reported that concentration ratio of phosphonate p to the dissolved unreactive phosphorus mainly referred to dop fraction ranged from 10 to 40 throughout all the stages of municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 although wastewaters from different sources have different trends of the ratio along the treatment processes it is worth noting that phosphonate accounts for a considerable proportion in op moreover armbruster et al 2019a ever characterized the impurities of commercial pcs and found a significant proportion of phosphonate related impurities including the synthesis byproducts intermediates and degradation products for instance high amounts of phosphonate related impurities 20 were detected in industrial ntmp products in this study the target phosphonates only covered the inherent constituents of pcs and part of their synthesis intermediates or degradation products and other unidentified phosphonates might exist in wastewater and sludge therefore the proportion of total phosphonates in the op fraction is expected to be much higher than those determined in this study 4 conclusions in summary we characterized the occurrence and transformation of pcs and dp pcs along the combined processes of two textile dyeing wwtps the p removal is largely dependent upon the composition of dop fraction as well as the specific unit of the processes high concentrations at upmost mg l level of three pcs pbtc hedp and ntmp and a considerable amount of dp pcs idmp glyp ampa and 2 aep were distinguished in the influents ntmp could be removed more efficiently than pbtc and hedp during subsequent treatment especially in the coagulation unit both pcs and dp pcs could be effectively eliminated 78 after the secondary chemical precipitation whereas coagulation and biological treatment would accompany the generation of ampa in addition the dissolved phosphonate could be removed more efficiently than other dop fractions also the presence of pcs and dp pcs up to 7 81 g kg

17710,phosphonates discharged from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have attracted increasing concerns because of their potential impact on eutrophication and potential risks to aquatic ecosystems however very few studies are available on their occurrence and transformation in wwtps partly due to the lack of sensitive methods for phosphonate analysis in complex matrices herein based on our recent progress in phosphonate analysis the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates along the full scale wastewater treatment processes of two textile dyeing wwtps were revealed a set of typical phosphonates including six phosphonate chelators pcs and four potential degradation products of pcs dp pcs were quantified in different units and the final dewatered sludge three pcs 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp and nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp at upmost mg l and a considerable amount of four dp pcs 9 12 608 μg l were detected in the influents of both wwtps in the subsequent treatment ntmp could be removed more efficiently than pbtc and hedp especially in the coagulation unit and the dissolved phosphonates were eliminated more readily than other dissolved organic phosphorus fractions of particular note the toxicologically critical dp pc i e aminomethylphosphonic acid was produced during the coagulation and biological treatment units the final precipitation unit seemed essential to ensure satisfactory removal of pcs and dp pcs in addition a significant accumulation of phosphonates in dewatered sludge up to 7 81 g kg and the widespread occurrence of harmful dp pcs also reminded us to pay more concerns on their potential risks during further sludge disposal in future graphical abstract image graphical

performance liquid chromatography wwtp wastewater treatment plant 1 introduction phosphorus p is a limiting factor for the growth of all aquatic organisms and effective removal of excessive p from wastewater is imperative to prevent water eutrophication rott et al 2018b as one of the main sources of p to the receiving water bodies wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been facing increasingly stringent discharge standard of the total phosphorus tp in the effluent e g tp 0 1 0 5 mg l especially for sensitive areas that suffer from eutrophication or serve as drinking water sources oleszkiewicz et al 2006 li et al 2012 rott et al 2018b in wwtps tp removal could be enhanced by improving biological processes increasing the precipitant dosage and or adopting more efficient separation technologies rott et al 2018b gu et al 2011 however the efficiency of the above strategies is greatly dependent upon the chemistry of the wastewater particularly the fractions of tp e g abundant inorganic and organic p species rott et al 2018b traditional processes such as biological treatment adsorption and precipitation coagulation could efficiently remove inorganic phosphorus ip but usually work worse for organic phosphorus op species neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 rott et al 2018b for instance biological processes and coagulation could not enable an efficient removal of high content of op from flotation wastewater and flame retardant cloth washing wastewater ma et al 2017 duan et al 2019 thus it is fundamental and imperative to understand the composition of various p species in wastewater for the ongoing development of advanced p treatment technologies nowadays a wide variety of op species have been identified and classified into five categories nucleic acids nucleotides inositol phosphates phospholipids and phosphonates baldwin 2013 phosphonates are a broad class of op compounds that contain one or more phosphonic acid groups c po oh 2 substantially increasing fraction of dissolved organic phosphorus dop was detected in the effluents of european wwtps with the phosphonate chelators pcs coming into use in early 1980s neft et al 2010 gu et al 2011 the main pcs include 2 phosphonobutane 1 2 4 tricarboxylic acid pbtc 1 hydroxyethane 1 1 diphosphonic acid hedp nitrilotris methylene phosphonic acid ntmp ethylenediamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid edtmp hexamethylenediamine tetra methylene phosphonic acid hdtmp and diethylenetriamine penta methylene phosphonic acid dtpmp with their molecular structure depicted in fig 1 they are commonly used in paper and textile production household cleaning products membrane filtration and cooling water systems rott et al 2018b the global consumption of pcs was 56 000 t a in 1998 davenport et al 2000 and enormously increased to 94 000 t a in 2012 epa 2013 meanwhile pcs are often discussed in connection with various environmental issues including possible remobilization of heavy metals gledhill and feijtel 1992 bordas and bourg 1998 nowack 2003 the interference with phosphate precipitation wenger oehn et al 2005 nowack and stone 2006 rott et al 2018b as well as the contribution to eutrophication ternan et al 1998 davenport et al 2000 knepper and weil 2001 jaworska et al 2002 rott et al 2018b when pcs are discharged from various industries the degradation products of phosphonate chelators dp pcs may be generated via various pathways such as microbial metabolism grandcoin et al 2017 drzyzga and lipok 2017 catalytic oxidation nowack 2002a and photodegradation sun et al 2019 kuhn et al 2017 the potential dp pcs include glyphosate glyp aminomethylphosphonic acid ampa 2 aminoethylphosphonic acid 2 aep and iminodi methylenephosphonic acid idmp fig 1 rott et al 2018b grandcoin et al 2017 drzyzga and lipok 2017 ampa and idmp also represent synthesis intermediates of commercial pcs armbruster et al 2019a and 2 aep is an important biogenic phosphonate cembella and antia 1986 although pcs at environmental levels are usually harmless for a wide variety of aquatic organisms it is not the case for dp pcs for example glyp was classified as a probable human carcinogen iarc 2015 and ampa was considered to have genotoxic effects grandcoin et al 2017 mañas et al 2009 wwtps are one of the main sinks of pcs and dp pcs rott et al 2018b armbruster et al 2019a up to now very limited studies are available on the concentrations of pcs in wastewater this is possibly due to the lack of simple and sensitive methods applicable for pcs analysis in complicated matrices rott et al 2018b most available methods featured high limits of detection lods for instance 25 40 µg l fürhacker et al 2005 and 15 57 µg l nowack 1997 1998 2002b very recently rott et al 2020 reported the concentration variations of five pcs pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp during municipal wastewater treatment by using an ion exchange chromatography tandem mass spectrometry ic ms ms method of relatively low limits of quantification loqs 0 6 2 3 µg l armbruster et al 2019b however the contribution of different treatment units on the fate of pcs remains unclear moreover to the best of our knowledge there is no open literature reporting the concentration of pcs coupled with their degradation products in wwtps thus further studies are required on the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates i e pcs and dp pcs in wastewater along the combined processes in full scale wwtps also the presence of phosphonates in sludge should be concerned where considerable amounts of phosphonates were transferred via adsorption nowack 1998 rott et al 2018b in our recent study we reported a new method of low loqs 5 0 200 ng l and strong practicability i e pre methylation and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms to determinate pcs in industrial effluents wang et al 2019 which enabled us to perform this study on the occurrence and transformation of phosphonates in wwtps herein two typical textile dyeing wwtps were concerned because textile dyeing wastewater is listed as the third largest sources 2 billion m3 a of chinese industrial wastewater featuring high usage and discharge of phosphonates liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 xue et al 2019 nowack 1998 rott et al 2018b the unit dependent removal of phosphonates including six pcs and four dp pcs was particularly considered and the contents of pcs and dp pcs in sludge were also determined 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and reagents pbtc of analytical standard aqueous solution 50 in mass with purity

grade or of higher purity ultrapure water 18 25 mω cm was employed throughout the study except for the hplc ms grade water merck co germany which was used for preparation of the mobile phase the preparation methods of stock solutions are listed in text s1 2 2 sample collection wastewater and sludge samples were collected from two wwtps located in a cotton textile printing dyeing plant in jiaxing city wwtpa and a textile printing dyeing industry zone using natural and chemical fibers as raw material in tongxiang city wwtpb zhejiang province of china the process flow schemes of both wwtps are very popular in the textile dyeing industry in china fig 2 both wwtps employed the grating chemical precipitation processes using iron or aluminum salts as the primary treatment the combined anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o processes and hydrolysis acidification ha sequencing batch reactor sbr processes were adopted as the secondary treatment for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively for further p removal the secondary chemical precipitation using aluminum salt was adopted after biological treatment for both wwtps note that the influent of wwtpa was deliberately divided into two parts according to different chemical oxygen demand cod values the high part 3000 mg l and low part 2000 mg l at the volume ratio of 1 2 furthermore air flotation and naclo oxidation were also employed in wwtpa the secondary clarifier effluent of wwtpb was subjected to sand filtration sf and 50 of the filtered effluent was further treated by ultrafiltration uf and reverse osmosis ro for water reclamation another half was mixed with the 50 ro concentrate equal to 25 of the sf effluent of wwtpb and pumped to the centralized wwtps for further treatment the same as the final effluent of wwtpa other details about two wwtps is available in table s1 grab samples were taken along the treatment processes within several hours considering the residence time of each unit such sampling strategies could ensure the same source of each sample furthest a total of 19 wastewater samples one sample at each sampling point were collected from the two wwtps with the sampling points illustrated in fig 2 and the properties of each sample available in table s2 the dewatered sludge samples from both wwtps were also collected all the samples were transferred to brown glass bottles and stored at 4 c for further processing 2 3 analytical methods wastewater all the samples were membrane filtered 0 45 μm pore size prior to the analysis various dissolved fractions of p in the aqueous samples were determined according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 4500 p apha 1998 with the terms and definitions summarized in scheme s1 molybdenum blue method was used to quantify the dissolved reactive phosphorus drp mainly referred to as orthophosphate after 0 45 μm filtration the total dissolved phosphorus tdp after potassium persulfate acid digestion the dissolved acid hydrolysable phosphorus dahp calculated as the difference between that from the colorimetric determination after h2so4 hydrolysis and drp and the dop calculated as the difference between tdp and that from colorimetric determination after h2so4 hydrolysis the concentrations of various pcs and dp pcs in the samples were determined by two separate analytical methods according to the previous studies wang et al 2016 2018b 2019 in brief six pcs including pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp hdtmp and dtpmp were measured by lc ms ms after h cation exchange and tmschn2 methylation when necessary solid phase extraction spe was applied to concentrate the analytes from the interfering matrix as detailed in table s3 four dp pcs idmp glyp ampa and 2 aep were determined by lc ms ms after fmoc cl derivatization wang et al 2016 2018b skeff et al 2016 nowack 2002a details on the sample pretreatment extraction and analysis is described in text s2 sludge the fractionation of p in the sludge including the tp op and ip was analyzed according to a harmonized protocol proposed by the standards measurements and testing smt programme european commission details of the extraction procedures are available in scheme s2 gonzález medeiros et al 2005 a blank test was performed along with every batch of samples phosphate in the extracts was determined on a uv vis spectrophotometer based on the molybdenum blue method extraction method for pcs and dp pcs from sludge samples was slightly modified from previous studies armbruster et al 2019 gonzález medeiros et al 2005 briefly 0 1 g of freeze dried sludge powder was mixed with a 100 ml solution containing 0 25 mol l naoh and 0 05 mol l edta and the mixture was shaken at 180 rpm and 25 c for 16 h the suspension was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter the alkaline extracted sample was separated and neutralized by hcl after dilution at 10 times or higher six pcs and four dp pcs in the resultant water extracts were determined according to the procedures described above quantitative analysis of samples was conducted by a dionex ultimate 3000 ultra high performance liquid chromatography uhplc system coupled with a high resolution q exactive focus orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer ms ms thermo fisher scientific inc germany the derivatives were separated on a reversed phase zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 100 mm 4 6 mm

are shown in figs s1 s4 2 4 quality assurance and quality control qa qc quantification of the target phosphonates was performed with the internal standard method the regression coefficients r2 for 7 to 10 point calibration standards were higher than 0 98 for all the target analytes relative standard deviations rsds of the triplicate determination for each sample were 15 accuracy were checked by spiking recovery for each uhplc ms ms analysis the recoveries fell in the ranges of 74 123 and 77 123 for all analytes in the wastewater and sludge respectively the loqs ranged from 0 010 μg l pbtc to 5 0 μg l idmp and from 0 080 mg kg pbtc to 40 mg kg idmp for the wastewater and sludge respectively table s8 the concentrations of the target chemicals in sludge are reported on a dry weight basis the calibration curves of target analytes were re established every week after mass calibration a method blank was analyzed with every batch of samples and an instrumental blank consisting of pure water only was injected after every 20 sample tests details on qa qc methods including internal standard correction spiking recovery calibration curve and the determination of loqs are provided in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of various p fractions during wastewater treatment it is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of the employed processes for removing various p fractions since it affects the final tdp in the effluent the fate of various dissolved p fractions drp dop and dahp along the treatment processes of both wwtps is illustrated in fig 3 with experimental data listed in table s9 and their elimination rates for each unit are shown in table 1 generally the composition and concentration of tdp 3 88 17 3 mg l in the influents of two wwtps differed significantly in terms of dop wwtpa 41 and 47 wwtpb 26 drp wwtpa 47 and 39 wwtpb 72 and dahp wwtpa 12 and 14 wwtpb 1 5 among the dissolved p fractions dahp was readily removed via hydrolysis into orthophosphate or adsorption onto coagulants since its concentration dropped down successively along with the units of both wwtps in case of drp relatively low removal was observed after the primary treatment i e the first chemical precipitation unit it is possibly because phosphonate is very competitive with phosphate for adsorption sites of the formed flocks during precipitation rott et al 2018b the concentrations of drp were further decreased after biological treatment and almost all the drp could be removed after the second chemical precipitation in both wwtps the removal of dop in both wwtps showed different profiles probably due to their different compositions and different processes in wwtpa dop of two influents was initially removed after the primary treatment and further removed by the biological treatment after the secondary clarification the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes contributed to the reduction of all the p fractions significantly with the residual dop of 0 11 0 01 mg l in the final effluent accounting for 46 of tdp on the contrary the processes of wwtpb worked ineffectively for removing dop after the secondary clarification dop contributed to most of the remaining tdp and its removal was not enhanced by sf and uf stages ro is a robust unit as the terminal step for reuse of the reclaimed water which enabled the separation of almost all the dissolved organic matters from the uf effluent resulting in a great drop of dop note that higher concentrations of several concerned compounds detected in the final effluent resulted from the mixture with the ro concentrate dop 1 19 0 03 mg l accounting for 97 of its tdp p fractions in the sludge of both textile dyeing wwtps were also concerned in this study tp contents in the dewatered sludge were 11 1 0 3 and 7 23 0 16 g kg for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively and ip was the principal component of tp in the dewatered sludge in both wwtps 7 46 0 36 and 4 58 0 09 g kg for wwtpa and wwtpb respectively as for op its concentrations were 3 32 0 04 and 2 93 0 10 g kg accounting for 30 and 40 of tp in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the op tp ratios were slightly higher than the average value of the municipal sludge samples 26 8 wang et al 2018a the sum of p contents in ip and op fractions agreed with 4 0 with the tp fraction in textile dyeing wastewater dahp is a negligible component in the final effluent and drp can be nearly completely removed through the combined processes in this case dop turned to be a limiting factor to achieve lower p level of the final effluent meanwhile op in sludge samples also accounted for a considerable proportion of tp thus it is necessitated to better understand the occurrence and transformation of different op fractions in the textile dyeing wastewater and sludge considering the massive amount of pcs used in the textile printing and dyeing processes the following sections are mainly focused on various phosphonates i e pcs and dp pcs in wastewater and sludge samples 3 2 occurrence of phosphonates in wwtp influents in this study six pcs and four dp pcs were determined in each wwtp influent figs 4 5 tables s10 s11 in general high concentrations of hedp and ntmp were detected in two influents of wwtpa 3 79 0 05 mg l hedp and 4 57 0 17 mg l ntmp in the high concentration influent and 0 820 0 028 mg l hedp and 1 34 0 09 mg l ntmp in the low concentration influent in wwtpb the concentration of pbtc hedp and ntmp fell in the range of 59 227 µg l pcs reaching as high as mg l level in wwtpa was similar to that reported in three chinese textile dyeing wwtps wang et al 2019 in a german wwtp receiving wastewater from textile factories ntmp was detected at 60 330 µg l nowack 2002b nowack 1998 determined the pcs in seven swiss wwtps and reported their highest concentration of 1 26 mg l in the influent of a wwtp receiving the textile effluent the concentrations of pcs in the concerned municipal wwtps were detailed as ntmp 20 224 µg l edtmp 48 65 µg l and dtpmp 74 109 µg l furthermore edtmp was detected at 49 and 167 µg l in two austrian municipal wwtps fürhacker et al 2005 very recently pbtc 22 119 µg l hedp 57 231 µg l ntmp 0 6 15 µg l edtmp 1 4 11 µg l and dtpmp 14 71 µg l were reported in two germany municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 obviously pcs is ubiquitous in municipal and textile dyeing wastewaters with much higher concentration in the latter one among four dp pcs measured three of them ampa 2 aep and idmp were detectable in all the influent samples from both wwtps idmp wwtpa 608 40 µg l and 545 10 µg l wwtpb 162 5 µg l and ampa wwtpa 146 4 µg l and 34 2 3 6 µg l wwtpb 51 8 1 8 µg l were the main dp pcs in the influents while 2 aep ranked 3rd in the influent samples wwtpa 87 6 3 2 µg l and 39 2 3 2 µg l wwtpb 17 5 1 9 µg l glyp was detected in wwtpa influents 9 12 1 27 and 11 4 0 2 µg l but negligible in wwtpb as for the source of the above dp pcs armbruster et al 2019a investigated the impurity of the commercial ntmp based chelators used in drinking water treatment plants and evidenced the presence of idmp ntmp eliminating one methylenephosphonic acid group ntmp mep and ampa ntmp 2mep armbruster et al 2019a thus idmp and ampa in the wwtp influents were probably derived from the chelator impurities in addition the abundance of potential dp pcs including 2 aep glyp and a small portion of idmp and ampa possibly resulted from the slight biotic and abiotic degradation of aminopolyphosphonates drzyzga and lipok 2017 grandcoin et al 2017 3 3 removal of phosphonates from wastewater 3 3 1 overall removal efficiency based on the concentration profile of pcs in the influents and final effluents figs 4 and table s10 the overall removal efficiency of the pcs was obtained table 1 which was in line with the values 80 in wwtps operated with chemical precipitation in a recent review rott et al 2018b the pcs removal followed the orders of ntmp hedp pbtc similar high removal rates of 99 3 99 6 ntmp 98 2 99 4 hedp and 95 8 99 7 pbtc were reported in three textile dying wwtps wang et al 2019 rott et al 2020 found that pbtc showed the lowest elimination a median of 84 9 of all five pcs pbtc hedp ntmp edtmp and dtpmp in two municipal wwtps the removal of ntmp was reported at 80 via chemical precipitation in five swiss wwtps nowack 1998 and one german wwtp nowack 2002b comparatively the removal of pcs seemed challenging via biological treatment only in a laboratory test reichert 1996 found that the maximum pbtc adsorption was only 50 in activated sludge process at the initial concentration of 50 mg l indicating its weaker affinity towards activated sludge than polyphosphonates the elimination of hedp in european wwtps has been previously investigated in two field studies involving spiking with 2 g l hedp in the influents with the efficiency differing significantly 90 after biological treatment and chemical precipitation müller et al 1984 and only 25 70 in the oxidation ditch metzner 1990 at a spiked concentration of 2 mg l in the influent of a wwtp only 60 of the ntmp was eliminated based on the activated sludge process metzner 1990 in general pcs could be removed with relatively high efficiency in wwtps operated with chemical precipitation as for dp cps they were all below the loqs except ampa in the effluent of both wwtps fig 5 and table s11 the overall removal efficiencies of glyp and ampa idmp and 2 aep are listed in table 1 although most dps and dp pcs were finally removed for both wwtps it should be concerned that some units also play a role in the recurrence of new compounds therefore their removal at different units should also be considered to better understand and further improve the performance of each unit 3 3 2 unit dependent removal of phosphonates fig 4 depicts the profile of the dissolved pcs along the combined processes of two wwtps data detailed in table s10 and corresponding elimination rates are shown in table 1 in general the total concentration of pcs decreased along the combined processes in both wwtps in the first chemical precipitation unit the removal of different pcs followed the orders of ntmp hedp in wwtpa and ntmp hedp pbtc in wwtpb it implies that ntmp could be removed more readily by chemical precipitation than hedp and pbtc the subsequent biological treatment resulted in enhanced removal of the residual pcs during the a a o processes in wwtpa the total removal of hedp and ntmp rapidly rose up after the anoxic unit and were further improved after the oxic unit as for the ha sbr processes adopted in wwtpb ha led to negligible elimination for hedp and ntmp and even a slight increase of pbtc in fact a slight desorption of pbtc was also observed from the digested sludge under anaerobic conditions in a laboratory test reichert 1996 implying the possible accumulation of pbtc in the wwtp after the sbr unit most of the pcs were effectively removed previous studies nowack 2003 rott et al 2018b suggested that the biological removal of various pcs in wwtps predominantly resulted from their adsorption onto the activated and digested sludge a further removal of the dissolved pcs could be achieved by secondary chemical precipitation in both wwtps similarly the majority of total pc elimination a median of 89 2 occurred in the biological treatment of two municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 as for the water reclaim units in wwtpb no significant removal of pcs occurred during the sf and uf since both units mainly targeted at physical removal of suspended solids rott et al 2020 all the pcs were present below loqs in the ro effluent very low concentrations of pcs were present in the final effluent of wwtpa hedp 13 3 0 3 µg l ntmp 3 37 0 15 µg l and wwtpb pbtc 14 1 0 3 µg l hedp 13 1 0 4 µg l ntmp 1 04 0 06 µg l the removal of dp pcs along the treatment processes in both wwtps are described in fig 5 the concentrations and elimination rates are detailed in table s11 and table 1 during the primary treatment glyp 2 aep and idmp were eliminated significantly however ampa showed a low elimination rate in wwtpb and even an apparent negative removal was observed in wwtpa the precipitation efficiency of ampa during coagulation remains uncertain because it was simultaneously formed from degradation of other phosphonates after the secondary treatment the concentrations of glyp and 2 aep were below the loqs in both wwtps because of their potential biodegradability wang et al 2016 2018b idmp containing two phosphonic acid groups possesses similar properties to the parent pcs and it could be readily removed by adsorption onto sludge after biological treatment idmp was almost completely removed in both wwtps however it is worth noting that the concentration of ampa increased up to 732 759 and 46 8 74 5 µg l an increase of 0 44 to 9 times after biological treatment in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively the increasing ampa concentration implies that the transformation of other phosphonates into ampa be faster than its bio elimination in both wwtps biodegradation and sludge adsorption may work in parallel for the dp pcs removal from wastewater but their sole contributions are still obscure ampa and idmp were further removed after the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes and coagulation sedimentation in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively in the additional water reclaim units of wwtpb the removal of ampa was insignificant by sf and uf units whereas dp pcs were below loqs in ro effluent finally only 15 7 0 6 µg l and 5 89 0 53 µg l ampa were residual in the final effluent of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively accordingly the secondary chemical precipitation plays a crucial role in eliminating ampa generated during primary and secondary treatments as ampa has been classified as a critical degradation product from the toxicological point of view further studies are needed to assess the potential risk of ampa generated during wastewater treatment 3 3 3 ampa formation and elimination pathways in wwtps as mentioned above toxicologically critical ampa was formed during the coagulation and biological treatment units generally degradation of related phosphonates whether biotic or abiotic is associated with ampa formation under natural conditions grandcoin et al 2017 the main ampa formation during coagulation is probably via the photodegradation of fe ntmp due to the presence of iron salt as the coagulant generally most pcs including ntmp edtmp and dtpmp could serve as the ligand to bind fe iii and the resultant fe iii complexes were sensitive to photo degradation where ampa was one of the main products nowack 2003 jaworska et al 2002 grandcoin et al 2017 in addition ampa was known as a metabolite of glyphosate and it also possibly came from microbial degradation of pcs generally pcs could not be readily biodegraded because of the strong c p bond however various microorganisms have been identified to enable the use pcs as their only p source for instance schowanek and verstraete 1990 found that majority of the enriched cultures from the environmental samples peat soil activated sludge digested sludge etc could solely degrade one phosphonate group from the polyphosphonates while only a few ones could enable a complete c p bond cleavage of all the phosphonate groups in addition forlani et al 2011 successfully used spirulina strains to remove 50 of polyphosphonate from wastewater therefore the microbial degradation of aminophosphonates including ntmp idmp glyp and other related phosphonates is supposed to be the main pathway for ampa formation during biological treatment from the adsorption point of view ampa seemed to have lower adsorption tendency than glyp idmp or ntmp by the sludge and or suspended particulate matter spm in wwtps physicochemical properties of each phosphonate are listed in table s12 popov et al 2001 nowack and stone 1999 skeff et al 2018 rott et al 2018a 2018b poiger et al 2020 as a result the dissolved ampa in water was also possibly derived from the degradation of other phosphonates adsorbed on solid phase finally most ampa generated during primary and secondary treatments was removed for both wwtps however ampa removal through coagulation and biological treatment is rarely documented in this study the final chemical precipitation seemed essential to ensure high elimination of ampa hall and camm 2007 reported the removal efficiencies of glyp and ampa during coagulation clarification ranged from 10 to 80 depending on ph coagulant type and dose therefore chemical precipitation is possibly an effective pathway of ampa removal in addition ampa removal has been observed by adsorption onto sludge instead of biodegradation during activated sludge treatment with the efficiency of 36 89 a median of 64 poiger et al 2020 thus we believe that the formation and elimination of ampa were likely to occur simultaneously during biological treatment 3 4 accumulation of phosphonates in sludge given that pc removal in wwtps was mainly achieved by adsorption onto sludge instead of biodegradation or chemical transformation rott et al 2018b the presence of pcs and dp pcs in sludge was considered in this study here six pcs and four dp pcs in the dewatered sludge were determined and the results are listed in table 2 surprisingly high phosphonate loads could be observed in the sludge of both wwtps with the sum of pcs at 7 33 0 57 and 3 28 0 25 g kg and that of dp pcs at 0 481 0 050 and 0 288 0 016 g kg in wwtpa and wwtpb respectively to date an average load of 1 2 1 5 g pc kg dry sludge was estimated in european municipal wwtps on the basis of the model calculation epa 2013 nowack 1998 2002b rott et al 2018b to the best of our knowledge no open reference is available on the analysis of the actual pc concentrations in sludge from wwtps due to the impurity of commercial pcs armbruster et al 2019a and the bio degradation of pcs drzyzga and lipok 2017 grandcoin et al 2017 some dp pcs of concern such as idmp ampa and 2 aep were also accumulated in sludge expect for glyp which was at μg l level in the influent of the secondary treatment in wwtpa and could not be detectable in sludge it also implied that biodegradation was effective for glyp removal generally pcs and dp pcs could be concentrated in sludge and a comprehensive risk assessment should be carried out when the sludge is used as fertilizer or for soil improvement in addition remarkable phosphonate loads were also reported in spm of wastewater recently rott et al 2020 reported the total phosphonate concentration of 223 2555 mg kg in the spm of municipal wastewaters and up to the triple digit mg kg adsorbed phosphonates were detected in the wastewater of a teaching and research wwtp armbruster et al 2019b since phosphonate is one of the essential components of tp in wastewaters rott et al 2020 it would be better to quantify the adsorbed phosphonates in spm 3 5 contribution of phosphonate p to the op fraction on the basis of the aforementioned discussion the op accounts for considerable proportion of tp in wastewater and sludge samples of both wwtps to further understand the composition of the op we calculated the concentration ratios of phosphonate p i e the sum of the target pcs and dp pcs to the total op along the water treatment processes fig 6 in the two influents of wwtpa the ratios were 26 and 40 and dropped down to 10 and 11 respectively after the combined air floatation coagulation processes however large amounts of ampa generated during the biological treatment resulted in a significant increase in the ratios by up to 47 after further removal of phosphonates in the combined air floatation coagulation naclo oxidation processes it declined to 8 4 in the final effluent a similar trend of such ratios was observed for wwtpb except for a slight increase in the sbr process the ratio decreased from 16 initially to 0 4 in the final effluent of wwtpb obviously the generally declining trend of the ratio indicated that the processes employed in both wwtps were more effective for removal of dissolved phosphonates than for other dop fractions in addition the concentration ratio of phosphonate p to the op fraction was 71 and 35 in the sludge samples of wwtpa and wwtpb respectively much higher than the corresponding phosphonate p dop ratios in the influents of both wwtps it also implied that most of the phosphonate was removed by separation i e adsorption and coagulation or partial degradation instead of mineralization a recent study reported that concentration ratio of phosphonate p to the dissolved unreactive phosphorus mainly referred to dop fraction ranged from 10 to 40 throughout all the stages of municipal wwtps rott et al 2020 although wastewaters from different sources have different trends of the ratio along the treatment processes it is worth noting that phosphonate accounts for a considerable proportion in op moreover armbruster et al 2019a ever characterized the impurities of commercial pcs and found a significant proportion of phosphonate related impurities including the synthesis byproducts intermediates and degradation products for instance high amounts of phosphonate related impurities 20 were detected in industrial ntmp products in this study the target phosphonates only covered the inherent constituents of pcs and part of their synthesis intermediates or degradation products and other unidentified phosphonates might exist in wastewater and sludge therefore the proportion of total phosphonates in the op fraction is expected to be much higher than those determined in this study 4 conclusions in summary we characterized the occurrence and transformation of pcs and dp pcs along the combined processes of two textile dyeing wwtps the p removal is largely dependent upon the composition of dop fraction as well as the specific unit of the processes high concentrations at upmost mg l level of three pcs pbtc hedp and ntmp and a considerable amount of dp pcs idmp glyp ampa and 2 aep were distinguished in the influents ntmp could be removed more efficiently than pbtc and hedp during subsequent treatment especially in the coagulation unit both pcs and dp pcs could be effectively eliminated 78 after the secondary chemical precipitation whereas coagulation and biological treatment would accompany the generation of ampa in addition the dissolved phosphonate could be removed more efficiently than other dop fractions also the presence of pcs and dp pcs up to 7 81 g kg

17711,porous metal organic frameworks mofs have drawn increasing attention as promising phosphate adsorbents yet the potential agglomeration of mofs particles and the difficult collection process largely thwarted their application meanwhile adsorbents regeneration might destroy mofs structures due to the use of strong alkaline solution in this work we reported a strategy for designing and fabricating an electrode to remove phosphate based on mil 101 derived metal carbon via a two step carbonization step which not only introduced c doping but also created a stable structure with the assistance of electric field the migration and capture of phosphate anions were greatly enhanced under 1 v condition the material exhibited a high maximum removal capacity of 97 73 mg p g adsorption kinetics and parameters for phosphate at different conditions were analyzed langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to validate the adsorption data more importantly the regeneration of electrode was achieved in a more facile and efficient way than micro nanoparticles adsorbents by simple voltage control such an intriguing approach may provide a new platform to further expand the use of mofs for adsorption process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mof derived material conductive structure porous morphology capacitive deionization phosphate removal 1 introduction phosphorus p is an important nutrient for the normal functioning of ecosystems however excessive presence of p in water bodies may accelerate eutrophication and subsequent deterioration of aquatic ecosystems by promoting the rampant growth of algae yu et al 2019 therefore search for efficient phosphate removal approaches have been widely initiated until now various strategies have been examined such as biological treatment chemical precipitation and adsorption etc chemical precipitation is effective for treating wastewater with high p concentration but requires sophisticated control systems and high dose of chemicals producing large amounts of sludge which must be properly disposed de haas et al 2000 biological treatment usually as secondary treatment is proved to be economic and environmentally sound at phosphate removal however its removal efficiency is sensitive to the variation of environment condition gebremariam et al 2011 biological process cannot meet the increasingly stringent environmental requirements which are much lower than the typical levels of conventional approaches by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude therefore it is generally supplemented by an additional tertiary treatment to reduce p to an ultralow concentration omosa et al 2012 out of these adsorption process is considered an appealing method with advantages of high efficiency rapid removal rate good selectivity and easy manipulation liu et al 2019c adsorption also appears a feasible effluent polishing step followed municipal wastewater treatment kumar et al 2017b various adsorption materials have been fabricated such as graphene tran et al 2015 activated carbon koilraj and sasaki 2017 metal oxides kumar et al 2017a and so on in spite of the great advances most of the adsorbents seemed to be challenged by the inferior adsorption capacity and strict regeneration condition these contributed to development of diverse new generation efficient materials and approaches for phosphate removal metal organic frameworks mofs which are constructed via joining organic links with metal ions have been identified to be efficient phosphate adsorbents with accessible high surface areas liu et al 2019a however the potential agglomeration of mofs particles and the difficult post extraction retrieval have hindered their application additionally the strong alkaline condition required for adsorbent regeneration may cause the collapse of mofs structures eventually leading to the incomplete desorption and poor recyclability of mofs liu et al 2018 hence their further application in phosphate control faces the imperative demand for developing more facile avenue to improve p uptake release efficiency the assistance of electric field tends to be promising and visible in practice since it facilitates the migration of phosphate ions and provides a quick way to regenerate the electrode capacitive deionization cdi is a mild electrochemical technique with low cost high removal rate and easy regeneration wang et al 2019 when an external voltage is applied charged ions would migrate to and be stored in polarized electrodes driven by electrostatic force leading to the formation of electric double layer and ions removal from water however traditional cdi technique exhibited poor selectivity towards phosphate attributed to the valence based and size based ion selectivity wherein ions with higher valence and smaller hydrated ions are preferentially electrosorbed guyes et al 2019 the incorporation of mofs materials with cdi technique would definitely makeup the shortage of cdi thus guarantee the selective capture of phosphate anions admittedly since most mofs materials feature as high electric resistance increasement in conductivity of mofs is decisive in the successful integration of mofs and cdi technique studies focusing on the preparation of conductive mofs mainly used acidic linker molecules or h donor guest molecules to generate charge migration by allowing proton transfer between acidic functional groups fleker et al 2016 which demanded special operation conditions including an electrolyte environment increased temperature and humidity up to now mofs derived porous structures with abundant c doping have been proven to improve the charge transfer and chemical stability pan et al 2016 herein thermal treatment under n2 atmosphere was applied to carbonize the organic linker the self accumulation of metal oxide was also prevented for its homogenous dispersion in carbon matrix additionally the calcinated mofs could maintain the structure under strong alkaline condition and overcome the challenge of regeneration inspired by the cdi technique and fabrication of conductive mofs derivatives in this study we reported synthesis of a novel electrode based on mof derived metal carbon composite as a recyclable adsorbent for phosphate removal mil 101 al an excellent phosphate adsorbent was applied as a precursor and template to prepare the porous al c via a two step calcination method the resulted material possessed pristine porous morphology and plentiful c doping with promoted charge transfer to further increase conductivity and avoid agglomeration of as prepared low density particles activated carbon ac was introduced to fabricate the electrode via a facile one pot method fleker et al 2016 compared with conventional sorption this proposed approach was expected to possess some advantages 1 phosphate ions could quickly migrate towards and subsequently interact with electrode with the assistance of electric field 2 the adsorbed p ions could be easily repelled from the electrode and released back to the solution by employing a reversed potential in desorption process 3 the electrode could be directly separated from treated water hence the main objectives were to develop a novel mil 101 derived electrode and explore its feasibility as phosphate adsorbent in particular in order to improve the removal efficiency an electric field was applied the impacts of preparation condition applied voltage ph value temperature ionic strength and co existing substances on phosphate removal were detailed in this paper also its performances in real sewage effluent and continuous phosphate adsorption desorption process with a tunable electro assistance method were studied moreover the adsorption isotherms kinetics the microstructure variation and main adsorption mechanisms of the prepared electrode were comprehensively investigated to illustrate possible synergistic interactions in the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of conductive ac supported al c composite the material was synthesized by suspending 1 g of dried ac in a 45 ml n n dimethylformamide dmf solution of terephthalic acid 0 51 g the mixture was treated under ultrasonication after that 0 51 g of aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o was added to the mixture followed by ultrasonication treatment the mixture was transferred into teflon lined autoclaves and maintained in an oven at 130 c for 72 h after cooling the resulting solid was washed and dried at 180 c for 2 h under reduced pressure to obtain ac supported mil 101 the product was then calcined under a nitrogen gas flow at 400 c for 2 h and subsequently increasing to 600 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 c min to afford the ac supported al c composite likewise mil 101 and al c were prepared according to the procedures mentioned above in the absence of ac 2 2 preparation of electrodes for the working electrode a mixture containing 55 56 wt of ac supported active material 5 56 wt of carbon black 5 56 wt of ground na2so4 and 33 3 wt of polytetrafluorethylene ptfe binder was well mixed in ethanol after that the resulting paste was pressed onto nickel foam 2 4 cm2 under a pressure of 5 mpa to obtain the working electrode fig 1 the typical mass of the mof derived al c in a piece of electrode was about 0 026 g the price of the chemicals and energy consumptions were estimated and listed in table s1 it took about 0 088 dollars of chemicals and 0 0037 dollars to synthesize 1 g of al c and a piece of electrode respectively 2 3 structural and elemental characterization scanning electron microscopy sem was taken on a sirion 200 instrument equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds accessory the crystal structure was identified with x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance da vinci in the 2 theta range from 5 to 90 thermal stability of the material was tested with a system provided by mettler toledo under argon flow an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps ultra axis dld was used for the chemical states identification the functional groups were determined using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 6700 the specific surface area was recorded on a surface area analyzer asap 2460 according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distributions were obtained by using non local density functional theory nldft method 2 4 phosphate uptake and release an electro assisted reaction system was applied to measure the phosphate removal and regeneration performance of prepared electrodes all measurements were conducted in an electrochemical cell consisting of working electrode platinum plate as counter electrode and ag agcl as reference electrode at the beginning of adsorption process phosphate solution of 50 ml was added into the cell with varied potential differences samples taken at preset time were analyzed spectrophotometrically according to molybdenum blue method a solution containing 50 mg p l was utilized to measure adsorption kinetics while the adsorption isotherms were determined with different phosphate concentration from 5 to 200 mg p l the effects of ph value and ionic strength were studied with varying ph values 2 12 and nano3 concentrations 0 001 1 m respectively moreover coexistent substances such as nacl k2so4 nahco3 and humic acid ha were utilized to evaluate their impacts on phosphate removal the above experiments were conducted under 1 v condition unless otherwise specified for the regeneration process phosphate solution was substituted by 0 01 m naoh and nacl solution and the applied potential was altered to 2 v for electrodesorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization it is reported that mil 101 has small diameter of ca 0 08 0 15 um seoane et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 mil 101 showed relatively smooth surface without obvious defect and the large particles could be due to agglomeration of mof particles the calcinated mof became rougher but reserved the morphology of mof precursor indicating its good structure stability during the thermal treatment process mil 101 transformed into amorphous carbon framework together with metal oxides and their strong adhesive force ensured the charge transfer on the electrode material zhang et al 2015 as ac displayed a square and smooth micrometer shape the images clearly indicated that mof crystallized on the ac surface where the uniform distributions of c o and al element were also unambiguously confirmed by elemental mapping analyses fig 2f and fig s1 the well dispersed active sites were critical for phosphate adsorption as displayed in fig s2 the prepared electrode was tightly stacked with a thickness about 1 53 cm showing high stability after phosphate adsorption process the macroporous nickel foam and uniform carbon black particles were also observed although mil 101 is an isolating material whose precipitation and coverage would cause the isolation of ac particles from neighboring ones the negative effects could be reduced by subsequent thermal treatment the ratios of o c and al c were higher in calcinated samples as shown in eds spectra fig s3 and table s2 possibly due to the declined c atom concentration caused by the ligand decomposition along with departure of residual solvent and free carboxylic groups in brief the increased al ratio after thermal treatment will enable ac supported al c to possess a high phosphate uptake capacity through offering more adsorptive sites to assess the constitution of functional groups thermogravimetric analysis tga were conducted as depicted in fig 3 a four distinct stages occurred for mil 101 the first stage from room temperature to 150 c was associated with the volatilization of physically attached water and the residual solvent among pore spaces the second step at 150 300 c referred to the departure of free carboxylic groups the third weight loss at 300 650 c can be attributed to the decomposition of organic ligands with further temperature increase the curve reached a plateau for the ac supported mil 101 similar stages but less weight loss percent were detected due to the presence of ac particles which exhibited no distinct weight loss stage during temperature change for its thermal stability endowing the obtained composite with a stable structure for phosphate removal under high temperatures although the shape of mil 101 remained surface area reduced from 1378 472 m2 g to 395 943 m2 g after thermal treatment fig 3b with the combination of ac material ac supported al c exhibited a surface area of 1251 361 m2 g owing to the highly porous structure of ac and small amount of al c the relatively high surface area and porous structure of ac supported al c were favorable for adsorption towards phosphate ions the size distributions of them indicated that the total pore area was almost contributed by mesopores and micropores especially micropores fig s4 furthermore it can be observed that thermal treatment led to the collapse of mof structure the two step carbonization of mil 101 precursor released volatile gasses including co2 and h2o which not only benefitted the formation of porous structure in al oxide but inhibited its aggregation pan et al 2016 besides the c doping by thermal treatment facilitated its application in electric field the xrd patterns of mil 101 and ac supported mil 101 as displayed in fig 4 a showed good crystallinity and matched the xrd pattern of previously reported mil 101 serra crespo et al 2011 confirming that well developed mof crystalline structure formed with ac matrix after thermal treatment the sharp diffraction modes corresponding to mil 101 vanished instead two broad peaks appeared at around 24 and 43 in accordance with the 002 and 100 diffraction peaks of the graphitic structure which was characteristic of disordered carbon liu et al 2015 however signals of al2o3 and al species cannot be obviously detected after the carbonization process suggesting the existence of al in amorphous and complex form according to the high wavenumber region of ir spectra fig 4b several main peaks appeared on mil 101 representing characteristics of benzene carboxylates the band at 1416 95 cm 1 referred to the aromatic carbon cc vibrational mode and band obtained near 1609 17 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o bonding in the carboxylates xie et al 2017 for the other samples similar characteristic peaks were detected as well however the peaks diminished and shifted a little when compared with the spectrum of pristine mil 101 band located at 3687 60 cm 1 corresponded to the al oh group serra crespo et al 2011 the functional al oh group provided binding sites for phosphate moreover the broad adsorption peaks were observed in the range of 3430 43 2959 74 cm 1 as the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl moieties due to the adsorbed h2o suggesting their hydrophilic nature since less hydrated anions of the same charge number are preferred by the hydrophobic resins which show a selectivity sequence based on hofmeister anion series f h2po4 hco3 cl hso3 no3 the prepared hydrophilic composite would present an anti hofmeister selectivity sequence with high affinity towards phosphate anions liu et al 2019a the elements of prepared materials were confirmed with xps analyses fig s5 no characteristic peak in the p 2p spectrum was detected for mil 101 and al c while the response in ac supported al c may be due to the introduction of ac which contained p element itself the spectra also evidenced the presence of al in al c o 1 s in al c could be fitted into three peaks similar to mil 101 representing al o al oh and o c o respectively fig s6 xps results were in good agreement with above analyses and further supported the existence of al oh which would contribute to phosphate remove via ligand exchange 3 2 preparation of electrode the working electrode was composed of conductive agent porogen binder and active material mass transfer and phosphate uptake were closely related to the structure of electrode therefore the performances of electrode prepared under different conditions have been discussed in detail in the supporting information text s1 s2 although electrode with low solid to liquid s l ratio saturated more quickly s l ratio increase based on pristine mil 101 from 0 532 to 2 66 g l doubled the removal efficiency which further increased to 89 when a voltage was applied among different pore forming agents at 0 02 m or 0 06 m na2so4 was identified as the perfect one moreover the ground na2so4 resulted in improved performance owing to the increased amount and reduced size of pores within electrode besides the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe kept rising with higher na2so4 content by facilitating p ions transfer for a given voltage electrode with an elevated ratio of carbon black possessed enhanced electrical conductivity and increased qe up to 105 41 mg p g active material text s3 possibly ascribing to the sustained high driving force for ions even with decreasing p concentration furthermore diverse p removal performances could be expected from electrodes prepared under different pressure retention time and amount of binder which were associated with the release of additives and pore distribution 3 3 adsorption of phosphate to electrode 3 3 1 effect of ph the ph value generally influenced phosphate removal via changing dominant phosphate species and surface charges of adsorbents as shown in fig 5 a phosphate removal capacity tended to decrease with ph increase but remained high in the ph range of 4 8 dominant p species were dependent on solution ph which were considered as h3po4 hpo4 2 h2po4 hpo4 2 po4 3 and po4 3 in the ph range of 2 13 2 13 7 20 7 20 10 30 and 12 40 respectively liu et al 2019a different from conventional adsorbent particles whose surface charges were determined by their zeta potentials and ph values the working electrode can be endowed with a given potential difference thereby always displaying positive surface charges to promote phosphate transportation the declined adsorption capacity could be attributed to the competitive adsorption for binding sites by excessive hydroxyl anions as the ph increased rashid et al 2017 especially with the assistance of electric field moreover oxygen evolution reaction could occur at anode under 1 0 v vs ag agcl condition with increased ph value according to nernst equation inhibiting phosphate adsorption by generating bubbles and releasing positive charges in strong acid condition the predominant neutral h3po4 was unfavorable for p capture via electrostatic attraction indicating the occurrence of ligand exchange between electrode and phosphate over a wide ph range considering the high removal efficiency from ph 4 to 8 the solution ph around 4 9 was not adjusted before other experiments to reduce the influences of foreign ions besides the highest adsorption capacity was also observed at ph 4 9 3 3 2 effect of temperature it can be seen in fig 5b and fig s9 that phosphate uptake increased noticeably at a higher temperature demonstrating that phosphate removal was an endothermic process for the 0 v condition qe at 25 45 and 65 c was 37 84 44 44 and 44 80 mg g respectively text s4 and table s8 when 1 v was applied to the electrodes qe fluctuated from 78 92 to 107 66 mg g accordingly this was possibly due to the improved physical adsoption towards phosphate resulting from the increment in p ions activity and the facilitated coordination interaction for the enhanced hydrolysis and ionization of phosphate wang et al 2016 obviously the presence of electrical field enlarged the differences among varied temperatures 3 3 3 effects of applied voltages and adsorption kinetics as illustrated in fig 5 phosphate removal was initially fast followed by a slow stage and achieved equilibrium in around 180 min the enhancement in phosphate capture with increasing potentials could be ascribed to the abundant availability of active sites on the electrode as time lapsed the number of remaining vacant binding sites decreased correspondingly and p ions in bulk solution had to traverse deeper to reach the active sites therefore the diffusing p ions would be subjected to higher resistance and slower adsorption rate over time kinetic analyses by the pseudo first order fig 5c and pseudo second order models fig 5d were employed to quantitatively study their adsorption behavior and summarized in table 1 both models fitted the kinetic curves well with high correlation coefficients r2 indicating the mechanisms responsible for phosphate adsorption included reaction on the material surface and chemisorption the former was related to the surface active sites and affinity while the latter involved valency forces via exchanging or sharing electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate liu et al 2019a according to the pseudo second order kinetic model analysis qe was 37 84 mg g for 0 v condition which rose to 111 62 mg g when applied voltage achieved 3 v high voltage accelerated the movement of anions towards working electrode and promoted ion adsorption by forming a thick electrical double layer ge et al 2018 with further increase in potential difference however phosphate capture no longer significantly improved furthermore electrode prepared with ac only showed an extremely low removal efficiency implying that phosphate was mainly adsorbed on mofs or al c mof particles crystallized on the ac surface and provided well dispersed binding sites since the mesoporous cages of mil 101 was beneficial for phosphate diffusion and an electric field was applied adsorption happened fast even at low p concentration kumar et al 2017b 3 3 4 effect of ionic strength with increased no3 concentration the elecrode exhibited decreased p adsorption rate fig 6 a according to the fitting analyses by kinetic models fig s10 and table s9 qe varied from 82 53 to 46 95 mg g in ionic strength range of 0 001 1 m the declined efficiency could be caused by suppressed formation of outer sphere complexes between p ions 1 61 mm and adsorbent owing to the competition for binding sites su et al 2013 with electric field co existing anions would also be driven towards the working electrode therefore interfering with phosphate adsorption via electrostatic interaction as the metallic cation within the adsorbent selectively formed inner sphere complex with phosphate via covalent chemical bonds in ligand exchange decent phosphate uptake rate maintained even with high concentration of foreign ions 3 3 5 effects of co existent anions and humic acid since some naturally occurring anions coexisted in nature water and industrial effluents the electro assisted adsorption preference towards phosphate was elucidated with commonly detected ions as shown in fig 6b phosphate uptake dropped obviously as the concentration of competing anions increased from 2 to 10 mm as aforementioned such behavior was closely associated with the formed complexes in between p ions and adsorbent the outer sphere surface complexation would be suppressed by the enhanced ionic strength for the electric double layer contraction and competitive adsorption su et al 2013 however phosphate uptake through inner sphere complexation guaranteed most of the removal efficiency even at high level of other anions except for so4 2 at 10 mm which led to reduced adsorption capacity due to its high valence and concentration in the electro assisted condition although hco3 could increase ph value and compete for binding sites because of their similar ionic structure su et al 2015 p anions with high valence were more preferred by the adsorbent which also occurred in the existence of cl natural water contains various macromolecules represented by ha that can form stable complexes with metal hydroxides the result revealed that phosphate adsorption efficiency with ha decreased slightly showing a qe of 53 19 mg g fig 6c and table s10 it was difficult for ha with average size of 1 2 4 nm to reach the internal region of adsorbent due to size exclusion effects tang et al 2019a besides ha could be adsorbed by carbon materials and removed from water rendering the active sites unaffected koilraj and sasaki 2017 such good selectivity would ensure p uptake in complex wastewater and promote the recovery of phosphate of high purity after regeneration of utilized adsorbent 3 3 6 effects of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the dependence of removal efficiency on the initial phosphate concentration was displayed in fig s11 adsorption efficiency declined as the initial concentration increased for the easy saturation of adsorption sites on the contrary the adsorption capacity improved fig 6d probably attributing to the enhanced mass transfer driven by concentration gradient between electrode surface and bulk solution moreover the increased number of collisions between electrode and pollutant ions significantly contributed to the adsorption process abo el naga et al 2018 the electro assisted adsorption isotherms of phosphate were tested to explore adsorption mode and assess potential uptake efficiency two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich were used to simulate and quantitatively analyze the adsorption process table 2 and text s5 the data was better described by the langmuir model in view of the higher correlation coefficients demonstrating the homogenous distribution of adsorption sites on the working electrode and monolayer adsorption mode a dimensionless equilibrium constant named separation factor rl is an essential parameter to evaluate the efficacy of prepared electrode and can be defined as follows r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl represent the initial p concentration and langmuir equilibrium constant respectively the rl value gives indication for the favorability of the adsorption process linear rl 1 irreversible rl 0 unfavorable rl 1 or favorable 0 rl 1 ruan et al 2016 according to the results of langmuir model kl value of 0 065 l mg implied that phosphate adsorption on synthesized electrode was a favorable process the maximal adsorption capacity qm of prepared electrode at 25 c for 1 v condition was 97 73 mg p g al c and exceeded most phosphate adsorbents table 3 3 3 7 recyclability of adsorbents the time varying electro assisted desorption performance was illustrated in fig 7 a the efficiency increased rapidly in the first 6 min and 88 92 of the binded p was released in 20 min while it took 24 h to reach a 83 73 desorption efficiency in the absence of electric potential fig 7b for the desorption process hydroxide oxides and chloride could remove adsorbed p via ion exchange and substitution generally the negatively charged adsorbent at high ph could no longer adsorb phosphate by electrostatic attraction under 0 v condition with a reverse potential difference electrode would further drive the adsorbed p ions away by electrostatic repulsion force and generate metal ligand bonding with higher affinity in order to decrease the charge density of hydroxide and chloride ions in solution lai et al 2019 consequently leading to an enhanced regeneration of utilized material in general a concentrated naoh solution 1 m or 0 5 m was utilized as desorpion solution which would destroy mof structure and simultaneously produce corrosive wastewater containing highly concentrated salts or and bases lai et al 2019 consequently the regeneration of mofs was mainly performed in nacl solution of high concentration with desorption percentage lower than 2 indicating at least 98 of the adsorbed phosphate was through specific adsorption and difficult to be released liu et al 2019b xie et al 2017 besides desorption process usually continues for 24 h to complete the highly efficient desorption in this study could be ascribable to the hierarchical structure of prepared electrode that prevented the falling off of al c and endowed the electrode with stable adsortion performance metal oxides hydroxides nanoparticles which have been widely utilized to adsorb phosphate due to high surface area to volume ratio are difficult to separate after the adsorption process possibly resulting in unsatisfactory recycling ability and water pollution caused by potential release of ultrafine materials into water ge et al 2016 while micrometer scale adsorbents require an additional separating treatment such as centrifugation and filtration noticeably the electrode was ready to remove directly from the treated aqueous system due to the high desorption efficiency the regenerated electrode could be utilized again for subsequent adsorption desorption cycles amount of phosphate removed by regenerated electrode decreased slightly possibly owing to loss of active sites fig s12 despite this the electrode still maintained more than 96 of the original removal efficiency after the fourth cycle indicative of its high potential for long time phosphate capture 3 3 8 removal of phosphate from practical sample the leakage of metal ions is a major concern for the practical application of adsorbents as depicted in fig 7c measurement of the al content in solution by an inductively coupled plasma optical icap7600 indicated that leaching after adsorption process was relatively low at common ph range the increased leakage at high ph was associated with anode reaction under 1 v condition the electrode exhibited satisfactory stability during phosphate removal generally phosphorous concentrations are quite low in practical samples which also contain other inorganics or organics adsorption experiments were carried out in secondary effluent from shanghai minhang water purification plant with initial concentration of 0 466 mg p l under 1 v condition the relevant parameters were listed in table s11 the applied performance of prepared electrode showed that 100 of the phosphate was removed implying its applicability in complex and low phosphate content water treatment fig 7d the proposed technique showed high removal efficiency and fast kinetic adsorption for p ions with high selectivity in the presence of coexisting ions and organics besides this electrode was easy to remove and regenerate after adsorption thereby avoiding the potential environmental problems caused by incomplete collection of adsorbents however the high cost was a major deficiency and limited its use on a large scale biochars costed about 114 7 124 2 kg ajmal et al 2020 while market prices of commercial adsorbents varied from 0 8 and 5 kg pap et al 2020 despite the easy desorption process that saved the cost for separating adsorbents and treating corrosive solution chemical cost of 88 kg for al c was high in comparison the material was expected to work for at least four cycles fig s12 to reach an effluent level of 0 1 mg p l under 1 v condition the price of ac supported al c was 2408 kg p c0 5 mg p l while the corresponding chemical cost was 229 kg p when calculated based on qm which could be further improved with increased voltages for the preparation of electrode the nickel foam can be reused the expense of carbon black na2so4 and ptfe in one piece of electrode was 0 0012 dollars it costed 1238 kg p and 118 kg p when calculated based on qe of 0 1 mg p l and qm respectively the energy consumption by contrast was relatively low as the electro assisted adsorption amount distinctly increased with treated water volume tang et al 2019b the real cost would be much lower the cost of biochar materials for phosphate removal was 6907 13 214 kg p ajmal et al 2020 the price of la al hydroxide composite was 18 5 25 6 kg p xu et al 2017 therefore optimizations including reducing preparation expense such as using low cost raw materials and simplifying fabrication process and utilizing environmentally benign materials are critical in future research moreover adsorbent with a long lifetime and high reuse cycles in the order of 50 to 100 cycles could largely reduce the adsorption cost and strengthen its practicability kumar et al 2019 further studies should focus on studying parameters that affect reusability and extrapolating the potential adsorbent lifetime 3 4 proposed mechanisms for phosphate adsorption and release efficient p removal and regeneration were observed in this study table 3 with an equilibrium time of 180 min and a rapid desorption process fig s13 besides the electrode showed a qe of 9 32 mg g when ce was 0 094 mg l indicating a relatively high adsorption affinity which is an important factor of adsorbent kumar et al 2019 wang and giammar 2019 commercial ac showed limited p removal kumar et al 2017b besides the qm of an ac electrode by capacitive deionization was only 8 53 mg g with a constant voltage of 3 6 v chen et al 2020 in this study the electrode with ac as active material also exhibited low adsorption capacity under 2 v condition implying p removal was mainly due to mofs or al c according to the phosphate adsorption kinetics and isotherms on electrode chemical interactions occurred during the adsorption process to further elucidate the mechanisms xps results were recorded before and after the treatment table s12 even with more complex composition than ac supported al c the prepared electrode after adsorption exhibited higher p atom concentration demonstrating the successful loading of phosphate the slight changes in the main peaks of mil 101 and al c samples suggested that there were interactions among the elements the strong intensity component at 74 71 ev in mil 101 shifted to a higher binding energy of 74 95 ev in al c indicating the variation of al phase from metallic al to oxidized al fig 8 a chen et al 2000 besides the intensity of al 2p in al c was much higher than that in mil 101 due to the decomposition of mof structure during calcination process phosphate can specifically interact with inorganic materials via ligand exchange the terminal hydroxyl groups contributed to phosphate uptake for the formation of al o p furthermore the hydroxyl group on the material surface got protonized and converted to oh2 groups with electric field which promoted the ligand exchange process owing to the easier displacement of oh2 than hydroxyl group from the metal binding sites yang et al 2014 according to crystallographic calculation and measurements of hydroxyl release into water via x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory in previously published research abdala et al 2015 fang et al 2017 phosphate adsorption happens as a monodentate or bidentate complex in the ligand exchange reaction fig 8b monodentate surface complexes were formed first and then the bidentate surface complexes wherein phosphate was bound to surface hydroxyl ion with one and two coordination sites respectively as surface reactions between phosphate and materials were considered to be reliable on the surface structure of al phases shin et al 2004 the presence of highly oxidized alumina in ac supported al c implied that the surface structure was favorable to form phosphate surface complexes for the high coordination numbers of aluminum oxide as shown in fig 5c d it took longer time to reach equilibrium with applied voltages than without electric field active material was mixed with ac carbon black ptfe and na2so4 to prepare a compacted electrode under pressure therefore the interactions between p ions and active material would be inhibited under 0 v condition thanks to the assistance of electric field an enhanced transfer of p ions from the aqueous solution to the electrode surface was expected because of the constant driving force even with gradually decreased p content in solution as the adsorption process progressed besides the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites could serve as mild lewis acid to bind with phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction 4 conclusions in this work an electrode based on mof derived al c was successfully assembled with efficient phosphate uptake release performance in the presence of electric field representing the first report of this kind of material employed for phosphate removal the al c synthesized via two step calcination of mil 101 not only promoted the diffusion of phosphate anions due to its porous structure and good conductivity but also provided high coordination numbers of aluminum oxide and phosphate specific active sites to form phosphate surface complexes besides the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites could serve as mild lewis acid and interact with phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction noticeably al c stayed stable in alkaline conditions which enabled an efficient regeneration process with continuous electro assistance the mof precursor strategy may be extended in the design and fabrication of many other functional materials meanwhile the present work demonstrated that mof derived al c is a promising candidate for phosphate removal from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationshiaps that could have appeared to

17711,porous metal organic frameworks mofs have drawn increasing attention as promising phosphate adsorbents yet the potential agglomeration of mofs particles and the difficult collection process largely thwarted their application meanwhile adsorbents regeneration might destroy mofs structures due to the use of strong alkaline solution in this work we reported a strategy for designing and fabricating an electrode to remove phosphate based on mil 101 derived metal carbon via a two step carbonization step which not only introduced c doping but also created a stable structure with the assistance of electric field the migration and capture of phosphate anions were greatly enhanced under 1 v condition the material exhibited a high maximum removal capacity of 97 73 mg p g adsorption kinetics and parameters for phosphate at different conditions were analyzed langmuir and freundlich isotherms were employed to validate the adsorption data more importantly the regeneration of electrode was achieved in a more facile and efficient way than micro nanoparticles adsorbents by simple voltage control such an intriguing approach may provide a new platform to further expand the use of mofs for adsorption process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mof derived material conductive structure porous morphology capacitive deionization phosphate removal 1 introduction phosphorus p is an important nutrient for the normal functioning of ecosystems however excessive presence of p in water bodies may accelerate eutrophication and subsequent deterioration of aquatic ecosystems by promoting the rampant growth of algae yu et al 2019 therefore search for efficient phosphate removal approaches have been widely initiated until now various strategies have been examined such as biological treatment chemical precipitation and adsorption etc chemical precipitation is effective for treating wastewater with high p concentration but requires sophisticated control systems and high dose of chemicals producing large amounts of sludge which must be properly disposed de haas et al 2000 biological treatment usually as secondary treatment is proved to be economic and environmentally sound at phosphate removal however its removal efficiency is sensitive to the variation of environment condition gebremariam et al 2011 biological process cannot meet the increasingly stringent environmental requirements which are much lower than the typical levels of conventional approaches by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude therefore it is generally supplemented by an additional tertiary treatment to reduce p to an ultralow concentration omosa et al 2012 out of these adsorption process is considered an appealing method with advantages of high efficiency rapid removal rate good selectivity and easy manipulation liu et al 2019c adsorption also appears a feasible effluent polishing step followed municipal wastewater treatment kumar et al 2017b various adsorption materials have been fabricated such as graphene tran et al 2015 activated carbon koilraj and sasaki 2017 metal oxides kumar et al 2017a and so on in spite of the great advances most of the adsorbents seemed to be challenged by the inferior adsorption capacity and strict regeneration condition these contributed to development of diverse new generation efficient materials and approaches for phosphate removal metal organic frameworks mofs which are constructed via joining organic links with metal ions have been identified to be efficient phosphate adsorbents with accessible high surface areas liu et al 2019a however the potential agglomeration of mofs particles and the difficult post extraction retrieval have hindered their application additionally the strong alkaline condition required for adsorbent regeneration may cause the collapse of mofs structures eventually leading to the incomplete desorption and poor recyclability of mofs liu et al 2018 hence their further application in phosphate control faces the imperative demand for developing more facile avenue to improve p uptake release efficiency the assistance of electric field tends to be promising and visible in practice since it facilitates the migration of phosphate ions and provides a quick way to regenerate the electrode capacitive deionization cdi is a mild electrochemical technique with low cost high removal rate and easy regeneration wang et al 2019 when an external voltage is applied charged ions would migrate to and be stored in polarized electrodes driven by electrostatic force leading to the formation of electric double layer and ions removal from water however traditional cdi technique exhibited poor selectivity towards phosphate attributed to the valence based and size based ion selectivity wherein ions with higher valence and smaller hydrated ions are preferentially electrosorbed guyes et al 2019 the incorporation of mofs materials with cdi technique would definitely makeup the shortage of cdi thus guarantee the selective capture of phosphate anions admittedly since most mofs materials feature as high electric resistance increasement in conductivity of mofs is decisive in the successful integration of mofs and cdi technique studies focusing on the preparation of conductive mofs mainly used acidic linker molecules or h donor guest molecules to generate charge migration by allowing proton transfer between acidic functional groups fleker et al 2016 which demanded special operation conditions including an electrolyte environment increased temperature and humidity up to now mofs derived porous structures with abundant c doping have been proven to improve the charge transfer and chemical stability pan et al 2016 herein thermal treatment under n2 atmosphere was applied to carbonize the organic linker the self accumulation of metal oxide was also prevented for its homogenous dispersion in carbon matrix additionally the calcinated mofs could maintain the structure under strong alkaline condition and overcome the challenge of regeneration inspired by the cdi technique and fabrication of conductive mofs derivatives in this study we reported synthesis of a novel electrode based on mof derived metal carbon composite as a recyclable adsorbent for phosphate removal mil 101 al an excellent phosphate adsorbent was applied as a precursor and template to prepare the porous al c via a two step calcination method the resulted material possessed pristine porous morphology and plentiful c doping with promoted charge transfer to further increase conductivity and avoid agglomeration of as prepared low density particles activated carbon ac was introduced to fabricate the electrode via a facile one pot method fleker et al 2016 compared with conventional sorption this proposed approach was expected to possess some advantages 1 phosphate ions could quickly migrate towards and subsequently interact with electrode with the assistance of electric field 2 the adsorbed p ions could be easily repelled from the electrode and released back to the solution by employing a reversed potential in desorption process 3 the electrode could be directly separated from treated water hence the main objectives were to develop a novel mil 101 derived electrode and explore its feasibility as phosphate adsorbent in particular in order to improve the removal efficiency an electric field was applied the impacts of preparation condition applied voltage ph value temperature ionic strength and co existing substances on phosphate removal were detailed in this paper also its performances in real sewage effluent and continuous phosphate adsorption desorption process with a tunable electro assistance method were studied moreover the adsorption isotherms kinetics the microstructure variation and main adsorption mechanisms of the prepared electrode were comprehensively investigated to illustrate possible synergistic interactions in the process 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of conductive ac supported al c composite the material was synthesized by suspending 1 g of dried ac in a 45 ml n n dimethylformamide dmf solution of terephthalic acid 0 51 g the mixture was treated under ultrasonication after that 0 51 g of aluminum chloride hexahydrate alcl3 6h2o was added to the mixture followed by ultrasonication treatment the mixture was transferred into teflon lined autoclaves and maintained in an oven at 130 c for 72 h after cooling the resulting solid was washed and dried at 180 c for 2 h under reduced pressure to obtain ac supported mil 101 the product was then calcined under a nitrogen gas flow at 400 c for 2 h and subsequently increasing to 600 c for 3 h with a heating rate of 1 c min to afford the ac supported al c composite likewise mil 101 and al c were prepared according to the procedures mentioned above in the absence of ac 2 2 preparation of electrodes for the working electrode a mixture containing 55 56 wt of ac supported active material 5 56 wt of carbon black 5 56 wt of ground na2so4 and 33 3 wt of polytetrafluorethylene ptfe binder was well mixed in ethanol after that the resulting paste was pressed onto nickel foam 2 4 cm2 under a pressure of 5 mpa to obtain the working electrode fig 1 the typical mass of the mof derived al c in a piece of electrode was about 0 026 g the price of the chemicals and energy consumptions were estimated and listed in table s1 it took about 0 088 dollars of chemicals and 0 0037 dollars to synthesize 1 g of al c and a piece of electrode respectively 2 3 structural and elemental characterization scanning electron microscopy sem was taken on a sirion 200 instrument equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds accessory the crystal structure was identified with x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance da vinci in the 2 theta range from 5 to 90 thermal stability of the material was tested with a system provided by mettler toledo under argon flow an x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps ultra axis dld was used for the chemical states identification the functional groups were determined using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 6700 the specific surface area was recorded on a surface area analyzer asap 2460 according to the brunauer emmett teller bet method the pore size distributions were obtained by using non local density functional theory nldft method 2 4 phosphate uptake and release an electro assisted reaction system was applied to measure the phosphate removal and regeneration performance of prepared electrodes all measurements were conducted in an electrochemical cell consisting of working electrode platinum plate as counter electrode and ag agcl as reference electrode at the beginning of adsorption process phosphate solution of 50 ml was added into the cell with varied potential differences samples taken at preset time were analyzed spectrophotometrically according to molybdenum blue method a solution containing 50 mg p l was utilized to measure adsorption kinetics while the adsorption isotherms were determined with different phosphate concentration from 5 to 200 mg p l the effects of ph value and ionic strength were studied with varying ph values 2 12 and nano3 concentrations 0 001 1 m respectively moreover coexistent substances such as nacl k2so4 nahco3 and humic acid ha were utilized to evaluate their impacts on phosphate removal the above experiments were conducted under 1 v condition unless otherwise specified for the regeneration process phosphate solution was substituted by 0 01 m naoh and nacl solution and the applied potential was altered to 2 v for electrodesorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization it is reported that mil 101 has small diameter of ca 0 08 0 15 um seoane et al 2013 as shown in fig 2 mil 101 showed relatively smooth surface without obvious defect and the large particles could be due to agglomeration of mof particles the calcinated mof became rougher but reserved the morphology of mof precursor indicating its good structure stability during the thermal treatment process mil 101 transformed into amorphous carbon framework together with metal oxides and their strong adhesive force ensured the charge transfer on the electrode material zhang et al 2015 as ac displayed a square and smooth micrometer shape the images clearly indicated that mof crystallized on the ac surface where the uniform distributions of c o and al element were also unambiguously confirmed by elemental mapping analyses fig 2f and fig s1 the well dispersed active sites were critical for phosphate adsorption as displayed in fig s2 the prepared electrode was tightly stacked with a thickness about 1 53 cm showing high stability after phosphate adsorption process the macroporous nickel foam and uniform carbon black particles were also observed although mil 101 is an isolating material whose precipitation and coverage would cause the isolation of ac particles from neighboring ones the negative effects could be reduced by subsequent thermal treatment the ratios of o c and al c were higher in calcinated samples as shown in eds spectra fig s3 and table s2 possibly due to the declined c atom concentration caused by the ligand decomposition along with departure of residual solvent and free carboxylic groups in brief the increased al ratio after thermal treatment will enable ac supported al c to possess a high phosphate uptake capacity through offering more adsorptive sites to assess the constitution of functional groups thermogravimetric analysis tga were conducted as depicted in fig 3 a four distinct stages occurred for mil 101 the first stage from room temperature to 150 c was associated with the volatilization of physically attached water and the residual solvent among pore spaces the second step at 150 300 c referred to the departure of free carboxylic groups the third weight loss at 300 650 c can be attributed to the decomposition of organic ligands with further temperature increase the curve reached a plateau for the ac supported mil 101 similar stages but less weight loss percent were detected due to the presence of ac particles which exhibited no distinct weight loss stage during temperature change for its thermal stability endowing the obtained composite with a stable structure for phosphate removal under high temperatures although the shape of mil 101 remained surface area reduced from 1378 472 m2 g to 395 943 m2 g after thermal treatment fig 3b with the combination of ac material ac supported al c exhibited a surface area of 1251 361 m2 g owing to the highly porous structure of ac and small amount of al c the relatively high surface area and porous structure of ac supported al c were favorable for adsorption towards phosphate ions the size distributions of them indicated that the total pore area was almost contributed by mesopores and micropores especially micropores fig s4 furthermore it can be observed that thermal treatment led to the collapse of mof structure the two step carbonization of mil 101 precursor released volatile gasses including co2 and h2o which not only benefitted the formation of porous structure in al oxide but inhibited its aggregation pan et al 2016 besides the c doping by thermal treatment facilitated its application in electric field the xrd patterns of mil 101 and ac supported mil 101 as displayed in fig 4 a showed good crystallinity and matched the xrd pattern of previously reported mil 101 serra crespo et al 2011 confirming that well developed mof crystalline structure formed with ac matrix after thermal treatment the sharp diffraction modes corresponding to mil 101 vanished instead two broad peaks appeared at around 24 and 43 in accordance with the 002 and 100 diffraction peaks of the graphitic structure which was characteristic of disordered carbon liu et al 2015 however signals of al2o3 and al species cannot be obviously detected after the carbonization process suggesting the existence of al in amorphous and complex form according to the high wavenumber region of ir spectra fig 4b several main peaks appeared on mil 101 representing characteristics of benzene carboxylates the band at 1416 95 cm 1 referred to the aromatic carbon cc vibrational mode and band obtained near 1609 17 cm 1 could be assigned to the c o bonding in the carboxylates xie et al 2017 for the other samples similar characteristic peaks were detected as well however the peaks diminished and shifted a little when compared with the spectrum of pristine mil 101 band located at 3687 60 cm 1 corresponded to the al oh group serra crespo et al 2011 the functional al oh group provided binding sites for phosphate moreover the broad adsorption peaks were observed in the range of 3430 43 2959 74 cm 1 as the stretching vibrations of hydroxyl moieties due to the adsorbed h2o suggesting their hydrophilic nature since less hydrated anions of the same charge number are preferred by the hydrophobic resins which show a selectivity sequence based on hofmeister anion series f h2po4 hco3 cl hso3 no3 the prepared hydrophilic composite would present an anti hofmeister selectivity sequence with high affinity towards phosphate anions liu et al 2019a the elements of prepared materials were confirmed with xps analyses fig s5 no characteristic peak in the p 2p spectrum was detected for mil 101 and al c while the response in ac supported al c may be due to the introduction of ac which contained p element itself the spectra also evidenced the presence of al in al c o 1 s in al c could be fitted into three peaks similar to mil 101 representing al o al oh and o c o respectively fig s6 xps results were in good agreement with above analyses and further supported the existence of al oh which would contribute to phosphate remove via ligand exchange 3 2 preparation of electrode the working electrode was composed of conductive agent porogen binder and active material mass transfer and phosphate uptake were closely related to the structure of electrode therefore the performances of electrode prepared under different conditions have been discussed in detail in the supporting information text s1 s2 although electrode with low solid to liquid s l ratio saturated more quickly s l ratio increase based on pristine mil 101 from 0 532 to 2 66 g l doubled the removal efficiency which further increased to 89 when a voltage was applied among different pore forming agents at 0 02 m or 0 06 m na2so4 was identified as the perfect one moreover the ground na2so4 resulted in improved performance owing to the increased amount and reduced size of pores within electrode besides the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe kept rising with higher na2so4 content by facilitating p ions transfer for a given voltage electrode with an elevated ratio of carbon black possessed enhanced electrical conductivity and increased qe up to 105 41 mg p g active material text s3 possibly ascribing to the sustained high driving force for ions even with decreasing p concentration furthermore diverse p removal performances could be expected from electrodes prepared under different pressure retention time and amount of binder which were associated with the release of additives and pore distribution 3 3 adsorption of phosphate to electrode 3 3 1 effect of ph the ph value generally influenced phosphate removal via changing dominant phosphate species and surface charges of adsorbents as shown in fig 5 a phosphate removal capacity tended to decrease with ph increase but remained high in the ph range of 4 8 dominant p species were dependent on solution ph which were considered as h3po4 hpo4 2 h2po4 hpo4 2 po4 3 and po4 3 in the ph range of 2 13 2 13 7 20 7 20 10 30 and 12 40 respectively liu et al 2019a different from conventional adsorbent particles whose surface charges were determined by their zeta potentials and ph values the working electrode can be endowed with a given potential difference thereby always displaying positive surface charges to promote phosphate transportation the declined adsorption capacity could be attributed to the competitive adsorption for binding sites by excessive hydroxyl anions as the ph increased rashid et al 2017 especially with the assistance of electric field moreover oxygen evolution reaction could occur at anode under 1 0 v vs ag agcl condition with increased ph value according to nernst equation inhibiting phosphate adsorption by generating bubbles and releasing positive charges in strong acid condition the predominant neutral h3po4 was unfavorable for p capture via electrostatic attraction indicating the occurrence of ligand exchange between electrode and phosphate over a wide ph range considering the high removal efficiency from ph 4 to 8 the solution ph around 4 9 was not adjusted before other experiments to reduce the influences of foreign ions besides the highest adsorption capacity was also observed at ph 4 9 3 3 2 effect of temperature it can be seen in fig 5b and fig s9 that phosphate uptake increased noticeably at a higher temperature demonstrating that phosphate removal was an endothermic process for the 0 v condition qe at 25 45 and 65 c was 37 84 44 44 and 44 80 mg g respectively text s4 and table s8 when 1 v was applied to the electrodes qe fluctuated from 78 92 to 107 66 mg g accordingly this was possibly due to the improved physical adsoption towards phosphate resulting from the increment in p ions activity and the facilitated coordination interaction for the enhanced hydrolysis and ionization of phosphate wang et al 2016 obviously the presence of electrical field enlarged the differences among varied temperatures 3 3 3 effects of applied voltages and adsorption kinetics as illustrated in fig 5 phosphate removal was initially fast followed by a slow stage and achieved equilibrium in around 180 min the enhancement in phosphate capture with increasing potentials could be ascribed to the abundant availability of active sites on the electrode as time lapsed the number of remaining vacant binding sites decreased correspondingly and p ions in bulk solution had to traverse deeper to reach the active sites therefore the diffusing p ions would be subjected to higher resistance and slower adsorption rate over time kinetic analyses by the pseudo first order fig 5c and pseudo second order models fig 5d were employed to quantitatively study their adsorption behavior and summarized in table 1 both models fitted the kinetic curves well with high correlation coefficients r2 indicating the mechanisms responsible for phosphate adsorption included reaction on the material surface and chemisorption the former was related to the surface active sites and affinity while the latter involved valency forces via exchanging or sharing electrons between adsorbent and adsorbate liu et al 2019a according to the pseudo second order kinetic model analysis qe was 37 84 mg g for 0 v condition which rose to 111 62 mg g when applied voltage achieved 3 v high voltage accelerated the movement of anions towards working electrode and promoted ion adsorption by forming a thick electrical double layer ge et al 2018 with further increase in potential difference however phosphate capture no longer significantly improved furthermore electrode prepared with ac only showed an extremely low removal efficiency implying that phosphate was mainly adsorbed on mofs or al c mof particles crystallized on the ac surface and provided well dispersed binding sites since the mesoporous cages of mil 101 was beneficial for phosphate diffusion and an electric field was applied adsorption happened fast even at low p concentration kumar et al 2017b 3 3 4 effect of ionic strength with increased no3 concentration the elecrode exhibited decreased p adsorption rate fig 6 a according to the fitting analyses by kinetic models fig s10 and table s9 qe varied from 82 53 to 46 95 mg g in ionic strength range of 0 001 1 m the declined efficiency could be caused by suppressed formation of outer sphere complexes between p ions 1 61 mm and adsorbent owing to the competition for binding sites su et al 2013 with electric field co existing anions would also be driven towards the working electrode therefore interfering with phosphate adsorption via electrostatic interaction as the metallic cation within the adsorbent selectively formed inner sphere complex with phosphate via covalent chemical bonds in ligand exchange decent phosphate uptake rate maintained even with high concentration of foreign ions 3 3 5 effects of co existent anions and humic acid since some naturally occurring anions coexisted in nature water and industrial effluents the electro assisted adsorption preference towards phosphate was elucidated with commonly detected ions as shown in fig 6b phosphate uptake dropped obviously as the concentration of competing anions increased from 2 to 10 mm as aforementioned such behavior was closely associated with the formed complexes in between p ions and adsorbent the outer sphere surface complexation would be suppressed by the enhanced ionic strength for the electric double layer contraction and competitive adsorption su et al 2013 however phosphate uptake through inner sphere complexation guaranteed most of the removal efficiency even at high level of other anions except for so4 2 at 10 mm which led to reduced adsorption capacity due to its high valence and concentration in the electro assisted condition although hco3 could increase ph value and compete for binding sites because of their similar ionic structure su et al 2015 p anions with high valence were more preferred by the adsorbent which also occurred in the existence of cl natural water contains various macromolecules represented by ha that can form stable complexes with metal hydroxides the result revealed that phosphate adsorption efficiency with ha decreased slightly showing a qe of 53 19 mg g fig 6c and table s10 it was difficult for ha with average size of 1 2 4 nm to reach the internal region of adsorbent due to size exclusion effects tang et al 2019a besides ha could be adsorbed by carbon materials and removed from water rendering the active sites unaffected koilraj and sasaki 2017 such good selectivity would ensure p uptake in complex wastewater and promote the recovery of phosphate of high purity after regeneration of utilized adsorbent 3 3 6 effects of initial concentration and adsorption isotherms the dependence of removal efficiency on the initial phosphate concentration was displayed in fig s11 adsorption efficiency declined as the initial concentration increased for the easy saturation of adsorption sites on the contrary the adsorption capacity improved fig 6d probably attributing to the enhanced mass transfer driven by concentration gradient between electrode surface and bulk solution moreover the increased number of collisions between electrode and pollutant ions significantly contributed to the adsorption process abo el naga et al 2018 the electro assisted adsorption isotherms of phosphate were tested to explore adsorption mode and assess potential uptake efficiency two isotherm models langmuir and freundlich were used to simulate and quantitatively analyze the adsorption process table 2 and text s5 the data was better described by the langmuir model in view of the higher correlation coefficients demonstrating the homogenous distribution of adsorption sites on the working electrode and monolayer adsorption mode a dimensionless equilibrium constant named separation factor rl is an essential parameter to evaluate the efficacy of prepared electrode and can be defined as follows r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c0 and kl represent the initial p concentration and langmuir equilibrium constant respectively the rl value gives indication for the favorability of the adsorption process linear rl 1 irreversible rl 0 unfavorable rl 1 or favorable 0 rl 1 ruan et al 2016 according to the results of langmuir model kl value of 0 065 l mg implied that phosphate adsorption on synthesized electrode was a favorable process the maximal adsorption capacity qm of prepared electrode at 25 c for 1 v condition was 97 73 mg p g al c and exceeded most phosphate adsorbents table 3 3 3 7 recyclability of adsorbents the time varying electro assisted desorption performance was illustrated in fig 7 a the efficiency increased rapidly in the first 6 min and 88 92 of the binded p was released in 20 min while it took 24 h to reach a 83 73 desorption efficiency in the absence of electric potential fig 7b for the desorption process hydroxide oxides and chloride could remove adsorbed p via ion exchange and substitution generally the negatively charged adsorbent at high ph could no longer adsorb phosphate by electrostatic attraction under 0 v condition with a reverse potential difference electrode would further drive the adsorbed p ions away by electrostatic repulsion force and generate metal ligand bonding with higher affinity in order to decrease the charge density of hydroxide and chloride ions in solution lai et al 2019 consequently leading to an enhanced regeneration of utilized material in general a concentrated naoh solution 1 m or 0 5 m was utilized as desorpion solution which would destroy mof structure and simultaneously produce corrosive wastewater containing highly concentrated salts or and bases lai et al 2019 consequently the regeneration of mofs was mainly performed in nacl solution of high concentration with desorption percentage lower than 2 indicating at least 98 of the adsorbed phosphate was through specific adsorption and difficult to be released liu et al 2019b xie et al 2017 besides desorption process usually continues for 24 h to complete the highly efficient desorption in this study could be ascribable to the hierarchical structure of prepared electrode that prevented the falling off of al c and endowed the electrode with stable adsortion performance metal oxides hydroxides nanoparticles which have been widely utilized to adsorb phosphate due to high surface area to volume ratio are difficult to separate after the adsorption process possibly resulting in unsatisfactory recycling ability and water pollution caused by potential release of ultrafine materials into water ge et al 2016 while micrometer scale adsorbents require an additional separating treatment such as centrifugation and filtration noticeably the electrode was ready to remove directly from the treated aqueous system due to the high desorption efficiency the regenerated electrode could be utilized again for subsequent adsorption desorption cycles amount of phosphate removed by regenerated electrode decreased slightly possibly owing to loss of active sites fig s12 despite this the electrode still maintained more than 96 of the original removal efficiency after the fourth cycle indicative of its high potential for long time phosphate capture 3 3 8 removal of phosphate from practical sample the leakage of metal ions is a major concern for the practical application of adsorbents as depicted in fig 7c measurement of the al content in solution by an inductively coupled plasma optical icap7600 indicated that leaching after adsorption process was relatively low at common ph range the increased leakage at high ph was associated with anode reaction under 1 v condition the electrode exhibited satisfactory stability during phosphate removal generally phosphorous concentrations are quite low in practical samples which also contain other inorganics or organics adsorption experiments were carried out in secondary effluent from shanghai minhang water purification plant with initial concentration of 0 466 mg p l under 1 v condition the relevant parameters were listed in table s11 the applied performance of prepared electrode showed that 100 of the phosphate was removed implying its applicability in complex and low phosphate content water treatment fig 7d the proposed technique showed high removal efficiency and fast kinetic adsorption for p ions with high selectivity in the presence of coexisting ions and organics besides this electrode was easy to remove and regenerate after adsorption thereby avoiding the potential environmental problems caused by incomplete collection of adsorbents however the high cost was a major deficiency and limited its use on a large scale biochars costed about 114 7 124 2 kg ajmal et al 2020 while market prices of commercial adsorbents varied from 0 8 and 5 kg pap et al 2020 despite the easy desorption process that saved the cost for separating adsorbents and treating corrosive solution chemical cost of 88 kg for al c was high in comparison the material was expected to work for at least four cycles fig s12 to reach an effluent level of 0 1 mg p l under 1 v condition the price of ac supported al c was 2408 kg p c0 5 mg p l while the corresponding chemical cost was 229 kg p when calculated based on qm which could be further improved with increased voltages for the preparation of electrode the nickel foam can be reused the expense of carbon black na2so4 and ptfe in one piece of electrode was 0 0012 dollars it costed 1238 kg p and 118 kg p when calculated based on qe of 0 1 mg p l and qm respectively the energy consumption by contrast was relatively low as the electro assisted adsorption amount distinctly increased with treated water volume tang et al 2019b the real cost would be much lower the cost of biochar materials for phosphate removal was 6907 13 214 kg p ajmal et al 2020 the price of la al hydroxide composite was 18 5 25 6 kg p xu et al 2017 therefore optimizations including reducing preparation expense such as using low cost raw materials and simplifying fabrication process and utilizing environmentally benign materials are critical in future research moreover adsorbent with a long lifetime and high reuse cycles in the order of 50 to 100 cycles could largely reduce the adsorption cost and strengthen its practicability kumar et al 2019 further studies should focus on studying parameters that affect reusability and extrapolating the potential adsorbent lifetime 3 4 proposed mechanisms for phosphate adsorption and release efficient p removal and regeneration were observed in this study table 3 with an equilibrium time of 180 min and a rapid desorption process fig s13 besides the electrode showed a qe of 9 32 mg g when ce was 0 094 mg l indicating a relatively high adsorption affinity which is an important factor of adsorbent kumar et al 2019 wang and giammar 2019 commercial ac showed limited p removal kumar et al 2017b besides the qm of an ac electrode by capacitive deionization was only 8 53 mg g with a constant voltage of 3 6 v chen et al 2020 in this study the electrode with ac as active material also exhibited low adsorption capacity under 2 v condition implying p removal was mainly due to mofs or al c according to the phosphate adsorption kinetics and isotherms on electrode chemical interactions occurred during the adsorption process to further elucidate the mechanisms xps results were recorded before and after the treatment table s12 even with more complex composition than ac supported al c the prepared electrode after adsorption exhibited higher p atom concentration demonstrating the successful loading of phosphate the slight changes in the main peaks of mil 101 and al c samples suggested that there were interactions among the elements the strong intensity component at 74 71 ev in mil 101 shifted to a higher binding energy of 74 95 ev in al c indicating the variation of al phase from metallic al to oxidized al fig 8 a chen et al 2000 besides the intensity of al 2p in al c was much higher than that in mil 101 due to the decomposition of mof structure during calcination process phosphate can specifically interact with inorganic materials via ligand exchange the terminal hydroxyl groups contributed to phosphate uptake for the formation of al o p furthermore the hydroxyl group on the material surface got protonized and converted to oh2 groups with electric field which promoted the ligand exchange process owing to the easier displacement of oh2 than hydroxyl group from the metal binding sites yang et al 2014 according to crystallographic calculation and measurements of hydroxyl release into water via x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory in previously published research abdala et al 2015 fang et al 2017 phosphate adsorption happens as a monodentate or bidentate complex in the ligand exchange reaction fig 8b monodentate surface complexes were formed first and then the bidentate surface complexes wherein phosphate was bound to surface hydroxyl ion with one and two coordination sites respectively as surface reactions between phosphate and materials were considered to be reliable on the surface structure of al phases shin et al 2004 the presence of highly oxidized alumina in ac supported al c implied that the surface structure was favorable to form phosphate surface complexes for the high coordination numbers of aluminum oxide as shown in fig 5c d it took longer time to reach equilibrium with applied voltages than without electric field active material was mixed with ac carbon black ptfe and na2so4 to prepare a compacted electrode under pressure therefore the interactions between p ions and active material would be inhibited under 0 v condition thanks to the assistance of electric field an enhanced transfer of p ions from the aqueous solution to the electrode surface was expected because of the constant driving force even with gradually decreased p content in solution as the adsorption process progressed besides the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites could serve as mild lewis acid to bind with phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction 4 conclusions in this work an electrode based on mof derived al c was successfully assembled with efficient phosphate uptake release performance in the presence of electric field representing the first report of this kind of material employed for phosphate removal the al c synthesized via two step calcination of mil 101 not only promoted the diffusion of phosphate anions due to its porous structure and good conductivity but also provided high coordination numbers of aluminum oxide and phosphate specific active sites to form phosphate surface complexes besides the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites could serve as mild lewis acid and interact with phosphate ions via electrostatic attraction noticeably al c stayed stable in alkaline conditions which enabled an efficient regeneration process with continuous electro assistance the mof precursor strategy may be extended in the design and fabrication of many other functional materials meanwhile the present work demonstrated that mof derived al c is a promising candidate for phosphate removal from water declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationshiaps that could have appeared to

17712,maximizing water recovery and minimizing the volume of ro concentrate i e brine produced is a growing challenge especially for inland communities that lack ocean disposal options in such regions transitioning towards zero liquid discharge zld can avoid detrimental impacts associated with salt disposal via regional sewer discharge or deep well injection on site zld energy requirements are proportional to the ro brine flowrate thus system level strategies that reduce ro brine flows will lower zld costs while simultaneously increasing the overall water recovery for beneficial reuse in reclamation facilities we investigated a membrane distillation md system operating using co located cooler source water to treat warmer wastewater ro brine using experimentally quantified md fluxes based on observed monthly water temperatures of co located water and ro brine at a facility in central arizona and based on the previously reported performance of large scale md systems energy consumption and operating cost were estimated to evaluate the potential capabilities of md to treat ro brine at full scale facilities when the ro unit was combined with md brine treatment net water recovery at the full scale facility can increase from 85 to up to 91 while brine flow can be reduced by 26 a 25 lower thermal energy was required to achieve ro net water recovery of 95 when using co located water compared against conventional md without using co located water overall this work demonstrates the potential to use local thermal gradients to reduce ro brine volumes thereby reducing zld costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability inland brine management reuse reclamation residual management 1 introduction many countries around the world are moving towards water reclamation to meet the increase in water demand due to the high population growth rates scarcity of water sources and most important the desire for a sustainable water source asano burton leverenz tsuchihashi and tchobanoglous 2007 bixio et al 2006 epa 2012 reverse osmosis ro is an integral part of modern reuse systems to remove dissolved solids contaminants of emerging concern cec and pathogens bagastyo et al 2011 pérez gonzález et al 2012 however ro produces large flows of concentrated wastes brine that need to be handled disposed or further treated which increases the cost of ro process typical wastewater reclamation ro systems achieve 80 85 water recovery with a 15 20 brine flow containing salts cec and other pollutants the disposal of these waste streams can potentially cause a point source pollution and it is a growing barrier for many communities implementing or expanding wastewater reuse therefore many utilities seek to increase ro water recovery to 95 to minimize brine volume and reduce the cost of achieving zero liquid discharge zld inland regions that do not have the option of oceanic discharge have to rely on regional sewers for brine disposal or use evaporation ponds thermal evaporators crystallizers spray driers or concentrators to reduce the brine volume pérez gonzález et al 2012 conventional water treatment technologies such as coagulation and granular activated carbon gac along with advanced treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation photocatalysis ions exchange or multi stage high pressure ro are effective treatment options to help reducing ro brine flowrate deshmukh et al 2018 pramanik et al 2017 umar et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2009 membrane distillation md can treat ro brine and extract high quality product water while further concentrating the waste stream deshmukh et al 2018 mericq et al 2010 morillo et al 2014 naidu et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 shaffer et al 2013 md is a thermally driven process with two feed waters separated by a thin hydrophobic porous membrane when adequate temperature differential exists i e 5 c between the two feeds water evaporates from the warmer side feed due to the vapor pressure differences in the cell forming water vapor that permeates across the membrane to condense on the colder side distillate salts do not permeate across the membrane and are retained in the warmer brine stream membrane thickness hydrophobicity porosity tortuosity md module configurations feed pressure and temperature are the main parameters controlling md performance alkhudhiri et al 2012 conventional md systems require heating of the feed water to achieve the required thermal differential resulting in high energy costs 10 kwh m3 tavakkoli et al 2017 the use of solar energy or waste heat have been explored as a way to lower operation costs in md dongare et al 2017 rice et al 2020 but these options still require heat exchangers large solar exposed surface areas or other capital equipment leveraging the access of co located colder water sources for the md distillate could help meet the required thermal differential this study s goal was to quantify the thermal availability and technical feasibility of using a co located water source as the md draw distillate to treat ro brine a specific case study at the city of scottsdale arizona one of the largest advanced wastewater facilities in the united states was considered where a 20 million gallon per day mgd 90 000 m3 day capacity wastewater facility operates at 8 mgd 36 000 m3 day ro unit with about 80 85 recovery the co located surface water source at the facility originates from the colorado river via the central arizona project cap cap water is already microfiltered and blended with ro permeate on site for stability and corrosion control before water reuse at golf courses or groundwater recharge measured average monthly temperature data from the two waters ro brine and cap were used as feed and distillate in the experiments conducted to estimate the potential monthly fluxes that would be produced by md based on experimental data and previously reported trials of pilot scale md systems the feasibility of using cap water as md distillate to treat ro brine are estimated for a full scale system including an estimation of extracted water volume the net increase in ro recovery and the thermal heat reqirements that would be needed to achieved a specific net recovery year round while leveraging co located temperature gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 reverse osmosis process and water quality ro brine was obtained from the city of scottsdale az water campus advanced water treatment facility awt alexander et al 2010 lluria 2009 mansfield and nunez 2001 vernon 2000 the awt process includes nitrification denitrification followed by ozonation microfiltration mf ro disinfection and advanced oxidation uv h2o2 treated ro permeate is either used for golf course irrigation or injected into vadose zone wells to supplement groundwater within the basin for potable use the ro unit consists of two ro membrane stages to achieve 85 water recovery seasonally between 1 and 3 mgd 5000 15 000 m3 day of ro brine is produced which is currently discharged to a regional sewer line this discharge option may no longer be available in the near future due to tds and salinity restrictions at the downstream regional wastewater treatment plant because the target sodium concentration in awt treated water is 125 mg l 1 ro permeate is blended with mf treated cap water to increase the sodium concentration prior to discharge to for the golf courses or on site vadose zone injection wells the cap water is also used as water source for a 27 mgd 120 000 m3 day on site drinking water treatment plant at the water campus table 1 summarizes key water quality parameters for the ro brine and cap waters because cap water has a lower temperature than ro brine year round it can be used as the cold water stream in an md system fig 1 2 2 experimental membrane distillation apparatus and membrane distillation operation the experimental set up was prepared to quantify md water fluxes using collected water from the site polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes fglp14250 emd millipore were used in a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd cell fig 2 the md system was composed of a feed circulation system a distillate circulation system and a membrane cell gear pumps delivered the waters to the membrane cell where it flowed in a 1 mm channel on both sides of a flat sheet ptfe membrane pore size 0 22 μm porosity 85 tortuosity around 2 and 150 μm thickness the md cell had an active area of 28 cm2 3 5 cm 8 cm actual ro brine obtained from the reclamation facility was used as the hot feed for all experiments and the co located surface water cap water was the cold distillate the md fluxes were quantified for each month using collected ro brine and cap water operated at the temperature measured in the field for each month each experiment operated for 3 h by recirculating 2 l of feed and 2 l of distillate and maintaining constant temperatures using a chiller or heater experiments were performed for cap water ro brine and ultrapure waters 2 3 estimation of membrane distillation performance at large scale the performance of md modules depends mainly on the temperatures of feed and distillate as the driving force however heat losses along the length of membranes in conventional md modules are considerable deshmukh et al 2018 convective heat and liquid mass transfer across md membranes influence water temperature on both sides of the membrane and decreases the driving force for md water flux qtaishat et al 2008 previous studies evaluated the md feed heat losses to be 10 35 when water contacts the membrane surface due to temperature polarization elmarghany et al 2019 martínez díez and vázquez gonzález 1999 heat loss is higher with lower feed velocities yu et al 2011 or when the feed temperature is below 50 c phattaranawik et al 2003 as it is the case in our study in bench scale experiments temperature polarization effects are often negligible due to the small membrane areas used however in large scale md modules decreasing water flux is observed due to the large amount of energy exchanged inside the membrane modules hitsov et al 2018 song et al 2007 winter et al 2017 as water vapor transfers across the membrane from the hot side to the cold side heat is transferred as well which leads to heat loss this heat loss increases along the membrane length leading to a reduction in the average feed temperature and therefore a reduction in water flux zhang et al 2012 showed a 75 reduction in water flux along a fiber 0 8 m in length for a pilot scale hollow fiber dcmd zhang et al 2012 another study shows a temperature drop of 69 and 82 at a full scale air gap md agmd and dmdc along a 1 5 m length of membrane respectively eykens et al 2017 for both studies flux reduction shows nearly linear relationship with membrane length at fluxes lower than 20 lmh seasonal md fluxes at large scale were estimated based on the experimental data collected as described in section 2 2 using ro brine and cap water as feed and distillate respectively these experimental results were used to predict large scale fluxes based on previously reported pilot scale experimental and modelling data for an hollow fiber dcmd module using a membrane length of 0 733 m zhang et al 2012 the bench scale flux which was measured using a membrane cell with a membrane length of 0 08 m was used as the inlet flux value for large scale modules the bench scale experiments were conducted for flat sheet dcmd as they are readily cleaned and replaced flat sheet dcmd have shown similar flux as hollow fiber dcmd in bench scale zare and kargari 2018 the inlet flux was the highest value in the module and total module flux was normalized to represent the flux reduction in function of module length according to the pilot results zhang et al 2012 two membrane lengths 0 3 m and 0 7 m were used to consider md performance at the large scale facility for the entire ro system including md treatment of brine waste stream we estimate the net ro recovery that can be achieved by adding a md system that leverages the temperature differential of the co located surface water source in addition to achieve a specific net ro recovery the external heat energy required for the system is calculated specific energy consumption sec kwh m3 which is defined as the required energy to produce 1 cubic meter of water to a fraction of latent heat is used to estimate the energy requirement to heat the feed water for specific flux values and is calculated using eq 1 jantaporn et al 2017 1 s e c ρ c p δ t where ρ is feed water density kg m3 c p is specific heat capacity of the feed kj kg c and δ t is the difference between actual and required temperature c 3 results and discussion 3 1 monthly variation in feed water temperature fig 3 plots the monthly mean temperatures of the ro brine and cap water at locations within the awt building household hot water use and warm arizona weather results in wastewater that is consistently warmer than cap surface water ro brine temperature varies seasonally between 25 and 34 c mean 29 c the cap water temperature is always cooler than the ro brine and varies between 12 and 26 c mean 19 c the average temperature differential δt between the two co located water sources is 10 3 5 c with the largest differential in january 13 5 c and smallest in september 7 1 c 3 2 experimental membrane distillation fluxes and water quality first the md apparatus was operated using ro brine and cap waters to establish md system performance as a function of δt the maximum flux 16 l m2 h lmh was achieved at temperatures around 50 c for the feed and 20 c for the distillate md flux values were found to be similar when ultrapure water was used under the same conditions demonstrating there is no short term effect of feed water quality on md flux second md experiments were conducted using the ro brine and cap water adjusted at actual monthly temperatures and δt fig 3 fig 4 dots shows md flux in these experiments varied from 3 lmh in march to 6 lmh in july the annual average flux achieved in the lab md apparatus was 4 0 4 lmh even though the δt in january and july is the same fig 4 the flux in july was 25 larger because md fluxes vary exponentially with feed and distillate temperatures higher flux occurs with higher temperatures md performance was measured using conductivity measurements in the feed and permeate waters after 3 h of operation with the ro brine and cap water conductivity rejection is measured for the percentage of md feed tds that has been removed in the permeate because the feed and permeate in the md apparatus are both recycled the ro brine side become more saline while the cap water side becomes more dilute using actual water with giving average temperatures for each month the md process achieved 97 rejection of conductivity which suggest partial pore wetting rezaei et al 2018 by the ro brine however the salt rejection value was stable over time and is considered acceptable for the current applications of the reclaimed water at this utility moreover recent work has shown that salt rejection can easily be maintained 99 if omniphobic md membranes are used ghaleni et al 2020 3 3 predicted flux for hollow fiber membrane distillation at large scale md fluxes for large scale were estimated for different hollow fiber membrane lengths l 0 3 m and l 0 7 m based on the experimental data conducted in bench scale and on the modeling and experimental data from a previous pilot study zhang et al 2012 flux reductions along the membrane were normalized based on the relationship between flux and the reported membrane length the highest md flux values were measured at the inlet which then decreased along the membrane towards the module outlet md flux values from our bench scale experiments fig 4 were used as inlet flux values for large scale calculations water fluxes were reduced by 75 for l 0 733 m long pilot scale hollow fiber dcmd zhang et al 2012 therefore we applied similar losses in flux for the md modules designed to treat ro brine using co located water for the full scale facility fig 4 shows md fluxes for l 0 7 m fiber length dashed line and for l 0 3 m fiber length solid line for each month the annual average flux is reduced by 73 at l 0 7 m membrane length and was estimated to be 1 11 0 4 lmh with the highest in july of 1 61 lmh and lowest in march of 0 76 lmh for a shorter fiber l 0 3 m the annual average flux was estimated at 2 09 0 8 lmh with highest at 3 lmh in july and lowest at 1 42 in march representing 48 reduction from bench scale flux values 3 4 full scale membrane distillation using co located waters based upon the facility schematic in fig 1 full scale system performance was evaluated using the estimated flux values fig 4 the aims were to 1 determine the required membrane surface area 2 determine net ro water recovery and 3 calculate the additional energy input at the scottsdale water campus the current ro recovery was assumed to be about 85 which is near the actual operation to reduce its brine flow the facility desires to achieve 95 ro md net recovery with the md monthly flux values the net system recovery was calculated for a scenario where an md unit is coupled with the ro system at a fixed md surface area as water is extracted from ro brine md treated water md permeate and cap water is added to the ro permeate and increases the net recovery of the ro unit fig 1 the calculations show a trade off exists between md membrane surface area and ro net recovery fig si 2 a larger md membrane surface area is needed to achieve 95 net recovery the commercial membrane packing density i e the ratio of the membrane surface area to module volume m2 m3 varies for different membrane configurations alkhudhiri and hilal 2018 hollow fiber md modules have the highest packing density 500 9000 m2 m3 garcía fernández et al 2015 a hollow fiber md with packing density of 3000 m2 m3 representing an average packing density for commercial hollow fiber modules was chosen for the study to achieve 95 net total recovery with minimum energy and number of md modules at the full scale facility each md module would need to operate at 100 000 gallons per day 450 m3 day of ro brine fig 5 shows an estimation of net recoveries qnet using estimated flux values from fig 4 for each month with the normalized md area recoveries increase seasonally from 85 to between 86 and 91 the average annual qnet increased from 85 to 87 for a membrane length of l 0 7 m and to 89 for l 0 3 m membrane long while producing more reclaimed water integrating this md design using cooler co located water also reduces the ro brine flow that requires disposal by yearly average of 0 17 0 32 mgd 750 1450 m3 day of course reducing the brine flow has no effect on salt load but the flow reduction would lower the ultimate capacity of zld systems e g evaporators overall the facility can reduce the ro brine by 60 120 million gallons annually 270 000 540 000 m3 by implementing the md system a monthly average qnet was estimated to be as high as 88 for l 0 7 m membrane and 91 for l 0 3 m membrane in july while recoveries are at lowest in march at 86 for l 0 7 m membrane and 87 for l 0 3 m membrane fig 5 however the awt at the scottsdale water campus seeks to achieve a constant 95 qnet for each month therefore additional external thermal energy would be required during specific months the additional energy requirement was calculated using eq 1 and monthly observed water temperatures by normalizing the membrane surface area to ro brine flow 3000 m2 per 100 000 gallons 450 m3 and estimated md fluxes fig 6 shows the average additional energy required for heating md feed to achieve at least 95 qnet for each month for both systems with and without co located water for membrane length of l 0 7 m fig 6a the average annual additional energy for the md system was estimated by eq 1 to be 10 kwh m3 for a single pass 2 md recovery in order to have multiple passes through md and achieve high water recovery md feed water needs to be recirculated lokare et al 2018 swaminathan and lienhard 2018 the limitation to leverage the natural thermal differences for md system is that recycled feed needs to be maintained at the same temperature as the influent ro brine water the feed loses some heat in each pass due to evaporation by using an external heat source e g electrical solar driven or waste heat for this facility in the arid southwestern usa there is excess waste heat from sources such as mf and ro pumps building heating and cooling systems that could be used to reduce heating costs to achieve a desired recovery for md feed water needs to be recycled and reheated in each pass lokare et al 2018 recirculation ratio for md feed depends on a single pass recovery and the overall recovery needed higher flux means lower recirculation ratio after calculating recycle rations for each month an average additional energy of 290 kwh m3 is needed for a md system that has access to a co located water source to achieve 95 overall recovery for ro md this was 15 lower than an md system without co located water annual average of 350 kwh m3 to heat the feed water the additional energy requirement is lower for shorter membrane l 0 3m due to lower heat losses which results in higher flux and lower recycle ratio needed the total additional energy was estimated by eq 1 to be 250 kwh m3 representing about 25 lower energy requirement than md without co located waters fig 6b fig 7 a shows the average annual energy cost needed to heat the md feed water with membrane length of l 0 7 m to achieve different qnet at a facility for treating 1 m3 of ro brine assuming a thermal energy cost of 0 0105 per kwh steam cost 7 1000kg and converted to latent heat kwh al obaidani et al 2008 kesieme et al 2013 the facility could achieve 87 5 qnet with an average heating cost of 1 00 m3 of ro brine and could achieve 95 qnet with 3 13 m3 for a membrane with l 0 3 m length the facility could achieve at least 87 5 qnet at 0 87 m3 for each month and could achieve 95 qnet with 2 63 m3 fig 7b the alternative or competitive technology to the md approach involves adding a 3rd stage ro unit to treat the 2nd stage ro brine fig si 3 the average energy of a 3rd stage ro unit for treating brine approaches 6 kwh m3 panagopoulos et al 2019 assuming an electrical energy cost of 0 13 kwh the energy cost of operating an additional ro stage approaches 0 75 m3 3 00 1000 gallon md operational costs vary depending upon how heat recovery is implemented ranging from 0 43 m3 to 1 17 m3 for md al obaidani et al 2008 kesieme et al 2013 song and liming 2009 thus achieving 95 overall recovery via 3rd stage ro could have lower energy operating costs than md even when using co located water unless another source of low cost energy such as sunlight or waste heat can be utilized by the md however achieving 95 overall recovery via 3rd stage ro requires 60 recovery from the saline wastewater brine which will undoubtedly result in organic inorganic or biofouling operational issues and associated costs in the concentrated saline solution in the 3rd stage ro module md capital costs are lower than ro costs the capital costs of ro ranges from 1190 m3 day to 1313 m3 day for large desalination plants ettouney et al 2002 song and liming 2009 a

17712,maximizing water recovery and minimizing the volume of ro concentrate i e brine produced is a growing challenge especially for inland communities that lack ocean disposal options in such regions transitioning towards zero liquid discharge zld can avoid detrimental impacts associated with salt disposal via regional sewer discharge or deep well injection on site zld energy requirements are proportional to the ro brine flowrate thus system level strategies that reduce ro brine flows will lower zld costs while simultaneously increasing the overall water recovery for beneficial reuse in reclamation facilities we investigated a membrane distillation md system operating using co located cooler source water to treat warmer wastewater ro brine using experimentally quantified md fluxes based on observed monthly water temperatures of co located water and ro brine at a facility in central arizona and based on the previously reported performance of large scale md systems energy consumption and operating cost were estimated to evaluate the potential capabilities of md to treat ro brine at full scale facilities when the ro unit was combined with md brine treatment net water recovery at the full scale facility can increase from 85 to up to 91 while brine flow can be reduced by 26 a 25 lower thermal energy was required to achieve ro net water recovery of 95 when using co located water compared against conventional md without using co located water overall this work demonstrates the potential to use local thermal gradients to reduce ro brine volumes thereby reducing zld costs graphical abstract image 1 keywords sustainability inland brine management reuse reclamation residual management 1 introduction many countries around the world are moving towards water reclamation to meet the increase in water demand due to the high population growth rates scarcity of water sources and most important the desire for a sustainable water source asano burton leverenz tsuchihashi and tchobanoglous 2007 bixio et al 2006 epa 2012 reverse osmosis ro is an integral part of modern reuse systems to remove dissolved solids contaminants of emerging concern cec and pathogens bagastyo et al 2011 pérez gonzález et al 2012 however ro produces large flows of concentrated wastes brine that need to be handled disposed or further treated which increases the cost of ro process typical wastewater reclamation ro systems achieve 80 85 water recovery with a 15 20 brine flow containing salts cec and other pollutants the disposal of these waste streams can potentially cause a point source pollution and it is a growing barrier for many communities implementing or expanding wastewater reuse therefore many utilities seek to increase ro water recovery to 95 to minimize brine volume and reduce the cost of achieving zero liquid discharge zld inland regions that do not have the option of oceanic discharge have to rely on regional sewers for brine disposal or use evaporation ponds thermal evaporators crystallizers spray driers or concentrators to reduce the brine volume pérez gonzález et al 2012 conventional water treatment technologies such as coagulation and granular activated carbon gac along with advanced treatment technologies such as advanced oxidation photocatalysis ions exchange or multi stage high pressure ro are effective treatment options to help reducing ro brine flowrate deshmukh et al 2018 pramanik et al 2017 umar et al 2015 westerhoff et al 2009 membrane distillation md can treat ro brine and extract high quality product water while further concentrating the waste stream deshmukh et al 2018 mericq et al 2010 morillo et al 2014 naidu et al 2017 pramanik et al 2017 shaffer et al 2013 md is a thermally driven process with two feed waters separated by a thin hydrophobic porous membrane when adequate temperature differential exists i e 5 c between the two feeds water evaporates from the warmer side feed due to the vapor pressure differences in the cell forming water vapor that permeates across the membrane to condense on the colder side distillate salts do not permeate across the membrane and are retained in the warmer brine stream membrane thickness hydrophobicity porosity tortuosity md module configurations feed pressure and temperature are the main parameters controlling md performance alkhudhiri et al 2012 conventional md systems require heating of the feed water to achieve the required thermal differential resulting in high energy costs 10 kwh m3 tavakkoli et al 2017 the use of solar energy or waste heat have been explored as a way to lower operation costs in md dongare et al 2017 rice et al 2020 but these options still require heat exchangers large solar exposed surface areas or other capital equipment leveraging the access of co located colder water sources for the md distillate could help meet the required thermal differential this study s goal was to quantify the thermal availability and technical feasibility of using a co located water source as the md draw distillate to treat ro brine a specific case study at the city of scottsdale arizona one of the largest advanced wastewater facilities in the united states was considered where a 20 million gallon per day mgd 90 000 m3 day capacity wastewater facility operates at 8 mgd 36 000 m3 day ro unit with about 80 85 recovery the co located surface water source at the facility originates from the colorado river via the central arizona project cap cap water is already microfiltered and blended with ro permeate on site for stability and corrosion control before water reuse at golf courses or groundwater recharge measured average monthly temperature data from the two waters ro brine and cap were used as feed and distillate in the experiments conducted to estimate the potential monthly fluxes that would be produced by md based on experimental data and previously reported trials of pilot scale md systems the feasibility of using cap water as md distillate to treat ro brine are estimated for a full scale system including an estimation of extracted water volume the net increase in ro recovery and the thermal heat reqirements that would be needed to achieved a specific net recovery year round while leveraging co located temperature gradient 2 materials and methods 2 1 reverse osmosis process and water quality ro brine was obtained from the city of scottsdale az water campus advanced water treatment facility awt alexander et al 2010 lluria 2009 mansfield and nunez 2001 vernon 2000 the awt process includes nitrification denitrification followed by ozonation microfiltration mf ro disinfection and advanced oxidation uv h2o2 treated ro permeate is either used for golf course irrigation or injected into vadose zone wells to supplement groundwater within the basin for potable use the ro unit consists of two ro membrane stages to achieve 85 water recovery seasonally between 1 and 3 mgd 5000 15 000 m3 day of ro brine is produced which is currently discharged to a regional sewer line this discharge option may no longer be available in the near future due to tds and salinity restrictions at the downstream regional wastewater treatment plant because the target sodium concentration in awt treated water is 125 mg l 1 ro permeate is blended with mf treated cap water to increase the sodium concentration prior to discharge to for the golf courses or on site vadose zone injection wells the cap water is also used as water source for a 27 mgd 120 000 m3 day on site drinking water treatment plant at the water campus table 1 summarizes key water quality parameters for the ro brine and cap waters because cap water has a lower temperature than ro brine year round it can be used as the cold water stream in an md system fig 1 2 2 experimental membrane distillation apparatus and membrane distillation operation the experimental set up was prepared to quantify md water fluxes using collected water from the site polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe membranes fglp14250 emd millipore were used in a lab scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd cell fig 2 the md system was composed of a feed circulation system a distillate circulation system and a membrane cell gear pumps delivered the waters to the membrane cell where it flowed in a 1 mm channel on both sides of a flat sheet ptfe membrane pore size 0 22 μm porosity 85 tortuosity around 2 and 150 μm thickness the md cell had an active area of 28 cm2 3 5 cm 8 cm actual ro brine obtained from the reclamation facility was used as the hot feed for all experiments and the co located surface water cap water was the cold distillate the md fluxes were quantified for each month using collected ro brine and cap water operated at the temperature measured in the field for each month each experiment operated for 3 h by recirculating 2 l of feed and 2 l of distillate and maintaining constant temperatures using a chiller or heater experiments were performed for cap water ro brine and ultrapure waters 2 3 estimation of membrane distillation performance at large scale the performance of md modules depends mainly on the temperatures of feed and distillate as the driving force however heat losses along the length of membranes in conventional md modules are considerable deshmukh et al 2018 convective heat and liquid mass transfer across md membranes influence water temperature on both sides of the membrane and decreases the driving force for md water flux qtaishat et al 2008 previous studies evaluated the md feed heat losses to be 10 35 when water contacts the membrane surface due to temperature polarization elmarghany et al 2019 martínez díez and vázquez gonzález 1999 heat loss is higher with lower feed velocities yu et al 2011 or when the feed temperature is below 50 c phattaranawik et al 2003 as it is the case in our study in bench scale experiments temperature polarization effects are often negligible due to the small membrane areas used however in large scale md modules decreasing water flux is observed due to the large amount of energy exchanged inside the membrane modules hitsov et al 2018 song et al 2007 winter et al 2017 as water vapor transfers across the membrane from the hot side to the cold side heat is transferred as well which leads to heat loss this heat loss increases along the membrane length leading to a reduction in the average feed temperature and therefore a reduction in water flux zhang et al 2012 showed a 75 reduction in water flux along a fiber 0 8 m in length for a pilot scale hollow fiber dcmd zhang et al 2012 another study shows a temperature drop of 69 and 82 at a full scale air gap md agmd and dmdc along a 1 5 m length of membrane respectively eykens et al 2017 for both studies flux reduction shows nearly linear relationship with membrane length at fluxes lower than 20 lmh seasonal md fluxes at large scale were estimated based on the experimental data collected as described in section 2 2 using ro brine and cap water as feed and distillate respectively these experimental results were used to predict large scale fluxes based on previously reported pilot scale experimental and modelling data for an hollow fiber dcmd module using a membrane length of 0 733 m zhang et al 2012 the bench scale flux which was measured using a membrane cell with a membrane length of 0 08 m was used as the inlet flux value for large scale modules the bench scale experiments were conducted for flat sheet dcmd as they are readily cleaned and replaced flat sheet dcmd have shown similar flux as hollow fiber dcmd in bench scale zare and kargari 2018 the inlet flux was the highest value in the module and total module flux was normalized to represent the flux reduction in function of module length according to the pilot results zhang et al 2012 two membrane lengths 0 3 m and 0 7 m were used to consider md performance at the large scale facility for the entire ro system including md treatment of brine waste stream we estimate the net ro recovery that can be achieved by adding a md system that leverages the temperature differential of the co located surface water source in addition to achieve a specific net ro recovery the external heat energy required for the system is calculated specific energy consumption sec kwh m3 which is defined as the required energy to produce 1 cubic meter of water to a fraction of latent heat is used to estimate the energy requirement to heat the feed water for specific flux values and is calculated using eq 1 jantaporn et al 2017 1 s e c ρ c p δ t where ρ is feed water density kg m3 c p is specific heat capacity of the feed kj kg c and δ t is the difference between actual and required temperature c 3 results and discussion 3 1 monthly variation in feed water temperature fig 3 plots the monthly mean temperatures of the ro brine and cap water at locations within the awt building household hot water use and warm arizona weather results in wastewater that is consistently warmer than cap surface water ro brine temperature varies seasonally between 25 and 34 c mean 29 c the cap water temperature is always cooler than the ro brine and varies between 12 and 26 c mean 19 c the average temperature differential δt between the two co located water sources is 10 3 5 c with the largest differential in january 13 5 c and smallest in september 7 1 c 3 2 experimental membrane distillation fluxes and water quality first the md apparatus was operated using ro brine and cap waters to establish md system performance as a function of δt the maximum flux 16 l m2 h lmh was achieved at temperatures around 50 c for the feed and 20 c for the distillate md flux values were found to be similar when ultrapure water was used under the same conditions demonstrating there is no short term effect of feed water quality on md flux second md experiments were conducted using the ro brine and cap water adjusted at actual monthly temperatures and δt fig 3 fig 4 dots shows md flux in these experiments varied from 3 lmh in march to 6 lmh in july the annual average flux achieved in the lab md apparatus was 4 0 4 lmh even though the δt in january and july is the same fig 4 the flux in july was 25 larger because md fluxes vary exponentially with feed and distillate temperatures higher flux occurs with higher temperatures md performance was measured using conductivity measurements in the feed and permeate waters after 3 h of operation with the ro brine and cap water conductivity rejection is measured for the percentage of md feed tds that has been removed in the permeate because the feed and permeate in the md apparatus are both recycled the ro brine side become more saline while the cap water side becomes more dilute using actual water with giving average temperatures for each month the md process achieved 97 rejection of conductivity which suggest partial pore wetting rezaei et al 2018 by the ro brine however the salt rejection value was stable over time and is considered acceptable for the current applications of the reclaimed water at this utility moreover recent work has shown that salt rejection can easily be maintained 99 if omniphobic md membranes are used ghaleni et al 2020 3 3 predicted flux for hollow fiber membrane distillation at large scale md fluxes for large scale were estimated for different hollow fiber membrane lengths l 0 3 m and l 0 7 m based on the experimental data conducted in bench scale and on the modeling and experimental data from a previous pilot study zhang et al 2012 flux reductions along the membrane were normalized based on the relationship between flux and the reported membrane length the highest md flux values were measured at the inlet which then decreased along the membrane towards the module outlet md flux values from our bench scale experiments fig 4 were used as inlet flux values for large scale calculations water fluxes were reduced by 75 for l 0 733 m long pilot scale hollow fiber dcmd zhang et al 2012 therefore we applied similar losses in flux for the md modules designed to treat ro brine using co located water for the full scale facility fig 4 shows md fluxes for l 0 7 m fiber length dashed line and for l 0 3 m fiber length solid line for each month the annual average flux is reduced by 73 at l 0 7 m membrane length and was estimated to be 1 11 0 4 lmh with the highest in july of 1 61 lmh and lowest in march of 0 76 lmh for a shorter fiber l 0 3 m the annual average flux was estimated at 2 09 0 8 lmh with highest at 3 lmh in july and lowest at 1 42 in march representing 48 reduction from bench scale flux values 3 4 full scale membrane distillation using co located waters based upon the facility schematic in fig 1 full scale system performance was evaluated using the estimated flux values fig 4 the aims were to 1 determine the required membrane surface area 2 determine net ro water recovery and 3 calculate the additional energy input at the scottsdale water campus the current ro recovery was assumed to be about 85 which is near the actual operation to reduce its brine flow the facility desires to achieve 95 ro md net recovery with the md monthly flux values the net system recovery was calculated for a scenario where an md unit is coupled with the ro system at a fixed md surface area as water is extracted from ro brine md treated water md permeate and cap water is added to the ro permeate and increases the net recovery of the ro unit fig 1 the calculations show a trade off exists between md membrane surface area and ro net recovery fig si 2 a larger md membrane surface area is needed to achieve 95 net recovery the commercial membrane packing density i e the ratio of the membrane surface area to module volume m2 m3 varies for different membrane configurations alkhudhiri and hilal 2018 hollow fiber md modules have the highest packing density 500 9000 m2 m3 garcía fernández et al 2015 a hollow fiber md with packing density of 3000 m2 m3 representing an average packing density for commercial hollow fiber modules was chosen for the study to achieve 95 net total recovery with minimum energy and number of md modules at the full scale facility each md module would need to operate at 100 000 gallons per day 450 m3 day of ro brine fig 5 shows an estimation of net recoveries qnet using estimated flux values from fig 4 for each month with the normalized md area recoveries increase seasonally from 85 to between 86 and 91 the average annual qnet increased from 85 to 87 for a membrane length of l 0 7 m and to 89 for l 0 3 m membrane long while producing more reclaimed water integrating this md design using cooler co located water also reduces the ro brine flow that requires disposal by yearly average of 0 17 0 32 mgd 750 1450 m3 day of course reducing the brine flow has no effect on salt load but the flow reduction would lower the ultimate capacity of zld systems e g evaporators overall the facility can reduce the ro brine by 60 120 million gallons annually 270 000 540 000 m3 by implementing the md system a monthly average qnet was estimated to be as high as 88 for l 0 7 m membrane and 91 for l 0 3 m membrane in july while recoveries are at lowest in march at 86 for l 0 7 m membrane and 87 for l 0 3 m membrane fig 5 however the awt at the scottsdale water campus seeks to achieve a constant 95 qnet for each month therefore additional external thermal energy would be required during specific months the additional energy requirement was calculated using eq 1 and monthly observed water temperatures by normalizing the membrane surface area to ro brine flow 3000 m2 per 100 000 gallons 450 m3 and estimated md fluxes fig 6 shows the average additional energy required for heating md feed to achieve at least 95 qnet for each month for both systems with and without co located water for membrane length of l 0 7 m fig 6a the average annual additional energy for the md system was estimated by eq 1 to be 10 kwh m3 for a single pass 2 md recovery in order to have multiple passes through md and achieve high water recovery md feed water needs to be recirculated lokare et al 2018 swaminathan and lienhard 2018 the limitation to leverage the natural thermal differences for md system is that recycled feed needs to be maintained at the same temperature as the influent ro brine water the feed loses some heat in each pass due to evaporation by using an external heat source e g electrical solar driven or waste heat for this facility in the arid southwestern usa there is excess waste heat from sources such as mf and ro pumps building heating and cooling systems that could be used to reduce heating costs to achieve a desired recovery for md feed water needs to be recycled and reheated in each pass lokare et al 2018 recirculation ratio for md feed depends on a single pass recovery and the overall recovery needed higher flux means lower recirculation ratio after calculating recycle rations for each month an average additional energy of 290 kwh m3 is needed for a md system that has access to a co located water source to achieve 95 overall recovery for ro md this was 15 lower than an md system without co located water annual average of 350 kwh m3 to heat the feed water the additional energy requirement is lower for shorter membrane l 0 3m due to lower heat losses which results in higher flux and lower recycle ratio needed the total additional energy was estimated by eq 1 to be 250 kwh m3 representing about 25 lower energy requirement than md without co located waters fig 6b fig 7 a shows the average annual energy cost needed to heat the md feed water with membrane length of l 0 7 m to achieve different qnet at a facility for treating 1 m3 of ro brine assuming a thermal energy cost of 0 0105 per kwh steam cost 7 1000kg and converted to latent heat kwh al obaidani et al 2008 kesieme et al 2013 the facility could achieve 87 5 qnet with an average heating cost of 1 00 m3 of ro brine and could achieve 95 qnet with 3 13 m3 for a membrane with l 0 3 m length the facility could achieve at least 87 5 qnet at 0 87 m3 for each month and could achieve 95 qnet with 2 63 m3 fig 7b the alternative or competitive technology to the md approach involves adding a 3rd stage ro unit to treat the 2nd stage ro brine fig si 3 the average energy of a 3rd stage ro unit for treating brine approaches 6 kwh m3 panagopoulos et al 2019 assuming an electrical energy cost of 0 13 kwh the energy cost of operating an additional ro stage approaches 0 75 m3 3 00 1000 gallon md operational costs vary depending upon how heat recovery is implemented ranging from 0 43 m3 to 1 17 m3 for md al obaidani et al 2008 kesieme et al 2013 song and liming 2009 thus achieving 95 overall recovery via 3rd stage ro could have lower energy operating costs than md even when using co located water unless another source of low cost energy such as sunlight or waste heat can be utilized by the md however achieving 95 overall recovery via 3rd stage ro requires 60 recovery from the saline wastewater brine which will undoubtedly result in organic inorganic or biofouling operational issues and associated costs in the concentrated saline solution in the 3rd stage ro module md capital costs are lower than ro costs the capital costs of ro ranges from 1190 m3 day to 1313 m3 day for large desalination plants ettouney et al 2002 song and liming 2009 a recent study showed the ro capital cost to be as low as 720 m3 day with enhanced recovery to treat brackish water tds 7 500 tarquin et al 2020 but did not achieve 95 overall water recovery md capital costs range from 911 1131 m3 day al obaidani et al 2008 kesieme et al 2013 song and liming 2009 thus the total costs of md and leveraging natural temperature differences between ro brine and local water sources can achieve 95 net water recovery lower operational cost of md treatment siginficantly when local low grade waste heat is avaialable be less prone to scaling and fouling than 3rd stage ro and make md a feasible and cost effective technology to treat inland ro brine 4 conclusion ro membranes produce highly concentrated waste streams brine as a result of the separation process ro brine handling is a growing concern especially for inland communities where disposal is a major challenge an md using a relatively cold co located water source as the md distillate was investigated

17713,biofilm start up is a critical and time consuming process in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs with the procedure beginning with bacteria being statically bound on surfaces studies addressing this critical process have mainly focused on constructing models based on single strains although consideration of the unstable adhesion process of structured bacterial communities remains underexplored in this study impedance based real time cell analysis rtca was employed to quantitatively characterize the unstable adhesion process of structured bacterial communities collected from the aerobic tanks of eight full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps the unstable adhesion time ranged from 8 85 1 53 h to 17 06 0 64 h indicating significant differences in bacterial colonization properties using principal components analysis pca na k and proteins were found to significantly influence the biofilm unstable adhesion process furthermore the differences in unstable adhesion times were closely related to the abundance of the most abundant operational taxonomic units otus the dominant otus mainly belonged to aeromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae with 73 found to be negatively corelated with unstable adhesion time furthermore bacterial assembly during the initial adhesion phase was driven by bacterial interactions and key otus exhibiting maximum connectivity in phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens analysis of pmens indicated that bacterial cooperation was a dominant factor in the initial adhesion which may involve bacterial co colonization co aggregation and communication considering keystone taxa were not identified otus with max connectivity in pmens were considered as key species although these key species play important roles in the connection of networks their relative abundances were low and no significant relationships were observed with the unstable adhesion time overall unstable adhesion in mbbrs is regulated by the dominant bacterial species and the alleviation of environmental variables by repulsive forces providing potential strategies of dosing quorum sensing signals and key cations at the initial adhesion phase in reactors to facilitate initial biofilm formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords unstable adhesion rtca community composition bacterial assembly 1 introduction biofilm based processes such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs have already been widely used in full scale wastewater treatment plants worldwide grandclément et al 2017 rapid start up of biofilm processes is desirable to obtain steady effluent quality and to reduce operating costs wang et al 2020b biofilm development is generally accomplished through three successive stages that include initial adhesion biofilm maturation and detachment processes particularly the behavior of individual bacterium that contact instantaneously with carriers and subsequently detach was defined as reversible adhesion matar et al 2017 which initiates biofilm formation bacterial adhesion at the group level during this initial phase is highly unstable and referred to as the unstable adhesion process wang et al 2020b the mechanism of instability has been assessed in early studies in terms of physicochemical aspects based on the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek dlvo theory busscher and weerkamp 1987 meinders et al 1995 however the transition time has received comparatively little attention in previous studies due to the limitations of analytical methods in the assessment of the immediacy of unstable adhesion hooshangi and bentley 2008 palmer et al 2007 importantly during the start up period inoculated sludge is always discharged within 24 h to ensure microorganisms have adequately adhered to carriers zhu et al 2015 with the specific time selected according to experience potentially neglecting the required unstable adhesion time during this process recently lee et al 2018 identified the unstable adhesion phase of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proposed a multigenerational surface adaptation mechanism mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate and type iv pili the study clarified the unstable adhesion process at the group level using in situ and nondestructive methods revealing that this critical phase involves not only physicochemical interactions but also biological mechanisms that have not been investigated to date the initial bacterial adhesion process is highly regulated by multifaceted factors involving surface properties characteristics of the medium hydraulic condition and microbes themselves berne et al 2018 hall stoodley et al 2004 wang et al 2018 it has been extensively reported that the efficiency of bacterial adhesion relies on the physicochemical properties of surfaces such as surface charge hydrophobicity roughness and micro topography palmer et al 2007 ren et al 2018 in addition the aqueous environment also regulates the initial adhesion process soluble macromolecules in wastewater such as proteins saccharides and lipids could modify surface properties following absorption and serve as a conditioning layer to promote bacterial adhesion garrett et al 2008 huang et al 2018 ionic strength affects the initial adhesion rate as cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 contribute to neutralizing the bacterial electrical double layer and reducing electrostatic repulsion he et al 2016 janjaroen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 meanwhile ca2 and mg2 enhance bacterial adhesion by regulating protein expression and polysaccharide synthesis in extracellular polymeric substances eps he et al 2016 overall the effects of various environmental variables on the bacterial adhesion process have been widely investigated adhesion is a tool for bacterial competition within microbial communities schluter et al 2015 while adhesion characteristics vary among different bacterial species because of their surface properties e g motility appendages surface receptor and ligand and adaptive mechanisms for surface adhesion wong et al 2017 these aspects complicate the mechanism of bacterial assembly in multiple species communities in addition roles for the key species and interspecies interactions in bacterial assembly and community organization have been established in studies using the synthesis of four species biofilms liu et al 2017b røder et al 2019 to better understand bacterial assembly within multispecies biofilms high throughput sequencing analysis has been widely used to investigate biofilm community composition in addition network analyses based approaches have been recently applied to dissect bacterial interactions in relatively mature and stable biofilms assessing both cooperation and competition berry and widder 2014 hibbing et al 2010 moreover topology based analysis of networks has been used to identify the keystone microbial groups in biofilms deng et al 2012 which may provide valuable insights into bacterial assembly in the initial biofilm adhesion process in this study an impedance based real time cell analyzer rtca was used to characterize the unstable adhesion processes in mixed bacterial communities which were collected from aerobic tanks of eight full scale wastewater treatment plants principal components analysis pca was used to explore the significant factors regulating initial adhesion in bacterial

activated sludge was collected from the aerobic tanks of eight wastewater treatment plants wwtps encoded as dc xm cz jxz nb cq sh and sjz with detailed information provided in table s1 sludge samples were manually homogenized with tissue grinding tubes sangon biotech shanghai co shanghai china wang et al 2018 subsequently the homogenized sludge was filtered through 10 μm filters and 0 22 μm filters anpel laboratory technologies shanghai inc shanghai china to obtain bacterial suspensions and sterile wastewater respectively wang et al 2018 the bacterial suspension was used as a bacterial resource for experiments prior to use all pretreated samples were temporarily stored in sterile vials at 4 c 2 2 rtca assays the early adhesion process of wastewater biofilms was monitored via impedance based rtca dp acea biosciences usa the core component of the rtca device is a polyethylene terephthalate based microtiter e plate covered by microelectrodes the contact angle of e plate surfaces with water was identified as 77 4 0 8 with a surface zeta potential of 62 4 1 6 mv these properties are similar with those of widely used high density polyethylene biocarriers wang et al 2018 bacteria adhering to the bottom of the e plate contributed to the increase in impedance and hence the initial bacterial adhesion phase was quantified first 50 μl of the sterile wastewater filtered through 0 22 μm filters was pre warmed to 25 c and added to the wells of the e plate which was positioned in the plate holder in a 25 c incubator to measure the impedance background of wastewater subsequently 150 μl of the bacterial culture suspension optical density of 600 nm 0 05 was added to wells with measurements performed automatically every 5 min and controlled using rtca software v 2 1 2 acea biosciences usa wang et al 2020b generally the initial adhesion phase refers to the process in which bacteria first contact the nascent surface and adapt to it lee et al 2018 according to previous studies the time used for bacteria to adapt the new microenvironment was within 24 h lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020b moreover during the mbbr start up period in practice nutrients are added to the reactor in an initial one off dosing and inoculated sludge is usually discharged within 24 h to ensure adequate contact between microorganisms and biocarriers gu et al 2018 liu et al 2017a zhu et al 2015 thus the experimental period in this study was set at 24 h each sample was assessed in triplicate and all steps were performed under sterile conditions 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing dna was extracted from microbes in suspension and biofilms adhering for 24 h using an e z n a mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek inc usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna quality and concentration were assessed by 2 5 agarose gel electrophoresis and a qubit 3 0 fluorometer q32866 thermo fisher scientific usa the extracted dna was amplified by pcr using the universal

initial denaturation at 94 c for 3 min followed by 5 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 45 c for 20 s and 65 c for 30 s and then 20 cycles of 94 c for 20 s 55 c for 20 s and 72 c for 30 s followed by extension at 72 c for 5 min subsequently pcr products from the first amplification and the bridge pcr primer were used for the second round 95 c for 3 min 5 cycles of 94 c for 20 s 55 c for 20 s 72 c for 30 s and 72 c for 5 min the pcr products were determined by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using magicpure size selection dna beads transgen biotech china followed by quantification using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa finally 10 ng 20 pm of pcr products were analyzed using the illumina miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai co china raw sequencing data was filtered using sickle and mothur software operational taxonomic units otus were determined at a 97 similarity level using uparse software and the taxon of filtered sequences were assigned by the ribosomal database project rdp classifier 2 4 physico chemical analyses suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm filters prior to physico chemical analyses the ph and conductivity of samples were determined using an electrochemistry meter orion versa star thermo fisher scientific usa total organic carbon toc was detected using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany the content of protein pn was determined by the bca assay method using bovine serum albumin v900933 sigma aldrich germany as the standard bassin et al 2012 ras et al 2008 the content of polysaccharide ps was quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose v900392 sigma aldrich germany used as the standard wang et al 2018 the humic acid ha content was measured using the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 with humic acid 53680 sigma aldrich germany used as the standard metal element contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 5300dv perkinelmer usa for each parameter each sample was measured in triplicate 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach the pmen of the microbial communities in suspension and in biofilms adhering for 24 h was constructed through random matrix theory rmt based methods developed by deng et al 2012 the relative abundance of otus was used to build a correlation matrix pairwise otu associations were measured by pearson correlation analysis and were used to obtain the similarity matrix which was then converted to the adjacency matrix using a threshold the threshold for defining the network structure was determined by an rmt based approach which could identify the threshold value automatically based on the data structure itself accordingly an objective pmen elucidating the interactions in microbial communities was drawn networks of biofilm communities of nb cq sh and sjz were labelled as nb b cq b sh b and sjz b respectively while for bacterial suspensions from these four wwtps they were named as nb s cq s sh s and sjz s respectively for each network identified 100 randomly rewired networks were generated via the maslov sneppen procedure maslov and sneppen 2002 which keeps the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewires the positions of all links in pmens furthermore global network topological properties were analyzed and the small world coefficient σ was calculated to characterize the small world property of the networks telesford et al 2011 module separation of pmens was performed based on the fast greedy modularity optimization method xu et al 2019a meanwhile the within module connectivity z and among modules connectivity c parameters were calculated to identify the keystone taxa gephi v 0 9 2 software webatlas france was used for network visualization wang et al 2020a 2 6 data analysis according to the manufacturer s instructions the impedance data monitored via rtca was expressed as cell index ci representing the impedance caused by adhering bacteria ci was derived by equation 1 and its mean value mean standard deviation sd was automatically calculated by the supporting software rtca 2 1 2 acea biosciences usa 1 c i z n z b 15 where zn represents the total impedance caused by bacteria attached on the bottom of wells and the wastewater solution and zb is the background impedance of wastewater ferrer et al 2017 statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss 20 0 ibm usa the principal components analysis pca was performed using canoco 5 0 software scientiapro hungary wang et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 unstable adhesion process during initial biofilm formation the initial adhesion process of wastewater biofilms was monitored by impedance based rtca at 5 min intervals for 24 h variation in biomass on electrode covered surfaces of the e plate alter the detected impedance and lead to changes in ci values as presented in fig 1 the biomass for all wwtps continuously increases after 18 h before this point varying degrees of fluctuation were observed defined in this study as the period of unstable adhesion it is of note that unstable adhesion herein emphasizes the unstable change of adhered biomass compared with the continuous increase observed in the later period according to the duration of the unstable adhesion phase the wwtps were ranked in the sequence of cq nb sjz dc jxz xm sh cz corresponding to 17 06 0 64 16 89 0 18 16 23 0 11 14 61 0 29 13 48 0 35 13 02 0 30 9 77 0 06 and 8 85 1 53 h respectively the unstable adhesion phase of cz and sh were shorter than that of other wwtps and were characterized by a sharp increase in biomass growth in the first 3 h followed by a peak biomass concentration similarly dc cq and nb also exhibited a rapid initial increase in biomass although they underwent more fluctuations resulting in longer unstable adhesion times in contrast the instability of xm was relatively poor corresponding to the rapid emergence of continually increasing biomass to explain the differences in bacterial adhesion characteristics of different wwtp samples pca was conducted based on the physicochemical characteristics of aqueous environments of all wwtps fig 2 and table s2 the unstable adhesion time was negatively correlated with the concentrations of na and k but positively correlated with pn which may explain the short unstable adhesion time of cz 8 85 1 53 h and the relatively long unstable adhesion time of dc 14 61 0 29 h respectively in addition the unstable adhesion time also exhibited a negative relationship with mg2 and si2 while ca2 and mn2 slightly positively correlated with it overall cations in surrounding environment were conducive to bacterial adhesion by contrast conductivity and ps in the bulk liquid phase were almost perpendicular to the unstable adhesion time furthermore the distance between nb and sh was relatively short in the pca biplot indicating the two wwtps possessed similar physicochemical characteristics while the unstable adhesion time of nb 16 89 0 18 h was 1 74 fold greater than that of sh 9 73 0 06 h in contrast although dc cq and sjz were separated from each other they had a similar unstable adhesion time 17 06 0 64 16 23 0 11 and 14 61 0 29 h the results shown in fig 2 indicate that the bacterial unstable adhesion process was determined by the environmental variables na k and pn previous studies have reported that ion strength and macromolecular components in sludge can affect the early biofilm development process janjaroen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 high concentrations of cations such as na and k contribute to better hydrophilicity of surfaces and alleviate the repulsive force between microorganisms and surfaces wang et al 2018 which may contribute to the rapid adhesion of cz in the first hour as well as the shortest unstable adhesion time it has been reported that macromolecular substances such as pns are generally conducive to the establishment of a conditioning layer on the surface which may improve bacterial adhesion huang et al 2018 zobell 1943 and shorten the unstable adhesion time however in the present study a positive relationship was found between pn and the unstable adhesion time indicating that high concentrations of pn may hinder bacterial adhesion and prolong the unstable adhesion process this may be explained by previously reported literature showing that pn in the bulk liquid phase may be compete for surface binding sites and therefore inhibit bacterial adhesion palmer et al 2007 therefore the unstable adhesion of nb and dc with high concentrations of pns lasted for relatively long time periods 16 89 0 18 and 14 61 0 29 h moreover no significant effect of ps was found in this study which may be the combined result of multiple factors in complex wastewater environments it is of note the differences in unstable adhesion time between nb and sh as well as the similarity in dc cq and sjz could not be well explained by these environment variables bacterial adhesion is affected by the combined effects of surface properties local environmental factors and bacterial properties garrett et al 2008 whereas the surface used in this study was the same bacterial community composition must be analyzed for further understanding of initial adhesion behaviors 3 2 bacterial community composition during the unstable adhesion process the majority of wwtp samples were clustered together in pca plots based on microbial abundance at the class level fig 3 a but were separated at the genus level fig 3b as shown in fig 3b pc1 and pc2 together accounted for 36 06 of the total variance cq and sjz cz xm and sh dc and jxz were clustered together indicating similarity in their community composition pca of the 5 most abundant otus in each wwtps showed that axis1 and axis2 accounted for 42 09 and 29 24 of the total variance respectively with the two axes together explaining 71 33 of the total variance fig 4 it is of note dc cq and sjz were clustered in the pca of the 5 most abundant otus fig 4 resulting in similar unstable adhesion times 17 06 0 64 16 23 0 11 and 14 61 0 29 h even though their environmental variables showed significant differences fig 2 furthermore physicochemical characteristics of nb and sh were similar fig 2 although the community compositions of the two plants exhibited significant differences figs 3b and 4 resulting in differences in the unstable adhesion time fig 1 in conclusion compared with environmental factors the bacterial community composition especially the top 5 most abundant taxa could better explain the different unstable adhesion times observed in various wwtps suggesting the importance of dominant populations in determining the bacterial adhesion process assessment of the 5 most abundant otus in each collection found that 17 otus were affiliated with proteobacteria including 11 otus otu2 3 6 7 9 12 18 and 19 in the family enterobacteriaceae and 6 otus otu1 4 5 8 14 and 23 belonging to aeromonas in the family aeromonadaceae table s3 5 otus were affiliated with firmicutes including otu16 22 and 40 belonging to lactobacillales otu13 granulicatella and otu50 clostridium fig 4 demonstrates that the majority of the 5 most abundant taxa 16 otus were negatively corelated with the unstable adhesion time indicating that they promote firm adhesion the 16 otus were otu 3 7 9 10 12 16 18 19 21 23 40 50 with specific information listed in table s3 biofilm bacteria capable of secreting eps possess a greater ability to adhere to surfaces schluter et al 2015 as eps producers proteobacteria and firmicutes are commonly abundant in biofilms calderon et al 2012 lv et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 as shown by the results of the present study fig s1 in particular members of aeromonadaceae such as aeromonas harbor the valuable capability to establish biofilms via cell cell signaling talagrand reboul et al 2017 contributing to an increase in their abundance in the early adhesion process enterobacter also possess a highly developed quorum sensing system mediated by multiple signaling molecules rezzonico et al 2012 and they are prone to colonize surfaces using their flagella to reinforce adhesion de maayer and cowan 2016 previous studies have also reported that the potential aerobic denitrifiers aeromonas and enterobacter tian et al 2015 were found to be dominant in the start up phase of a modified packed bed biofilm reactor pbbr allodi et al 2016 fig 3c and d illustrate the community composition in the bulk liquid and biofilms adhered for 24 h in each wwtp vagococcus was the most dominant genus in the bulk liquid of xm while enterobacter was dominant in seven other wwtp samples fig 3c after adhering for 24 h the abundance of enterobacter decreased in jxz nb cq sh and sjz while aeromonas became the dominant genus fig 3d overall enterobacter and aeromonas dominated the bulk liquid and biofilms respectively fig 3 and fig s1 bacteroidetes contribute to maintaining the stability of sludge zhu et al 2015 and hence dominated the community in bulk liquid while being greatly reduced in biofilms fig s1 furthermore the dominant bacteria were commonly found to be capable of qs indicating the potential importance of bacterial communication in biofilm initiation in addition to bacteria protozoa and fungi are also major members of biofilm communities generally protozoa usually play an important role in mature biofilms affecting the biofilm structure via grazing and the predation of bacteria aybar et al 2019 raghupathi et al 2018 fungi contribute to the functionality of multilayer biofilms due to their high rates of degradation of organic cortés lorenzo et al 2016 huang et al 2019 in the early process of biofilm formation in the present study only the bacterial populations in communities were investigated however some previous studies have reported that protozoa and fungi could also influence the initial stages of biofilm development for instance adding flagellates was found to initially disturb biofilm formation although in later stages they stimulated biofilm growth in 48 h incubations rychert and neu 2010 yeasts may compete with bacteria for adhesion sites due to their strong adhesion capability liébana et al 2015 accordingly protozoan and fungal communities should be considered in future studies to fully understand the complexity of microbial interactions during initial biofilm formation 3 3 network topology features of bacterial communities rmt based networks were established to analyze population interactions in bulk liquid and biofilm communities from nb cq sh and sjz fig 5 with nodes representing bacterial otus and edges representing correlations between pairwise otus the major topological properties the average path distance clustering coefficients and modularity of these networks were significantly higher than those of the corresponding random networks table s4 thus the networks were non random xu et al 2019b the small world coefficients σ of all networks were higher than 1 table s5 which strongly indicates that the pmens of bacterial communities possessed small world and modular structures zhou et al 2010 in addition there was no significant difference in the clustering coefficients of all networks indicating the similarities in module structures present in pmens deng et al 2012 particularly in comparison with nb sh and sjz the pmens in both bacteria and biofilms from cq possessed significantly higher connectivity and shorter geodesic distances this indicates that the community structures were much more complex and network interactions were more intense in the bacterial community of cq moreover modularity in the biofilm of cq was relatively lower than the other samples indicating niche overlap or low diversity of functional units li et al 2020 compared with previously reported systems imposed with specific conditions wang et al 2020a xu et al 2019b the connectivity was relatively higher in the present study higher connectivity represents higher complexity within a network marioosvin and anamari 2001 and high complexity is considered to indicate high stability in bacterial communities mougi and kondoh 2012 accordingly although the adhesion behaviors of individual bacteria are dynamic during the unstable adhesion process bacterial community structures in both suspensions and biofilms are highly stable ensuring the initiation of biofilm formation in addition the positive associations in pmens indicate the occurrence of prevalent mutualism or commensalism xu et al 2019a in this study predominantly positive interactions table s6 emphasize the importance of cooperative behaviors such as bacterial co colonization and co aggregation within biofilm communities during the initial adhesion process faust and raes 2012 hibbing et al 2010 which could be conducive to the formation of biofilms in particular bacterial communities of cq exhibited higher complexity and more intense interactions while the unstable adhesion phase was relatively time consuming compared to the other three wwtp samples it is of note that in comparison with the bacterial suspension community the negative interactions in the biofilm community of cq were increased by 17 38 table s6 indicating that bacterial competition was strengthened this may result in the relatively long duration of the unstable adhesion phase of cq 17 06 0 64 h to identify the topological roles of otus in pmens a z c plot based on within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity ci was constructed fig 6 according to the values of z and c otus can be classified into the roles of module hubs peripherals connectors and network hubs wu et al 2016 peripherals with low z and c values represent specialists in the microbial community while network hubs with both high z and c values indicate supergeneralists module hubs with a high z value are highly connected in their own modules while connectors with a high c value have high links among various modules both representing the generalists in the community connectors module hubs and network hubs are considered to be keystone taxa in topological networks xu et al 2019a which are important for shaping the community structure and maintaining community function martín gonzález et al 2010 xu et al 2019b in this study all of the otus in z c plots were classified as peripherals and no keystone taxa were identified however otus with max degree i e connectivity in each community were identified through global network properties analysis table s5 these nodes with high connectivity exhibit strong interactions with others and thus may play important roles in connecting communities during the initial adhesion process in biofilm communities five otus out 6 9 11 29 and 31 belonged to the f enterobacteriaceae of the phylum proteobacteria otu16 out165 and otu200 were identified as o lactobacillales in firmicutes f moraxellaceae in proteobacteria and f comamonadaceae in proteobacteria respectively table s3 members of f enterobacteriaceae could use multiple signaling molecules involving n acyl homoserine lactones autoinducer 2 autoinducer 3 peptides and indole to accomplish bacterial communication rezzonico et al 2012 some populations of f moraxellaceae possess the ability to colonize at a high rate pettersson et al 1998 most members of f comamonadaceae have high motility mediated by a single polar flagellum bipolar tufts of one to five flagella or degenerate peritrichous flagella willems et al 1991 these properties are conducive for bacterial adhesion to carriers in addition previous studies have reported that the abundances of keystone taxa are generally poor berry and widder 2014 xu et al 2019a in this study otus with max degree were also detected as low abundance species accounting for between 0 02 and 6 78 of communities in biofilms collected from various wwtps table s7 furthermore the abundances of these otus did not present a significant relationship with the unstable adhesion time p 0 05 which could be explained by the fact that abundance is not related to taxon importance lupatini et al 2014 3 4 implications investigations of the unstable adhesion phase of biofilm formation processes have been limited in the past due to a lack of suitable methods torresi et al 2017 in this study the initial adhesion phase of various sources of mixed bacteria were identified using in situ and nondestructive rtca with the unstable adhesion time defined based on biomass at the group level herein hydrodynamics was not considered although this could be significant in practice the effect of shear stress on bacterial adhesion has been investigated in a previous study demonstrating that shear forces derived from orbital shaking improved the reversibility of bacterial adhesion and prolonged the unstable adhesion time wang et al 2020b meanwhile it could affect bacterial proliferation rate on surfaces and further lead to different impedance wang et al 2020b to reduce the complexity and emphasize on the adhesion behaviors of bacteria themselves hydrodynamics was not included in this paper so that the experiment could be operated in well controlled conditions in the wastewater treatment process rapid biofilm formation is generally desirable for the start up of biofilm based processes wang et al 2018 unstable adhesion time may serve as a potential indicator of whether the operation is conducive to biofilm formation in addition this study showed that the unstable adhesion phase was highly correlated with the bacterial community itself especially the dominant population top 5 most abundant taxa interestingly the critical population conducive to shortening unstable adhesion time was identified as being qs related bacteria therefore bacterial communication appears to be of high importance in the initial adhesion phase wang et al 2019 implying a potential strategy for the regulation of bacterial qs to facilitate biofilm formation in wastewater treatment processes more specifically adding exogenous qs signals in stable and mature biofilm is a common way to improve biofilm activity and reactor performance hu et al 2016 while the effect of qs on the initial adhesion of bacteria in real wastewater is limited wang et al 2020c according to the results of the present study it can be reasonably speculated that qs signal dosing in the initial adhesion phase in reactors may effectively accelerate the reactor start up process this supports previous findings that the addition of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls during the start up phase significantly promoted the yield of dense and thick biofilms wang et al 2020c furthermore the concentration of cations was found be correlated to the unstable adhesion time although its specific effects require further investigation accordingly relevant strategies for controlling the concentration of key ions may be useful in the acceleration of bacterial adhesion bacterial communities within biofilms are not randomly assembled but consist of a core microbiome matar et al 2017 previous studies have reported that key species with low abundances regulated the community composition in four species biofilms liu et al 2017a b røder et al 2019 in this study although no keystone taxa were identified otus with max connectivity in each pmen were considered as the key population due to their roles in connecting networks and were also detected as low abundance populations however their abundance does not appear to be related to the unstable adhesion time in contrast the most abundant otus accounted for the differences in unstable adhesion time in various wwtps therefore it could be speculated that the development of bacterial adhesion is attributed to the abundant species while the key low abundance species are responsible for controlling the community structure which emphasizes the importance of bacterial cooperation in communities to further explore bacterial cooperative behaviors in the unstable adhesion phase the design and analysis of biofilms involving different combinations of species is recommended for comprehensive analysis of bacterial cooperation 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of environmental factors and bacterial communities on bacterial assembly mechanisms during the unstable adhesion phase the major conclusions are as follows the unstable adhesion time of various sources of bacteria exhibited significant differences ranging from 8 85 1 53 h to 17 06 0 64 h na k and proteins were the key environmental variables affecting unstable adhesion time high concentrations of na and k were found to be conducive to forming stable adhesion although a high concentration of protein in sludge may result in long unstable adhesion times the difference in unstable adhesion time in various wwtps could be well explained by the 5 most abundant otus with community composition more important in dictating unstable adhesion time than environmental factors most of the dominant population were found to be negatively corelated with unstable adhesion time bacterial assembly during the unstable adhesion process was investigated population interactions within the biofilm community were dominantly positive involving co colonization and co aggregation as well as bacterial communication eight otus with max connectivity were present at low abundances with their relative abundance not exhibiting a significant relationship with the unstable adhesion time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17713,biofilm start up is a critical and time consuming process in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs with the procedure beginning with bacteria being statically bound on surfaces studies addressing this critical process have mainly focused on constructing models based on single strains although consideration of the unstable adhesion process of structured bacterial communities remains underexplored in this study impedance based real time cell analysis rtca was employed to quantitatively characterize the unstable adhesion process of structured bacterial communities collected from the aerobic tanks of eight full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps the unstable adhesion time ranged from 8 85 1 53 h to 17 06 0 64 h indicating significant differences in bacterial colonization properties using principal components analysis pca na k and proteins were found to significantly influence the biofilm unstable adhesion process furthermore the differences in unstable adhesion times were closely related to the abundance of the most abundant operational taxonomic units otus the dominant otus mainly belonged to aeromonadaceae and enterobacteriaceae with 73 found to be negatively corelated with unstable adhesion time furthermore bacterial assembly during the initial adhesion phase was driven by bacterial interactions and key otus exhibiting maximum connectivity in phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens analysis of pmens indicated that bacterial cooperation was a dominant factor in the initial adhesion which may involve bacterial co colonization co aggregation and communication considering keystone taxa were not identified otus with max connectivity in pmens were considered as key species although these key species play important roles in the connection of networks their relative abundances were low and no significant relationships were observed with the unstable adhesion time overall unstable adhesion in mbbrs is regulated by the dominant bacterial species and the alleviation of environmental variables by repulsive forces providing potential strategies of dosing quorum sensing signals and key cations at the initial adhesion phase in reactors to facilitate initial biofilm formation graphical abstract image 1 keywords unstable adhesion rtca community composition bacterial assembly 1 introduction biofilm based processes such as moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs have already been widely used in full scale wastewater treatment plants worldwide grandclément et al 2017 rapid start up of biofilm processes is desirable to obtain steady effluent quality and to reduce operating costs wang et al 2020b biofilm development is generally accomplished through three successive stages that include initial adhesion biofilm maturation and detachment processes particularly the behavior of individual bacterium that contact instantaneously with carriers and subsequently detach was defined as reversible adhesion matar et al 2017 which initiates biofilm formation bacterial adhesion at the group level during this initial phase is highly unstable and referred to as the unstable adhesion process wang et al 2020b the mechanism of instability has been assessed in early studies in terms of physicochemical aspects based on the derjaguine landaue verweye overbeek dlvo theory busscher and weerkamp 1987 meinders et al 1995 however the transition time has received comparatively little attention in previous studies due to the limitations of analytical methods in the assessment of the immediacy of unstable adhesion hooshangi and bentley 2008 palmer et al 2007 importantly during the start up period inoculated sludge is always discharged within 24 h to ensure microorganisms have adequately adhered to carriers zhu et al 2015 with the specific time selected according to experience potentially neglecting the required unstable adhesion time during this process recently lee et al 2018 identified the unstable adhesion phase of pseudomonas aeruginosa and proposed a multigenerational surface adaptation mechanism mediated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate and type iv pili the study clarified the unstable adhesion process at the group level using in situ and nondestructive methods revealing that this critical phase involves not only physicochemical interactions but also biological mechanisms that have not been investigated to date the initial bacterial adhesion process is highly regulated by multifaceted factors involving surface properties characteristics of the medium hydraulic condition and microbes themselves berne et al 2018 hall stoodley et al 2004 wang et al 2018 it has been extensively reported that the efficiency of bacterial adhesion relies on the physicochemical properties of surfaces such as surface charge hydrophobicity roughness and micro topography palmer et al 2007 ren et al 2018 in addition the aqueous environment also regulates the initial adhesion process soluble macromolecules in wastewater such as proteins saccharides and lipids could modify surface properties following absorption and serve as a conditioning layer to promote bacterial adhesion garrett et al 2008 huang et al 2018 ionic strength affects the initial adhesion rate as cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 contribute to neutralizing the bacterial electrical double layer and reducing electrostatic repulsion he et al 2016 janjaroen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 meanwhile ca2 and mg2 enhance bacterial adhesion by regulating protein expression and polysaccharide synthesis in extracellular polymeric substances eps he et al 2016 overall the effects of various environmental variables on the bacterial adhesion process have been widely investigated adhesion is a tool for bacterial competition within microbial communities schluter et al 2015 while adhesion characteristics vary among different bacterial species because of their surface properties e g motility appendages surface receptor and ligand and adaptive mechanisms for surface adhesion wong et al 2017 these aspects complicate the mechanism of bacterial assembly in multiple species communities in addition roles for the key species and interspecies interactions in bacterial assembly and community organization have been established in studies using the synthesis of four species biofilms liu et al 2017b røder et al 2019 to better understand bacterial assembly within multispecies biofilms high throughput sequencing analysis has been widely used to investigate biofilm community composition in addition network analyses based approaches have been recently applied to dissect bacterial interactions in relatively mature and stable biofilms assessing both cooperation and competition berry and widder 2014 hibbing et al 2010 moreover topology based analysis of networks has been used to identify the keystone microbial groups in biofilms deng et al 2012 which may provide valuable insights into bacterial assembly in the initial biofilm adhesion process in this study an impedance based real time cell analyzer rtca was used to characterize the unstable adhesion processes in mixed bacterial communities which were collected from aerobic tanks of eight full scale wastewater treatment plants principal components analysis pca was used to explore the significant factors regulating initial adhesion in bacterial

surfaces with water was identified as 77 4 0 8 with a surface zeta potential of 62 4 1 6 mv these properties are similar with those of widely used high density polyethylene biocarriers wang et al 2018 bacteria adhering to the bottom of the e plate contributed to the increase in impedance and hence the initial bacterial adhesion phase was quantified first 50 μl of the sterile wastewater filtered through 0 22 μm filters was pre warmed to 25 c and added to the wells of the e plate which was positioned in the plate holder in a 25 c incubator to measure the impedance background of wastewater subsequently 150 μl of the bacterial culture suspension optical density of 600 nm 0 05 was added to wells with measurements performed automatically every 5 min and controlled using rtca software v 2 1 2 acea biosciences usa wang et al 2020b generally the initial adhesion phase refers to the process in which bacteria first contact the nascent surface and adapt to it lee et al 2018 according to previous studies the time used for bacteria to adapt the new microenvironment was within 24 h lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020b moreover during the mbbr start up period in practice nutrients are added to the reactor in an initial one off dosing and inoculated sludge is usually discharged within 24 h to ensure adequate contact between microorganisms and biocarriers gu et al 2018 liu et al 2017a zhu et al 2015 thus the experimental period in this study was set at 24 h each sample was assessed in triplicate and all steps were performed under sterile conditions 2 3 dna extraction pcr amplification and sequencing dna was extracted from microbes in suspension and biofilms adhering for 24 h using an e z n a mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek inc usa following the manufacturer s instructions dna quality and concentration were assessed by 2 5 agarose gel electrophoresis and a qubit 3 0 fluorometer q32866 thermo fisher scientific usa the extracted dna was amplified by pcr using the universal primers 341f 5 cctacgggnggcwgcag 3 and 805r 5 gactachvgggtatctaatcc 3 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the 16s rrna gene deng et al 2019 the pcr mixture contained 15 μl of 2 taq master mix 1 μl of bar pcr primer 341f 10 μm 1 μl of primer 805r 10 μm 10 20 ng of genomic dna and was diluted with ultrapure water to 30 ml pcr reactions were performed using a thermal cycler t100 bio rad usa as follows initial denaturation at 94 c for 3 min followed by 5 cycles of 94 c for 30 s 45 c for 20 s and 65 c for 30 s and then 20 cycles of 94 c for 20 s 55 c for 20 s and 72 c for 30 s followed by extension at 72 c for 5 min subsequently pcr products from the first amplification and the bridge pcr primer were used for the second round 95 c for 3 min 5 cycles of 94 c for 20 s 55 c for 20 s 72 c for 30 s and 72 c for 5 min the pcr products were determined by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and purified using magicpure size selection dna beads transgen biotech china followed by quantification using a qubit 3 0 fluorometer thermo fisher scientific usa finally 10 ng 20 pm of pcr products were analyzed using the illumina miseq platform sangon biotech shanghai co china raw sequencing data was filtered using sickle and mothur software operational taxonomic units otus were determined at a 97 similarity level using uparse software and the taxon of filtered sequences were assigned by the ribosomal database project rdp classifier 2 4 physico chemical analyses suspensions were filtered through 0 22 μm filters prior to physico chemical analyses the ph and conductivity of samples were determined using an electrochemistry meter orion versa star thermo fisher scientific usa total organic carbon toc was detected using a toc analyzer multi n c 3100 analytikjena germany the content of protein pn was determined by the bca assay method using bovine serum albumin v900933 sigma aldrich germany as the standard bassin et al 2012 ras et al 2008 the content of polysaccharide ps was quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid method with glucose v900392 sigma aldrich germany used as the standard wang et al 2018 the humic acid ha content was measured using the modified lowry method frølund et al 1996 with humic acid 53680 sigma aldrich germany used as the standard metal element contents were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes optima 5300dv perkinelmer usa for each parameter each sample was measured in triplicate 2 5 network construction using the rmt based approach the pmen of the microbial communities in suspension and in biofilms adhering for 24 h was constructed through random matrix theory rmt based methods developed by deng et al 2012 the relative abundance of otus was used to build a correlation matrix pairwise otu associations were measured by pearson correlation analysis and were used to obtain the similarity matrix which was then converted to the adjacency matrix using a threshold the threshold for defining the network structure was determined by an rmt based approach which could identify the threshold value automatically based on the data structure itself accordingly an objective pmen elucidating the interactions in microbial communities was drawn networks of biofilm communities of nb cq sh and sjz were labelled as nb b cq b sh b and sjz b respectively while for bacterial suspensions from these four wwtps they were named as nb s cq s sh s and sjz s respectively for each network identified 100 randomly rewired networks were generated via the maslov sneppen procedure maslov and sneppen 2002 which keeps the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewires the positions of all links in pmens furthermore global network topological properties were analyzed and the small world coefficient σ was calculated to characterize the small world property of the networks telesford et al 2011 module separation of pmens was performed based on the fast greedy modularity optimization method xu et al 2019a meanwhile the within module connectivity z and among modules connectivity c parameters were calculated to identify the keystone taxa gephi v 0 9 2 software webatlas france was used for network visualization wang et al 2020a 2 6 data analysis according to the manufacturer s instructions the impedance data monitored via rtca was expressed as cell index ci representing the impedance caused by adhering bacteria ci was derived by equation 1 and its mean value mean standard deviation sd was automatically calculated by the supporting software rtca 2 1 2 acea biosciences usa 1 c i z n z b 15 where zn represents the total impedance caused by bacteria attached on the bottom of wells and the wastewater solution and zb is the background impedance of wastewater ferrer et al 2017 statistical analyses were conducted using ibm spss 20 0 ibm usa the principal components analysis pca was performed using canoco 5 0 software scientiapro hungary wang et al 2020b 3 results and discussion 3 1 unstable adhesion process during initial biofilm formation the initial adhesion process of wastewater biofilms was monitored by impedance based rtca at 5 min intervals for 24 h variation in biomass on electrode covered surfaces of the e plate alter the detected impedance and lead to changes in ci values as presented in fig 1 the biomass for all wwtps continuously increases after 18 h before this point varying degrees of fluctuation were observed defined in this study as the period of unstable adhesion it is of note that unstable adhesion herein emphasizes the unstable change of adhered biomass compared with the continuous increase observed in the later period according to the duration of the unstable adhesion phase the wwtps were ranked in the sequence of cq nb sjz dc jxz xm sh cz corresponding to 17 06 0 64 16 89 0 18 16 23 0 11 14 61 0 29 13 48 0 35 13 02 0 30 9 77 0 06 and 8 85 1 53 h respectively the unstable adhesion phase of cz and sh were shorter than that of other wwtps and were characterized by a sharp increase in biomass growth in the first 3 h followed by a peak biomass concentration similarly dc cq and nb also exhibited a rapid initial increase in biomass although they underwent more fluctuations resulting in longer unstable adhesion times in contrast the instability of xm was relatively poor corresponding to the rapid emergence of continually increasing biomass to explain the differences in bacterial adhesion characteristics of different wwtp samples pca was conducted based on the physicochemical characteristics of aqueous environments of all wwtps fig 2 and table s2 the unstable adhesion time was negatively correlated with the concentrations of na and k but positively correlated with pn which may explain the short unstable adhesion time of cz 8 85 1 53 h and the relatively long unstable adhesion time of dc 14 61 0 29 h respectively in addition the unstable adhesion time also exhibited a negative relationship with mg2 and si2 while ca2 and mn2 slightly positively correlated with it overall cations in surrounding environment were conducive to bacterial adhesion by contrast conductivity and ps in the bulk liquid phase were almost perpendicular to the unstable adhesion time furthermore the distance between nb and sh was relatively short in the pca biplot indicating the two wwtps possessed similar physicochemical characteristics while the unstable adhesion time of nb 16 89 0 18 h was 1 74 fold greater than that of sh 9 73 0 06 h in contrast although dc cq and sjz were separated from each other they had a similar unstable adhesion time 17 06 0 64 16 23 0 11 and 14 61 0 29 h the results shown in fig 2 indicate that the bacterial unstable adhesion process was determined by the environmental variables na k and pn previous studies have reported that ion strength and macromolecular components in sludge can affect the early biofilm development process janjaroen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2014 high concentrations of cations such as na and k contribute to better hydrophilicity of surfaces and alleviate the repulsive force between microorganisms and surfaces wang et al 2018 which may contribute to the rapid adhesion of cz in the first hour as well as the shortest unstable adhesion time it has been reported that macromolecular substances such as pns are generally conducive to the establishment of a conditioning layer on the surface which may improve bacterial adhesion huang et al 2018 zobell 1943 and shorten the unstable adhesion time however in the present study a positive relationship was found between pn and the unstable adhesion time indicating that high concentrations of pn may hinder bacterial adhesion and prolong the unstable adhesion process this may be explained by previously reported literature showing that pn in the bulk liquid phase may be compete for surface binding sites and therefore inhibit bacterial adhesion palmer et al 2007 therefore the unstable adhesion of nb and dc with high concentrations of pns lasted for relatively long time periods 16 89 0 18 and 14 61 0 29 h moreover no significant effect of ps was found in this study which may be the combined result of multiple factors in complex wastewater environments it is of note the differences in unstable adhesion time between nb and sh as well as the similarity in dc cq and sjz could not be well explained by these environment variables bacterial adhesion is affected by the combined effects of surface properties local environmental factors and bacterial properties garrett et al 2008 whereas the surface used in this study was the same bacterial community composition must be analyzed for further understanding of initial adhesion behaviors 3 2 bacterial community composition during the unstable adhesion process the majority of wwtp samples were clustered together in pca plots based on microbial abundance at the class level fig 3 a but were separated at the genus level fig 3b as shown in fig 3b pc1 and pc2 together accounted for 36 06 of the total variance cq and sjz cz xm and sh dc and jxz were clustered together indicating similarity in their community composition pca of the 5 most abundant otus in each wwtps showed that axis1 and axis2 accounted for 42 09 and 29 24 of the total variance respectively with the two axes together explaining 71 33 of the total variance fig 4 it is of note dc cq and sjz were clustered in the pca of the 5 most abundant otus fig 4 resulting in similar unstable adhesion times 17 06 0 64 16 23 0 11 and 14 61 0 29 h even though their environmental variables showed significant differences fig 2 furthermore physicochemical characteristics of nb and sh were similar fig 2 although the community compositions of the two plants exhibited significant differences figs 3b and 4 resulting in differences in the unstable adhesion time fig 1 in conclusion compared with environmental factors the bacterial community composition especially the top 5 most abundant taxa could better explain the different unstable adhesion times observed in various wwtps suggesting the importance of dominant populations in determining the bacterial adhesion process assessment of the 5 most abundant otus in each collection found that 17 otus were affiliated with proteobacteria including 11 otus otu2 3 6 7 9 12 18 and 19 in the family enterobacteriaceae and 6 otus otu1 4 5 8 14 and 23 belonging to aeromonas in the family aeromonadaceae table s3 5 otus were affiliated with firmicutes including otu16 22 and 40 belonging to lactobacillales otu13 granulicatella and otu50 clostridium fig 4 demonstrates that the majority of the 5 most abundant taxa 16 otus were negatively corelated with the unstable adhesion time indicating that they promote firm adhesion the 16 otus were otu 3 7 9 10 12 16 18 19 21 23 40 50 with specific information listed in table s3 biofilm bacteria capable of secreting eps possess a greater ability to adhere to surfaces schluter et al 2015 as eps producers proteobacteria and firmicutes are commonly abundant in biofilms calderon et al 2012 lv et al 2014 zhu et al 2015 as shown by the results of the present study fig s1 in particular members of aeromonadaceae such as aeromonas harbor the valuable capability to establish biofilms via cell cell signaling talagrand reboul et al 2017 contributing to an increase in their abundance in the early adhesion process enterobacter also possess a highly developed quorum sensing system mediated by multiple signaling molecules rezzonico et al 2012 and they are prone to colonize surfaces using their flagella to reinforce adhesion de maayer and cowan 2016 previous studies have also reported that the potential aerobic denitrifiers aeromonas and enterobacter tian et al 2015 were found to be dominant in the start up phase of a modified packed bed biofilm reactor pbbr allodi et al 2016 fig 3c and d illustrate the community composition in the bulk liquid and biofilms adhered for 24 h in each wwtp vagococcus was the most dominant genus in the bulk liquid of xm while enterobacter was dominant in seven other wwtp samples fig 3c after adhering for 24 h the abundance of enterobacter decreased in jxz nb cq sh and sjz while aeromonas became the dominant genus fig 3d overall enterobacter and aeromonas dominated the bulk liquid and biofilms respectively fig 3 and fig s1 bacteroidetes contribute to maintaining the stability of sludge zhu et al 2015 and hence dominated the community in bulk liquid while being greatly reduced in biofilms fig s1 furthermore the dominant bacteria were commonly found to be capable of qs indicating the potential importance of bacterial communication in biofilm initiation in addition to bacteria protozoa and fungi are also major members of biofilm communities generally protozoa usually play an important role in mature biofilms affecting the biofilm structure via grazing and the predation of bacteria aybar et al 2019 raghupathi et al 2018 fungi contribute to the functionality of multilayer biofilms due to their high rates of degradation of organic cortés lorenzo et al 2016 huang et al 2019 in the early process of biofilm formation in the present study only the bacterial populations in communities were investigated however some previous studies have reported that protozoa and fungi could also influence the initial stages of biofilm development for instance adding flagellates was found to initially disturb biofilm formation although in later stages they stimulated biofilm growth in 48 h incubations rychert and neu 2010 yeasts may compete with bacteria for adhesion sites due to their strong adhesion capability liébana et al 2015 accordingly protozoan and fungal communities should be considered in future studies to fully understand the complexity of microbial interactions during initial biofilm formation 3 3 network topology features of bacterial communities rmt based networks were established to analyze population interactions in bulk liquid and biofilm communities from nb cq sh and sjz fig 5 with nodes representing bacterial otus and edges representing correlations between pairwise otus the major topological properties the average path distance clustering coefficients and modularity of these networks were significantly higher than those of the corresponding random networks table s4 thus the networks were non random xu et al 2019b the small world coefficients σ of all networks were higher than 1 table s5 which strongly indicates that the pmens of bacterial communities possessed small world and modular structures zhou et al 2010 in addition there was no significant difference in the clustering coefficients of all networks indicating the similarities in module structures present in pmens deng et al 2012 particularly in comparison with nb sh and sjz the pmens in both bacteria and biofilms from cq possessed significantly higher connectivity and shorter geodesic distances this indicates that the community structures were much more complex and network interactions were more intense in the bacterial community of cq moreover modularity in the biofilm of cq was relatively lower than the other samples indicating niche overlap or low diversity of functional units li et al 2020 compared with previously reported systems imposed with specific conditions wang et al 2020a xu et al 2019b the connectivity was relatively higher in the present study higher connectivity represents higher complexity within a network marioosvin and anamari 2001 and high complexity is considered to indicate high stability in bacterial communities mougi and kondoh 2012 accordingly although the adhesion behaviors of individual bacteria are dynamic during the unstable adhesion process bacterial community structures in both suspensions and biofilms are highly stable ensuring the initiation of biofilm formation in addition the positive associations in pmens indicate the occurrence of prevalent mutualism or commensalism xu et al 2019a in this study predominantly positive interactions table s6 emphasize the importance of cooperative behaviors such as bacterial co colonization and co aggregation within biofilm communities during the initial adhesion process faust and raes 2012 hibbing et al 2010 which could be conducive to the formation of biofilms in particular bacterial communities of cq exhibited higher complexity and more intense interactions while the unstable adhesion phase was relatively time consuming compared to the other three wwtp samples it is of note that in comparison with the bacterial suspension community the negative interactions in the biofilm community of cq were increased by 17 38 table s6 indicating that bacterial competition was strengthened this may result in the relatively long duration of the unstable adhesion phase of cq 17 06 0 64 h to identify the topological roles of otus in pmens a z c plot based on within module connectivity zi and among module connectivity ci was constructed fig 6 according to the values of z and c otus can be classified into the roles of module hubs peripherals connectors and network hubs wu et al 2016 peripherals with low z and c values represent specialists in the microbial community while network hubs with both high z and c values indicate supergeneralists module hubs with a high z value are highly connected in their own modules while connectors with a high c value have high links among various modules both representing the generalists in the community connectors module hubs and network hubs are considered to be keystone taxa in topological networks xu et al 2019a which are important for shaping the community structure and maintaining community function martín gonzález et al 2010 xu et al 2019b in this study all of the otus in z c plots were classified as peripherals and no keystone taxa were identified however otus with max degree i e connectivity in each community were identified through global network properties analysis table s5 these nodes with high connectivity exhibit strong interactions with others and thus may play important roles in connecting communities during the initial adhesion process in biofilm communities five otus out 6 9 11 29 and 31 belonged to the f enterobacteriaceae of the phylum proteobacteria otu16 out165 and otu200 were identified as o lactobacillales in firmicutes f moraxellaceae in proteobacteria and f comamonadaceae in proteobacteria respectively table s3 members of f enterobacteriaceae could use multiple signaling molecules involving n acyl homoserine lactones autoinducer 2 autoinducer 3 peptides and indole to accomplish bacterial communication rezzonico et al 2012 some populations of f moraxellaceae possess the ability to colonize at a high rate pettersson et al 1998 most members of f comamonadaceae have high motility mediated by a single polar flagellum bipolar tufts of one to five flagella or degenerate peritrichous flagella willems et al 1991 these properties are conducive for bacterial adhesion to carriers in addition previous studies have reported that the abundances of keystone taxa are generally poor berry and widder 2014 xu et al 2019a in this study otus with max degree were also detected as low abundance species accounting for between 0 02 and 6 78 of communities in biofilms collected from various wwtps table s7 furthermore the abundances of these otus did not present a significant relationship with the unstable adhesion time p 0 05 which could be explained by the fact that abundance is not related to taxon importance lupatini et al 2014 3 4 implications investigations of the unstable adhesion phase of biofilm formation processes have been limited in the past due to a lack of suitable methods torresi et al 2017 in this study the initial adhesion phase of various sources of mixed bacteria were identified using in situ and nondestructive rtca with the unstable adhesion time defined based on biomass at the group level herein hydrodynamics was not considered although this could be significant in practice the effect of shear stress on bacterial adhesion has been investigated in a previous study demonstrating that shear forces derived from orbital shaking improved the reversibility of bacterial adhesion and prolonged the unstable adhesion time wang et al 2020b meanwhile it could affect bacterial proliferation rate on surfaces and further lead to different impedance wang et al 2020b to reduce the complexity and emphasize on the adhesion behaviors of bacteria themselves hydrodynamics was not included in this paper so that the experiment could be operated in well controlled conditions in the wastewater treatment process rapid biofilm formation is generally desirable for the start up of biofilm based processes wang et al 2018 unstable adhesion time may serve as a potential indicator of whether the operation is conducive to biofilm formation in addition this study showed that the unstable adhesion phase was highly correlated with the bacterial community itself especially the dominant population top 5 most abundant taxa interestingly the critical population conducive to shortening unstable adhesion time was identified as being qs related bacteria therefore bacterial communication appears to be of high importance in the initial adhesion phase wang et al 2019 implying a potential strategy for the regulation of bacterial qs to facilitate biofilm formation in wastewater treatment processes more specifically adding exogenous qs signals in stable and mature biofilm is a common way to improve biofilm activity and reactor performance hu et al 2016 while the effect of qs on the initial adhesion of bacteria in real wastewater is limited wang et al 2020c according to the results of the present study it can be reasonably speculated that qs signal dosing in the initial adhesion phase in reactors may effectively accelerate the reactor start up process this supports previous findings that the addition of n acyl homoserine lactones ahls during the start up phase significantly promoted the yield of dense and thick biofilms wang et al 2020c furthermore the concentration of cations was found be correlated to the unstable adhesion time although its specific effects require further investigation accordingly relevant strategies for controlling the concentration of key ions may be useful in the acceleration of bacterial adhesion bacterial communities within biofilms are not randomly assembled but consist of a core microbiome matar et al 2017 previous studies have reported that key species with low abundances regulated the community composition in four species biofilms liu et al 2017a b røder et al 2019 in this study although no keystone taxa were identified otus with max connectivity in each pmen were considered as the key population due to their roles in connecting networks and were also detected as low abundance populations however their abundance does not appear to be related to the unstable adhesion time in contrast the most abundant otus accounted for the differences in unstable adhesion time in various wwtps therefore it could be speculated that the development of bacterial adhesion is attributed to the abundant species while the key low abundance species are responsible for controlling the community structure which emphasizes the importance of bacterial cooperation in communities to further explore bacterial cooperative behaviors in the unstable adhesion phase the design and analysis of biofilms involving different combinations of species is recommended for comprehensive analysis of bacterial cooperation 4 conclusions this study investigated the effects of environmental factors and bacterial communities on bacterial assembly mechanisms during the unstable adhesion phase the major conclusions are as follows the unstable adhesion time of various sources of bacteria exhibited significant differences ranging from 8 85 1 53 h to 17 06 0 64 h na k and proteins were the key environmental variables affecting unstable adhesion time high concentrations of na and k were found to be conducive to forming stable adhesion although a high concentration of protein in sludge may result in long unstable adhesion times the difference in unstable adhesion time in various wwtps could be well explained by the 5 most abundant otus with community composition more important in dictating unstable adhesion time than environmental factors most of the dominant population were found to be negatively corelated with unstable adhesion time bacterial assembly during the unstable adhesion process was investigated population interactions within the biofilm community were dominantly positive involving co colonization and co aggregation as well as bacterial communication eight otus with max connectivity were present at low abundances with their relative abundance not exhibiting a significant relationship with the unstable adhesion time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

17714,the water food and energy nexus is a vital subject to achieve sustainable development goals worldwide wastewater ww and food waste fw from municipal sources are the primary contributors of organic waste from cities along with the loss of these valuable natural resources their treatment systems also consume a considerable amount of abiotic energy and resource input and make a perceptible contribution to global warming hence the global paradigm has evolved from simple pollution mitigation to resource recovery systems in this study the prospects of fw co disposal into the sewer system and treatment with municipal sewage were quantitatively investigated for hong kong s largest biological ww treatment plant wwtp by integrated plant wide steady state modelling pwssm and lifecycle assessment lca approaches the investigation assessed the impacts on the design and operational capacity of the wwtp effluent quality sludge output and its net energy and carbon footprint the results revealed that even at a higher than normal fw to sewage ratio the wwtp s organic load capacity and performance in terms of organics and nitrogen removal was not significantly degraded in fact the denitrification efficiency was improved by the fw organics with low n c ratio the net energy balance was improved by 80 400 the net carbon footprint was lowered by 37 63 without biogenic emissions while the sludge production was increased by 33 the results are very sensitive and improved with greater influent fw concentration and solids capture in the primary settling unit of the wwtp the differences in the results have to be seen in relation to uncontrolled methane emission and a faster filling rate if the fw were disposed to landfill the study provides valuable insights and policy

generation and its management is seen as a global challenge mainly generated at consumer level it covers around 30 60 of total municipal solid waste msw worldwide maalouf and el fadel 2017 the conventional method of fw disposal in landfills is the primary source of leachate and greenhouse gas ghg emissions chen and lo 2016 damgaard et al 2011 woon and lo 2014 while large quantities of fw are also not suitable for incineration due to its high moisture content song et al 2013 thomsen et al 2018 in hong kong as well fw is landfilled with other msw components with emission control measures and energy recovery but the process is inefficient and requires extremely expensive land space in 2017 the daily average fw disposal at landfills was approximately 3 600 tonnes per day tpd comprising of around 65 from domestic and 35 from commercial and industrial c i sources hkepd 2018 biological treatment methods such as anaerobic digestion ad and composting are being encouraged due to their higher resource recovery potential fitamo et al 2016 iqbal et al 2019 however beside some technical limitations of digesting fw by itself source separation and transportation are also the key factors limiting productivity mata alvarez et al 2014 therefore these treatment facilities are mainly dealing with the c i fraction of fw and the search for alternative solutions for domestic fw continues in addition there is a global quest to achieve energy self sufficiency and a lower carbon footprint in conventional biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp corominas et al 2013 fernández arévalo et al 2017 guest et al 2009 wan et al 2016 in this context a contentious option of disposing fw into sewers by using kitchen food waste disposers fwds e g kitchen macerators and treating it biologically with sewage has great attraction to change the wwtp into a net energy generator it could be a promising alternative for not only source separation and transportation of fw but also for increased resource recovery energy via anaerobic co digestion of fw with sewage at wwtp fitamo et al 2016 koch et al 2016 zan et al 2020 fwds have been in the market for many years but authorities are still reluctant to adopt them due to poor knowledge of their impacts on the sewer system and wwtp as reported extra fw significantly increases the organic and nutrient load on wwtp demanding extra energy for treatment however with fw the carbon or cod to nutrients n p ratio increases to be more favourable for increased nutrient removal efficiency and with anaerobic digestion reduces the net energy demand battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 evans et al 2010 other perceived adverse impacts include damage to sewers e g more crown corrosion an increase in wwtp sludge production poorer effluent quality and a less financially economic operation bernstad et al 2013 maalouf and el fadel 2017 thomsen et al 2018 there is also a potential drawback of limiting the use of fw sludge as biofertilizer owing to the mixing of hazardous materials like heavy metals pathogens medical residues and microplastics from the sewage as well as a risk of an increase in the number of rats at wwtp site however most of these impacts are subject to local conditions and to the particular wwtp s technology therefore the impacts of integrating fw with ww treatment still lack reliable information and there is a need to strengthen the quantification of the fw impacts on the wwtp s actual operating performance parameters its organic load capacity and the energy and carbon footprint in the context of local conditions the impacts of fw on the sewerage system is not part of this study this was investigated in another study under the same project zan et al 2019 this paper focusses on the impact of fw on the wwtp as a whole linking cod chonp mass balanced steady state activated sludge as and anaerobic digestion ad models in a plant wide way mass conservative steady state models of as and ad processes are well established tools for reactor sizing capacity estimation and optimization of these biological processes sötemann et al 2005 henze et al 2008 ekama 2011 fang et al 2016 lizarralde et al 2015 bisinella de faria et al 2015 fernández arévalo et al 2017 to complement these cod based models ekama 2009 included elemental chonp mass balance stoichiometry so that not only cod but also the chonp elements can be tracked through the wwtp in an interconnected plant wide way as wastewater characteristics and environmental and technological factors differ between regions the strength of a mass conservative integrated plant wide model which is sensitive to such factors is important to reliably quantify the impacts of fw discharge to a wwtp for local conditions this study utilized a purpose made chonp elemental mass balanced plant wide steady state model pwssm to evaluate the impact of fw co disposal and treatment on the sha tin wwtp in hong kong integrating all the sub processes into a spreadsheet while maintaining the plant wide water chonp element and cod and tod mass balances while p was tracked in pwssm it is not discussed in the paper because the sha tin wwtp is a modified ludzack ettinger mle n removal plant which does not include enhanced biological p removal considering three increasing organic removal efficiencies in the primary separation unit psu the impacts of settled ww primary sludge ps and waste activated sludge was characteristics on the performance and capacity of the downstream as mle and ad systems were examined quantitatively additionally by following the lca approach within a defined system boundary and considering local conditions the net carbon footprint of these three scenarios were evaluated involving standard and innovative modelling techniques this way the study provides some valuable insights into the individual wwtp unit operations and identifies critical factors involved in the wwtp resulting from fw discharge into the sewer the results can contribute to the policy framework of fw disposal and resource recovery plan for not just hong kong but for other cities as well 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the case study and pwssm the sha tin sewage treatment plant the largest secondary biological wwtp operating in hong kong was selected as a case study to simulate and examine its performance and operational capacity with and without fw addition the pwssm developed for this case study follows the overall kinetic and bioprocess stoichiometry of ekama 2009 2017 i e the kinetic steady state as model from henze et al 2008 for biological nitrogen removal bnr and a cod based steady state model by sötemann et al 2005 for ad of ps and was the impacts on effluent quality aeration and pumping energy requirements energy generation from methane production and final sludge production for disposal were quantitatively investigated for the sha tin wwtp based on the three cases of

presents a simplified layout of the sha tin wwtp in the pwssm the scale of the average dry weather flow and reactor volumes was reduced to 1 10th of the actual sizes listed below to keep the quantities smaller in order to more easily visualize their magnitude average dry weather influent flow qiadwf 240 ml day or 240 000 m3 day ratio of peak wet weather flow and dry weather flow fq pwwf

input data were selected to best represent the local sewage influent to the sha tin wwtp fig 1 the fw to sewage ratio is highly variable ranging from 0 7 2 g l wastewater locally zan et al 2019 a fw discharge of 1 0 g l was used in this study to represent 100 usage of fwd the impact of the increase in hydraulic load by fw on the sha tin wwtp was insignificant because the per person water usage in hong kong is quite high at 300 l cap d and therefore only the impact of change in influent concentrations was modelled for the evaluation of the net carbon footprint the study boundary emphasizes the disposal and treatment process of fw and sewage so the scope of the study primarily targeted the process specific direct and indirect emissions all the organic carbon in the sewage and fw was considered to be of biogenic origin the biogenic co2 emissions were also estimated and presented other assumptions and nonspecific parameters used are mentioned in the respective sections 2 3 raw wastewater composition and characterization the data for influent ww composition was taken from previous studies carried out on the same wwtp and represent the local sewage lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the local fw composition data was obtained specifically for this project from laboratory experimentation where in order to dispose of 1 kg fw by fwd 10 litres of freshwater was used zan et al 2018 the fw samples were collected for one year eight times per month from three residential areas of different income level the data was fitted under normal distribution and presented as mean and standard deviation with 95 confidence interval the average data was used as input to the pwssm table 1 shows the characteristics of raw ww rww ww with fw only fww and the total concentrations after mixing addition of concentrations that is the influent mixed raw ww mww entering the sha tin wwtp these two kinds of wws were further characterized individually and combined to obtain the ww characteristics compatible with steady state models the steady state models require the influent organics to be fractionated into five organic sub groups and three inorganic groups as performed by ekama 2017 2009 the five organic groups are volatile fatty acids vfa fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fbso biodegradable particulate organics bpo unbiodegradable soluble organics uso and unbiodegradable particulate organics upo the inorganic components are free and saline ammonia fsa ortho phosphate op and inorganic suspended solids iss tss vss which were available in the collected data table 1 the particulate organic and inorganic groups are further subdivided into settleable and non settleable components table 3 the required biodegradable and unbiodegradable fractions were estimated based on the influent ww characteristics the uso and upo fractions of cod were taken from literature from lu et al 2012 as 7 uso and 13 upo for raw ww and americas 2011 as 13 uso and 5 upo for fww to estimate the remaining fbso and bpo fractions from the total soluble and particulate components respectively the vfa and inorganic fractions of n p were available in the collected data each of these 5 organic groups have cod c n and p mass ratios fcv fc fn fp historical mass ratios for uso and upo obtained from ekama 2017 2011 2009 were accepted in this study to estimate the bso and bpo mass ratios the organic c n and p concentrations were then calculated from the respective organic cod concentrations and their mass ratios the molar composition of the organic and mass ratios for hydrogen fh and oxygen fo were calculated by stoichiometry given by ekama 2009 based on these mass ratios the calculated organic mass ratios and related elemental composition are shown in table 2 2 4 primary separation unit psu removal cases the influent ww organic flow is split into two by the psu one with the settled solids and dissolved components which go to the psad where energy is produced and the other with the non settled and dissolved components which go to the mle as reactor where energy is consumed mainly for aeration to analyse the impact of different psu removal efficiencies on the performance of as and ad processes three cases were established based on increasing the solids removal percentages of upo bpo and iss in the psu the literature confirms that the upo and iss are removed in greater proportion than bpo ikumi et al 2014 wentzel et al 2006 so this was also reflected in the three cases a higher psu removal efficiency implies lower organic load on the as process and a lower energy demand and a higher organic load on the psad with higher energy recovery and vice versa table 3 shows the three removal efficiency cases for both rww and fww because the bpo fraction in fww is relatively higher and the upo lower the psu removal of fw organics was considered slightly higher than raw ww with the 1 10th scale of the sha tin wwtp the average influent flow rate to psu was fixed at 24 000 m3 d and the psu cum ps gravity thickener psgt underflow was set at 0 5 of the qi to thicken the organic concentration of the ps this fixes the ad influent flow rate qps at 120 m3 d and the remaining settled ww flow qsww of 23 880 m3 d entered the mle as reactor the cod c n and p mass balances were maintained over the psu psgt by considering the material fluxes concentration x flow rate and the resulting concentrations in the settled ww and ps were estimated for each removal percentage case as can be seen in table a 1 of the supplementary information si 2 5 preliminary considerations for case specific pwssms 2 5 1 balanced mle process the sha tin wwtp is configured as a mle as system comprising anoxic and aerobic reactors connected together fig 1 a balanced mle system requires the smallest reactor volume per m3 wastewater treated because it operates at the shortest srt to achieve near complete nitrification and the lowest economical effluent nitrate concentration at a mixed liquor a recycle ratio of 6 1 ekama 2017 at the balanced srt the anoxic sludge mass fraction f x1 for denitrification in an anoxic reactor is the maximum allowable unaerated sludge mass fraction f xm to ensure near complete nitrification and the anoxic reactor is exactly large enough to denitrify all the nitrate discharged to it by the mixed liquor a recycle ratio aopt aprac 6 1 and underflow s recycle ratio s 1 1 henze et al 2008 ekama 2017 increasing the optimum recycle ratio aopt to 7 1 decreases the effluent nitrate concentration by only 1 to 2 mg no3 n l increases the balanced srt and hence also the reactor volume and oxygen demand and increases the pumping cost the determination of balanced srt is given in appendix a of the si under steady state conditions the total oxygen demand tod flux which is the cod flux of the organics plus the oxygen demand flux of the reduced nitrogen tkn as per eq 1 is conserved over the mle as psad wasad and also all the physical solid liquid separation units therefore to ensure the accuracy of modelling calculations the exiting and entering tod c n and p flux balances were checked over each unit operation and over the entire wwtp 1 t o d c o d 4 57 t k n 2 5 2 energy balance in order to investigate whether the energy recovery from biogas by psad and wasad fulfils the onsite requirements and if the ultimate goal of energy self sufficiency can be achieved the net energy balance for the sha tin wwtp was carried out for three psu removal cases with and without fw the energy consumption and recovery calculation were separately performed as described below the difference between the consumed and recovered energy delivers the net energy balance for each scenario as given by eq 2 and the net positive or negative energy balance represents the energy deficit or surplus respectively 2 e g n e t e g i n p u t e g r e c o v e r e d in the as process energy is required mainly for oxygen supply the aeration power was determined based on the average oxygen demand flux fot ave which is the sum of the oxygen required for organic removal foc and nitrification fon minus the oxygen recovered by denitrification fod as given by eq 3 the average aeration power requirement paer kwh was then derived by considering the average oxygen demand kg o2 and actual oxygen transfer rate otract kg o2 kwh as shown in eq 4 3 f o t a v e f o c f o n f o d 4 p a e r f o t ave ot r act while the peak oxygen demand is required to size the aeration equipment the average oxygen demand is sufficient to calculate the power consumption over a 24h day the otract kg o2 kwh was estimated from the standard otr 2 5 kg o2 kwh making the site specific corrections for temperature 20 c pressure altitude 0 m and other parameters as given by metcalf and eddy 2004 however beside the aeration power other processes such as water pumping heating requirements of ad reactors and sludge thickening and dewatering also require power for their operation the water pumping energy was calculated from the flow rate and water head 5 m head for the influent 2 m head for the sst underflow and 0 5 m head for the mixed liquor flow the ad energy requirements were estimated based on 30 w m3 ad volume to maintain the temperature at 37 c ekama 2017 and heating the ad influent to 37 c based on the ad influent temperature ambient and flow other unit operations including thickening and dewatering of sludge were estimated based on 100 kwh per tonne tss of sludge metcalf and eddy 2004 from the actual data for sha tin the average energy requirement per m3 of ww without fw is reported around 0 3 0 5 kwh m3 liu et al 2016 which corresponded well with these model estimations finally the total energy recovery was calculated with respect to the total amount of methane recovered its heating value and the energy conversion efficiency of the combined heat and power chp generator the efficiency of the chp units used was 35 for electricity and 45 for heat production hkemsd 2002 the calorific value for ch4 was taken as 37 7 mj m3 or 10 47 kwh m3 perry and green 2007 the ad should perform at the shortest srt with maximum surplus energy so the srt of 10 days and 15 days was selected for ps and was additionally an analysis was performed to observe the change in the net energy balance of wwtp in response to the variation in srt of ad plants details can be found in the si 2 5 3 plant capacity assessment to perform a capacity assessment of fw treatment with sewage at the sha tin wwtp it was necessary to investigate the capability of the plant to handle the extra organic loading by fw the hydraulic and organic loading capacity assessment was conducted for the mle as and ad reactor sizes to ensure that the process units are not overloaded the capacity assessment of the as reactor was performed for its worst case scenario when it receives its maximum load i e case 1 with lowest upo bpo and iss removals in the psu similarly for the ad reactors it was based on their worst case scenario i e case 3 with the highest upo bpo and iss removals in the psu because ad capacity is not defined by organic load the ad srt was checked for different ps and was thickening concentrations 2 5 3 1 capacity assessment for the as system in this case study the reactor volume vr and secondary setting tank sst surface area asst of the as system wastewater characteristics and the peak wet to average dry weather flow ratio pwwf adwf fq are fixed so the plant capacity depends only on the selected mle balanced srt and the adwf from the steady state as model the total mass of tss in the reactor mxt is a product of organic load ww characteristics and srt as shown in eqs 5 and 6 5 m x t f s t i a 6 x tave v r q i adwf s ti a where 7 a 1 f s up f s us y h r s 1 b ht r s 1 f h b ht r s f ioho f s up f cv x ioi s ti r s 8 q i adwf x tave v r a s ti but eq 8 has two unknowns qiadwf and xtave so a second equation is required to find xtave and qi adwf simultaneously from sst flux theory ekama et al 1997 the overflow rate at pwwf must not be greater than the flux rating 0 8 times the settling

substituting concentrations with xt gives 11 x t 24 s ti a a sst 0 8 v 0 1000 f q v r ex p r hin x t eq 11 is solved by finding the xt that equates both sides of the equation and with xt known the adwf capacity is found from eqs 8 or 10 from eq 9 it can be seen that the as sst capacity depends on the settleability of the as expressed by the flux theory constants v0 and rhin these were calculated from a selected diluted sludge volume index dsvi with the equations in ekama et al 1997 as follows 12 s s v i 3 5 0 67 d s v i 13 v 0 r hin 67 9 e 0 016 ssv i 3 5 14 r hin 0 88 0 393 log v 0 r hin 15 v 0 v 0 r hin r hin 2 5 3 2 capacity assessment for ad reactors the required volume of ad reactors was calculated from the selected srt and ad influent flow rates which is controlled by the sludge solids concentration fed to the ad as given by eq 16 this estimated ad volume was compared with the actual ad volume available at the sha tin wwtp the ad needs to operate at the shortest possible srt for maximum capacity so the srt was fixed at 10 days for ps and 15 days for was the feed solid concentration is regulated by the thickening process so three cases of thickening tss concentrations were tested as follows 3 for ps and 4 for was digesters 4 for ps and 5 for was digesters 5 for ps and 6 for was digesters 16 v ad r s q ps q was 2 5 4 sensitivity of fw characteristics to evaluate the sensitivity of the wwtp s performance parameters in response to the variation in influent fw characteristics the one at a time oat sensitivity analysis was performed like the removal rate of psu two other basic parameters were selected for the analysis including the mixing ratio of grounded fw and sewage and the fraction of unbiodegradable organics in fw the fw to sewage mixing ratio governs the dilution of fw by sewage so it directly affects all the concentrations in influent ww as base case a ratio of 1 g l was selected from the range of 0 7 2 0 g l in this study making it a highly variable parameter similarly the biodegradability of fw affects the operation of both as and ad processes and regulates the effluent quality sludge and biogas production and the net energy balance it is also a highly variable parameter as reported in the range of 70 95 cho et al 1995 curry and pillay 2012 liu et al 2009 tsang 2013 this sets the un biodegradable fraction range of 5 30 with an average value of 18 that was used in this study 13 soluble and 5 solids therefore it is imperative to test the sensitivity of these highly uncertain parameters towards the final results this was done by individually testing a variation of 50 in the base case values of these parameters and determining the impact on key performance parameters although these factors have a direct impact on almost every performance parameter the results are presented for the selective key performance parameters of as and ad processes details can be found in si 2 6 greenhouse gas emission ghe potential 2 6 1 scenario development to evaluate the ghe potential of fw co disposal and treatment with sewage at the sha tin wwtp an lca based analysis was performed to include the positive and negative emissions associated with each unit process in this scenario fig 2 depicts the layout of the scenario where the unit processes are grouped into three main stages as i fw maceration and co disposal with sewage ii fw and sewage co treatment by biological as and ad treatment methods and iii sludge incineration at the sludge treatment facility stf with ash disposal at the nearby west new territories landfill went lf the functional unit for this study was set as treatment of 1 m3 sewage day representing 1 kg fw day based on the fw to sewage ratio of 1 g litre in this case study 2 6 2 modelling description following the recommended best practices for ghe reporting both the direct and indirect emissions of upstream and downstream types associated with each unit process were counted iqbal et al 2019 the three main greenhouse gases ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o were counted wherever significant and the net emissions are presented as kg co2 equivalent as per their 100 year global warming potential gwp factors i e 25 for 1 kg ch4 and 298 for 1 kg n2o ipcc 2007 based on the unit processes and type of emissions the net ghe is formulated as 17 g h e n e t c o d i s p g h e p o s i t i v e g h e n e g a t i v e 18 g h e p o s i t i v e g h e d e g g h e f o s s i l g h e m a t i n 19 g h e n e g a t i v e g h e e n e r g y r e c g h e m a t r e c where ghenet co disp represents the net ghe from fw and sewage co disposal and treatment scenario kg co2 eq per m3 ghepositive represents the positive emissions from the sub processes such as direct emissions from organic degradation ghedeg direct and indirect emissions related to fossil fuel based energy ghefossil and auxiliary material consumption ghemat in gheavoided refers to the negative emissions by energy heat electricity recovery gheenergy rec and or any other material recovery ghemat rec nutrients compost etc substituting the fossil fuel based resources 2 6 2 1 fw co disposal the use of a kitchen fwd to grind and dispose fw into an existing sewer system requires electricity and water as input resources and therefore ghe cannot be avoided during the operational phase the positive sources involve indirect ghe from resource inputs during the production and provision of fwd and its use phase manufacturer data was used for the model called evolution 100 insinkerator usa the gwp factor for a unit fwd production and provision is reported as 68 68 kg co2 eq per 10 years of its lifecycle and during the use phase it uses 10 l of water and 0 04 kwh of electricity to dispose of 1 kg fw americas 2011 to convert this equivalent into a functional unit the conversion was made based on the per capita fw generation rate of 0 4 kg per day and 2 9 persons per household in hong kong the energy required for provision of fresh water was used as 0 45 kwh m3 from liu et al 2016 for the hong kong case and the local emission factor ef for electricity production was taken to be an average of the previous 10 years data 0 69 kg co2 eq kwh 2 6 2 2 biological co treatment the focal stage of the scenario is co treatment of fw and sewage at the wwtp which involves the mle as process for the non settleable ww and fw fractions and ad for co digestion of fw with sewage sludge therefore the whole process was divided into multiple sub processes based on ghe sources the positive ghe arises from biological degradation in the as and ad processes and fossil fuel based resources input whereas the negative ghe comes indirectly from the energy recovered onsite from biogas the degradation of organic matter produces co2 ch4 and n2o that are normally estimated using ipcc 2006 guidelines for biological ww and waste treatment methods however the ipcc methodology is very general so the use of case specific input data and efs is suggested the co2 emissions are considered to be of biogenic origin and ipcc does not provide a method to estimate them yet because the pwssm is c flux balanced the c emitted from the mle as co2 and from the ad as co2 and ch4 systems were estimated by using data from mass balance and respective conversion factors in as and emission factors for ad while n2o emissions were estimated using an ef 0 014 kg n2o n per kg influent tkn specific to mle as system from foley et al 2015 details can be found in appendix b of si 2 6 2 3 sludge treatment and disposal the final stage of the scenario is sludge management after dewatering to a dryness ts content of approximately 30 the dewatered sludge is transported to the stf where it is incinerated in a fluidized bed reactor electricity is produced from the recovered heat to fulfil on site needs from the 2017 annual statistical report around 125 kwh t energy was produced from which 95 was used on site and the remaining 5 was exported to the local grid with 4 transmission losses hkcsd 2018 the amount of ash production is reported as 13 5 of the total sludge including 9 3 bottom ash and 4 2 air pollution control apc residue hkepd 2006 which is disposed of in landfill in terms of positive ghe the incineration process produces biogenic co2 emissions by degradation of organic matter which are estimated by using the ipcc 2006 incineration model and case specific parameters the fossil emissions come from the use of diesel as an auxiliary fuel and some chemicals in the apc system iqbal et al 2019 while the negative ghe come indirectly from energy recovery the remaining fossil emissions due to fossil fuel based energy and material consumption are based on the direct and indirect ghe from the production and provision of these resources and were counted with respect to their co2 equivalent efs the inventory data for energy and material consumption is provided in table b 2 in appendix b of si 3 results and discussions 3 1 impact of fw on the wwtp performance 3 1 1 performance of the mle as process the balanced srt for the system was defined based on the influent tkn cod ratios and the denitrification potential of the system for each case to keep the sludge mass concentration greater than the required minimum and the srt greater than the minimum required srt for nitrification the mle srt was rounded off to 4 days and 10 days for with and without fw scenarios respectively based on that the remaining performance parameters such as effluent concentrations and sludge mass production were calculated and the main results are shown in table 4 for all the psu removal cases results indicate that with the increase in settleability from case 1 to case 3 the as reactor received a lower concentration of organics and therefore the volume requirement oxygen demand and sludge production decreased accordingly the addition of fw resulted in increased carbonaceous oxygen demand 39 52 but also reduced net oxygen requirement of the nitrification and denitrification nd process by 15 23 due to the improved tkn cod ratio as also reported by battistoni et al 2007 the overall power requirement of the as process was also approximately 30 higher compared to without the fw scenario finally the impact on the effluent quality shows that although effluent cod concentration was significant with fw addition it was not deteriorated beyond the local discharge standard of 80 mg l in comparison to the scenario with fw the results of the sensitivity analysis show that fw to sewage mixing ratio has a significant impact on the operation of as process as 50 lower concentrations in food ww 50 greater dilution increased the tkn cod ratio and subsequently the required anoxic sludge mass fraction and the balanced srt of the system were increased the total oxygen demand and the total power demand were decreased by around 10 and increased by 15 with 50 lower and higher concentrations respectively whereas at a 50 lower and higher unbiodegradable fraction of fw the net oxygen demand and the total power requirement were only increased and decreased by 3 and 2 respectively however the impact on effluent quality by both tested parameters was significant for cod concentration with a 50 increase in fw concentrations and the unbiodegradable fraction of fw the effluent cod was about 14 beyond the effluent discharge limit details can be found in the si in terms of practical application and operation control the wwtp mainly requires the alteration in srt and aeration control to achieve these results considering that the sha tin wwtp operates on mle as configuration it has the flexibility to implement required variation in srt and the aeration system control therefore these results for the performance of as process entail that fw cotreatment with sewage is a feasible scenario 3 1 2 performance of ps and wasad the results for the ad performance parameters based on the selected srts for psad and wasad are provided in table 5 the volume of ad relies on the influent flow and the selected srt with greater settleability and due to was thickening the influent flow rate of wasad reduced and therefore its volume requirement also decreased although the ad model used in this study is a cod based model the organic loading rate in terms of vss was in the range of 2 0 6 9 kg vss m3 for all tested cases of with and without fw scenarios the fraction of cod converted into methane by the ad process was greater for ps than was as the was goes through biological degradation oxidation in the aerobic reactor before entering the ad reactor resulting in a lower fraction of biodegradable cod in the was this is also why the methane production by psad increased with the increase in settleability of organics from case 1 to case 3 while it decreased in the same manner for wasad overall the addition of fw increased the volume requirement and total methane production potential of the ad process the final sludge output was also increased by 33 on average for all the cases with fw which is dewatered up to 30 solid content before transporting to stf additionally the results of sensitivity analysis revealed that when fw concentrations were reduced and increased by 50 i e 50 greater and lower dilution the total methane production and energy recovery were decreased by 21 and increased by 17 respectively consequently with a 50 reduction and increase in fw concentrations the net energy balance of the wwtp was degraded by 74 and improved by 32 on average compared to the base case scenario but these results were significantly affected by psu removal rates the final sludge production was also variated by approximately 12 whereas the unbiodegradable fraction of fw has an inverse impact on the total methane production and energy recovery both parameters were altered by approximately 3 with 50 variation from base case value the net energy balance of the wwtp was also changed by 7 on average though the final sludge production was increased with increase in unbiodegradable fraction and vice versa the extent of this change accounted for only 1 details can be found in si furthermore by tracking the fluxes of cod c and tkn through each unit process of the sha tin wwtp the tod mass balance over the whole wwtp is presented in table a 2 in si it can be seen that the tod flux balances 100 which simultaneously confirms 100 cod and n flux balances and validates that the pwssm was coded correctly 3 1 3 impact on net energy balance to evaluate the wwtp s potential to achieve energy self sufficiency a net energy balance was performed for both scenarios the comparison of total methane production and net energy balance are depicted in fig 3 the total methane production with fw was around 63 88 greater than without the fw scenario and enhanced settleability of the organics in psu increased the methane production by psad but decreased by wasad fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the total amount of energy used and recovered by the sha tin wwtp for both with and without fw scenarios and psu removal cases the results indicate that fw addition increased the energy demand by around 30 contributed around 48 by aeration energy requirements 15 by ad and 37 by sludge thickening and dewatering while the energy recovery was improved by 58 76 attributed to the increase in biogas production consequently the net energy balance was significantly improved with fw addition and it further improved with the increase in removal of organics in psu the results revealed that for the psu removal case 2 3 with fw the net energy recovery was 17 41 greater than the net consumed at the wwtp therefore it exhibited the ability to become energy self sufficient with fw addition however this was only possible when the maximum fraction of organics was removed from the psu and diverted to the psad the extra amount of energy can be transferred to the local grid to substitute fossil fuel based energy and reduce the carbon footprint the impact of change in srt of ad on the energy balance of the wwtp revealed that with the increase in srt of ad system from 10 days to 15 and 20 days methane production increased incrementally by 2 5 and 3 0 for with and without fw scenarios respectively accordingly due to greater energy recovery from methane the net energy balance of the wwtp was improved as presented in fig a 2 of the si however the net increase was greater for srt shift from 10 to 15 days than for 15 to 20 days srt despite the greater energy recovery the increase in srt requires a greater digester volume and with that the energy required for digester heating also increases furthermore for longer srt the influent sludge needs to be thickened to keep the reactor volume under the existing capacity of ad plants as discussed in the following section therefore the srt of the ad system should be carefully selected depending on the reactor volume and the net energy balance 3 2 impact on the capacity of the as and ad reactors the capacity of the mle as system was established for both varying srt and dsvi for the worst case scenario case 1 as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that with the addition of fw the solid concentration in the reactor increased so the hydraulic capacity of the reactor decreased by around 25 30 however as the balanced srt was fixed at 4 days with fw the flow rate was below the qiadwf even at srt of 10 days as depicted in fig 4 a in addition when srt was fixed and dsvi varied the results revealed that the sha tin wwtp has enough capacity to handle extra organic load by fw even when the sludge settling in the sst was as low as a dsvi of 150 ml g fig 4 b therefore the extra solids load by fw does not reduce the physical capacity of the mle as reactors even at a 100 penetration rate of the fwds in its catchment area the capacity of ad reactors was tested based on variable srts and three cases of tss concentrations for ps and was that define the influent flow rate the results are shown in fig 5 the analysis revealed that the tss concentrations of 3 4 for ps and was only fulfil the volume requirement for the srt of 10 days while thickening of 4 5 was good for 15 days srt but only for psu removal cases 1 and 2 on the other hand at an upper limit of 20 day srt for practical considerations the optimum tss concentrations feasible for the co digestion process were 5 and 6 for ps and was respectively however for psu removal case 3 extreme the ps may also require thickening at 6 tss concentration to comply with the actual volume of the digester 3 3 carbon footprint of the scenario by using an lca based analysis the net carbon footprint of the fw co disposal and co treatment scenario was evaluated based on three distinct stages and on positive and negative emission sources the contribution of ghe by the sub processes with a discerned impact of fw and biogenic co2 addition is presented in fig 6 for psu removal case 1 the results indicate that the biological treatment stage wwtp was the primary source of ghe where the positive ghe was mainly caused by degradation of organics and remaining by fossil fuel based energy use and a small fraction by chemical input the biological degradation emissions included n2o and fugitive ch4 emissions from the as and ad processes respectively the negative emissions came from energy recovery by ad and a small fraction by sludge incineration similar results were reported by other lca based studies corominas et al 2013 fang et al 2016 foley et al 2010 the impacts of fw addition can also be observed from the increase in both positive and negative emissions at the selected functional unit 1 m3 sewage or 1 kg fw the impacts of the fw disposal stage and sludge treatment were insignificant as shown in fig 6 a there are considerable quantities of biogenic co2 emissions that arise from the biological degradation processes in both the with and without fw scenarios therefore when considered positive the ghe from the biological treatment stage were the primary contributor in the whole scenario fig 6 b based on the contribution by sub processes the net ghe per m3 of treated sewage from the developed scenario were estimated with respect to the three psu organic removal cases for both with and without fw addition fig 7 the results reveal that the psu removal efficiency had an almost linear impact on the net ghe with increase in psu removal efficiency the net ghe decreased for both scenarios this implies that with increased psu removal efficiency the net ghe decreased due to less degradation emissions and energy demand by the as process and greater energy recovery by ad as also reported by bisinella de faria et al 2015 the overall net ghe for the with fw scenario were lower than the without fw scenario by around 37 63 from case 1 and case 3 as exhibited in fig 7 a in contrast when biogenic co2 emissions were added the net ghe for with fw scenario were 25 37 higher as shown in fig 7 b the correlation between net ghe and the psu removal cases depicted a further positive trend i e 38 40 improvement in net ghe from without fw scenario and 43 61 from with fw scenario to quantify the ghe saving achieved by this scenario compared to the traditional landfilling the preliminary investigation revealed that the ghe from fw disposal in landfill is around 0 4 0 6 kg co2 eq per kg yet an average ghe of 0 15 kg co2 eq for 1 m3 raw sewage treatment was to be added to keep the functional unit consistent this adds up to 0 65 kg co2 eq which in our proposed scenario is 0 03 0 15 kg co2 eq with fw therefore compared to landfilling the scenario of fw co treatment with sewage produces 87 lower ghe on average 3 4 implications and perspectives the disposal of fw into sewers greatly impacts the overall sewage quality and the subsequent wwtp operation the parameters like fw to sewage mixing ratio fwd penetration rate the solids removal rate of psu and the biodegradable unbiodegradable fraction of organics in fw significantly affect the performance of the wwtp considering that the fw disposers will mostly be used during cooking and dishwashing time of the day it may cause a short peak organic loading period and may shock the downstream wwtp during those peak hours therefore in terms of practical application the wwtp would mainly require the flexibility and speed to make the alteration in srt and aeration system control in as process to achieve the desired outputs the effluent concentrations can get deteriorated with the higher unbiodegradable fraction of fw organics especially in soluble form or high fw concentrations too much load yet it is worth mentioning that the results in this study represent the 100 penetration rate of fwd in the territory which is very unlikely to achieve practically the highest penetration rate of around 50 has been reported in the usa even after being introduced for a long time iacovidou et al 2012 furthermore the srt of the ad system should be carefully selected depending on the reactor volume and net energy balance of the wwtp the addition of fw significantly increases the biogas and sludge production in response to that the wwtp should also be equipped with the capacity to store excess biogas and sludge handling the increase in sludge amount may also increase the energy and sludge handling cost depending on the transportation factors and type of sludge treatment method in different regions from the perspective of the impact on total msw management the diversion of fw towards wwtp can alleviate the burdens of waste transportation and landfills while fw is the main cause of ghg emissions from landfills the proposed scenario can significantly reduce the net carbon footprint of the fw and total msw management yet we recommend evaluating and comparing this scenario with other contemporary fw management options in terms of lifecycle costing and environmental emissions 4 conclusions with the application of the pwssm and lca approach the prospects of fw disposal into sewers using fwds and co treatment with sewage were explored the impacts of this extra organic load was investigated quantitatively for an actual operating biological wwtp in hong kong the pwssm developed for the case study unveiled extensive information with respect to three primary separation unit psu scenarios the concentration of fw in settled ww was not extremely adverse for the operation of the mle as system at a balanced srt for economical effluent quality there was 30 increase in energy requirement for pollutant removal and the final sludge output was 33 greater the effluent nitrogen concentration decreased due to a decrease in influent tkn cod concentration ratio additionally the energy recovery by co digestion of fw with ps and was was also significantly improved 58 76 and with the increase of organic settleability in the psu the energy self sufficiency goal was achieved the physical capacity of the mle as process was sufficient to accommodate the fw load but to operate ad at 20 days of srt the ps and was needed thickening of up to 6 tss concentration the evaluation of net ghe revealed that the fw co disposal and treatment scenario reduced the net carbon footprint of the sha tin wwtp but it was increased with the inclusion of biogenic co2 emissions the use of fossil fuel based energy and biological degradation of organic matter were the two biggest sources of ghe in the scenario however the net carbon footprint comprised both ww and fw treatment so being an alternative to the conventional fw management system landfilling the ghe associated with that method are significantly reduced by this scenario from the above findings for a wwtp like sha tin to be energy self sufficient without compromising the effluent quality with the fw addition it is advantageous to improve the organic removal in the psu the same tss concentration can be maintained in the as reactor as for other psu removal cases and therefore the volume of as reactor and effluent n and p concentrations do not change significantly also the greater energy recovery by psad increases the potential to avoid ghe and reduces the net carbon footprint of the wwtp as well as the landfilling of fw in this context the study is helpful in evaluating the improved resource recovery potential from ww and fw treatment and it provides valuable insights for policy makers to comprehend the synergistic impact of fw and sewage co disposal and treatment which can be considered as an alternative method for fw management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the support

17714,the water food and energy nexus is a vital subject to achieve sustainable development goals worldwide wastewater ww and food waste fw from municipal sources are the primary contributors of organic waste from cities along with the loss of these valuable natural resources their treatment systems also consume a considerable amount of abiotic energy and resource input and make a perceptible contribution to global warming hence the global paradigm has evolved from simple pollution mitigation to resource recovery systems in this study the prospects of fw co disposal into the sewer system and treatment with municipal sewage were quantitatively investigated for hong kong s largest biological ww treatment plant wwtp by integrated plant wide steady state modelling pwssm and lifecycle assessment lca approaches the investigation assessed the impacts on the design and operational capacity of the wwtp effluent quality sludge output and its net energy and carbon footprint the results revealed that even at a higher than normal fw to sewage ratio the wwtp s organic load capacity and performance in terms of organics and nitrogen removal was not significantly degraded in fact the denitrification efficiency was improved by the fw organics with low n c ratio the net energy balance was improved by 80 400 the net carbon footprint was lowered by 37 63 without biogenic emissions while the sludge production was increased by 33 the results are very sensitive and improved with greater influent fw concentration and solids capture in the primary settling unit of the wwtp the differences in the results have to be seen in relation to uncontrolled methane emission and a faster filling rate if the fw were disposed to landfill the study provides valuable insights and policy

generation and its management is seen as a global challenge mainly generated at consumer level it covers around 30 60 of total municipal solid waste msw worldwide maalouf and el fadel 2017 the conventional method of fw disposal in landfills is the primary source of leachate and greenhouse gas ghg emissions chen and lo 2016 damgaard et al 2011 woon and lo 2014 while large quantities of fw are also not suitable for incineration due to its high moisture content song et al 2013 thomsen et al 2018 in hong kong as well fw is landfilled with other msw components with emission control measures and energy recovery but the process is inefficient and requires extremely expensive land space in 2017 the daily average fw disposal at landfills was approximately 3 600 tonnes per day tpd comprising of around 65 from domestic and 35 from commercial and industrial c i sources hkepd 2018 biological treatment methods such as anaerobic digestion ad and composting are being encouraged due to their higher resource recovery potential fitamo et al 2016 iqbal et al 2019 however beside some technical limitations of digesting fw by itself source separation and transportation are also the key factors limiting productivity mata alvarez et al 2014 therefore these treatment facilities are mainly dealing with the c i fraction of fw and the search for alternative solutions for domestic fw continues in addition there is a global quest to achieve energy self sufficiency and a lower carbon footprint in conventional biological wastewater treatment plants wwtp corominas et al 2013 fernández arévalo et al 2017 guest et al 2009 wan et al 2016 in this context a contentious option of disposing fw into sewers by using kitchen food waste disposers fwds e g kitchen macerators and treating it biologically with sewage has great attraction to change the wwtp into a net energy generator it could be a promising alternative for not only source separation and transportation of fw but also for increased resource recovery energy via anaerobic co digestion of fw with sewage at wwtp fitamo et al 2016 koch et al 2016 zan et al 2020 fwds have been in the market for many years but authorities are still reluctant to adopt them due to poor knowledge of their impacts on the sewer system and wwtp as reported extra fw significantly increases the organic and nutrient load on wwtp demanding extra energy for treatment however with fw the carbon or cod to nutrients n p ratio increases to be more favourable for increased nutrient removal efficiency and with anaerobic digestion reduces the net energy demand battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 evans et al 2010 other perceived adverse impacts include damage to sewers e g more crown corrosion an increase in wwtp sludge production poorer effluent quality and a less financially economic operation bernstad et al 2013 maalouf and el fadel 2017 thomsen et al 2018 there is also a potential drawback of limiting the use of fw sludge as biofertilizer owing to the mixing of hazardous materials like heavy metals pathogens medical residues and microplastics from the sewage as well as a risk of an increase in the number of rats at wwtp site however most of these impacts are subject to local conditions and to the particular wwtp s technology therefore the impacts of integrating fw with ww treatment still lack reliable information and there is a need to strengthen the quantification of the fw impacts on the wwtp s actual operating performance parameters its organic load capacity and the energy and carbon footprint in the context of local conditions the impacts of fw on the sewerage system is not part of this study this was investigated in another study under the same project zan et al 2019 this paper focusses on the impact of fw on the wwtp as a whole linking cod chonp mass balanced steady state activated sludge as and anaerobic digestion ad models in a plant wide way mass conservative steady state models of as and ad processes are well established tools for reactor sizing capacity estimation and optimization of these biological processes sötemann et al 2005 henze et al 2008 ekama 2011 fang et al 2016 lizarralde et al 2015 bisinella de faria et al 2015 fernández arévalo et al 2017 to complement these cod based models ekama 2009 included elemental chonp mass balance stoichiometry so that not only cod but also the chonp elements can be tracked through the wwtp in an interconnected plant wide way as wastewater characteristics and environmental and technological factors differ between regions the strength of a mass conservative integrated plant wide model which is sensitive to such factors is important to reliably quantify the impacts of fw discharge to a wwtp for local conditions this study utilized a purpose made chonp elemental mass balanced plant wide steady state model pwssm to evaluate the impact of fw co disposal and treatment on the sha tin wwtp in hong kong integrating all the sub processes into a spreadsheet while maintaining the plant wide water chonp element and cod and tod mass balances while p was tracked in pwssm it is not discussed in the paper because the sha tin wwtp is a modified ludzack ettinger mle n removal plant which does not include enhanced biological p removal considering three increasing organic removal efficiencies in the primary separation unit psu the impacts of settled ww primary sludge ps and waste activated sludge was characteristics on the performance and capacity of the downstream as mle and ad systems were examined quantitatively additionally by following the lca approach within a defined system boundary and considering local conditions the net carbon footprint of these three scenarios were evaluated involving standard and innovative modelling techniques this way the study provides some valuable insights into the individual wwtp unit operations and identifies critical factors involved in the wwtp resulting from fw discharge into the sewer the results can contribute to the policy framework of fw disposal and resource recovery plan for not just hong kong but for other cities as well 2 material and methods 2 1 description of the case study and pwssm the sha tin sewage treatment plant the largest secondary biological wwtp operating in hong kong was selected as a case study to simulate and examine its performance and operational capacity with and without fw addition the pwssm developed for this case study follows the overall kinetic and bioprocess stoichiometry of ekama 2009 2017 i e the kinetic steady state as model from henze et al 2008 for biological nitrogen removal bnr and a cod based steady state model by sötemann et al 2005 for ad of ps and was the impacts on effluent quality aeration and pumping energy requirements energy generation from methane production and final sludge production for disposal were quantitatively investigated for the sha tin wwtp based on the three cases of solids capture in psu which change the 1 settled ww and ps characteristics 2 the balanced sludge retention time srt of the mle as process shortest srt for lowest effluent n concentration 3 aeration and pumping power requirement at the balanced mle srt 4 capacity of as and ad reactors 5 energy generation potential of ps and was by ad and 6 final sludge amount and effluent concentrations fig 1 presents a simplified layout of the sha tin wwtp in the pwssm the scale of the average dry weather flow and reactor volumes was reduced to 1 10th of the actual sizes listed below to keep the quantities smaller in order to more easily visualize their magnitude average dry weather influent flow qiadwf 240 ml day or 240 000 m3 day ratio of peak wet weather flow and dry weather flow fq pwwf

input data were selected to best represent the local sewage influent to the sha tin wwtp fig 1 the fw to sewage ratio is highly variable ranging from 0 7 2 g l wastewater locally zan et al 2019 a fw discharge of 1 0 g l was used in this study to represent 100 usage of fwd the impact of the increase in hydraulic load by fw on the sha tin wwtp was insignificant because the per person water usage in hong kong is quite high at 300 l cap d and therefore only the impact of change in influent concentrations was modelled for the evaluation of the net carbon footprint the study boundary emphasizes the disposal and treatment process of fw and sewage so the scope of the study primarily targeted the process specific direct and indirect emissions all the organic carbon in the sewage and fw was considered to be of biogenic origin the biogenic co2 emissions were also estimated and presented other assumptions and nonspecific parameters used are mentioned in the respective sections 2 3 raw wastewater composition and characterization the data for influent ww composition was taken from previous studies carried out on the same wwtp and represent the local sewage lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the local fw composition data was obtained specifically for this project from laboratory experimentation where in order to dispose of 1 kg fw by fwd 10 litres of freshwater was used zan et al 2018 the fw samples were collected for one year eight times per month from three residential areas of different income level the data was fitted under normal distribution and presented as mean and standard deviation with 95 confidence interval the average data was used as input to the pwssm table 1 shows the characteristics of raw ww rww ww with fw only fww and the total concentrations after mixing addition of concentrations that is the influent mixed raw ww mww entering the sha tin wwtp these two kinds of wws were further characterized individually and combined to obtain the ww characteristics compatible with steady state models the steady state models require the influent organics to be fractionated into five organic sub groups and three inorganic groups as performed by ekama 2017 2009 the five organic groups are volatile fatty acids vfa fermentable biodegradable soluble organics fbso biodegradable particulate organics bpo unbiodegradable soluble organics uso and unbiodegradable particulate organics upo the inorganic components are free and saline ammonia fsa ortho phosphate op and inorganic suspended solids iss tss vss which were available in the collected data table 1 the particulate organic and inorganic groups are further subdivided into settleable and non settleable components table 3 the required biodegradable and unbiodegradable fractions were estimated based on the influent ww characteristics the uso and upo fractions of cod were taken from literature from lu et al 2012 as 7 uso and 13 upo for raw ww and americas 2011 as 13 uso and 5 upo for fww to estimate the remaining fbso and bpo fractions from the total soluble and particulate components respectively the vfa and inorganic fractions of n p were available in the collected data each of these 5 organic groups have cod c n and p mass ratios fcv fc fn fp historical mass ratios for uso and upo obtained from ekama 2017 2011 2009 were accepted in this study to estimate the bso and bpo mass ratios the organic c n and p concentrations were then calculated from the respective organic cod concentrations and their mass ratios the molar composition of the organic and mass ratios for hydrogen fh and oxygen fo were calculated by stoichiometry given by ekama 2009 based on these mass ratios the calculated organic mass ratios and related elemental composition are shown in table 2 2 4 primary separation unit psu removal cases the influent ww organic flow is split into two by the psu one with the settled solids and dissolved components which go to the psad where energy is produced and the other with the non settled and dissolved components which go to the mle as reactor where energy is consumed mainly for aeration to analyse the impact of different psu removal efficiencies on the performance of as and ad processes three cases were established based on increasing the solids removal percentages of upo bpo and iss in the psu the literature confirms that the upo and iss are removed in greater proportion than bpo ikumi et al 2014 wentzel et al 2006 so this was also reflected in the three cases a higher psu removal efficiency implies lower organic load on the as process and a lower energy demand and a higher organic load on the psad with higher energy recovery and vice versa table 3 shows the three removal efficiency cases for both rww and fww because the bpo fraction in fww is relatively higher and the upo lower the psu removal of fw organics was considered slightly higher than raw ww with the 1 10th scale of the sha tin wwtp the average influent flow rate to psu was fixed at 24 000 m3 d and the psu cum ps gravity thickener psgt underflow was set at 0 5 of the qi to thicken the organic concentration of the ps this fixes the ad influent flow rate qps at 120 m3 d and the remaining settled ww flow qsww of 23 880 m3 d entered the mle as reactor the cod c n and p mass balances were maintained over the psu psgt by considering the material fluxes concentration x flow rate and the resulting concentrations in the settled ww and ps were estimated for each removal percentage case as can be seen in table a 1 of the supplementary information si 2 5 preliminary considerations for case specific pwssms 2 5 1 balanced mle process the sha tin wwtp is configured as a mle as system comprising anoxic and aerobic reactors connected together fig 1 a balanced mle system requires the smallest reactor volume per m3 wastewater treated because it operates at the shortest srt to achieve near complete nitrification and the lowest economical effluent nitrate concentration at a mixed liquor a recycle ratio of 6 1 ekama 2017 at the balanced srt the anoxic sludge mass fraction f x1 for denitrification in an anoxic reactor is the maximum allowable unaerated sludge mass fraction f xm to ensure near complete nitrification and the anoxic reactor is exactly large enough to denitrify all the nitrate discharged to it by the mixed liquor a recycle ratio aopt aprac 6 1 and underflow s recycle ratio s 1 1 henze et al 2008 ekama 2017 increasing the optimum recycle ratio aopt to 7 1 decreases the effluent nitrate concentration by only 1 to 2 mg no3 n l increases the balanced srt and hence also the reactor volume and oxygen demand and increases the pumping cost the determination of balanced srt is given in appendix a of the si under steady state conditions the total oxygen demand tod flux which is the cod flux of the organics plus the oxygen demand flux of the reduced nitrogen tkn as per eq 1 is conserved over the mle as psad wasad and also all the physical solid liquid separation units therefore to ensure the accuracy of modelling calculations the exiting and entering tod c n and p flux balances were checked over each unit operation and over the entire wwtp 1 t o d c o d 4 57 t k n 2 5 2 energy balance in order to investigate whether the energy recovery from biogas by psad and wasad fulfils the onsite requirements and if the ultimate goal of energy self sufficiency can be achieved the net energy balance for the sha tin wwtp was carried out for three psu removal cases with and without fw the energy consumption and recovery calculation were separately performed as described below the difference between the consumed and recovered energy delivers the net energy balance for each scenario as given by eq 2 and the net positive or negative energy balance represents the energy deficit or surplus respectively 2 e g n e t e g i n p u t e g r e c o v e r e d in the as process energy is required mainly for oxygen supply the aeration power was determined based on the average oxygen demand flux fot ave which is the sum of the oxygen required for organic removal foc and nitrification fon minus the oxygen recovered by denitrification fod as given by eq 3 the average aeration power requirement paer kwh was then derived by considering the average oxygen demand kg o2 and actual oxygen transfer rate otract kg o2 kwh as shown in eq 4 3 f o t a v e f o c f o n f o d 4 p a e r f o t ave ot r act while the peak oxygen demand is required to size the aeration equipment the average oxygen demand is sufficient to calculate the power consumption over a 24h day the otract kg o2 kwh was estimated from the standard otr 2 5 kg o2 kwh making the site specific corrections for temperature 20 c pressure altitude 0 m and other parameters as given by metcalf and eddy 2004 however beside the aeration power other processes such as water pumping heating requirements of ad reactors and sludge thickening and dewatering also require power for their operation the water pumping energy was calculated from the flow rate and water head 5 m head for the influent 2 m head for the sst underflow and 0 5 m head for the mixed liquor flow the ad energy requirements were estimated based on 30 w m3 ad volume to maintain the temperature at 37 c ekama 2017 and heating the ad influent to 37 c based on the ad influent temperature ambient and flow other unit operations including thickening and dewatering of sludge were estimated based on 100 kwh per tonne tss of sludge metcalf and eddy 2004 from the actual data for sha tin the average energy requirement per m3 of ww without fw is reported around 0 3 0 5 kwh m3 liu et al 2016 which corresponded well with these model estimations finally the total energy recovery was calculated with respect to the total amount of methane recovered its heating value and the energy conversion efficiency of the combined heat and power chp generator the efficiency of the chp units used was 35 for electricity and 45 for heat production hkemsd 2002 the calorific value for ch4 was taken as 37 7 mj m3 or 10 47 kwh m3 perry and green 2007 the ad should perform at the shortest srt with maximum surplus energy so the srt of 10 days and 15 days was selected for ps and was additionally an analysis was performed to observe the change in the net energy balance of wwtp in response to the variation in srt of ad plants details can be found in the si 2 5 3 plant capacity assessment to perform a capacity assessment of fw treatment with sewage at the sha tin wwtp it was necessary to investigate the capability of the plant to handle the extra organic loading by fw the hydraulic and organic loading capacity assessment was conducted for the mle as and ad reactor sizes to ensure that the process units are not overloaded the capacity assessment of the as reactor was performed for its worst case scenario when it receives its maximum load i e case 1 with lowest upo bpo and iss removals in the psu similarly for the ad reactors it was based on their worst case scenario i e case 3 with the highest upo bpo and iss removals in the psu because ad capacity is not defined by organic load the ad srt was checked for different ps and was thickening concentrations 2 5 3 1 capacity assessment for the as system in this case study the reactor volume vr and secondary setting tank sst surface area asst of the as system wastewater characteristics and the peak wet to average dry weather flow ratio pwwf adwf fq are fixed so the plant capacity depends only on the selected mle balanced srt and the adwf from the steady state as model the total mass of tss in the reactor mxt is a product of organic load ww characteristics and srt as shown in eqs 5 and 6 5 m x t f s t i a 6 x

second equation is required to find xtave and qi adwf simultaneously from sst flux theory ekama et al 1997 the overflow rate at pwwf must not be greater than the flux rating 0 8 times the settling

substituting concentrations with xt gives 11 x t 24 s ti a a sst 0 8 v 0 1000 f q v r ex p r hin x t eq 11 is solved by finding the xt that equates both sides of the equation and with xt known the adwf capacity is found from eqs 8 or 10 from eq 9 it can be seen that the as sst capacity depends on the settleability of the as expressed by the flux theory constants v0 and rhin these were calculated from a selected diluted sludge volume index dsvi with the equations in ekama et al 1997 as follows 12 s s v i 3 5 0 67 d s v i 13 v 0 r hin 67 9 e 0 016 ssv i 3 5 14 r hin 0 88 0 393 log v

sludge solids concentration fed to the ad as given by eq 16 this estimated ad volume was compared with the actual ad volume available at the sha tin wwtp the ad needs to operate at the shortest possible srt for maximum capacity so the srt was fixed at 10 days for ps and 15 days for was the feed solid concentration is regulated by the thickening process so three cases of thickening tss concentrations were tested as follows 3 for ps and 4 for was digesters 4 for ps and 5 for was digesters 5 for ps and 6 for was digesters 16 v ad r s q ps q was 2 5 4 sensitivity of fw characteristics to evaluate the sensitivity of the wwtp s performance parameters in response to the variation in influent fw characteristics the one at a time oat sensitivity analysis was performed like the removal rate of psu two other basic parameters were selected for the analysis including the mixing ratio of grounded fw and sewage and the fraction of unbiodegradable organics in fw the fw to sewage mixing ratio governs the dilution of fw by sewage so it directly affects all the concentrations in influent ww as base case a ratio of 1 g l was selected from the range of 0 7 2 0 g l in this study making it a highly variable parameter similarly the biodegradability of fw affects the operation of both as and ad processes and regulates the effluent quality sludge and biogas production and the net energy balance it is also a highly variable parameter as reported in the range of 70 95 cho et al 1995 curry and pillay 2012 liu et al 2009 tsang 2013 this sets the un biodegradable fraction range of 5 30 with an average value of 18 that was used in this study 13 soluble and 5 solids therefore it is imperative to test the sensitivity of these highly uncertain parameters towards the final results this was done by individually testing a variation of 50 in the base case values of these parameters and determining the impact on key performance parameters although these factors have a direct impact on almost every performance parameter the results are presented for the selective key performance parameters of as and ad processes details can be found in si 2 6 greenhouse gas emission ghe potential 2 6 1 scenario development to evaluate the ghe potential of fw co disposal and treatment with sewage at the sha tin wwtp an lca based analysis was performed to include the positive and negative emissions associated with each unit process in this scenario fig 2 depicts the layout of the scenario where the unit processes are grouped into three main stages as i fw maceration and co disposal with sewage ii fw and sewage co treatment by biological as and ad treatment methods and iii sludge incineration at the sludge treatment facility stf with ash disposal at the nearby west new territories landfill went lf the functional unit for this study was set as treatment of 1 m3 sewage day representing 1 kg fw day based on the fw to sewage ratio of 1 g litre in this case study 2 6 2 modelling description following the recommended best practices for ghe reporting both the direct and indirect emissions of upstream and downstream types associated with each unit process were counted iqbal et al 2019 the three main greenhouse gases ghgs i e co2 ch4 and n2o were counted wherever significant and the net emissions are presented as kg co2 equivalent as per their 100 year global warming potential gwp factors i e 25 for 1 kg ch4 and 298 for 1 kg n2o ipcc 2007 based on the unit processes and type of emissions the net ghe is formulated as 17 g h e n e t c o d i s p g h e p o s i

degradation ghedeg direct and indirect emissions related to fossil fuel based energy ghefossil and auxiliary material consumption ghemat in gheavoided refers to the negative emissions by energy heat electricity recovery gheenergy rec and or any other material recovery ghemat rec nutrients compost etc substituting the fossil fuel based resources 2 6 2 1 fw co disposal the use of a kitchen fwd to grind and dispose fw into an existing sewer system requires electricity and water as input resources and therefore ghe cannot be avoided during the operational phase the positive sources involve indirect ghe from resource inputs during the production and provision of fwd and its use phase manufacturer data was used for the model called evolution 100 insinkerator usa the gwp factor for a unit fwd production and provision is reported as 68 68 kg co2 eq per 10 years of its lifecycle and during the use phase it uses 10 l of water and 0 04 kwh of electricity to dispose of 1 kg fw americas 2011 to convert this equivalent into a functional unit the conversion was made based on the per capita fw generation rate of 0 4 kg per day and 2 9 persons per household in hong kong the energy required for provision of fresh water was used as 0 45 kwh m3 from liu et al 2016 for the hong kong case and the local emission factor ef for electricity production was taken to be an average of the previous 10 years data 0 69 kg co2 eq kwh 2 6 2 2 biological co treatment the focal stage of the scenario is co treatment of fw and sewage at the wwtp which involves the mle as process for the non settleable ww and fw fractions and ad for co digestion of fw with sewage sludge therefore the whole process was divided into multiple sub processes based on ghe sources the positive ghe arises from biological degradation in the as and ad processes and fossil fuel based resources input whereas the negative ghe comes indirectly from the energy recovered onsite from biogas the degradation of organic matter produces co2 ch4 and n2o that are normally estimated using ipcc 2006 guidelines for biological ww and waste treatment methods however the ipcc methodology is very general so the use of case specific input data and efs is suggested the co2 emissions are considered to be of biogenic origin and ipcc does not provide a method to estimate them yet because the pwssm is c flux balanced the c emitted from the mle as co2 and from the ad as co2 and ch4 systems were estimated by using data from mass balance and respective conversion factors in as and emission factors for ad while n2o emissions were estimated using an ef 0 014 kg n2o n per kg influent tkn specific to mle as system from foley et al 2015 details can be found in appendix b of si 2 6 2 3 sludge treatment and disposal the final stage of the scenario is sludge management after dewatering to a dryness ts content of approximately 30 the dewatered sludge is transported to the stf where it is incinerated in a fluidized bed reactor electricity is produced from the recovered heat to fulfil on site needs from the 2017 annual statistical report around 125 kwh t energy was produced from which 95 was used on site and the remaining 5 was exported to the local grid with 4 transmission losses hkcsd 2018 the amount of ash production is reported as 13 5 of the total sludge including 9 3 bottom ash and 4 2 air pollution control apc residue hkepd 2006 which is disposed of in landfill in terms of positive ghe the incineration process produces biogenic co2 emissions by degradation of organic matter which are estimated by using the ipcc 2006 incineration model and case specific parameters the fossil emissions come from the use of diesel as an auxiliary fuel and some chemicals in the apc system iqbal et al 2019 while the negative ghe come indirectly from energy recovery the remaining fossil emissions due to fossil fuel based energy and material consumption are based on the direct and indirect ghe from the production and provision of these resources and were counted with respect to their co2 equivalent efs the inventory data for energy and material consumption is provided in table b 2 in appendix b of si 3 results and discussions 3 1 impact of fw on the wwtp performance 3 1 1 performance of the mle as process the balanced srt for the system was defined based on the influent tkn cod ratios and the denitrification potential of the system for each case to keep the sludge mass concentration greater than the required minimum and the srt greater than the minimum required srt for nitrification the mle srt was rounded off to 4 days and 10 days for with and without fw scenarios respectively based on that the remaining performance parameters such as effluent concentrations and sludge mass production were calculated and the main results are shown in table 4 for all the psu removal cases results indicate that with the increase in settleability from case 1 to case 3 the as reactor received a lower concentration of organics and therefore the volume requirement oxygen demand and sludge production decreased accordingly the addition of fw resulted in increased carbonaceous oxygen demand 39 52 but also reduced net oxygen requirement of the nitrification and denitrification nd process by 15 23 due to the improved tkn cod ratio as also reported by battistoni et al 2007 the overall power requirement of the as process was also approximately 30 higher compared to without the fw scenario finally the impact on the effluent quality shows that although effluent cod concentration was significant with fw addition it was not deteriorated beyond the local discharge standard of 80 mg l in comparison to the scenario with fw the results of the sensitivity analysis show that fw to sewage mixing ratio has a significant impact on the operation of as process as 50 lower concentrations in food ww 50 greater dilution increased the tkn cod ratio and subsequently the required anoxic sludge mass fraction and the balanced srt of the system were increased the total oxygen demand and the total power demand were decreased by around 10 and increased by 15 with 50 lower and higher concentrations respectively whereas at a 50 lower and higher unbiodegradable fraction of fw the net oxygen demand and the total power requirement were only increased and decreased by 3 and 2 respectively however the impact on effluent quality by both tested parameters was significant for cod concentration with a 50 increase in fw concentrations and the unbiodegradable fraction of fw the effluent cod was about 14 beyond the effluent discharge limit details can be found in the si in terms of practical application and operation control the wwtp mainly requires the alteration in srt and aeration control to achieve these results considering that the sha tin wwtp operates on mle as configuration it has the flexibility to implement required variation in srt and the aeration system control therefore these results for the performance of as process entail that fw cotreatment with sewage is a feasible scenario 3 1 2 performance of ps and wasad the results for the ad performance parameters based on the selected srts for psad and wasad are provided in table 5 the volume of ad relies on the influent flow and the selected srt with greater settleability and due to was thickening the influent flow rate of wasad reduced and therefore its volume requirement also decreased although the ad model used in this study is a cod based model the organic loading rate in terms of vss was in the range of 2 0 6 9 kg vss m3 for all tested cases of with and without fw scenarios the fraction of cod converted into methane by the ad process was greater for ps than was as the was goes through biological degradation oxidation in the aerobic reactor before entering the ad reactor resulting in a lower fraction of biodegradable cod in the was this is also why the methane production by psad increased with the increase in settleability of organics from case 1 to case 3 while it decreased in the same manner for wasad overall the addition of fw increased the volume requirement and total methane production potential of the ad process the final sludge output was also increased by 33 on average for all the cases with fw which is dewatered up to 30 solid content before transporting to stf additionally the results of sensitivity analysis revealed that when fw concentrations were reduced and increased by 50 i e 50 greater and lower dilution the total methane production and energy recovery were decreased by 21 and increased by 17 respectively consequently with a 50 reduction and increase in fw concentrations the net energy balance of the wwtp was degraded by 74 and improved by 32 on average compared to the base case scenario but these results were significantly affected by psu removal rates the final sludge production was also variated by approximately 12 whereas the unbiodegradable fraction of fw has an inverse impact on the total methane production and energy recovery both parameters were altered by approximately 3 with 50 variation from base case value the net energy balance of the wwtp was also changed by 7 on average though the final sludge production was increased with increase in unbiodegradable fraction and vice versa the extent of this change accounted for only 1 details can be found in si furthermore by tracking the fluxes of cod c and tkn through each unit process of the sha tin wwtp the tod mass balance over the whole wwtp is presented in table a 2 in si it can be seen that the tod flux balances 100 which simultaneously confirms 100 cod and n flux balances and validates that the pwssm was coded correctly 3 1 3 impact on net energy balance to evaluate the wwtp s potential to achieve energy self sufficiency a net energy balance was performed for both scenarios the comparison of total methane production and net energy balance are depicted in fig 3 the total methane production with fw was around 63 88 greater than without the fw scenario and enhanced settleability of the organics in psu increased the methane production by psad but decreased by wasad fig 3 a fig 3 b shows the total amount of energy used and recovered by the sha tin wwtp for both with and without fw scenarios and psu removal cases the results indicate that fw addition increased the energy demand by around 30 contributed around 48 by aeration energy requirements 15 by ad and 37 by sludge thickening and dewatering while the energy recovery was improved by 58 76 attributed to the increase in biogas production consequently the net energy balance was significantly improved with fw addition and it further improved with the increase in removal of organics in psu the results revealed that for the psu removal case 2 3 with fw the net energy recovery was 17 41 greater than the net consumed at the wwtp therefore it exhibited the ability to become energy self sufficient with fw addition however this was only possible when the maximum fraction of organics was removed from the psu and diverted to the psad the extra amount of energy can be transferred to the local grid to substitute fossil fuel based energy and reduce the carbon footprint the impact of change in srt of ad on the energy balance of the wwtp revealed that with the increase in srt of ad system from 10 days to 15 and 20 days methane production increased incrementally by 2 5 and 3 0 for with and without fw scenarios respectively accordingly due to greater energy recovery from methane the net energy balance of the wwtp was improved as presented in fig a 2 of the si however the net increase was greater for srt shift from 10 to 15 days than for 15 to 20 days srt despite the greater energy recovery the increase in srt requires a greater digester volume and with that the energy required for digester heating also increases furthermore for longer srt the influent sludge needs to be thickened to keep the reactor volume under the existing capacity of ad plants as discussed in the following section therefore the srt of the ad system should be carefully selected depending on the reactor volume and the net energy balance 3 2 impact on the capacity of the as and ad reactors the capacity of the mle as system was established for both varying srt and dsvi for the worst case scenario case 1 as shown in fig 4 the results indicate that with the addition of fw the solid concentration in the reactor increased so the hydraulic capacity of the reactor decreased by around 25 30 however as the balanced srt was fixed at 4 days with fw the flow rate was below the qiadwf even at srt of 10 days as depicted in fig 4 a in addition when srt was fixed and dsvi varied the results revealed that the sha tin wwtp has enough capacity to handle extra organic load by fw even when the sludge settling in the sst was as low as a dsvi of 150 ml g fig 4 b therefore the extra solids load by fw does not reduce the physical capacity of the mle as reactors even at a 100 penetration rate of the fwds in its catchment area the capacity of ad reactors was tested based on variable srts and three cases of tss concentrations for ps and was that define the influent flow rate the results are shown in fig 5 the analysis revealed that the tss concentrations of 3 4 for ps and was only fulfil the volume requirement for the srt of 10 days while thickening of 4 5 was good for 15 days srt but only for psu removal cases 1 and 2 on the other hand at an upper limit of 20 day srt for practical considerations the optimum tss concentrations feasible for the co digestion process were 5 and 6 for ps and was respectively however for psu removal case 3 extreme the ps may also require thickening at 6 tss concentration to comply with the actual volume of the digester 3 3 carbon footprint of the scenario by using an lca based analysis the net carbon footprint of the fw co disposal and co treatment scenario was evaluated based on three distinct stages and on positive and negative emission sources the contribution of ghe by the sub processes with a discerned impact of fw and biogenic co2 addition is presented in fig 6 for psu removal case 1 the results indicate that the biological treatment stage wwtp was the primary source of ghe where the positive ghe was mainly caused by degradation of organics and remaining by fossil fuel based energy use and a small fraction by chemical input the biological degradation emissions included n2o and fugitive ch4 emissions from the as and ad processes respectively the negative emissions came from energy recovery by ad and a small fraction by sludge incineration similar results were reported by other lca based studies corominas et al 2013 fang et al 2016 foley et al 2010 the impacts of fw addition can also be observed from the increase in both positive and negative emissions at the selected functional unit 1 m3 sewage or 1 kg fw the impacts of the fw disposal stage and sludge treatment were insignificant as shown in fig 6 a there are considerable quantities of biogenic co2 emissions that arise from the biological degradation processes in both the with and without fw scenarios therefore when considered positive the ghe from the biological treatment stage were the primary contributor in the whole scenario fig 6 b based on the contribution by sub processes the net ghe per m3 of treated sewage from the developed scenario were estimated with respect to the three psu organic removal cases for both with and without fw addition fig 7 the results reveal that the psu removal efficiency had an almost linear impact on the net ghe with increase in psu removal efficiency the net ghe decreased for both scenarios this implies that with increased psu removal efficiency the net ghe decreased due to less degradation emissions and energy demand by the as process and greater energy recovery by ad as also reported by bisinella de faria et al 2015 the overall net ghe for the with fw scenario were lower than the without fw scenario by around 37 63 from case 1 and case 3 as exhibited in fig 7 a in contrast when biogenic co2 emissions were added the net ghe for with fw scenario were 25 37 higher as shown in fig 7 b the correlation between net ghe and the psu removal cases depicted a further positive trend i e 38 40 improvement in net ghe from without fw scenario and 43 61 from with fw scenario to quantify the ghe saving achieved by this scenario compared to the traditional landfilling the preliminary investigation revealed that the ghe from fw disposal in landfill is around 0 4 0 6 kg co2 eq per kg yet an average ghe of 0 15 kg co2 eq for 1 m3 raw sewage treatment was to be added to keep the functional unit consistent this adds up to 0 65 kg co2 eq which in our proposed scenario is 0 03 0 15 kg co2 eq with fw therefore compared to landfilling the scenario of fw co treatment with sewage produces 87 lower ghe on average 3 4 implications and perspectives the disposal of fw into sewers greatly impacts the overall sewage quality and the subsequent wwtp operation the parameters like fw to sewage mixing ratio fwd penetration rate the solids removal rate of psu and the biodegradable unbiodegradable fraction of organics in fw significantly affect the performance of the wwtp considering that the fw disposers will mostly be used during cooking and dishwashing time of the day it may cause a short peak organic loading period and may shock the downstream wwtp during those peak hours therefore in terms of practical application the wwtp would mainly require the flexibility and speed to make the alteration in srt and aeration system control in as process to achieve the desired outputs the effluent concentrations can get deteriorated with the higher unbiodegradable fraction of fw organics especially in soluble form or high fw concentrations too much load yet it is worth mentioning that the results in this study represent the 100 penetration rate of fwd in the territory which is very unlikely to achieve practically the highest penetration rate of around 50 has been reported in the usa even after being introduced for a long time iacovidou et al 2012 furthermore the srt of the ad system should be carefully selected depending on the reactor volume and net energy balance of the wwtp the addition of fw significantly increases the biogas and sludge production in response to that the wwtp should also be equipped with the capacity to store excess biogas and sludge handling the increase in sludge amount may also increase the energy and sludge handling cost depending on the transportation factors and type of sludge treatment method in different regions from the perspective of the impact on total msw management the diversion of fw towards wwtp can alleviate the burdens of waste transportation and landfills while fw is the main cause of ghg emissions from landfills the proposed scenario can significantly reduce the net carbon footprint of the fw and total msw management yet we recommend evaluating and comparing this scenario with other contemporary fw management options in terms of lifecycle costing and environmental emissions 4 conclusions with the application of the pwssm and lca approach the prospects of fw disposal into sewers using fwds and co treatment with sewage were explored the impacts of this extra organic load was investigated quantitatively for an actual operating biological wwtp in hong kong the pwssm developed for the case study unveiled extensive information with respect to three primary separation unit psu scenarios the concentration of fw in settled ww was not extremely adverse for the operation of the mle as system at a balanced srt for economical effluent quality there was 30 increase in energy requirement for pollutant removal and the final sludge output was 33 greater the effluent nitrogen concentration decreased due to a decrease in influent tkn cod concentration ratio additionally the energy recovery by co digestion of fw with ps and was was also significantly improved 58 76 and with the increase of organic settleability in the psu the energy self sufficiency goal was achieved the physical capacity of the mle as process was sufficient to accommodate the fw load but to operate ad at 20 days of srt the ps and was needed thickening of up to 6 tss concentration the evaluation of net ghe revealed that the fw co disposal and treatment scenario reduced the net carbon footprint of the sha tin wwtp but it was increased with the inclusion of biogenic co2 emissions the use of fossil fuel based energy and biological degradation of organic matter were the two biggest sources of ghe in the scenario however the net carbon footprint comprised both ww and fw treatment so being an alternative to the conventional fw management system landfilling the ghe associated with that method are significantly reduced by this scenario from the above findings for a wwtp like sha tin to be energy self sufficient without compromising the effluent quality with the fw addition it is advantageous to improve the organic removal in the psu the same tss concentration can be maintained in the as reactor as for other psu removal cases and therefore the volume of as reactor and effluent n and p concentrations do not change significantly also the greater energy recovery by psad increases the potential to avoid ghe and reduces the net carbon footprint of the wwtp as well as the landfilling of fw in this context the study is helpful in evaluating the improved resource recovery potential from ww and fw treatment and it provides valuable insights for policy makers to comprehend the synergistic impact of fw and sewage co disposal and treatment which can be considered as an alternative method for fw management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the support
