developed in subsection 2 3 in subsection 2 4 an optimized controller is designed to eliminate the effect of thruster fault on the premise of protecting the faulted thruster 1 2 adaptive sliding mode controller there chattering phenomenon is ubiquitous in conventional sliding mode control roopaei and balas 2009 in order to address this the saturation function sat s is usually adopted to replace the sign function sign s to reduce chattering however the thickness of boundary need to be chosen properly if the thickness is chosen too large although it can reduce the chattering the tracking performance must be degraded conversely if a too small thickness is chosen the chattering is still serious roopaei and balas 2009 in order to make closed loop system asymptotically stable the sliding

modelling uncertainty in practical it is difficult to known the boundary of external disturbance d t and modeling uncertainty in prior in recent years most of conventional sliding mode control mainly suffers can be classed either assumption that the boundaries of modeling uncertainty and external disturbances are known in prior or selection a fixed boundary thickness for the switching gain in zhang and chu 2012 a method of exponential function based switching gain adjustment is proposed but the thickness of boundary is still fixed motivated by the above considerations this paper studies an adaptive adjustment method for both the switching gain and thickness of boundary to reduce chattering firstly a sigmoid function is introduced to replace the sign function to reduce the chattering

3 priority of thruster considering the effect to auv caused by the different degrees of thruster fault a weight matrix is introduced in present study to express the priority of thruster corradini and cristofaro 2016 the weight matrix is expressed as follow 16 w w 1 0 0 w i by adjusting the element in this matrix which is related to the degree of thruster fault in fault tolerant control the priority of the corresponding thruster can be change if one of the thrusters fault the faulted thruster priority will be degraded to protect it in the paper an active fault tolerant strategy is adopted to provide the thruster fault information given by the fdd unit to the sliding mode controller and thrust allocation therefore the element of the weight matrix w i can be adjusted in accordance with the thruster fault information λ to decrease the priority of the fault thruster when a thruster fault occurs the element of the weight matrix is adjusted as follows 17 w i w i 0 δ w i where w i 0 is the initial value δ w i is change of the element related with the degree of thruster fault 18 δ w i w i 0 1 λ 1 we can see from eq 18 the different values of λ 0 λ 1 would result in different namely the priority is changed according to the weight matrix the control input of each thruster can be expressed as follows 19 τ w 1 b w 1 u where denotes the pseudo inverse matrix 1 4 fault tolerant controller design in lakhekar and waghmare 2017 an active fault tolerant control method was proposed this method adjusted the controller output in the basis of thruster fault identification and obtained good tracking performance however due to parameters in the controller cannot achieve optimum values the simulation results show that there is a steady state error to remove this obstacle a fault tolerant control method is proposed based on sliding mode and thrust allocation different from the control law in lakhekar and waghmare 2017 this study takes the thruster fault into consideration and redesign the control law to compensate the effect of thruster fault define the tracking errors 20 z 1 y t y d t x 1 t x 1 d the time derivative of 20 is obtained 21 z 1 x 1 x 1

subsystem would be stable now we can design the actual control law take time derivative of variable z 2 27 z 2 x 2 γ 1 a 2 x 2 b r f u f x 2 t d t γ 1 select a lyapunov function 28 v 2 1 2 z 2 t z 2 then we have 29 v 2 z 2 t a 2 z 2 γ 1 b r f u f x 2 t d t t d f x 1 d σ where t d f denotes the effect of thruster fault σ denotes c 1 z 1 redefine a lyapunov function 30 v 3 v 1 v 2 then 31 v 3 z 1 t

the feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant control method pool experiments on beaver 2 auv shown in fig 2 are carried out the dimension of beaver2 auv is 0 8 m 0 5 m 0 4 m the beaver 2 auv uses processor pc104 and embedded real time operating system vxworks its dry weight is 50 kg 6 thrusters are configured in beaver 2 and the distribution is shown in fig 3 the sensor system consists of hmr3000 digital compass cyt 151 depth gauge and navquest 600 micro doppler velocity log in the pool experiments it makes the auv track a longitude velocity and yaw angle and there are three parts 1 compared with pid method the feasibility of the proposed sliding mode control method is verified 2 compared with the fixed boundary method the feasibility of the developed chattering reducing scheme

with smooth current environment in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the adaptive sliding mode controller experiments without ocean current are performed based on the proposed method and a pid scheme in one given mission the auv is required to cruise at a specified speed and angle therefore we design a time varying longitude velocity and yaw angle to complete simulation verification the desired longitude velocity is set as v 0 3 0 2 sin 2 π t 40 the desired yaw angle is set as ψ 105 t 30 s 115 30 s t 60 s 105 60 s t 90 s 95 90 s t 120 s 105 t 120 s the experiment result is shown in fig 4 the fig 4 a shows that the actual and desired longitude velocity and yaw angle respectively and fig 4 b denotes the corresponding tracking error the solid lines represent the results obtained by the method presented in this paper and the thick dash lines represent the result by the pid control the tracking errors are presented in table 1 from fig 4 and table 1 compared with the pid control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity by adopting proposed method is reduced by 28 4 and 50 6 respectively and the mean value and variance of the absolute tracking error of yaw angle is down 24 2 and 35 7 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the proposed method is feasible 2 1 2 experiments with ocean current environment further the experiments with simulated ocean current are conducted to verify the control performance for the proposed method the simulation device of ocean currents is shown in fig 5 the device is

of tracking error of yaw angle is down 56 9 and 46 7 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method in the simulated ocean current environment 2 2 fault tolerant controller performance verification 2 2 1 experiments with smooth current environment in order to verify the control performance of the proposed fault tolerant control method the experiments without ocean current are performed the desired longitude velocity is 0 5 m s and yaw angle is 275 the thruster fault is simulated in accordance with the method in chu and zhang 2014 suppose the fault of right main thruster has 20 thrust loss at 200th step is that λ 0 8 in order to closer to the actual a time delay needs to be set according to the authors previous research and related literature zhang et al 2015 this delay is usually small so we set an adequate delay 20 steps namely the fault information is provided at 220th step according to eq 33 the control compensation is calculated as follow t d f u w 1 2 λ w 2 2 w 1 2 w 2 2 u u t d f ψ l 1 t 1 l 2 t 2 where t d f u is the compensation of longitude control and t d f ψ is the compensation of yaw control the experiment results are shown in fig 7 fig 7 a is the actual and desired longitude velocity and yaw angle respectively fig 7 b is the corresponding tracking error the thick solid line denotes the experiment result using optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the result by conventional fault tolerant control method the tracking errors are presented in table 3 seen from fig 7 and table 3 compared with a conventional fault tolerant control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity by adopting the proposed method is reduced by 62 4 and 42 1 respectively the mean value and variance of the absolute value of tracking errors of yaw angle from the proposed method is reduced by 48 6 and 33 respectively it can be seen from fig 7 a that there is a steady state error between the actual and desired velocity in conventional fault tolerant control with an average of 0 0199 m s accordingly the steady state error based on the proposed method is 0 0011 m s hence it demonstrates the feasibility of the method is proposed in order to reflect the effect of the optimized method on the priority of the fault thruster the control thrust in the experiment results need to be analyze the control thrust curve is shown in fig 8 the thick solid line denotes the experiment result using optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the result by conventional fault tolerant control method the relative results are presented in table 4 seen from fig 8 and table 4 the mean value voltage of main thrusters from 0 to 200th step is 3 18 v when the right main thruster malfunctioning the conventional method increases the voltage of the left and right main thrusters by 0 19 v and 0 16 v respectively to compensate for the thruster fault based on the proposed method the voltage of the right main thruster is reduced by 0 82 v and comparison with the conventional method the mean voltage of right main thruster is 2 36 v namely reducing 30 therefore it can be proved that this method can effectively reduce the priority of the malfunctioning thruster and thus realize its protection 2 2 2 experiments with ocean current environment in this subsection the experiments are performed in a simulated ocean current environment to verify the control feasibility of the proposed method the desired longitude velocity is 0 1 m s and desired yaw

conventional fault tolerant control method the tracking errors are presented in table 5 seen from fig 9 and table 5 compared with the conventional fault tolerant control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity using optimization method in this paper are reduced by 58 4 and 44 7 respectively and the mean value and variance of the absolute tracking errors of yaw angle are reduced by 29 6 and 27 8 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in simulated ocean current environment 2 3 chattering reducing experiments in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed chattering reducing method the experimental results based on optimized method are compared with that obtained by the fixed thickness boundary method the experiment situations are similar to those in 3 1 1 the desired yaw angle is 0 and the control output is showed in fig 10 the thick solid line denotes the output of thruster in the optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the output of thruster in conventional fault tolerant control from fig 10 the different between the control output variance of proposed method and the conventional method is 0 16 v and 0 93 v respectively compared with the conventional method the control voltage variance is reduced by 82 8 which proves the proposed method is effective in reducing chattering 3 conclusion in present study a fault tolerant control method for auv is proposed in order to address the steady error in the conventional fault tolerant control a fault tolerant control method based on the integration of sliding mode and thrust allocation is proposed the experimental result shows that compared with the conventional sliding model fault tolerant control method the steady error is reduced by 94 5 and the output voltage of the fault thruster is reduced by 30 it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method an adaptive adjusting method of switching gain and thickness of boundary method is proposed to eliminate the requirement of the boundary of the external disturbance and reduces chattering form the experiments analysis show that in

modelling uncertainty in practical it is difficult to known the boundary of external disturbance d t and modeling uncertainty in prior in recent years most of conventional sliding mode control mainly suffers can be classed either assumption that the boundaries of modeling uncertainty and external disturbances are known in prior or selection a fixed boundary thickness for the switching gain in zhang and chu 2012 a method of exponential function based switching gain adjustment is proposed but the thickness of boundary is still fixed motivated by the above considerations this paper studies an adaptive adjustment method for both the switching gain and thickness of boundary to reduce chattering firstly a sigmoid function is introduced to replace the sign function to reduce the chattering

3 priority of thruster considering the effect to auv caused by the different degrees of thruster fault a weight matrix is introduced in present study to express the priority of thruster corradini and cristofaro 2016 the weight matrix is expressed as follow 16 w w 1 0 0 w i by adjusting the element in this matrix which is related to the degree of thruster fault in fault tolerant control the priority of the corresponding thruster can be change if one of the thrusters fault the faulted thruster priority will be degraded to protect it in the paper an active fault tolerant strategy is adopted to provide the thruster fault information given by the fdd unit to the sliding mode controller and thrust allocation therefore the element of the weight matrix w i can be adjusted in accordance with the thruster fault information λ to decrease the priority of the fault thruster when a thruster fault occurs the element of the weight matrix is adjusted as follows 17 w i w i 0 δ w i where w i 0 is the initial value δ w i is change of the element related with the degree of thruster fault 18 δ w i w i 0 1 λ 1 we can see from eq 18 the different values of λ 0 λ 1 would result in different namely the priority is changed according to the weight matrix the control input of each thruster can be expressed as follows 19 τ w 1 b w 1 u where denotes the pseudo inverse matrix 1 4 fault tolerant controller design in lakhekar and waghmare 2017 an active fault tolerant control method was proposed this method adjusted the controller output in the basis of thruster fault identification and obtained good tracking performance however due to parameters in the controller cannot achieve optimum values the simulation results show that there is a steady state error to remove this obstacle a fault tolerant control method is proposed based on sliding mode and thrust allocation different from the control law in lakhekar and waghmare 2017 this study takes the thruster fault into consideration and redesign the control law to compensate the effect of thruster fault define the tracking errors 20 z 1 y t y d t x 1 t x 1 d the time derivative of 20 is obtained 21 z 1 x 1 x 1

hmr3000 digital compass cyt 151 depth gauge and navquest 600 micro doppler velocity log in the pool experiments it makes the auv track a longitude velocity and yaw angle and there are three parts 1 compared with pid method the feasibility of the proposed sliding mode control method is verified 2 compared with the fixed boundary method the feasibility of the developed chattering reducing scheme is verified 3 compared with conventional sliding mode controller the feasibility of the proposed fault tolerant control method is verified 2 1 verification of control performance 2 1 1 experiments with smooth current environment in order to demonstrate the feasibility of the adaptive sliding mode controller experiments without ocean current are performed based on the proposed method and a pid scheme in one given mission the auv is required to cruise at a specified speed and angle therefore we design a time varying longitude velocity and yaw angle to complete simulation verification the desired longitude velocity is set as v 0 3 0 2 sin 2 π t 40 the desired yaw angle is set as ψ 105 t 30 s 115 30 s t 60 s 105 60 s t 90 s 95 90 s t 120 s 105 t 120 s the experiment result is shown in fig 4 the fig 4 a shows that the actual and desired longitude velocity and yaw angle respectively and fig 4 b denotes the corresponding tracking error the solid lines represent the results obtained by the method presented in this paper and the thick dash lines represent the result by the pid control the tracking errors are presented in table 1 from fig 4 and table 1 compared with the pid control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity by adopting proposed method is reduced by 28 4 and 50 6 respectively and the mean value and variance of the absolute tracking error of yaw angle is down 24 2 and 35 7 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the proposed method is feasible 2 1 2 experiments with ocean current environment further the experiments with simulated ocean current are conducted to verify the control performance for the proposed method the simulation device of ocean currents is shown in fig 5 the device is designed by placing four thrusters on the vertical plane and the ocean current generated in the experimental area is between 0 1 m s and 0 3 m s the experimental result is shown in fig 6 the fig 6 a shows the actual and desired longitude velocity and yaw angle respectively fig 6 b is the corresponding tracking error the thick solid line is the experiment result according to the proposed method and the thick dash line is the result obtained by pid control the tracking errors are presented in table 2 by analyzing fig 6 and table 2 we know that compared with the pid control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity by adopting the proposed method is down 61 6 and 64 8 respectively the mean value and variance value of the absolute value of tracking error of yaw angle is down 56 9 and 46 7 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method in the simulated ocean current environment 2 2 fault tolerant controller performance verification 2 2 1 experiments with smooth current environment in order to verify the control performance of the proposed fault tolerant control method the experiments without ocean current are performed the desired longitude velocity is 0 5 m s and yaw angle is 275 the thruster fault is simulated in accordance with the method in chu and zhang 2014 suppose the fault of right main thruster has 20 thrust loss at 200th step is that λ 0 8 in order to closer to the actual a time delay needs to be set according to the authors previous research and related literature zhang et al 2015 this delay is usually small so we set an adequate delay 20 steps namely the fault information is provided at 220th step according to eq 33 the control compensation is calculated as follow t d f u w 1 2 λ w 2 2 w 1 2 w 2 2 u u t d f ψ l 1 t 1 l 2 t 2 where t d f u is the compensation of longitude control and t d f ψ is the compensation of yaw control the experiment results are shown in fig 7 fig 7 a is the actual and desired longitude velocity and yaw angle respectively fig 7 b is the corresponding tracking error the thick solid line denotes the experiment result using optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the result by conventional fault tolerant control method the tracking errors are presented in table 3 seen from fig 7 and table 3 compared with a conventional fault tolerant control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity by adopting the proposed method is reduced by 62 4 and 42 1 respectively the mean value and variance of the absolute value of tracking errors of yaw angle from the proposed method is reduced by 48 6 and 33 respectively it can be seen from fig 7 a that there is a steady state error between the actual and desired velocity in conventional fault tolerant control with an average of 0 0199 m s accordingly the steady state error based on the proposed method is 0 0011 m s hence it demonstrates the feasibility of the method is proposed in order to reflect the effect of the optimized method on the priority of the fault thruster the control thrust in the experiment results need to be analyze the control thrust curve is shown in fig 8 the thick solid line denotes the experiment result using optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the result by conventional fault tolerant control method the relative results are presented in table 4 seen from fig 8 and table 4 the mean value voltage of main thrusters from 0 to 200th step is 3 18 v when the right main thruster malfunctioning the conventional method increases the voltage of the left and right main thrusters by 0 19 v and 0 16 v respectively to compensate for the thruster fault based on the proposed method the voltage of the right main thruster is reduced by 0 82 v and comparison with the conventional method the mean voltage of right main thruster is 2 36 v namely reducing 30 therefore it can be proved that this method can effectively reduce the priority of the malfunctioning thruster and thus realize its protection 2 2 2 experiments with ocean current environment in this subsection the experiments are performed in a simulated ocean current environment to verify the control feasibility of the proposed method the desired longitude velocity is 0 1 m s and desired yaw angle is 270 the right main thruster has 20 effectiveness loss where the thick solid line denotes the experiment result using optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the result by conventional fault tolerant control method the tracking errors are presented in table 5 seen from fig 9 and table 5 compared with the conventional fault tolerant control method the mean value and variance value of the absolute tracking error of longitude velocity using optimization method in this paper are reduced by 58 4 and 44 7 respectively and the mean value and variance of the absolute tracking errors of yaw angle are reduced by 29 6 and 27 8 respectively hence the experiment result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in simulated ocean current environment 2 3 chattering reducing experiments in order to verify the feasibility of the proposed chattering reducing method the experimental results based on optimized method are compared with that obtained by the fixed thickness boundary method the experiment situations are similar to those in 3 1 1 the desired yaw angle is 0 and the control output is showed in fig 10 the thick solid line denotes the output of thruster in the optimized method and the thick dash line denotes the output of thruster in conventional fault tolerant control from fig 10 the different between the control output variance of proposed method and the conventional method is 0 16 v and 0 93 v respectively compared with the conventional method the control voltage variance is reduced by 82 8 which proves the proposed method is effective in reducing chattering 3 conclusion in present study a fault tolerant control method for auv is proposed in order to address the steady error in the conventional fault tolerant control a fault tolerant control method based on the integration of sliding mode and thrust allocation is proposed the experimental result shows that compared with the conventional sliding model fault tolerant control method the steady error is reduced by 94 5 and the output voltage of the fault thruster is reduced by 30 it demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method an adaptive adjusting method of switching gain and thickness of boundary method is proposed to eliminate the requirement of the boundary of the external disturbance and reduces chattering form the experiments analysis show that in comparison with the conventional sliding mode method the maximum absolute value and mean square deviation of the tracking error are reduced above 28 and 35 respectively therefore the feasibility of the proposed method is verified in addition the variance of control output is reduced by 82 8 denotes the effectiveness of the proposed chattering reducing method credit authorship contribution

21476,wind measurements made on ships are used for general navigation maritime operations and in some cases logged to support oceanographic research they are particularly important for aircraft carrying ships as operations can be restricted in certain wind conditions shipboard wind measurements are subject to biases and inaccuracies as a result of air flow changing as it passes over and around the ship its structures and features ship induced wind distortion and the resulting bias on anemometer readings can range from insignificant to severe anemometer bias cannot be completely eliminated for all conditions but it can be managed so that reliable and accurate assessments of wind at sea can be identified this paper describes the basic concepts related to ship wind distortion along with procedures and considerations on how bias can be quantified using simulations or model tests and validated using sea trials an example case of a helicopter carrying frigate is used to demonstrate the process of quantifying bias calculating metrics determining useful ranges and developing and applying correction functions wind tunnel measurements and a sea trial successfully demonstrated and validated the proposed ship anemometer bias management methodology keywords anemometer bias sea trial ship wind measurements relative wind model tests wind tunnel 1 introduction wind measurements made on ships are subject to distortion as the air flow moves over and around the ship the degree of distortion depends on factors such as the wind angle and speed ship geometry and the location of the sensor wind measurements are not only used for general navigation but are often logged to provide data for oceanographic research wind measurements are particularly important for ships which launch and recover aircraft as these operations can be unsafe or unachievable in certain wind conditions ship induced wind distortion cannot be eliminated but steps can be taken to evaluate the extent to which measurements are biased and to develop a means to correct and or otherwise manage the issue to ensure operators are presented with useful data on their wind environment the royal canadian navy is in the process of a recapitalization involving a mid life refit of its patrol frigates the introduction of new marine helicopters and the acquisition of three new classes of helicopter carrying naval ship anemometer bias analysis and ship airwake studies for aircraft operations are being conducted for both existing and future ships this is to ensure accurate wind data are available to operators and that airwake characteristics will be suitable for a broad wind envelope for aircraft this paper describes the methods used in these studies along with guidelines for evaluation and use that are generally applicable to naval and commercial vessels alike taken together these processes are referred to as anemometer bias management abm and are used to ensure reliable wind readings at sea this paper begins with an overview of the distorting effect of bodies on the flow and a literature review of the work previously performed on ship abm followed by a discussion of modelling and validation techniques for evaluating wind bias design guidelines and considerations are then given along with general strategies for managing ship anemometer bias 2 flow distortions around ships the measurement and understanding of flow distortions around ships is essential for managing the biases that affect ship anemometer readings bluff bodies modify the incoming flow in one or more of the following ways due to skin friction flow moving along the surface of a body will be slowed near the surface resulting in a boundary layer fig 1 a the shape of the body may also induce changes in flow direction fig 1 b or speed fig 1 c for these first three distortion types the flow is said to be attached with the flow remaining largely in the freestream direction with the unsteady characteristics mainly unchanged if the flow encounters a rapid change in body shape depending on the shape and the pressure gradient on the body surface the flow may separate which results in a shear layer fig 1 d where the flow speed changes rapidly from the freestream speed to a region of velocity deficit and recirculation behind the body shear layers flap in space and time fig 1 e and promote the development of vortices due to the change in speed fig 1 f shear layers separate more consistently from sharp edged objects than from round edges fig 1 g flow separations are characterized by increased levels of vorticity and turbulence an open separation fig 1 h results in a turbulent wake depending on the geometry of the bluff body a separated flow may be subject to reattachment and a closed separation that results in a separation bubble fig 1 i conservatively speaking a flow can be considered to be unaffected by a bluff body at a distance greater than 10 characteristic body dimensions away from the body therefore any practical anemometer placement will be subject to biases induced by the overall ship superstructure and hull this concept is illustrated in fig 2 in addition biases are also induced by smaller features such as masts or other ship mounted equipment within 10 characteristic lengths of the anemometer position since practical anemometer positions will undoubtedly be subject to biases a practical goal of placement is ensuring that the biases are consistent across a range of operating conditions and that they are unique meaning the true flow can be calculated from the measurement if bias characteristics are known the topology of the flow around a ship is governed by the non dimensional reynolds number 1 re ρ v l μ where ρ is the flow density v is the characteristic flow speed l is the characteristic body dimension and μ is the flow dynamic viscosity the characteristic body dimension is the dimension that dominates the development of the flow topology for example in the case of a circular cylinder the diameter is the characteristic dimension even though the length may be much greater in the case of a backwards facing step which leads to a separation bubble the characteristic dimension is the step height the characteristic flow speed should be close to the speed that dominates the development of the flow topology for bluff body flow studies the characteristic flow speed is usually the reference flow speed measured in the absence of the bluff body the height of the reference speed also needs to be specified for bluff body aerodynamics applications near the surface of the earth due to the atmospheric boundary layer abl see section 5 2 the abl results from the same physical causes as the flow shown in fig 1 a the reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces in the flow the drag forces on a bluff body and the subsequent wake topology are nominally dependent on the reynolds number low reynolds number flows laminar regime are characterized by gradual changes in forces with changes in reynolds number the transitional range of reynolds numbers is associated with rapid changes in forces and flow topology with changes in reynolds number high reynolds number flows turbulent flow regime are characterized by a general insensitivity to further changes in reynolds number these ranges are illustrated in fig 3 showing a typical relationship shape for circular cylinders the surface roughness body shape incoming flow turbulence level and other factors influence the reynolds numbers over which the three flow regimes laminar transitional turbulent are present of particular importance for ship airwake or anemometer studies is the reynolds number where the flow can be assumed to be fully turbulent at full scale and also for testing at model scale to ensure similarity broadly speaking separations from sharp edges and or large features such as the deck edge the hangar the bow are less sensitive to reynolds number than separations from rounded or small features such as posts lattice masts fences because the flow topology is more dependent on the shape of the body than on the flow itself for ship airwake studies involving the flow in proximity to the flight deck a lower reynolds number limit of 11 000 using the beam as the characteristic dimension is typically used for reynolds similitude assuming the ship is largely sharp edged healey 1992 by comparison flow over a cylinder is usually considered to be dependent on reynolds number up to a value of 10 6 as a result the study of anemometer biases requires a more subtle understanding of reynolds number effect since anemometers are often placed within 10 characteristic body dimensions of round ship features and equipment unstable flow topologies for some wind conditions may render anemometer biases inconsistent and therefore unusable or uncorrectable reynolds number effects are a fundamental aspect of modelling measurement and interpretation of anemometer biases which will be discussed at length in this paper an understanding of the topological stability of the air flow is needed if model scale or shipboard measurements are to be interpreted properly 3 wind definitions and conventions wind direction in this paper adheres to the convention used in meteorology and by mariners it is the direction where the wind is coming from e g a north wind is where the air moves from the north to the south and a starboard wind is where air moves from starboard to port consequently and unless specified otherwise wind vectors 1 1 even when explicitly using the coming from convention there is no consensus on how wind vector arrows should be oriented in diagrams depending on the context arrows can either point to the wind s coming from or going to directions in the figures will point to the coming from direction note that this approach is opposite to the convention used most in fluid dynamics where direction is defined by where the flow is going to wind direction is given either with respect to the compass rose e g 0 to 359 where 0 is true north or relative to the ship centreline converting between the two references can be done using eq 2 when using a relative reference the terms red r and green g winds refer to port and starboard winds respectively as shown in fig 4 although 3d effects of wind distortion can be significant for some anemometer placements the vertical component of wind is rarely measured by ship s anemometers therefore only wind in the horizontal plane is considered 2 θ w ψ w ψ h where θ w is the wind direction relative to the ship centreline ψ w is the wind direction relative to true north ψ h is the ship heading relative to true north fig 5 shows a diagram illustrating the various wind vectors defined below used in evaluating anemometer biases from the perspective of a ship at sea only two of these vectors are known initially the ship generated wind s from the ship speed and course and the measured wind m from the anemometer s the goal of bias management is to account for the distortions in m caused by the air moving over and around the ship to determine the corrected relative wind c as discussed in later sections these vectors are functions of wind direction and height above sea level and in some cases wind speed true wind true wind t is the ambient atmospheric wind flowing over the ocean surface it has a vertical velocity distribution as a result of the abl where wind speed increases with height above the water unless otherwise specified true wind speed is given at the anemometer height ship generated wind ship generated wind s is created by the movement of the ship through still air it is treated as an idealized concept where the ship has no effect on the air through which it moves the ship generated wind speed is defined in eq 3 as the ship speed v s in the direction of the ship course over ground ψ c using the coming from convention 3 s v s ψ c note the ship course ψ c does not always align with the ship heading ψ h the difference between them called drift angle can be substantial for certain operating conditions undistorted relative wind undistorted relative wind u is the idealized concept of relative wind as the vector sum of the true and ship generated winds this is the relative wind that would be measured on a ship that had no effect on the air around it 4 u t s measured relative wind measured relative wind m is the wind as measured at a specific point on the ship the measured relative wind is a combination of the true and ship generated winds and also includes all of the distortion effects caused as the air is forced to flow over and around the ship structures corrected relative wind corrected relative wind c is an estimate of the idealized undistorted wind u that is made by applying a correction developed for example from wind tunnel data to the measured wind m it is not always possible to apply corrections to m 5 c u 4 literature review 4 1 preliminary measurements of bias effects on ships observations of distortions in wind measurements made from ships were reported as early as the mid 1960s these observations came mostly from research vessels where measurements from the mast were compared with other sources such as nearby buoys or from shore based sensors bogorodskiy 1966 augstein et al 1974 hoeber 1977 pierson 1990 bias effects at different locations on a ship were also observed through comparisons of wind measurements on a ship s mast and various extended booms ching 1976 kahma and leppãranta 1981 kidwell and seguin 1978 rahmstorf 1989 blunt 1991 these effects were quantified through the use of scaled model wind tunnel tests which estimated the flow distortion error at potential shipboard anemometer sites to be as large as 40 elliot 1981 4 2 ship wind measurement for oceanographic studies a large focus of the published work for wind measurement bias on ships came from the scientists who use wind measurements and other data from thousands of ships globally as part of the world meteorological organization wmo voluntary observing ships vos there was enough distortion of meteorological measurements induced by ships that it was adversely affecting weather and sea state forecasts hoeber 1977 blanc 1986b the national oceanography centre noc in southampton uk has performed a considerable amount of work on the subject of ship anemometer speed bias which focused primarily on improving data from vos for oceanographic studies these studies include full scale measurements from research vessels wind tunnel model tests and the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd to quantify ship based anemometer bias moat 1994 taylor et al 1999 yelland et al 2002 moat 2003 moat et al 2004b a 2005 moat and yelland 2005 moat et al 2006b a moat and yelland 2009 several of these studies consisted of steady state cfd simulations to predict the speed biases for anemometers mounted on a mast located at the bow of the ship moat et al 2006b moat and yelland 2009 yelland et al 2002 additional series of cfd simulations were conducted to predict wind speed biases on generic container ships in order to improve the wind speeds reported by vos simulations of generic container ships were used to develop predictions of wind speed bias as a function of bridge height in bow and beam winds the speed bias on top of the bridge of these container models ranged from 11 to 100 indicating that regions of flow acceleration and regions of reversed flow were present as a result of the bridge geometry general guidance for anemometer positioning suggested by moat et al 2006a 2005 included placement of anemometers in regions where shear is low near the forward edge of large structures such as the bridge and to avoid regions where wakes are present outside of the noc other researchers were also using cfd to evaluate flow distortions at ship anemometer positions in order to improve observation data popinet et al 2004 presented results from a cfd study using the unsteady large eddy simulation les research code gerris to investigate the characteristics of the mean airflow and the turbulent wake around the ship rv tangaroa good agreement over a full range of relative wind angles was found between the simulations and measurements from a corresponding sea trial at several positions in regions of both high and low flow distortion they concluded that both the normalized wind speed and normalized standard deviation were only weakly dependent on wind speed ship speed ship motion and sea state but strongly dependent on relative wind angle while anemometer placement does affect the dependence of anemometer readings on speed and motion related factors biases that depend on wind angle only are preferred o sullivan et al 2013 presented results of a study using the cfd code openfoam to simulate the errors in wind speed measurements caused by flow distortion on the rv celtic explorer and validated the predictions with full scale data simulations were performed over a range of relative wind angles from r60 to g60 and velocities from 10 to 50knots the numerical results were within 12 of experimental measurements which could possibly be improved using different cfd processes specifically tuned for unsteady ship airwakes it was also shown that although the wind angle is a dominant factor in flow distortion errors popinet et al 2004 yelland et al 2002 these errors can also change as a function of wind speed magnitude due to reynolds number effects o sullivan et al 2015 present a study where results from the openfoam reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans solver simplefoam and les solver pisofoam are compared with experimental data taken from various anemometer sites onboard the rv knorr the les produced mean accuracy levels of 3 of the wind speed bias whereas the rans simulations produced mean accuracies of 7 they also investigated two different methods to define a wave induced flow distortion correction which was found to improve the overall accuracy of the models by up to 3 o sullivan et al 2015 4 3 anemometer correction functions much of the literature discussed so far although investigating ship induced bias on anemometer measurements focused on improvements to oceanographic data sets generated by vos the focus of the current effort however is the improvement of wind measurements for the ship operators while at sea one way of doing this is by applying correction functions to the wind data in real time before it is shown on the ship displays the following papers discuss the development of correction functions for various ships for the lha tarawa class blanc 1986a estimated that the accuracy of the type of sensor used on the lha was 2 for wind speed and 3 for wind angle this represented the best possible case in ideal conditions however wind tunnel tests demonstrated that wind measurements made at the standard anemometer locations could be in serious error due to flow distortions caused by the ship for example near the top of the forward most mast measurement errors were as much as 50 for wind speed and greater than 10 for wind angle the test conditions included neutral atmospheric stability constant sea surface roughness zero pitch and roll attitudes no aircraft on the flight deck and a motionless ship blanc concluded that corrections are necessary in order to report undisturbed relative wind readings and that corrections should be specific to both the ship class and the anemometer locations because of the spatial variations of the flow around the ship furthermore he proposed blanc 1986b that the wind speed measurement error could be minimized by developing correction algorithms for the standard anemometer locations on each class of ship based on measurements made with ship models in a wind tunnel the correction scheme presented by blanc consisted of tables for each anemometer which listed the indicated relative wind angles in increments of 5 followed by columns containing a wind speed correction and a wind angle correction the corrected relative wind was then determined by the following equations corrected rw speed 6a indicated rw speed speed correction corrected rw angle 6b indicated rw angle angle correction the typical overall accuracy of the corrected values under a variety of environmental conditions exclusive of any inherent sensor error was estimated to be 5 for wind speed and 5 for wind angle blanc 1986a it was noted that this approach could be easily adapted to an automated system that could compute and display the corrected readings on the bridge of the ship or wherever the information might be needed similar reports were also made for the virginia class blanc 1987 and nimitz class blanc and larson 1989 although the values in the correction tables varied the procedures and conclusions were effectively the same for all three ship classes thiebaux 1990 presents the results of scale model tests for three research vessels css dawson css baffin and css hudson in a boundary layer wind tunnel used to develop correction functions for the shipboard anemometers measurements were performed at the ship anemometer locations as well as a bow reference location bow reference anemometers are often used for comparative measurements from which to assess anemometer biases while still subject to flow distortions from the ship bow anemometers placed above the bow separation region if present are subject to lower biases smaller changes in biases with wind angle and lower levels of superstructure induced turbulence than their typical mast mounted counterparts as was done by blanc 1986a the correction functions developed by thiebaux were presented in tabular form with columns for indicated relative wind angle every 10 angular correction and speed correction thiebaux 1990 corrected relative wind could be determined from the indicated relative wind using appropriate table data and eq 6b this study revealed an issue with biased anemometer readings where the same indicated wind angles were measured for different actual wind angles this complicates the development of correction functions as the correct angle was indeterminate with two or three possible solutions this observation led to a requirement that anemometer measurements must be unique for a given wind angle us navair who have extensive experience and established procedures for abm is a member of relevant nato groups to which canada also belongs a current summary of their procedures is given in the report by nato advanced vehicle technology avt working group avt 217 avt 217 task group 2015 in the open literature polsky et al 2011 discuss a feasibility study for using cfd instead of wind tunnel testing for performing anemometer position evaluations apes for naval vessels this is the process the united states navy typically employs to determine the range of indicated winds for which the anemometers of a ship are useable for flight operations a detailed description of an ape is given including the test matrix instruments and analysis procedure three metrics are used when generating anemometer useful ranges urs speed distortion angle distortion and turbulence intensity if the anemometer is in the wake of a large object for a given relative wind angle then the location would likely have flow characteristics that would fail these metrics the operators would then be instructed to disregard anemometer data for this region the focus of their study was to use cfd to perform an ape on two candidate vessels for which wind tunnel data existed usns dahl and a joint high speed vessel jhsv a discussion of the procedures was given and the results between the cfd and wind tunnel data were presented overall the cfd results followed the trends of the wind tunnel data but could differ in absolute values depending on the specifics of each simulation 5 anemometer bias management anemometer bias management abm is the process of ensuring reliable wind readings at sea to be useful anemometer readings do not need to be unbiased from flow distortions but they do need to be consistent and unique 5 1 anemometer types common types of anemometers used on ships include propeller vane cup vane 2d ultrasonic and 3d ultrasonic propeller cup vane units obtain the wind speed from the rate of propeller or cup rotation and wind direction from the vane angle this method of measurement can result in some of the following issues inability to resolve horizontal wind speeds independent of vertical flow distortions that may be present at that location dynamic behaviour in unsteady winds leading to an incorrect measurement of unsteady flow characteristics the potential for measurement characteristics to be influenced by ship motion phase lag behaviour and poor low speed response the fact that horizontal wind speed reported by these units can be influenced by the wind s vertical component presents an issue when attempting to compare measurements made in a wind tunnel to those from a ship fitted with propeller cup vane anemometers an adjustment is needed to account for the vertical component s effect on the ship fitted sensors such corrections are sometimes available from the manufacturer but in cases where they are not an estimation can be used for propeller vane units which models a theoretical response of rotors to vertical flow mazzarella 1954 this correction given by eq 7 is made by multiplying the 3d velocity magnitude v 3d by the cosine squared of the flow elevation angle ϕ to get an equivalent propeller vane horizontal indicated speed v pv 7 v pv v 3d cos 2 ϕ where v pv is the equivalent speed reported by the propeller vane unit v 3d is the flow velocity magnitude including all three components and ϕ is the wind elevation angle ultrasonic anemometers measure the wind speed based on the speed of an ultrasonic pulse travelling between a set of transducer heads one for each direction component as such they are not subject to the limitations listed above they are becoming more common for new installations and mid life refits as they tend to be smaller lighter and provide more accurate wind information however ultrasonic anemometers can be susceptible to icing and corrosion electromagnetic interference from nearby emitters or from local temperature changes such as from the ship s exhaust 5 2 atmospheric boundary layer the true wind over the surface of the earth t has a vertical velocity distribution called the atmospheric boundary layer abl where wind closer to the sea surface is slower than wind higher up due to friction between the air and the ground sea surface the shape of the abl depends on a number of factors including surface roughness and the atmospheric stability the vertical profile can be estimated by a variety of models forand 2018 which can take some or all of these factors into account davenport 1960 for anemometer bias analysis a simple power law estimate eq 8 which is common for wind engineering studies and is given in the nato standardized definitions 2 2 the equation is provided in the footnotes of table d 1 of ref nato 1993 for wind and wave conditions nato 1993 is often used the standard reference height for wind speeds used in the nato document was z ref 19 5 m speeds at other heights are determined using eq 8 unless otherwise indicated by a subscript such as t 19 5 wind speeds in this paper are given for the height of the anemometer 8 t b t a z b z a α where t a is the known true wind speed at height z a z a is the vertical height above the nominal ocean surface corresponding to the known wind speed t a z b is the vertical height above the nominal ocean surface for which the true wind speed is desired t b is the true wind speed at height z b α is an empirically derived power law exponent ref nato 1993 specifies α 1 7 0 14 but ships at sea could experience profiles with α in the range of 0 09 to 0 25 davenport 1960 by definition the undistorted relative wind u is the vector sum of the true wind t which follows a power law distribution left side of fig 6 and ship generated wind s which has an idealized uniform distribution right side of fig 6 when t z and s z combine the angle between them can introduce a twisting effect on the resultant vertical distribution of u z this is illustrated in fig 7 showing winds when a ship travels in a direction perpendicular to the true wind numerous combinations of t z and s z with varying speeds and angles could sum to give the same u at the anemometer height but with different vertical profiles for u z the shape of the abl profiles can modify the development of the distorted flow fields around a ship which may impact various aspects of operation differently this issue primarily affects ships where the anemometers have been placed far from a height of interest e g the helicopter hover height corrections made to determine wind conditions at the height of interest will be subject to uncertainties in wind speed and direction due to abl variation this illustrates an aspect of anemometer bias management where the details of the ship operational need and anemometer placement are extremely important in determining the best course of action 5 3 ship orientation and motion standard practice for anemometer bias tests is to use a level static ship and would therefore neglect any effects due to a tilted ship or one undergoing motions due to ocean waves in the case of a ship s orientation the list or trim angle due to uneven loading would generally be small a few degrees at most and would not be expected to have a significant effect i e less than the precision of the full scale sensors on the wind distortion or measurement the same would be true for modest changes in ship draft ship motions due to sea states however can result in larger angles and dynamic effects which can affect both wind distortion and measurement large angles of roll and pitch can tilt the anemometer out of the horizontal plane affecting which components of the wind are being measured as most ship anemometers are only 2d measurements cannot be properly corrected for out of plane measurements a procedure to apply tilt corrections for anemometers was presented by wilczak et al 2001 though this was more applicable to non shipboard installations large angles also substantially change the shape of the ship presented to the wind distortion effects and the resulting bias could therefore be quite different for an even keeled ship and one for example rolled over to 20 thiebaux 1990 tested models in both an even keeled orientation and with static roll 20 and pitch 5 angles resulting in differing biases profiles for each condition dynamic effects were not considered rolling and pitching motions can also generate large velocities particularly for anemometers located high up on a ship s mast the movement of the anemometers through the air generates apparent wind velocities and the movement of the ship can generate dynamic wind distortions dynamic wind distortion is more complicated and would likely require ship specific studies to quantify its effects the influence of ship motion on wind measurements has been explored by reinsvold 2013 but this type of analysis is not usually included in standard anemometer bias evaluations in practice applying a low pass filter to the anemometer data using a frequency lower than ship s natural frequencies of motion is often sufficient to remove or reduce these effects 5 4 anemometer location quality metrics the quality of an anemometer location is assessed by measuring the biases and evaluating the mean and fluctuating component of the wind measured at the anemometer location that includes the distortion effects of the ship superstructures a time series x of instantaneous measurements is collected in order to perform the analysis the normalized mean wind speed horizontal component given by x ˆ and the normalized standard deviation horizontal component given by τ x are the typical assessment metrics for a given anemometer location 9 x 1 n i 1 n x i 10 x ˆ 1 n i 1 n x i u ref 11 τ x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 u ref where x is the mean of x for a given time series comprised of n discrete measurements x ˆ is the normalized value of x n is the number of elements in the time series of x u ref is undistorted wind speed at a standard reference height x i is the i th measurement in the series τ x is the normalized standard deviation of the fluctuating component of x the quality metrics used here are normalized by the undistorted wind speed at a standard reference height of 19 5m u 19 5 the height was selected to be consistent with the nato reference wind height for sea state definition nato 1993 this approach has been adopted by the co authors as it facilitates the comparison of bias from ships that may have different anemometer heights in other contexts a different reference height may be more meaningful the qualities of a good anemometer location are insensitive to reynolds number which is indicated by stable values of x ˆ with wind speed and outside of wake regions and flapping shear layers which is indicated by levels of τ x which are on the order of the turbulence intensity in the undistorted atmospheric wind and also by low rates of change of x ˆ and τ x with wind angle statistics are expressed only for the horizontal component due to the fact that many measurement devices are limited in their measuring capability to the horizontal plane and the fact that the determination of undistorted wind which is inherently horizontal is the goal the mean of the vertical distortion if measured can also indicate the level of flow distortion however the presence of vertical distortions is not necessarily an indicator of poor placement also the unsteady component of the vertical distortion is unlikely to provide insight not already captured by the level of unsteadiness in the horizontal plane 5 5 bias correction factors bias factors used both for defining the magnitudes of bias as well as for their correction are given in eq 12b the angular bias β θ is the difference between the measured m and undistorted u wind angles and the speed bias β v is the ratio of the measured to undistorted wind speeds note that bias is a function of anemometer location wind angle and to some extent wind speed see section 6 1 the relationship between measured and undistorted winds is represented graphically in fig 8 note that variations of eq 12b could also be defined by reversing the order of θ m and θ u in eq 12a and or inverting the ratio in eq 12b other researchers have used these variations such as eq 6b by blanc 1986a 12a β θ θ m θ u 12b β v m u where θ m is the mean azimuth angle of m w r t the ship centreline θ u is the mean azimuth angle of u w r t the ship centreline m is the mean 2d horizontal wind speed of m u is the mean 2d horizontal wind speed of u β θ is the anemometer angle bias correction β v is the anemometer speed factor correction 5 6 accuracy requirements anemometer measurements are subject to uncertainties resulting from a number of sources including superstructure induced biases aerodynamic uncertainties in biases possible sources reynolds number sensitivity sensitivity to the abl and instrument uncertainties possible sources unexpected dynamic behaviour alignment issues instrument calibration and or resolution installation variation for example uncertainty levels for wind measurements could be defined such that they must be no greater 5 for wind angle and 2knots for wind speed below 40knots and 5 above 40knots uncertainty targets should include both the accuracy of the installation and measurement uncertainties associated with the instruments used at sea 6 bias measurement considerations the standard method for evaluating ship anemometer bias is through model scale testing in a wind tunnel and or cfd simulations the procedure is essentially the same in both cases a representative version of the above water geometry of the ship is generated the model is then placed in the wind tunnel or computational domain and exposed to a range of known wind conditions while measurements are taken at the anemometer position s for each wind condition and location the difference between the measured winds m and the known undistorted winds u are then used to characterize the angle and speed biases the following sections describe the process in more detail and describe important considerations when making wind bias measurements including scaling model fidelity propeller vane corrections turbulence intensity and the abl 6 1 scaling achieving meaningful results from scale model tests requires that the experiments are designed to comply with the principles of similitude as physical phenomena can be governed by different and sometimes opposing conditions for similitude consideration should be given to ensure that behaviours of interest are being modelled correctly for ship airwake studies the similitude parameters required for dynamic and kinematic similitude respectively are reynolds number re defined in section 2 and reduced frequency f as defined below 13 f ω l v where f is the reduced frequency v is the wind velocity l is the characteristic body dimension and ω is frequency these two parameters cannot be matched simultaneously in a conventional atmospheric wind tunnel however as discussed in section 2 dynamic similitude does not require reynolds number matching if the flow is in a regime where the flow characteristics are consistent across the range of relevant reynolds numbers both at model and full scale at very low wind speeds reynolds similitude cannot be maintained therefore a successful experimental design requires that this lower limit occurs below the scaled wind speed of interest for ship airwake studies a lower limit of 10knots full scale is generally used where the influence of wind at this speed on operations is limited the reduced frequency f is used to scale the relative frequencies for testing and analysis by eq 13 for a reduced scale model the frequencies of fluctuations in the flow for the same wind speed occur faster by the same amount eq 14e illustrates the interplay between the three parameters size speed and frequency all of which can be manipulated to optimize the experimental design while maintaining kinematic similitude 14a f m f f 14b f m f f ω m ω f l m l f v f v m λ ω λ l λ v 1 14c λ l l m l f 14d λ v v m v f 14e λ ω ω m ω f λ v λ l λ t λ l λ v where x m x f are parameters x at model and full scale respectively λ l is the geometric scale factor λ v is the wind velocity scale factor λ ω is the frequency scale factor λ t is the time scale factor the equations for reduced frequency scaling are relevant for ensuring sufficient sampling time and rate to capture the dominant effects of interest and also for spectral analyses provided the tests are conducted in appropriate reynolds number conditions then measurements of flow speed at anemometer locations can be normalized directly by the reference wind speed for the test point and no further scaling is required for stationary statistical quantities like mean and standard deviation 6 2 model fidelity to minimize effort and cost there is an incentive for both numerical and physical model testing to simplify the geometry of the ship model as much as possible this is done by either excluding or reducing the complexity of details and features of the ship s structure for these studies it is acceptable to remove details on the order 1m or less unless these details are within 10 object dimensions of the anemometer position or could be reasonably expected to cast a significant wake on the anemometer for any relative wind angle compound objects such as lattice masts or multiple repeating instances of small objects can have an effective characteristic geometry that is on the order of the compound object rather than the individual pieces in this case the object should be treated as a porous object where many studies estimating drag and wake topology for porous objects exist due to reynolds number effects on the individual elements of a compound object or objects where the reynolds number regime at model scale is not representative of the full scale equivalent geometric scaling does not always produce an equivalent flow structure a model for equivalent drag must be developed using literature or testing of the object itself in order to accurately reproduce the flow effect of these types of objects at model scale therefore the appropriate simplification of a ship geometry for adequate simulation requires judgement calls and experience to do correctly 6 3 atmospheric boundary layer the simple power law profile described in section 5 2 using α 1 7 0 14 from nato 1993 is considered sufficient for simulations of ship anemometer biases and can be generated using a series of triangular spires for wind tunnel tests irwin 1979 a power law profile with this coefficient value represents average conditions found at sea 6 4 sampling rates and durations ship induced wind distortion is an inherently unsteady process involving turbulent flow fluctuations covering a broad range of length and time scales measurement of the wind therefore needs to be done over a sufficient duration to extract meaningful statistics the measurement technique whether wind tunnel at sea or cfd impacts the appropriate duration some preliminary estimations of the primary frequencies that may exist in the flow can be done using vortex shedding theory zdravkovich 1997 from the ship as a whole and individually for its major structural features a more practical approach though is to perform a sensitivity analysis on the measurement duration to ensure that it is long enough to produce statistically significant mean and root mean square rms values the sampling rate for the measurements must be sufficient to resolve the time scales of interest at the nrc wind tunnel scale measurements supporting ship helicopter operations are typically made at 5000hz more than sufficient to capture turbulence frequencies related to ship anemometer bias measurement durations at model scale may theoretically only need to be a few seconds but in practice wind tunnel data is normally collected for periods in the range of 10 to 30s cfd simulations for anemometer bias should be performed as transient rather than steady state in this way the fluctuating components which are used as metrics for evaluating bias can be captured timestep size in cfd applications are driven by factors such as the numerical scheme and grid dimensions but should be at least small enough to capture frequencies of interest simulations also require some time for the flow to properly develop from its initial conditions at startup before measurements at anemometer positions should be made in the case of ship trials conducted at sea marine anemometers typically report wind measurements at 1hz though commonly used ultrasonic sensors can go as high as 30hz at sea inherent turbulence in the ambient wind as well as ship motions can also affect measurement times depending on conditions durations for trial measurements can be as low as 2 to 5min though for the dedicated trials discussed in section 8 runs were each at least 15min 7 anemometer bias analysis 7 1 wind tunnel results an example of wind tunnel results for anemometer bias and their use for abm is given in this section the selected case is the port side anemometer position of a halifax class frigate this class of ship is fitted with two port and stbd anemometers near the top of its mast as shown fig 9 the wind tunnel anemometer bias tests were conducted at the nrc 9m wind tunnel facility in ottawa using a 1 50 scale model of the ship mounted on a turntable as shown in fig 10 flow measurements at each anemometer location were taken using a single cobra probe see fig 11 suspended above the wind tunnel floor by a structure mounted downstream of the turn table a cobra probe turbulent flow instrumentation 2019 is a fast response four hole pressure sensor that provides dynamic three component velocity and static pressure measurements within an acceptance cone of 45 the acceptance cone limits the range of measurement for example the probe as positioned for the test can only accurately measure flow vectors that are not distorted more than 45 vertically or horizontally from the probe tip s longitudinal axis the following procedure was performed for each of the anemometer locations first the three component wind velocity was measured without the ship installed this was done to determine the characteristics of the undistorted wind and the baseline turbulence intensity next the model was positioned in the tunnel and the three component wind velocity was measured at the anemometer position s the ship was then rotated w r t the tunnel air flow direction using the turntable to change θ u and the flow measurements were taken again 3 3 the cobra probe sensor was always aligned to the wind tunnel flow direction and did not rotate with the ship this process was repeated for the full range of relative wind angles the halifax class used propeller vane anemometers at the time of the wind tunnel testing so the measured 2d wind speed results from the wind tunnel were adjusted for vertical velocity as described in section 5 1 the bias results and location quality metrics for the port anemometer are given in fig 12 the top two charts show the results for speed and angle bias calculated using eq 12b for winds coming to the port side anemometer on windward side there was some moderate direction bias of 5 as well as a reduction in 2d wind speed by as much as 20 in port beam winds the 2d horizontal speed decreases but the normalized vertical velocity bottom chart increases the total 3d wind speed would therefore increase in port winds due to the strong up draft created as the wind is accelerated upward and over the broad side of the ship as can be seen in fig 9 the port anemometer is on the leeward side of the mast for starboard winds and is in a wake region for certain relative wind angles the wind tunnel results particularly speed bias clearly show this effect as the wind speed drops to nearly zero for starboard beam winds when the anemometer is leeward of the mast structure the edges of the wake are characterized by the rapid changes in speed bias and the centre of the wake is characterized by the greatest velocity deficit another important factor to consider is the turbulence intensity τ v using eq 11 shown in the fourth plot of fig 12 the data shown are for the difference in turbulence intensity δ τ v measured at the anemometer position from the baseline value taken in an empty tunnel large values of δ τ v indicate that the wind flow is highly turbulent in these cases measurements may be unstable and consequently cannot be corrected for the example data shown the δ τ v is low for port winds indicating stable and correctable bias higher and rapidly changing δ τ v for starboard winds suggest more turbulent and unstable conditions particularly in mast shear layers note that both the speed bias and turbulence metrics are needed for evaluation for example there are low turbulence levels in the centre of the wake at g90 but this is simply a consequence of the nearly zero wind speed in the wake of the mast and not an indication that the measurements here are correctable 7 2 useful range one of the primary objectives of ship anemometer bias analysis is to determine the useful range for when data can be used and when it should be discarded it is important that operators are aware when sensor data is invalid due to excessive bias or instability useful data occur when the anemometer is in wind conditions that can produce consistent repeatable measurements that are within or can be corrected to be within the required accuracy see section 5 6 the specific criteria for defining useful range will depend on the requirements for the data as well as the characteristics of the bias profile for example polsky et al 2011 uses criteria based on threshold values for β θ β v τ v as well as their gradients in general terms anemometers should not be used if they are within or on the edge of separated flow regions with highly turbulent flow these are typically seen but not limited to when the sensor is downwind of some object or structure they can be identified by large values of turbulence intensity inside separated regions and large gradients in bias metrics at the edges for the data in fig 12 the useful range was defined as covering relative wind angles from g170 clockwise through all port wind angles to g10 as illustrated by fig 13 although port beam winds did exhibit bias the wind flow was stable i e low values of τ and therefore amenable to correction in contrast the majority of the starboard wind angles caused the sensor to be in lee of the mast and resulted in highly distorted and chaotic flows this behaviour can be observed on the real ship the leeward anemometer propeller vane type will sometimes spin in circles in response to the mast s wake flow ships should be fitted with anemometers located such that the combination of their useful ranges provides full coverage over 360 of undistorted wind angles overlap of useful ranges is recommended for best results for the halifax class the starboard anemometer data has a mostly mirror image bias profile as the port anemometer it therefore has overlap for both headwinds and tailwinds so that together both anemometers can provide the ship with full valid measurement coverage 7 3 bias correction if the airflow distortion to the anemometer is significant it may be helpful to apply a correction to remove or at least reduce the resulting bias this can be done by using the same data from fig 12 but truncated to the useful range and plotted against θ m instead of θ u fig 14 shows this version of the data along with that collected for the starboard anemometer smooth curves are also fitted to each data set the bias correction procedure would be to first check that the measured angle is within the anemometer s useful range then to use the fitted curves from fig 14 to determine the relevant speed and angle bias then to apply eq 12b to calculate θ u and u applying these corrections can avoid ambiguity from sensors that have different bias profiles using the current example for headwinds the port anemometer would measure g5 while the starboard anemometer measures r5 but the corrected values would be consistent 7 3 1 anemometer selection although seemingly straight forward bias correction has a complication where incorrect data can be displayed this is when an anemometer is outside of its useful range in terms of the undistorted wind angles θ u but due to it being in a highly turbulent zone can report wind angles θ u that appear to be within its useful range identifying these situations cannot be done in isolation instead requiring data from one or more other anemometers the procedure for selecting the anemometer s that are actually in their useful range as opposed to merely indicating that they are may depend on the specific bias profiles of a given ship however invalid ranges for anemometers are most commonly caused because they are leeward of some localized object or structure in these cases the wind speed on the leeward sensors will be lower than those on the windward side therefore the anemometer with the higher wind speed should be selected this sort of procedure could easily be included in an automatic bias correction algorithm provided the system had simultaneous access to all wind sensor sources 7 4 improving bias in certain cases where abm analysis has been performed the results may show that there are relative wind angles for which no anemometer location can provide useful data essentially creating blind spot s for wind measurement a less severe result could be that some wind angles within the useful range determined by the abm analysis may produce poor data in practice at sea in these cases if there is a requirement for accurate wind data such as for aircraft operations then there are several options for improving the bias profiles these include modifying superstructure features to improve flow quality re locating anemometers to more favourable positions adding additional anemometers to less biased positions improving the anemometer sensor type alignment calibration etc or applying appropriate constraints on wind sensitive operations for conditions affected by blind spots or poor unreliable data all of these approaches have different merit and feasibility considerations depending on the application 7 5 true wind although the true wind t is often treated as a given in most diagrams for a ship at sea it is not measured directly as the true wind can be determined using the anemometer measurements bias in the relative wind will result in a biased assessment of the true wind therefore the following steps based on eq 4 re arranged for eq 15 can be used to calculate the true wind vector using the corrected anemometer readings 15 t u s 1 determine s using the ship s known speed course and heading 2 correct for anemometer bias section 7 3 to get an estimate of u from the measured relative wind m and 3 use eq 15 to estimate t and eq 2 to convert between relative angles w r t the ship and absolute direction w r t compass north 8 validating bias when conducting model scale experiments or cfd simulations it can be helpful to gain confidence in their results by validating them against real world full scale data this is best done on a dedicated sea trial on an appropriately instrumented ship such a trial was performed in 2017 as part of the anemometer bias study conducted for the halifax class frigates of the royal canadian navy the primary difference in attempting to evaluate bias in a wind tunnel and on a ship at sea is that in a wind tunnel the undistorted wind u is known and controllable at sea u cannot be measured directly from the ship because of the very anemometer bias that the trial is being conducted to evaluate it may be possible to measure t using other sources such as buoys or small craft in practice though these are not always available and or could overly constrain trial activities their use also introduces additional uncertainties instead the common approach is to temporarily fit the ship with additional reference anemometers for the trial these reference sensors should be placed in areas where bias can be expected to be small stable and consistent the bias metrics for a given target sensor can then be calculated using eq 16b with respect to a reference sensor as opposed to u provided that the anemometer bias at the reference anemometer locations was also measured in the wind tunnel then β θ r and β vr can be calculated and directly compared with the results from a sea trial 16a β θ r θ m θ mr 16b β vr m m r where θ m is the mean measured relative wind angle of the target anemometer θ mr is the mean measured relative wind angle of the reference anemometer m is the mean measured 2d horizontal wind speed of the target anemometer m r is the mean measured 2d horizontal wind speed of the reference anemometer β θ r is the anemometer angle bias of the target anemometer w r t to the reference anemometer β vr is the anemometer speed bias of the target anemometer w r t to the reference anemometer a potential drawback of this approach is that if major differences were seen between the model and at sea data then it would not be obvious whether the differences were due to issues at the target reference or both anemometer locations it is also possible that the two locations could have errors that cancel each other out however consistent agreement between multiple sensors over a range of conditions would be very strong evidence of validation three reference sensors were used on the halifax class sea trial at the bow stern and in front the mast the bow reference anemometer shown in fig 15 was attached to the top of a pole such that its measurement point was 5m above the deck although ostensibly in clear air wind tunnel results showed that the bow location still experienced biasing due to the ship hull this bias was stable except for tailwinds making it a viable source for reference wind in addition to the extra reference sensors two 3d ultrasonic anemometers were also fitted directly above the ship s existing propeller vane anemometers these were used to acquire higher resolution data as well as to evaluate any potential benefit of moving the ship s anemometers to new slightly higher positions the trial consisted of performing straight track runs at constant speed for several minutes while logging data the ship course was adjusted for each run to achieve a new relative wind angle ship speed was set so as to maintain at least 15knots of relative wind speed as measured by the windward reference ultrasonic anemometer example results comparing data from the trial to the wind tunnel are given in fig 16 these are for the two ultrasonic anemometers temporarily fitted directly above the ship s port and starboard sensors using the bow anemometer as the reference wind wind tunnel data for the bow location was only measured out to beam winds as any wind coming from behind the ship would be heavily distorted the figure is therefore limited from r90 through headwinds to g90 the results show good agreement between the two sets of data there appears to be a minor upward shift in the angular bias for the sea trial port anemometer compared with the wind tunnel but this could be due an alignment issue of the ship s sensor small differences would be expected for the speed bias due to the effects of different vertical atmospheric velocity profiles as discussed in section 5 2 various combinations of target and reference anemometers were examined and most showed good agreement between the sea trial and wind tunnel with the exception of the ship s existing propeller vane anemometers bias trends at these locations were not consistent with the wind tunnel nor the ultrasonics located directly above them various explanations were considered such as whether the effect of vertical atmospheric velocity was more significant than the simplified adjustment discussed in section 5 1 or whether the dynamic nature of the devices causes susceptibility to errors induced by ship motion the issue has not been investigated further as the fleet s older propeller vane units will soon be replaced by new ultrasonic units which have good agreement to wind tunnel data still the unexpected behaviour of the propeller vane sensors highlights the importance of performing full scale validation studies based on these sea trial results new revised bias correction profiles specifically tailored for the propeller vane units were created so they can be used until the ship anemometer upgrades are completed 9 conclusions a ship and its structures create distortions that affect the accuracy of wind measurements made by its anemometers bias in wind readings is a particularly important issue for ships which operate aircraft although wind distortion cannot be eliminated ship anemometer bias can be quantified and managed in a way that can restore the accuracy and usefulness of data the abm process first involves assessing the ship induced bias present at actual or proposed anemometer locations using physical model testing or numerical simulation important considerations when performing these assessments are flow features that cause anemometer bias scaling and modelling necessary to ensure appropriate simulation the impact of complicating real world elements such as the abl and ship motion anemometer type and its characteristics and how information is displayed this paper provides definitions for the important quantities to consider in abm and the concept of anemometer useful range following the process laid out in the paper the resulting bias profiles for a given anemometer system can then be used to assess the proposed locations to determine whether they are sufficient to provide stable measurements for the full range

21476,wind measurements made on ships are used for general navigation maritime operations and in some cases logged to support oceanographic research they are particularly important for aircraft carrying ships as operations can be restricted in certain wind conditions shipboard wind measurements are subject to biases and inaccuracies as a result of air flow changing as it passes over and around the ship its structures and features ship induced wind distortion and the resulting bias on anemometer readings can range from insignificant to severe anemometer bias cannot be completely eliminated for all conditions but it can be managed so that reliable and accurate assessments of wind at sea can be identified this paper describes the basic concepts related to ship wind distortion along with procedures and considerations on how bias can be quantified using simulations or model tests and validated using sea trials an example case of a helicopter carrying frigate is used to demonstrate the process of quantifying bias calculating metrics determining useful ranges and developing and applying correction functions wind tunnel measurements and a sea trial successfully demonstrated and validated the proposed ship anemometer bias management methodology keywords anemometer bias sea trial ship wind measurements relative wind model tests wind tunnel 1 introduction wind measurements made on ships are subject to distortion as the air flow moves over and around the ship the degree of distortion depends on factors such as the wind angle and speed ship geometry and the location of the sensor wind measurements are not only used for general navigation but are often logged to provide data for oceanographic research wind measurements are particularly important for ships which launch and recover aircraft as these operations can be unsafe or unachievable in certain wind conditions ship induced wind distortion cannot be eliminated but steps can be taken to evaluate the extent to which measurements are biased and to develop a means to correct and or otherwise manage the issue to ensure operators are presented with useful data on their wind environment the royal canadian navy is in the process of a recapitalization involving a mid life refit of its patrol frigates the introduction of new marine helicopters and the acquisition of three new classes of helicopter carrying naval ship anemometer bias analysis and ship airwake studies for aircraft operations are being conducted for both existing and future ships this is to ensure accurate wind data are available to operators and that airwake characteristics will be suitable for a broad wind envelope for aircraft this paper describes the methods used in these studies along with guidelines for evaluation and use that are generally applicable to naval and commercial vessels alike taken together these processes are referred to as anemometer bias management abm and are used to ensure reliable wind readings at sea this paper begins with an overview of the distorting effect of bodies on the flow and a literature review of the work previously performed on ship abm followed by a discussion of modelling and validation techniques for evaluating wind bias design guidelines and considerations are then given along with general strategies for managing ship anemometer bias 2 flow distortions around ships the measurement and understanding of flow distortions around ships is essential for managing the biases that affect ship anemometer readings bluff bodies modify the incoming flow in one or more of the following ways due to skin friction flow moving along the surface of a body will be slowed near the surface resulting in a boundary layer fig 1 a the shape of the body may also induce changes in flow direction fig 1 b or speed fig 1 c for these first three distortion types the flow is said to be attached with the flow remaining largely in the freestream direction with the unsteady characteristics mainly unchanged if the flow encounters a rapid change in body shape depending on the shape and the pressure gradient on the body surface the flow may separate which results in a shear layer fig 1 d where the flow speed changes rapidly from the freestream speed to a region of velocity deficit and recirculation behind the body shear layers flap in space and time fig 1 e and promote the development of vortices due to the change in speed fig 1 f shear layers separate more consistently from sharp edged objects than from round edges fig 1 g flow separations are characterized by increased levels of vorticity and turbulence an open separation fig 1 h results in a turbulent wake depending on the geometry of the bluff body a separated flow may be subject to reattachment and a closed separation that results in a separation bubble fig 1 i conservatively speaking a flow can be considered to be unaffected by a bluff body at a distance greater than 10 characteristic body dimensions away from the body therefore any practical anemometer placement will be subject to biases induced by the overall ship superstructure and hull this concept is illustrated in fig 2 in addition biases are also induced by smaller features such as masts or other ship mounted equipment within 10 characteristic lengths of the anemometer position since practical anemometer positions will undoubtedly be subject to biases a practical goal of placement is ensuring that the biases are consistent across a range of operating conditions and that they are unique meaning the true flow can be calculated from the measurement if bias characteristics are known the topology of the flow around a ship is governed by the non dimensional reynolds number 1 re ρ v l μ where ρ is the flow density v is the characteristic flow speed l is the characteristic body dimension and μ is the flow dynamic viscosity the characteristic body dimension is the dimension that dominates the development of the flow topology for example in the case of a circular cylinder the diameter is the characteristic dimension even though the length may be much greater in the case of a backwards facing step which leads to a separation bubble the characteristic dimension is the step height the characteristic flow speed should be close to the speed that dominates the development of the flow topology for bluff body flow studies the characteristic flow speed is usually the reference flow speed measured in the absence of the bluff body the height of the reference speed also needs to be specified for bluff body aerodynamics applications near the surface of the earth due to the atmospheric boundary layer abl see section 5 2 the abl results from the same physical causes as the flow shown in fig 1 a the reynolds number is the ratio of the inertial forces to the viscous forces in the flow the drag forces on a bluff body and the subsequent wake topology are nominally dependent on the reynolds number low reynolds number flows laminar regime are characterized by gradual changes in forces with changes in reynolds number the transitional range of reynolds numbers is associated with rapid changes in forces and flow topology with changes in reynolds number high reynolds number flows turbulent flow regime are characterized by a general insensitivity to further changes in reynolds number these ranges are illustrated in fig 3 showing a typical relationship shape for circular cylinders the surface roughness body shape incoming flow turbulence level and other factors influence the reynolds numbers over which the three flow regimes laminar transitional turbulent are present of particular importance for ship airwake or anemometer studies is the reynolds number where the flow can be assumed to be fully turbulent at full scale and also for testing at model scale to ensure similarity broadly speaking separations from sharp edges and or large features such as the deck edge the hangar the bow are less sensitive to reynolds number than separations from rounded or small features such as posts lattice masts fences because the flow topology is more dependent on the shape of the body than on the flow itself for ship airwake studies involving the flow in proximity to the flight deck a lower reynolds number limit of 11 000 using the beam as the characteristic dimension is typically used for reynolds similitude assuming the ship is largely sharp edged healey 1992 by comparison flow over a cylinder is usually considered to be dependent on reynolds number up to a value of 10 6 as a result the study of anemometer biases requires a more subtle understanding of reynolds number effect since anemometers are often placed within 10 characteristic body dimensions of round ship features and equipment unstable flow topologies for some wind conditions may render anemometer biases inconsistent and therefore unusable or uncorrectable reynolds number effects are a fundamental aspect of modelling measurement and interpretation of anemometer biases which will be discussed at length in this paper an understanding of the topological stability of the air flow is needed if model scale or shipboard measurements are to be interpreted properly 3 wind definitions and conventions wind direction in this paper adheres to the convention used in meteorology and by mariners it is the direction where the wind is coming from e g a north wind is where the air moves from the north to the south and a starboard wind is where air moves from starboard to port consequently and unless specified otherwise wind vectors 1 1 even when explicitly using the coming from convention there is no consensus on how wind vector arrows should be oriented in diagrams depending on the context arrows can either point to the wind s coming from or going to directions in the figures will point to the coming from direction note that this approach is opposite to the convention used most in fluid dynamics where direction is defined by where the flow is going to wind direction is given either with respect to the compass rose e g 0 to 359 where 0 is true north or relative to the ship centreline converting between the two references can be done using eq 2 when using a relative reference the terms red r and green g winds refer to port and starboard winds respectively as shown in fig 4 although 3d effects of wind distortion can be significant for some anemometer placements the vertical component of wind is rarely measured by ship s anemometers therefore only wind in the horizontal plane is considered 2 θ w ψ w ψ h where θ w is the wind direction relative to the ship centreline ψ w is the wind direction relative to true north ψ h is the ship heading relative to true north fig 5 shows a diagram illustrating the various wind vectors defined below used in evaluating anemometer biases from the perspective of a ship at sea only two of these vectors are known initially the ship generated wind s from the ship speed and course and the measured wind m from the anemometer s the goal of bias management is to account for the distortions in m caused by the air moving over and around the ship to determine the corrected relative wind c as discussed in later sections these vectors are functions of wind direction and height above sea level and in some cases wind speed true wind true wind t is the ambient atmospheric wind flowing over the ocean surface it has a vertical velocity distribution as a result of the abl where wind speed increases with height above the water unless otherwise specified true wind speed is given at the anemometer height ship generated wind ship generated wind s is created by the movement of the ship through still air it is treated as an idealized concept where the ship has no effect on the air through which it moves the ship generated wind speed is defined in eq 3 as the ship speed v s in the direction of the ship course over ground ψ c using the coming from convention 3 s v s ψ c note the ship course ψ c does not always align with the ship heading ψ h the difference between them called drift angle can be substantial for certain operating conditions undistorted relative wind undistorted relative wind u is the idealized concept of relative wind as the vector sum of the true and ship generated winds this is the relative wind that would be measured on a ship that had no effect on the air around it 4 u t s measured relative wind measured relative wind m is the wind as measured at a specific point on the ship the measured relative wind is a combination of the true and ship generated winds and also includes all of the distortion effects caused as the air is forced to flow over and around the ship structures corrected relative wind corrected relative wind c is an estimate of the idealized undistorted wind u that is made by applying a correction developed for example from wind tunnel data to the measured wind m it is not always possible to apply corrections to m 5 c u 4 literature review 4 1 preliminary measurements of bias effects on ships observations of distortions in wind measurements made from ships were reported as early as the mid 1960s these observations came mostly from research vessels where measurements from the mast were compared with other sources such as nearby buoys or from shore based sensors bogorodskiy 1966 augstein et al 1974 hoeber 1977 pierson 1990 bias effects at different locations on a ship were also observed through comparisons of wind measurements on a ship s mast and various extended booms ching 1976 kahma and leppãranta 1981 kidwell and seguin 1978 rahmstorf 1989 blunt 1991 these effects were quantified through the use of scaled model wind tunnel tests which estimated the flow distortion error at potential shipboard anemometer sites to be as large as 40 elliot 1981 4 2 ship wind measurement for oceanographic studies a large focus of the published work for wind measurement bias on ships came from the scientists who use wind measurements and other data from thousands of ships globally as part of the world meteorological organization wmo voluntary observing ships vos there was enough distortion of meteorological measurements induced by ships that it was adversely affecting weather and sea state forecasts hoeber 1977 blanc 1986b the national oceanography centre noc in southampton uk has performed a considerable amount of work on the subject of ship anemometer speed bias which focused primarily on improving data from vos for oceanographic studies these studies include full scale measurements from research vessels wind tunnel model tests and the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd to quantify ship based anemometer bias moat 1994 taylor et al 1999 yelland et al 2002 moat 2003 moat et al 2004b a 2005 moat and yelland 2005 moat et al 2006b a moat and yelland 2009 several of these studies consisted of steady state cfd simulations to predict the speed biases for anemometers mounted on a mast located at the bow of the ship moat et al 2006b moat and yelland 2009 yelland et al 2002 additional series of cfd simulations were conducted to predict wind speed biases on generic container ships in order to improve the wind speeds reported by vos simulations of generic container ships were used to develop predictions of wind speed bias as a function of bridge height in bow and beam winds the speed bias on top of the bridge of these container models ranged from 11 to 100 indicating that regions of flow acceleration and regions of reversed flow were present as a result of the bridge geometry general guidance for anemometer positioning suggested by moat et al 2006a 2005 included placement of anemometers in regions where shear is low near the forward edge of large structures such as the bridge and to avoid regions where wakes are present outside of the noc other researchers were also using cfd to evaluate flow distortions at ship anemometer positions in order to improve observation data popinet et al 2004 presented results from a cfd study using the unsteady large eddy simulation les research code gerris to investigate the characteristics of the mean airflow and the turbulent wake around the ship rv tangaroa good agreement over a full range of relative wind angles was found between the simulations and measurements from a corresponding sea trial at several positions in regions of both high and low flow distortion they concluded that both the normalized wind speed and normalized standard deviation were only weakly dependent on wind speed ship speed ship motion and sea state but strongly dependent on relative wind angle while anemometer placement does affect the dependence of anemometer readings on speed and motion related factors biases that depend on wind angle only are preferred o sullivan et al 2013 presented results of a study using the cfd code openfoam to simulate the errors in wind speed measurements caused by flow distortion on the rv celtic explorer and validated the predictions with full scale data simulations were performed over a range of relative wind angles from r60 to g60 and velocities from 10 to 50knots the numerical results were within 12 of experimental measurements which could possibly be improved using different cfd processes specifically tuned for unsteady ship airwakes it was also shown that although the wind angle is a dominant factor in flow distortion errors popinet et al 2004 yelland et al 2002 these errors can also change as a function of wind speed magnitude due to reynolds number effects o sullivan et al 2015 present a study where results from the openfoam reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans solver simplefoam and les solver pisofoam are compared with experimental data taken from various anemometer sites onboard the rv knorr the les produced mean accuracy levels of 3 of the wind speed bias whereas the rans simulations produced mean accuracies of 7 they also investigated two different methods to define a wave induced flow distortion correction which was found to improve the overall accuracy of the models by up to 3 o sullivan et al 2015 4 3 anemometer correction functions much of the literature discussed so far although investigating ship induced bias on anemometer measurements focused on improvements to oceanographic data sets generated by vos the focus of the current effort however is the improvement of wind measurements for the ship operators while at sea one way of doing this is by applying correction functions to the wind data in real time before it is shown on the ship displays the following papers discuss the development of correction functions for various ships for the lha tarawa class blanc 1986a estimated that the accuracy of the type of sensor used on the lha was 2 for wind speed and 3 for wind angle this represented the best possible case in ideal conditions however wind tunnel tests demonstrated that wind measurements made at the standard anemometer locations could be in serious error due to flow distortions caused by the ship for example near the top of the forward most mast measurement errors were as much as 50 for wind speed and greater than 10 for wind angle the test conditions included neutral atmospheric stability constant sea surface roughness zero pitch and roll attitudes no aircraft on the flight deck and a motionless ship blanc concluded that corrections are necessary in order to report undisturbed relative wind readings and that corrections should be specific to both the ship class and the anemometer locations because of the spatial variations of the flow around the ship furthermore he proposed blanc 1986b that the wind speed measurement error could be minimized by developing correction algorithms for the standard anemometer locations on each class of ship based on measurements made with ship models in a wind tunnel the correction scheme presented by blanc consisted of tables for each anemometer which listed the indicated relative wind angles in increments of 5 followed by columns containing a wind speed correction and a wind angle correction the corrected relative wind was then determined by the following equations corrected rw speed 6a indicated rw speed speed correction corrected rw angle 6b indicated rw angle angle correction the typical overall accuracy of the corrected values under a variety of environmental conditions exclusive of any inherent sensor error was estimated to be 5 for wind speed and 5 for wind angle blanc 1986a it was noted that this approach could be easily adapted to an automated system that could compute and display the corrected readings on the bridge of the ship or wherever the information might be needed similar reports were also made for the virginia class blanc 1987 and nimitz class blanc and larson 1989 although the values in the correction tables varied the procedures and conclusions were effectively the same for all three ship classes thiebaux 1990 presents the results of scale model tests for three research vessels css dawson css baffin and css hudson in a boundary layer wind tunnel used to develop correction functions for the shipboard anemometers measurements were performed at the ship anemometer locations as well as a bow reference location bow reference anemometers are often used for comparative measurements from which to assess anemometer biases while still subject to flow distortions from the ship bow anemometers placed above the bow separation region if present are subject to lower biases smaller changes in biases with wind angle and lower levels of superstructure induced turbulence than their typical mast mounted counterparts as was done by blanc 1986a the correction functions developed by thiebaux were presented in tabular form with columns for indicated relative wind angle every 10 angular correction and speed correction thiebaux 1990 corrected relative wind could be determined from the indicated relative wind using appropriate table data and eq 6b this study revealed an issue with biased anemometer readings where the same indicated wind angles were measured for different actual wind angles this complicates the development of correction functions as the correct angle was indeterminate with two or three possible solutions this observation led to a requirement that anemometer measurements must be unique for a given wind angle us navair who have extensive experience and established procedures for abm is a member of relevant nato groups to which canada also belongs a current summary of their procedures is given in the report by nato advanced vehicle technology avt working group avt 217 avt 217 task group 2015 in the open literature polsky et al 2011 discuss a feasibility study for using cfd instead of wind tunnel testing for performing anemometer position evaluations apes for naval vessels this is the process the united states navy typically employs to determine the range of indicated winds for which the anemometers of a ship are useable for flight operations a detailed description of an ape is given including the test matrix instruments and analysis procedure three metrics are used when generating anemometer useful ranges urs speed distortion angle distortion and turbulence intensity if the anemometer is in the wake of a large object for a given relative wind angle then the location would likely have flow characteristics that would fail these metrics the operators would then be instructed to disregard anemometer data for this region the focus of their study was to use cfd to perform an ape on two candidate vessels for which wind tunnel data existed usns dahl and a joint high speed vessel jhsv a discussion of the procedures was given and the results between the cfd and wind tunnel data were presented overall the cfd results followed the trends of the wind tunnel data but could differ in absolute values depending on the specifics of each simulation 5 anemometer bias management anemometer bias management abm is the process of ensuring reliable wind readings at sea to be useful anemometer readings do not need to be unbiased from flow distortions but they do need to be consistent and unique 5 1 anemometer types common types of anemometers used on ships include propeller vane cup vane 2d ultrasonic and 3d ultrasonic propeller cup vane units obtain the wind speed from the rate of propeller or cup rotation and wind direction from the vane angle this method of measurement can result in some of the following issues inability to resolve horizontal wind speeds independent of vertical flow distortions that may be present at that location dynamic behaviour in unsteady winds leading to an incorrect measurement of unsteady flow characteristics the potential for measurement characteristics to be influenced by ship motion phase lag behaviour and poor low speed response the fact that horizontal wind speed reported by these units can be influenced by the wind s vertical component presents an issue when attempting to compare measurements made in a wind tunnel to those from a ship fitted with propeller cup vane anemometers an adjustment is needed to account for the vertical component s effect on the ship fitted sensors such corrections are sometimes available from the manufacturer but in cases where they are not an estimation can be used for propeller vane units which models a theoretical response of rotors to vertical flow mazzarella 1954 this correction given by eq 7 is made by multiplying the 3d velocity magnitude v 3d by the cosine squared of the flow elevation angle ϕ to get an equivalent propeller vane horizontal indicated speed v pv 7 v pv v 3d cos 2 ϕ where v pv is the equivalent speed reported by the propeller vane unit v 3d is the flow velocity magnitude including all three components and ϕ is the wind elevation angle ultrasonic anemometers measure the wind speed based on the speed of an ultrasonic pulse travelling between a set of transducer heads one for each direction component as such they are not subject to the limitations listed above they are becoming more common for new installations and mid life refits as they tend to be smaller lighter and provide more accurate wind information however ultrasonic anemometers can be susceptible to icing and corrosion electromagnetic interference from nearby emitters or from local temperature changes such as from the ship s exhaust 5 2 atmospheric boundary layer the true wind over the surface of the earth t has a vertical velocity distribution called the atmospheric boundary layer abl where wind closer to the sea surface is slower than wind higher up due to friction between the air and the ground sea surface the shape of the abl depends on a number of factors including surface roughness and the atmospheric stability the vertical profile can be estimated by a variety of models forand 2018 which can take some or all of these factors into account davenport 1960 for anemometer bias analysis a simple power law estimate eq 8 which is common for wind engineering studies and is given in the nato standardized definitions 2 2 the equation is provided in the footnotes of table d 1 of ref nato 1993 for wind and wave conditions nato 1993 is often used the standard reference height for wind speeds used in the nato document was z ref 19 5 m speeds at other heights are determined using eq 8 unless otherwise indicated by a subscript such as t 19 5 wind speeds in this paper are given for the height of the anemometer 8 t b t a z b z a α where t a is the known true wind speed at height z a z a is the vertical height above the nominal ocean surface corresponding to the known wind speed t a z b is the vertical height above the nominal ocean surface for which the true wind speed is desired t b is the true wind speed at height z b α is an empirically derived power law exponent ref nato 1993 specifies α 1 7 0 14 but ships at sea could experience profiles with α in the range of 0 09 to 0 25 davenport 1960 by definition the undistorted relative wind u is the vector sum of the true wind t which follows a power law distribution left side of fig 6 and ship generated wind s which has an idealized uniform distribution right side of fig 6 when t z and s z combine the angle between them can introduce a twisting effect on the resultant vertical distribution of u z this is illustrated in fig 7 showing winds when a ship travels in a direction perpendicular to the true wind numerous combinations of t z and s z with varying speeds and angles could sum to give the same u at the anemometer height but with different vertical profiles for u z the shape of the abl profiles can modify the development of the distorted flow fields around a ship which may impact various aspects of operation differently this issue primarily affects ships where the anemometers have been placed far from a height of interest e g the helicopter hover height corrections made to determine wind conditions at the height of interest will be subject to uncertainties in wind speed and direction due to abl variation this illustrates an aspect of anemometer bias management where the details of the ship operational need and anemometer placement are extremely important in determining the best course of action 5 3 ship orientation and motion standard practice for anemometer bias tests is to use a level static ship and would therefore neglect any effects due to a tilted ship or one undergoing motions due to ocean waves in the case of a ship s orientation the list or trim angle due to uneven loading would generally be small a few degrees at most and would not be expected to have a significant effect i e less than the precision of the full scale sensors on the wind distortion or measurement the same would be true for modest changes in ship draft ship motions due to sea states however can result in larger angles and dynamic effects which can affect both wind distortion and measurement large angles of roll and pitch can tilt the anemometer out of the horizontal plane affecting which components of the wind are being measured as most ship anemometers are only 2d measurements cannot be properly corrected for out of plane measurements a procedure to apply tilt corrections for anemometers was presented by wilczak et al 2001 though this was more applicable to non shipboard installations large angles also substantially change the shape of the ship presented to the wind distortion effects and the resulting bias could therefore be quite different for an even keeled ship and one for example rolled over to 20 thiebaux 1990 tested models in both an even keeled orientation and with static roll 20 and pitch 5 angles resulting in differing biases profiles for each condition dynamic effects were not considered rolling and pitching motions can also generate large velocities particularly for anemometers located high up on a ship s mast the movement of the anemometers through the air generates apparent wind velocities and the movement of the ship can generate dynamic wind distortions dynamic wind distortion is more complicated and would likely require ship specific studies to quantify its effects the influence of ship motion on wind measurements has been explored by reinsvold 2013 but this type of analysis is not usually included in standard anemometer bias evaluations in practice applying a low pass filter to the anemometer data using a frequency lower than ship s natural frequencies of motion is often sufficient to remove or reduce these effects 5 4 anemometer location quality metrics the quality of an anemometer location is assessed by measuring the biases and evaluating the mean and fluctuating component of the wind measured at the anemometer location that includes the distortion effects of the ship superstructures a time series x of instantaneous measurements is collected in order to perform the analysis the normalized mean wind speed horizontal component given by x ˆ and the normalized standard deviation horizontal component given by τ x are the typical assessment metrics for a given anemometer location 9 x 1 n i 1 n x i 10 x ˆ 1 n i 1 n x i u ref 11 τ x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 u ref where x is the mean of x for a given time series comprised of n discrete measurements x ˆ is the normalized value of x n is the number of elements in the time series of x u ref is undistorted wind speed at a standard reference height x i is the i th measurement in the series τ x is the normalized standard deviation of the fluctuating component of x the quality metrics used here are normalized by the undistorted wind speed at a standard reference height of 19 5m u 19 5 the height was selected to be consistent with the nato reference wind height for sea state definition nato 1993 this approach has been adopted by the co authors as it facilitates the comparison of bias from ships that may have different anemometer heights in other contexts a different reference height may be more meaningful the qualities of a good anemometer location are insensitive to reynolds number which is indicated by stable values of x ˆ with wind speed and outside of wake regions and flapping shear layers which is indicated by levels of τ x which are on the order of the turbulence intensity in the undistorted atmospheric wind and also by low rates of change of x ˆ and τ x with wind angle statistics are expressed only for the horizontal component due to the fact that many measurement devices are limited in their measuring capability to the horizontal plane and the fact that the determination of undistorted wind which is inherently horizontal is the goal the mean of the vertical distortion if measured can also indicate the level of flow distortion however the presence of vertical distortions is not necessarily an indicator of poor placement also the unsteady component of the vertical distortion is unlikely to provide insight not already captured by the level of unsteadiness in the horizontal plane 5 5 bias correction factors bias factors used both for defining the magnitudes of bias as well as for their correction are given in eq 12b the angular bias β θ is the difference between the measured m and undistorted u wind angles and the speed bias β v is the ratio of the measured to undistorted wind speeds note that bias is a function of anemometer location wind angle and to some extent wind speed see section 6 1 the relationship between measured and undistorted winds is represented graphically in fig 8 note that variations of eq 12b could also be defined by reversing the order of θ m and θ u in eq 12a and or inverting the ratio in eq 12b other researchers have used these variations such as eq 6b by blanc 1986a 12a β θ θ m θ u 12b β v m u where θ m is the mean azimuth angle of m w r t the ship centreline θ u is the mean azimuth angle of u w r t the ship centreline m is the mean 2d horizontal wind speed of m u is the mean 2d horizontal wind speed of u β θ is the anemometer angle bias correction β v is the anemometer speed factor correction 5 6 accuracy requirements anemometer measurements are subject to uncertainties resulting from a number of sources including superstructure induced biases aerodynamic uncertainties in biases possible sources reynolds number sensitivity sensitivity to the abl and instrument uncertainties possible sources unexpected dynamic behaviour alignment issues instrument calibration and or resolution installation variation for example uncertainty levels for wind measurements could be defined such that they must be no greater 5 for wind angle and 2knots for wind speed below 40knots and 5 above 40knots uncertainty targets should include both the accuracy of the installation and measurement uncertainties associated with the instruments used at sea 6 bias measurement considerations the standard method for evaluating ship anemometer bias is through model scale testing in a wind tunnel and or cfd simulations the procedure is essentially the same in both cases a representative version of the above water geometry of the ship is generated the model is then placed in the wind tunnel or computational domain and exposed to a range of known wind conditions while measurements are taken at the anemometer position s for each wind condition and location the difference between the measured winds m and the known undistorted winds u are then used to characterize the angle and speed biases the following sections describe the process in more detail and describe important considerations when making wind bias measurements including scaling model fidelity propeller vane corrections turbulence intensity and the abl 6 1 scaling achieving meaningful results from scale model tests requires that the experiments are designed to comply with the principles of similitude as physical phenomena can be governed by different and sometimes opposing conditions for similitude consideration should be given to ensure that behaviours of interest are being modelled correctly for ship airwake studies the similitude parameters required for dynamic and kinematic similitude respectively are reynolds number re defined in section 2 and reduced frequency f as defined below 13 f ω l v where f is the reduced frequency v is the wind velocity l is the characteristic body dimension and ω is frequency these two parameters cannot be matched simultaneously in a conventional atmospheric wind tunnel however as discussed in section 2 dynamic similitude does not require reynolds number matching if the flow is in a regime where the flow characteristics are consistent across the range of relevant reynolds numbers both at model and full scale at very low wind speeds reynolds similitude cannot be maintained therefore a successful experimental design requires that this lower limit occurs below the scaled wind speed of interest for ship airwake studies a lower limit of 10knots full scale is generally used where the influence of wind at this speed on operations is limited the reduced frequency f is used to scale the relative frequencies for testing and analysis by eq 13 for a reduced scale model the frequencies of fluctuations in the flow for the same wind speed occur faster by the same amount eq 14e illustrates the interplay between the three parameters size speed and frequency all of which can be manipulated to optimize the experimental design while maintaining kinematic similitude 14a f m f f 14b f m f f ω m ω f l m l f v f v m λ ω λ l λ v 1 14c λ l l m l f 14d λ v v m v f 14e λ ω ω m ω f λ v λ l λ t λ l λ v where x m x f are parameters x at model and full scale respectively λ l is the geometric scale factor λ v is the wind velocity scale factor λ ω is the frequency scale factor λ t is the time scale factor the equations for reduced frequency scaling are relevant for ensuring sufficient sampling time and rate to capture the dominant effects of interest and also for spectral analyses provided the tests are conducted in appropriate reynolds number conditions then measurements of flow speed at anemometer locations can be normalized directly by the reference wind speed for the test point and no further scaling is required for stationary statistical quantities like mean and standard deviation 6 2 model fidelity to minimize effort and cost there is an incentive for both numerical and physical model testing to simplify the geometry of the ship model as much as possible this is done by either excluding or reducing the complexity of details and features of the ship s structure for these studies it is acceptable to remove details on the order 1m or less unless these details are within 10 object dimensions of the anemometer position or could be reasonably expected to cast a significant wake on the anemometer for any relative wind angle compound objects such as lattice masts or multiple repeating instances of small objects can have an effective characteristic geometry that is on the order of the compound object rather than the individual pieces in this case the object should be treated as a porous object where many studies estimating drag and wake topology for porous objects exist due to reynolds number effects on the individual elements of a compound object or objects where the reynolds number regime at model scale is not representative of the full scale equivalent geometric scaling does not always produce an equivalent flow structure a model for equivalent drag must be developed using literature or testing of the object itself in order to accurately reproduce the flow effect of these types of objects at model scale therefore the appropriate simplification of a ship geometry for adequate simulation requires judgement calls and experience to do correctly 6 3 atmospheric boundary layer the simple power law profile described in section 5 2 using α 1 7 0 14 from nato 1993 is considered sufficient for simulations of ship anemometer biases and can be generated using a series of triangular spires for wind tunnel tests irwin 1979 a power law profile with this coefficient value represents average conditions found at sea 6 4 sampling rates and durations ship induced wind distortion is an inherently unsteady process involving turbulent flow fluctuations covering a broad range of length and time scales measurement of the wind therefore needs to be done over a sufficient duration to extract meaningful statistics the measurement technique whether wind tunnel at sea or cfd impacts the appropriate duration some preliminary estimations of the primary frequencies that may exist in the flow can be done using vortex shedding theory zdravkovich 1997 from the ship as a whole and individually for its major structural features a more practical approach though is to perform a sensitivity analysis on the measurement duration to ensure that it is long enough to produce statistically significant mean and root mean square rms values the sampling rate for the measurements must be sufficient to resolve the time scales of interest at the nrc wind tunnel scale measurements supporting ship helicopter operations are typically made at 5000hz more than sufficient to capture turbulence frequencies related to ship anemometer bias measurement durations at model scale may theoretically only need to be a few seconds but in practice wind tunnel data is normally collected for periods in the range of 10 to 30s cfd simulations for anemometer bias should be performed as transient rather than steady state in this way the fluctuating components which are used as metrics for evaluating bias can be captured timestep size in cfd applications are driven by factors such as the numerical scheme and grid dimensions but should be at least small enough to capture frequencies of interest simulations also require some time for the flow to properly develop from its initial conditions at startup before measurements at anemometer positions should be made in the case of ship trials conducted at sea marine anemometers typically report wind measurements at 1hz though commonly used ultrasonic sensors can go as high as 30hz at sea inherent turbulence in the ambient wind as well as ship motions can also affect measurement times depending on conditions durations for trial measurements can be as low as 2 to 5min though for the dedicated trials discussed in section 8 runs were each at least 15min 7 anemometer bias analysis 7 1 wind tunnel results an example of wind tunnel results for anemometer bias and their use for abm is given in this section the selected case is the port side anemometer position of a halifax class frigate this class of ship is fitted with two port and stbd anemometers near the top of its mast as shown fig 9 the wind tunnel anemometer bias tests were conducted at the nrc 9m wind tunnel facility in ottawa using a 1 50 scale model of the ship mounted on a turntable as shown in fig 10 flow measurements at each anemometer location were taken using a single cobra probe see fig 11 suspended above the wind tunnel floor by a structure mounted downstream of the turn table a cobra probe turbulent flow instrumentation 2019 is a fast response four hole pressure sensor that provides dynamic three component velocity and static pressure measurements within an acceptance cone of 45 the acceptance cone limits the range of measurement for example the probe as positioned for the test can only accurately measure flow vectors that are not distorted more than 45 vertically or horizontally from the probe tip s longitudinal axis the following procedure was performed for each of the anemometer locations first the three component wind velocity was measured without the ship installed this was done to determine the characteristics of the undistorted wind and the baseline turbulence intensity next the model was positioned in the tunnel and the three component wind velocity was measured at the anemometer position s the ship was then rotated w r t the tunnel air flow direction using the turntable to change θ u and the flow measurements were taken again 3 3 the cobra probe sensor was always aligned to the wind tunnel flow direction and did not rotate with the ship this process was repeated for the full range of relative wind angles the halifax class used propeller vane anemometers at the time of the wind tunnel testing so the measured 2d wind speed results from the wind tunnel were adjusted for vertical velocity as described in section 5 1 the bias results and location quality metrics for the port anemometer are given in fig 12 the top two charts show the results for speed and angle bias calculated using eq 12b for winds coming to the port side anemometer on windward side there was some moderate direction bias of 5 as well as a reduction in 2d wind speed by as much as 20 in port beam winds the 2d horizontal speed decreases but the normalized vertical velocity bottom chart increases the total 3d wind speed would therefore increase in port winds due to the strong up draft created as the wind is accelerated upward and over the broad side of the ship as can be seen in fig 9 the port anemometer is on the leeward side of the mast for starboard winds and is in a wake region for certain relative wind angles the wind tunnel results particularly speed bias clearly show this effect as the wind speed drops to nearly zero for starboard beam winds when the anemometer is leeward of the mast structure the edges of the wake are characterized by the rapid changes in speed bias and the centre of the wake is characterized by the greatest velocity deficit another important factor to consider is the turbulence intensity τ v using eq 11 shown in the fourth plot of fig 12 the data shown are for the difference in turbulence intensity δ τ v measured at the anemometer position from the baseline value taken in an empty tunnel large values of δ τ v indicate that the wind flow is highly turbulent in these cases measurements may be unstable and consequently cannot be corrected for the example data shown the δ τ v is low for port winds indicating stable and correctable bias higher and rapidly changing δ τ v for starboard winds suggest more turbulent and unstable conditions particularly in mast shear layers note that both the speed bias and turbulence metrics are needed for evaluation for example there are low turbulence levels in the centre of the wake at g90 but this is simply a consequence of the nearly zero wind speed in the wake of the mast and not an indication that the measurements here are correctable 7 2 useful range one of the primary objectives of ship anemometer bias analysis is to determine the useful range for when data can be used and when it should be discarded it is important that operators are aware when sensor data is invalid due to excessive bias or instability useful data occur when the anemometer is in wind conditions that can produce consistent repeatable measurements that are within or can be corrected to be within the required accuracy see section 5 6 the specific criteria for defining useful range will depend on the requirements for the data as well as the characteristics of the bias profile for example polsky et al 2011 uses criteria based on threshold values for β θ β v τ v as well as their gradients in general terms anemometers should not be used if they are within or on the edge of separated flow regions with highly turbulent flow these are typically seen but not limited to when the sensor is downwind of some object or structure they can be identified by large values of turbulence intensity inside separated regions and large gradients in bias metrics at the edges for the data in fig 12 the useful range was defined as covering relative wind angles from g170 clockwise through all port wind angles to g10 as illustrated by fig 13 although port beam winds did exhibit bias the wind flow was stable i e low values of τ and therefore amenable to correction in contrast the majority of the starboard wind angles caused the sensor to be in lee of the mast and resulted in highly distorted and chaotic flows this behaviour can be observed on the real ship the leeward anemometer propeller vane type will sometimes spin in circles in response to the mast s wake flow ships should be fitted with anemometers located such that the combination of their useful ranges provides full coverage over 360 of undistorted wind angles overlap of useful ranges is recommended for best results for the halifax class the starboard anemometer data has a mostly mirror image bias profile as the port anemometer it therefore has overlap for both headwinds and tailwinds so that together both anemometers can provide the ship with full valid measurement coverage 7 3 bias correction if the airflow distortion to the anemometer is significant it may be helpful to apply a correction to remove or at least reduce the resulting bias this can be done by using the same data from fig 12 but truncated to the useful range and plotted against θ m instead of θ u fig 14 shows this version of the data along with that collected for the starboard anemometer smooth curves are also fitted to each data set the bias correction procedure would be to first check that the measured angle is within the anemometer s useful range then to use the fitted curves from fig 14 to determine the relevant speed and angle bias then to apply eq 12b to calculate θ u and u applying these corrections can avoid ambiguity from sensors that have different bias profiles using the current example for headwinds the port anemometer would measure g5 while the starboard anemometer measures r5 but the corrected values would be consistent 7 3 1 anemometer selection although seemingly straight forward bias correction has a complication where incorrect data can be displayed this is when an anemometer is outside of its useful range in terms of the undistorted wind angles θ u but due to it being in a highly turbulent zone can report wind angles θ u that appear to be within its useful range identifying these situations cannot be done in isolation instead requiring data from one or more other anemometers the procedure for selecting the anemometer s that are actually in their useful range as opposed to merely indicating that they are may depend on the specific bias profiles of a given ship however invalid ranges for anemometers are most commonly caused because they are leeward of some localized object or structure in these cases the wind speed on the leeward sensors will be lower than those on the windward side therefore the anemometer with the higher wind speed should be selected this sort of procedure could easily be included in an automatic bias correction algorithm provided the system had simultaneous access to all wind sensor sources 7 4 improving bias in certain cases where abm analysis has been performed the results may show that there are relative wind angles for which no anemometer location can provide useful data essentially creating blind spot s for wind measurement a less severe result could be that some wind angles within the useful range determined by the abm analysis may produce poor data in practice at sea in these cases if there is a requirement for accurate wind data such as for aircraft operations then there are several options for improving the bias profiles these include modifying superstructure features to improve flow quality re locating anemometers to more favourable positions adding additional anemometers to less biased positions improving the anemometer sensor type alignment calibration etc or applying appropriate constraints on wind sensitive operations for conditions affected by blind spots or poor unreliable data all of these approaches have different merit and feasibility considerations depending on the application 7 5 true wind although the true wind t is often treated as a given in most diagrams for a ship at sea it is not measured directly as the true wind can be determined using the anemometer measurements bias in the relative wind will result in a biased assessment of the true wind therefore the following steps based on eq 4 re arranged for eq 15 can be used to calculate the true wind vector using the corrected anemometer readings 15 t u s 1 determine s using the ship s known speed course and heading 2 correct for anemometer bias section 7 3 to get an estimate of u from the measured relative wind m and 3 use eq 15 to estimate t and eq 2 to convert between relative angles w r t the ship and absolute direction w r t compass north 8 validating bias when conducting model scale experiments or cfd simulations it can be helpful to gain confidence in their results by validating them against real world full scale data this is best done on a dedicated sea trial on an appropriately instrumented ship such a trial was performed in 2017 as part of the anemometer bias study conducted for the halifax class frigates of the royal canadian navy the primary difference in attempting to evaluate bias in a wind tunnel and on a ship at sea is that in a wind tunnel the undistorted wind u is known and controllable at sea u cannot be measured directly from the ship because of the very anemometer bias that the trial is being conducted to evaluate it may be possible to measure t using other sources such as buoys or small craft in practice though these are not always available and or could overly constrain trial activities their use also introduces additional uncertainties instead the common approach is to temporarily fit the ship with additional reference anemometers for the trial these reference sensors should be placed in areas where bias can be expected to be small stable and consistent the bias metrics for a given target sensor can then be calculated using eq 16b with respect to a reference sensor as opposed to u provided that the anemometer bias at the reference anemometer locations was also measured in the wind tunnel then β θ r and β vr can be calculated and directly compared with the results from a sea trial 16a β θ r θ m θ mr 16b β vr m m r where θ m is the mean measured relative wind angle of the target anemometer θ mr is the mean measured relative wind angle of the reference anemometer m is the mean measured 2d horizontal wind speed of the target anemometer m r is the mean measured 2d horizontal wind speed of the reference anemometer β θ r is the anemometer angle bias of the target anemometer w r t to the reference anemometer β vr is the anemometer speed bias of the target anemometer w r t to the reference anemometer a potential drawback of this approach is that if major differences were seen between the model and at sea data then it would not be obvious whether the differences were due to issues at the target reference or both anemometer locations it is also possible that the two locations could have errors that cancel each other out however consistent agreement between multiple sensors over a range of conditions would be very strong evidence of validation three reference sensors were used on the halifax class sea trial at the bow stern and in front the mast the bow reference anemometer shown in fig 15 was attached to the top of a pole such that its measurement point was 5m above the deck although ostensibly in clear air wind tunnel results showed that the bow location still experienced biasing due to the ship hull this bias was stable except for tailwinds making it a viable source for reference wind in addition to the extra reference sensors two 3d ultrasonic anemometers were also fitted directly above the ship s existing propeller vane anemometers these were used to acquire higher resolution data as well as to evaluate any potential benefit of moving the ship s anemometers to new slightly higher positions the trial consisted of performing straight track runs at constant speed for several minutes while logging data the ship course was adjusted for each run to achieve a new relative wind angle ship speed was set so as to maintain at least 15knots of relative wind speed as measured by the windward reference ultrasonic anemometer example results comparing data from the trial to the wind tunnel are given in fig 16 these are for the two ultrasonic anemometers temporarily fitted directly above the ship s port and starboard sensors using the bow anemometer as the reference wind wind tunnel data for the bow location was only measured out to beam winds as any wind coming from behind the ship would be heavily distorted the figure is therefore limited from r90 through headwinds to g90 the results show good agreement between the two sets of data there appears to be a minor upward shift in the angular bias for the sea trial port anemometer compared with the wind tunnel but this could be due an alignment issue of the ship s sensor small differences would be expected for the speed bias due to the effects of different vertical atmospheric velocity profiles as discussed in section 5 2 various combinations of target and reference anemometers were examined and most showed good agreement between the sea trial and wind tunnel with the exception of the ship s existing propeller vane anemometers bias trends at these locations were not consistent with the wind tunnel nor the ultrasonics located directly above them various explanations were considered such as whether the effect of vertical atmospheric velocity was more significant than the simplified adjustment discussed in section 5 1 or whether the dynamic nature of the devices causes susceptibility to errors induced by ship motion the issue has not been investigated further as the fleet s older propeller vane units will soon be replaced by new ultrasonic units which have good agreement to wind tunnel data still the unexpected behaviour of the propeller vane sensors highlights the importance of performing full scale validation studies based on these sea trial results new revised bias correction profiles specifically tailored for the propeller vane units were created so they can be used until the ship anemometer upgrades are completed 9 conclusions a ship and its structures create distortions that affect the accuracy of wind measurements made by its anemometers bias in wind readings is a particularly important issue for ships which operate aircraft although wind distortion cannot be eliminated ship anemometer bias can be quantified and managed in a way that can restore the accuracy and usefulness of data the abm process first involves assessing the ship induced bias present at actual or proposed anemometer locations using physical model testing or numerical simulation important considerations when performing these assessments are flow features that cause anemometer bias scaling and modelling necessary to ensure appropriate simulation the impact of complicating real world elements such as the abl and ship motion anemometer type and its characteristics and how information is displayed this paper provides definitions for the important quantities to consider in abm and the concept of anemometer useful range following the process laid out in the paper the resulting bias profiles for a given anemometer system can then be used to assess the proposed locations to determine whether they are sufficient to provide stable measurements for the full range of relative wind angles and whether the bias is severe enough to require real time correction a naval frigate was used as an example case to show this process using the bias profiles measured from wind tunnel testing this data was then validated using full scale measurements from a dedicated sea trial acronyms abl atmospheric boundary layer abm anemometer bias management ape anemometer position

21477,since added resistance in waves is a key parameter for prediction of ship performance in actual seas it should be measured with sufficient accuracy in general the measurand obtained in a model test contains unavoidable error which results from the complexity of the measurement procedure of such tests therefore uncertainty which can quantify this error should be clarified for achievement of accurate measurement the authors conducted repeat tests both for resistance in calm water and for added resistance in short regular waves to assess their uncertainty in three facilities in the national maritime research institute japan nmri the tests were conducted according to the procedure published by the international organization for standardization this paper reports the results of the uncertainty analysis for resistance in calm water and added resistance in short regular waves and the comparison among the three facilities which revealed that the predominant error component is different among the facilities furthermore the authors calculated the decrease in ship speed in actual seas on the basis of the results of the uncertainty analysis for added resistance in waves in order to discuss whether the uncertainty is acceptable the results of the calculation showed that added resistance in short regular waves can be measured with sufficient accuracy for practical

devices in the design stage but also to acquire validation data for the numerical method developed which means that model tests must always provide highly accurate and reliable data as a model test usually involves a large number of instruments and complicated test procedure errors in the measurand will inevitably occur therefore it is necessary to understand the quantity of such errors in order to maintain model test accuracy one of the aims of quantitative assessment of the error in the measurand includes uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis can not only assess the uncertainty of the output but can also clarify the propagation route of error and provide useful information for improvement of model test accuracy himeno et al 1990 applied uncertainty analysis to a resistance test in calm water that study dealt with error propagation in the process of correcting measured data nishio et al 1991 applied uncertainty analysis to a resistance test and self propulsion test in calm water and discussed the treatment of the low pass filter and problem of curve fitting these two studies focused on the repeat test which refers to measurements conducted at various times under the same conditions kume et al 2000 presented an uncertainty analysis for a single test taking into account that the resistance test and self propulsion test in calm water are regularly conducted tests these studies followed the performance test guidelines developed by the american national standards institute and american society of mechanical engineers ansi asme longo and stern 2005 presented an example of uncertainty analysis for a resistance test and nominal wake measurement in accordance with the procedure of the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the international towing tank conference ittc led a worldwide series of comparative tests ittc 2008 for identifying facility bias under the framework of ittc procedures for uncertainty analysis in addition to ship performance in calm seas recent studies have also examined ship performance in actual seas which requires accurate measurement of added resistance in waves by model tests since added resistance in waves is the dominant component among the external forces acting on a ship in actual seas the international maritime organization imo developed guidelines for calculation of the coefficient f w of the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition imo 2012 those guidelines recommend that use of model test data is preferable for accurate calculation of the decrease in ship speed thus it is necessary to assess uncertainty in the measurement of added resistance in waves in order to evaluate ship performance in actual seas with sufficient accuracy park et al 2015 applied uncertainty analysis to measurement of added resistance in regular waves using the kvlcc2 model they proposed a procedure for uncertainty analysis for added resistance in waves and discussed the effect of each error source but did not discuss the effect of the uncertainty of the added resistance on ship performance in actual seas estimation of ship performance in actual seas by solving an equilibrium equation for the forces acting on a ship requires the mean value within a certain period not an instantaneous value in particular since added resistance in waves is predominant among external forces it should be accurately measured bearing in mind that larger ships encounter relatively shorter waves the authors focused on added resistance in short regular waves and conducted repeat tests for uncertainty analysis at the three facilities in the national maritime research institute japan nmri the comparison of uncertainty among the facilities is reported in this paper further in order to discuss whether the assessed uncertainty is acceptable the decrease in ship speed in actual seas was calculated on the basis of the uncertainty analysis 2 uncertainty analysis the procedures provided by the ansi asme and aiaa define error in measurement as the difference between the measurand and the true value error in measurement is composed of bias error and random error the former is constant error and the latter is error that varies randomly throughout measurements these procedures indicate that assessment of the two components of error sources provides the uncertainty of the output although the procedures of the ansi asme and aiaa give a reasonable assessment of uncertainty there is concern that the true value cannot be measured in reality and it is difficult to assess the uncertainty provided by an uncertainty analysis based on an unknown value to overcome those concerns guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement gum was published by the international organization for standardization iso 1995 gum defines the true value not only as a sole value but also as a group of values that might be the true value which enables construction of a highly reasonable and consistent uncertainty considering the fact that ittc applies gum to the procedure of uncertainty analysis 2014a the authors conducted an uncertainty analysis according to gum consisting of the following steps 2 1 data reduction equation the instruments used in measurement should be appropriately selected and the data reduction equation should be determined for the purpose of measurement this study addresses not only added resistance in waves but also resistance in calm water which is required in order to calculate added resistance in waves the resistance coefficient in calm water c t and the added resistance coefficient in waves k aw are expressed as follows respectively 1 c t r 0 5 ρ s v 2 2 k a w r a w ρ g ζ w 2 b 2 l p p r w r ρ g ζ w 2 b 2 l p p where r is resistance in calm water ρ is

a assessment is obtained by a repeat test based on the results of a repeat test in which the tests are repeated m times the uncertainties of the mean value x of a type a assessment for a single test and a repeat test are given by eq 3 and eq 4 respectively using the standard deviation s obtained by the repeat test 3 u x s for single test 4 u x s m for repeat test the uncertainty of the type b assessment is based on the manufacturer s specifications previous test data the instrument handbook or the experience and knowledge of the experimenter the estimated standard uncertainty of an instrument whose capacity is x c and tolerance is a is calculated by eqs 5 and 6 for a single test and repeat test of m times respectively the authors assigned the value 3 to k d on the assumption

set to 2 0 11 u k c u c y 3 repeat test and uncertainty assessment this study deals with the mean obtained in one test illustrated in fig 1 as the object of uncertainty analysis the authors conducted a repeat test at the 400 m towing tank hereinafter 400m 150 m towing tank hereinafter 150m and actual sea model basin hereinafter act in nmri for uncertainty analysis act has 382 wave generators on its surrounding and can generate waves with accuracy tanizawa et al 2011 while the two towing tanks have a wave generator on their edge the principal particulars of the ship model used in these repeat tests are shown in table 1 the ship type is a pure car carrier the apparatus for measurement in the repeat tests is shown in fig 2 and is usually used for resistance or self propulsion tests in calm water the sway and yaw motions of the ship model were restricted by the fore and aft guide units while heave and pitch motions were free to move the sampling frequencies were set to 100 hz in all measurements table 2 shows the specification of the facilities and the conditions of the repeat test at 400m and act the synchronous measurement system described below has been introduced to ensure repeatability in measurements 3 1 synchronous measurement system the procedure of a model test is often complicated since it consists of many processes such as carriage control clamp activation and trigger input for measurement which are often performed by manually operation however manual operation cannot completely reproduce the time history of such processes and therefore fails to maintain the repeatability of measurements to ensure higher repeatability of measurements nmri installed a synchronous measurement system in 400m and act as the system follows a sequence program constructed prior to the measurement and operates each process automatically it can completely reproduce the time history of the processes in measurements which contributes to decrease deviation among measurements the sequence used in this study is shown in fig 3 the important point in the sequence is that the wave generators are stopped before the measurement is performed the reason is that the measurement should be performed in the minimum number of waves excessive wave making is not desirable since much residual waves having influences on the next test remain on the water surface the time history of the wave height obtained in act using the synchronous measurement system is shown in fig 4 where 10 series of time histories are superimposed fig 4 shows that the synchronous measurement system can reproduce the time history of wave height with high accuracy the correlation factor between measurements is distributed from 0 9842 to 0 9992 and the averaged correlation factor is 0 9954 since a synchronous measurement system has not been installed in 150m the time from measurement start is always monitored to conduct the sequence manually and realize a condition similar to those in 400m and act 3 2 resistance test in calm water the resistance test in calm water is carried out with ship speed v c 1 614 m s f r 0 238 resistance and speed through water were measured in the resistance test the results of the resistance test are shown in figs 5 7 the values plotted in these figures are based on the averaged value in each measurement fig 5 shows that while the speed through water measured in 400m and 150m does not show a qualitative trend that in act decreases as the number of measurements accumulates the residual current profile in act may differ from that in 400m and 150m and seems to generate a following current in act fig 6 shows that a 2 difference in resistance appears among the facilities while the resistance measured in each basin is almost constant throughout the repeat test although the same apparatuses were used in the three facilities details such as the spring in the towing rod installed on the model were different among the facilities it is likely that these differences can affect the resistance coefficient in calm water in fig 7 which requires further consideration considering the comparison among facilities the authors corrected the measured resistance for the common water temperature 15 degrees c in accordance with the ittc procedure 2014b as shown in eq 12 the frictional resistance coefficient is calculated according to the schoenherr implicit formula 12 r ˆ ρ t c ρ t m 1 c f t c c f t m c t t m r where r ˆ is corrected resistance in calm water for common water temperature t c is common water temperature t m is measured water temperature and c f is frictional resistance coefficient in addition to the correction on water temperature the measured resistance should be corrected for the speed through water as well as for water temperature the correction follows eq 13 on the assumption that the resistance in still water is proportional to the square of the speed through water fig 8 shows the corrected resistance on water temperature and speed through water and demonstrates that the resistance in each basin goes to the same value by the correction 13 r v c 2 v 2 r ˆ where v c is target ship speed through water in repeat test and r is corrected resistance in calm water for common speed through water and water temperature 3 3 uncertainty analysis for resistance coefficient in calm water 3 3 1 standard uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water the purpose of the type a assessment is to assess the deviation in resistance and speed through water that occurred in the repeat test the uncertainties of the type a and type b assessments for a single test are calculated by eq 3 and eq 5 respectively where k d in eq 5 is set to 3 on the assumption that uncertainty obeys a uniform distribution on type a assessment of the corrected resistance on the speed through water and water temperature the propagation of the uncertainty due to the correction should be considered the type a assessment of the corrected resistance can be conducted by eq 14 and eq 15 14 u r ˆ 2 r ˆ r u r 2 r ˆ v u v 2 r ˆ t m u t m 2 r ˆ l p p u l p p 2 r ˆ s u s 2 15 u r 2 r r ˆ u r ˆ 2 r v u v 2 since the derivative of the first term in the right hand in eq 14 is ρ t c ρ t m which is almost equal to 1 it is required to carry out an assessment on the contribution of the other terms the assessment reveals that the sum of the second term to the fifth term does not exceed 0 02 of the whole right hand the reason why the percentage is negligibly small is that the water temperature in each basin is close to the common water temperature 15 degrees c the type b assessment related to eq 1 treats the load cell current meter and water temperature detector water temperature is related to eq 1 because the water density is based on the measured water temperature according to the equation described in the ittc procedure 2002 however in the present study the water temperature was measured only once prior to the repeat test this is different from the ittc procedure recommending water temperature measurements before every test it is assumed that the model length has a 0 1 manufacturing error and the wetted surface has a 0 2 error the load cell used in the repeat test is assumed to have a tolerance non linearity and hysteresis in the type b assessment the standard estimated error see of the fitting curve given by calibration as defined by eq 16 is also included 16 s e e k 1 n d y k y l s k 2 n d c where c is number of constant variables in see n d is number of tests in calibration y k is value measured at calibration and y ls k is value used in the fitting curve corresponding to k th test linear approximation of the calibration data yields c 2 the tolerance and see of the fitting curve of the calibration test of the current meter and the resolution and reading error of the water temperature gauge are included in the type b assessment 3 3 2 combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water when the standard uncertainty of resistance speed through water density and wetted surface area are defined as u r u v u ρ and u s respectively the combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of the resistance coefficient in calm water can be calculated by eq 17 and eq 18 respectively 17 u c c t 2 c t r u r 2 c t v u v 2 c t ρ u ρ 2 c t s u s 2 18 u c t 2 0 u c c t 3 3 3 results of uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water the uncertainty analysis for a single test of the resistance coefficient in calm water is shown in tables 3 5 and fig 9 in the tables rate represents the contribution rate of an error source to combined uncertainty and is calculated by eq 19 fig 9 shows the combined uncertainty multiplied by the sensitivity coefficient 19 r a t e u x i 2 u c c t 2 tables 3 5 show that the expanded uncertainty of the resistance coefficient in calm water is 1 15 in 400m 1 44 in 150m and 2 63 in act fig 9 expresses that the component of uncertainty is different among the facilities fig 9 shows that the effects of the density do not appear while those of resistance and speed through water are dominant uncertainty in 150m and in 400m is less than that in act the reason for the smaller uncertainty in 400m and 150m is that they are towing tanks in which the towing carriage is able to run a long distance to ensure steady measurement whereas act has a shorter distance in the towing direction than the others which contributes to larger uncertainty in addition the residual current in act which is deemed to be different from that in the other facilities also contributes to the larger uncertainty further consideration of the time interval between tests may be required as this is closely related to the residual current profile which affects the accuracy of speed through water furthermore fig 9 shows that the component of resistance is almost equal to that of speed through water in act although the most of uncertainty is the speed in 400m and 150m this study treats the corrected resistance on the speed and water temperature which is expected to prevent an increase of uncertainty of resistance this is achieved in 400m and 150m however not achieved in act the main reason of this is the deviation of the speed in act as fig 5 demonstrates the speed in act is gradually going down which gives larger deviation in the speed although this study incorporates the synchronous measurement system in 400m and act which is expected to contribute to smaller uncertainty in measurement there was no improvement in the uncertainty of resistance in calm water among the facilities because synchronous measurement is conducted manually in 150m this suggests that either automatic or manual synchronous measurement should be ensured for measuring resistance in calm water with high repeatability 3 4 added resistance tests in short regular waves while park et al conducted repeat tests to measure added resistance in regular waves for λ l pp 0 5 1 1 and 2 0 where λ is wave length the authors set λ l pp 0 4 as a condition for measurement of added resistance in waves considering the fact that the guidelines for calculating the coefficient for the decrease in ship speed f w developed by imo recommend that model test results for added resistance in short regular waves should be incorporated in the calculation the test speed is set to ship speed v 1 614 m s f r 0 238 and the incident wave height is set to 0 074 m corresponding to 3 0 m in full scale equivalent to beaufort scale 6 which the guidelines define as a representative sea condition since the added resistance test is carried out in regular short waves in which ship motion is negligibly small the apparatus shown in fig 2 was used in this test as well as in the test in calm water tsujimoto et al 2012 non dimensional heave and pitch amplitude measured in the tests is about 0 02 and 0 01 respectively wave height is estimated as the first order term of a fourier series expansion and resistance in waves is estimated as the averaged value within the period in which the fourier series expansion is conducted incident wave height and resistance in waves are measured in the tests the results of the incident wave height resistance in waves and added resistance coefficient in waves are shown in figs 10 12 respectively the resistance in waves measured in 150m is smaller than that in the other facilities since the wave height in 150m is smaller and the added resistance coefficient is almost same among the facilities generally there is an unavoidable gap between the target wave height and the measured wave height to minimize that gap the characteristics of the wave generator should be calibrated prior to every test in waves which is not realistic therefore this study treats the wave height measured by the wave generator whose characteristics is calibrated only before the first test since the measured added resistance differs due to the wave height difference among the facilities as shown in fig 12 the resistance in waves measured in the facilities is provided with a correction for the incident wave height by eq 20 for comparison among the facilities on the assumption that the added resistance in waves is proportional to the square of the incident wave height fig 13 confirms that the corrected resistance in waves measured in the facilities shows almost the same value 20 r w t r w r ζ t ζ w 2 r where ζ t is target wave height r wt is corrected resistance in waves and r is mean value of repeat test for corrected resistance in calm water regarding correction on water temperature the right side of eq 2 contains fluid density which in principle requires density correction when determining added resistance coefficient in waves however the authors did not correct added resistance in waves for water temperature as the viscous effect is small himeno et al 1984 3 5 uncertainty analysis for added resistance coefficient in regular short waves the mean value in certain periods is required in order to predict ship performance in waves since it is necessary to solve an equilibrium equation for the external forces acting on the ship in steady navigation thus the mean value for added resistance in waves and not an instantaneous value should be measured accurately therefore the mean value was treated as the object of uncertainty analysis in this study and oscillation in measurement was not considered 3 5 1 standard uncertainty of resistance coefficient in waves the purpose of the type a assessment is to assess the deviation in resistance in waves incident wave height and resistance in calm water that occurred in the repeat test the deviation in resistance in calm water assessed in the process of the uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water is adopted the type a assessment of the incident wave height can be carried out by eq 21 on the assumption that the non dimensional standard deviation of the mean of incident wave height is constant in eq 21 ζ w is mean of wave height in repeat test 21 u ζ w σ ζ ζ t ζ w the type a assessment of resistance in waves is based on the corrected value obtained by eq 20 this correction propagates the error that occurs in each term on the right side of the equation to the corrected resistance in waves thus the type a assessment of the corrected resistance in waves can be conducted by eq 22 22 u r w t 2 r w t r w u r w 2 r w t r ˆ u r 2 r w t ζ t u ζ t 2 r w t ζ w u ζ w 2 on the right side of eq 22 the 3rd term concerns the specific wave height which yields u ζ t 0 the derivative in the 4th term yields zero since added resistance in waves is assumed to be proportional to the square of the incident wave height accordingly the type a assessment of the corrected resistance in waves can be performed by eq 23 which is transformed from eq 22 23 u r w t 2 r w t r w u r w 2 r w t r ˆ u r 2 the objects of the type b assessment related to eq 2 are the load cell wave gauge and water temperature detector the treatment of the load cell and water temperature detector is the same as that in the uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water the wave gauge tolerance and hysteresis are assessed according to the certification in addition see of the fitting curve given by the calibration test is assessed see of the length and beam of the ship model is assumed to be 0 1 3 5 2 combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves when the standard uncertainty of corrected resistance in waves resistance in calm water incident wave height density ship model length and ship model beam are defined as u r w t u r u ζ w u ρ u l p p and u b respectively the combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves can be calculated by eq 24 and eq 25 respectively 24 u c k a w 2 k a w r w t u r w t 2 k a w r ˆ u r 2 k a w ζ w u ζ w 2 k a w ρ u ρ 2 k a w l p p u l p p 2 k a w b u b 2 25 u k a w 2 0 u c k a w 3 5 3 results of uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in regular short waves the results of the uncertainty analysis for the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves are shown in tables 6 8 and fig 14 in the tables rate represents the contribution rate of the error source to the combined uncertainty calculated by the equation given by a replacement of the denominator of eq 19 with the square of the combined uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient the expanded uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves shows qualitatively the same trend as that of the resistance coefficient in calm water the expanded uncertainty is 8 34 in 400m 14 38 in 150m and 12 49 in act uncertainty in 150m is approximately equal to that by park et al who reported 15 54 uncertainty on the other hand the uncertainty in 400m and act are smaller than that in 150m which is attributable to incorporation of the synchronous measurement system in 400m and act which minimizes deviation in the repeat test resulting in high repeatability of measurements and smaller uncertainty fig 14 also shows that the components affecting the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient are resistance in waves resistance in calm water and incident wave height the effects of the components of the ship model and fluid density can be considered negligible in 400m and 150m the predominant and secondary predominant component of the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient is wave height and resistance in waves respectively in act the component on resistance in calm water is predominant in the uncertainty whilst it is smaller than the two components this reason is that the standard uncertainty of resistance in calm water is larger than those in 400m and 150m in ship engineering retesting for confirmation of repeatability of the measurand is often required although the number of retests differs on a case by case basis it is likely that a few tests are repeated during measurement of added resistance waves in such cases uncertainty can be estimated for the mean value of the tests by calculating the standard uncertainty by eq 4 and eq 6 replaced to eq 3 and eq 5 which results in smaller uncertainty as a concrete example a test procedure in which measurements are performed two times in every case can reduce the expanded uncertainty of 150m from 14 38 to 10 33 4 evaluation of results of uncertainty analysis the applications of experimental results for added resistance in waves include predictions of ship performance such as the decrease of ship speed in actual seas which means that the uncertainty of added resistance in waves can be propagated to estimations of performance bearing in mind the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient the authors performed a sensitivity assessment of ship performance in actual seas in order to discuss the acceptable level of uncertainty by calculating the deviation of the decrease of ship speed in actual seas fig 15 sogihara et al 2010 shows the flowchart for the prediction of ship performance in actual seas and indicates that the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves has some influence on predictions of ship speed in actual seas although experimental resistance in calm water has uncertainty width the sensitivity assessment in this study does not deal with such uncertainty 4 1 uncertainty of coefficient of advance speed added resistance in waves k aw is composed of the component due to ship motion k awm and that due to wave reflection at bow k awr as shown in eq 26 k awm can be theoretically predicted by maruo s theorem 1963 while several calculation methods have been proposed for k awr the authors applied the method proposed by tsujimoto et al 2008 which gives a practical correction of k awr by incorporating model test data the coefficient of advance speed c u which is necessary for accurate estimation of k awr is obtained by eq 27 the coordinate system is shown in fig 16 26 k a w k a w m k a w r 27 α u 8 k a w k a w m l p p b f α d 1 c u f r 28 b f 1 b i sin 2 α β w sin β w d l i i sin 2 α β w sin β w d l 29 α d π 2 i 1 2 k e d π 2 i 1 2 k e d k 1 2 k

modified bessel function of the first kind of order 1 k 1 is modified bessel function of the second kind of order 1 k awm is added resistance in waves due to ship motion k awr is added resistance in waves due to wave reflection at bow and k e is wave number corresponding to encountering frequency tsujimoto et al 2015 developed the b f c u chart based on model tests in oblique waves c u in oblique waves can be estimated in accordance with the chart involving c u in heading waves which enables accurate estimation of the added resistance in any direction by means of the model test in short regular heading waves furthermore c u can also contribute to accurate estimation of the added resistance in the short crested irregular waves which ships usually encounter in actual seas c u is a key factor for accurate estimation of added resistance in waves since c u is obtained on the basis of k aw measured in model tests the uncertainty of k aw can propagate to c u based on eq 27 c u directly affects k awr which is dominant in short waves relative to the ship length in other words the effect of the uncertainty of c u on ship performance in actual seas depends on the ship length therefore the authors evaluated the deviation of c u that propagated from the uncertainty of k aw not only for the pure car carrier used in the repeat test but also for a container ship cs chemical tanker ct and vlcc whose principal particulars are shown in table 9 to clarify the sensitivity of uncertainty of k aw to c u the uncertainty of k aw is assumed to be 5 10 15 and 20 here the added resistance in regular short waves is measured at three speeds for the ships in table 9 the results of the tests are shown in fig 17 assuming that the uncertainty of k aw is independent of speed and that k aw obeys a normal distribution of n μ σ where μ is the measured k aw and σ is uncertainty the authors assessed the uncertainty of c u by the monte carlo method k aw at each speed can be generated randomly under the aforementioned normal distribution extracting one k aw randomly at each speed gives one c u and 1000 random generations of a series of k aw forms a group of 1000 c u accordingly the uncertainty of c u can be assessed by statistical analysis of the group of randomly generated c u the probability density function pdf of c u is shown in fig 18 for the pure car carrier random means the pdf based on the randomly generated c u and n d means a normal distribution n μ c σ c where μ c and σ c are the mean and standard deviation of the group of c u respectively fig 18 shows that the pdf of c u also obeys a normal distribution the coefficient of determination r 2 is 0 9813 and 0 8266 for the uncertainty of k aw of 5 0 and 20 0 respectively the statistical analysis of c u for the subject ships is summarized in table 10 where s d means standard deviation table 11 confirms that an increase in the uncertainty of k aw results in a higher standard deviation 4 2 coefficient for decrease of ship speed in actual seas f w to evaluate the results of the uncertainty analysis of k aw the authors calculated the decrease of ship speed in actual seas for the ships shown in table 9 by incorporating the mean c u and lower and upper confidence limit c u given based on table 10 the decrease of ship speed in actual seas was calculated by the ship performance simulator vesta 2015 developed by nmri vesta treats a ship in a steady navigating condition on a fixed course and numerically solves the equilibrium equation for the external forces acting on the ship as this study addresses the decrease of ship speed in heading waves and winds the added resistance due to drift motion and rudder operation is not considered added resistance in waves is estimated based on the method proposed by tsujimoto et al 2013 which originated from their previous method 2008 and was expanded to following wave systems added resistance in short crested irregular waves is obtained by linear superposition of the product of added resistance in regular waves by the frequency spectrum and directional spreading function which are prescribed in iacs rec no 34 rec 2000 corr 2001 added resistance in winds is calculated by the regression formula proposed by fujiwara et al 2006 the sea condition representing actual seas for the calculation is shown in table 11 the decrease of ship speed in actual seas is calculated when the engine output is constant at 75 mcr the guideline for the calculation of the coefficient f w for the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition is defined as follows 32 f w v w v r e f where v ref and v w denotes ship speed in calm sea condition and that in a representative sea condition respectively the guidelines define bf6 in table 11 as a representative sea condition and this is also applied to the present study for calculation of the ship speed in actual seas three c u are set mean c u m lower confidence limit c u l and upper confidence limit c u u which are set based on table 10 accordingly values of f w are obtained for each c u mentioned above the authors define δf w in eq 33 as the width of f w derived from the uncertainty of k aw 33 δ f w f w l f w u f w m where f w l f w m f w u are f w calculated with c u l c u m c u u respectively fig 19 shows the relationship between the uncertainty of k aw and the width of f w for all the subject ships fig 19 shows that the width of f w increases in proportion to the uncertainty of k aw fig 19 also indicates that the trends in the ct and vlcc are different from those in the pcc and cs more concretely the impact of the uncertainty of k aw on estimation of f w for the blunt ships is larger than that for the fine ships for the fine ships even though uncertainty reaches 20 the width of f w is less than 2 fine ships are usually installed with high output engine due to the necessity of keeping time schedules as this prevents a large decrease in ship speed in actual seas this also means that decreases in ship speed in actual seas are relatively unaffected by the uncertainty of k aw in fine ships blunt ships have relatively lower output engines and operate at lower speeds which results in a larger decrease in ship speed in actual seas than in fine ships this indicates that the sensitivity of uncertainty of k aw to decrease in ship speed is more remarkable in blunt ships suggesting that higher accuracy is required in measurement of the added resistance in waves fig 19 also shows that the width of f w for the vlcc is larger than that for the ct because the experimentally obtained k aw for the vlcc is larger than that for the ct as shown in fig 17 it is obvious that the relationship between the uncertainty of k aw and the width of f w depends on the value of k aw however the difference in the trend of the width of f w between the fine ships and the blunt ships holds generally this means that the required accuracy in measurements of added resistance in waves should be adjusted depending on the specifications of the subject ship this study has clarified the fact that for the fine ships 20 uncertainty of k aw is acceptable for estimation of f w with less than 2 0 deviation but for the blunt ships 5 uncertainty of k aw is required in order to obtain the same 2 0 deviation as in fine ships 5 concluding remarks the authors conducted repeat tests for measurement of resistance in calm water and added resistance in short regular waves at the facilities in nmri using the same ship model and performed an uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water and added resistance coefficient in waves according to the procedure published by iso for comparison among the facilities correction on speed through water water temperature and wave height was conducted to the common experimental condition the uncertainty analysis shows that the component of error source of resistance coefficient in calm water and that of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves are different among the facilities the results of the uncertainty analysis of the added resistance coefficient in waves were also evaluated by calculating the decrease of ship speed in actual seas for a pure car carrier a container ship a chemical tanker and a vlcc prior to the calculation the deviation in the coefficient of advance speed which is a key parameter for accurate estimation of the added resistance due to wave reflection at the bow was assessed on the assumption that the added resistance coefficient in waves obeys a normal distribution based on the above calculation the acceptable level of uncertainty of added resistance in waves was discussed the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the component of uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water is different between the towing tanks 400m and 150m and the basin act in the towing tanks speed through water is predominant coefficient of the uncertainty while in the basin the speed and resistance have similar influence on the uncertainty this results from larger deviation of the speed in the basin than that in the towing tank 2 the component of uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves is also different between the towing tanks and the basin in the towing tanks wave height is the predominant component of the uncertainty while in the basin resistance in calm water is predominant 3 use of the synchronous measurement system to ensure high reproducibility of measurements contributes to smaller uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in short regular waves although it does not contribute in the measurements of resistance in calm water the reason for this is that the synchronous measurement system can control of the carriage and wave generator but cannot control the profile of residual current in the facilities 4 this study demonstrated that the acceptable level of uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in waves depends on the ship type for the ships in this study the estimation of the coefficient of the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition with less than 2 0 deviation showed that uncertainty of 20 was acceptable for fine ships whereas 5 was required for the blunt ships credit author statement naoto sogihara formal analysis he had a main role of this

21477,since added resistance in waves is a key parameter for prediction of ship performance in actual seas it should be measured with sufficient accuracy in general the measurand obtained in a model test contains unavoidable error which results from the complexity of the measurement procedure of such tests therefore uncertainty which can quantify this error should be clarified for achievement of accurate measurement the authors conducted repeat tests both for resistance in calm water and for added resistance in short regular waves to assess their uncertainty in three facilities in the national maritime research institute japan nmri the tests were conducted according to the procedure published by the international organization for standardization this paper reports the results of the uncertainty analysis for resistance in calm water and added resistance in short regular waves and the comparison among the three facilities which revealed that the predominant error component is different among the facilities furthermore the authors calculated the decrease in ship speed in actual seas on the basis of the results of the uncertainty analysis for added resistance in waves in order to discuss whether the uncertainty is acceptable the results of the calculation showed that added resistance in short regular waves can be measured with sufficient accuracy for practical

devices in the design stage but also to acquire validation data for the numerical method developed which means that model tests must always provide highly accurate and reliable data as a model test usually involves a large number of instruments and complicated test procedure errors in the measurand will inevitably occur therefore it is necessary to understand the quantity of such errors in order to maintain model test accuracy one of the aims of quantitative assessment of the error in the measurand includes uncertainty analysis uncertainty analysis can not only assess the uncertainty of the output but can also clarify the propagation route of error and provide useful information for improvement of model test accuracy himeno et al 1990 applied uncertainty analysis to a resistance test in calm water that study dealt with error propagation in the process of correcting measured data nishio et al 1991 applied uncertainty analysis to a resistance test and self propulsion test in calm water and discussed the treatment of the low pass filter and problem of curve fitting these two studies focused on the repeat test which refers to measurements conducted at various times under the same conditions kume et al 2000 presented an uncertainty analysis for a single test taking into account that the resistance test and self propulsion test in calm water are regularly conducted tests these studies followed the performance test guidelines developed by the american national standards institute and american society of mechanical engineers ansi asme longo and stern 2005 presented an example of uncertainty analysis for a resistance test and nominal wake measurement in accordance with the procedure of the american institute of aeronautics and astronautics aiaa the international towing tank conference ittc led a worldwide series of comparative tests ittc 2008 for identifying facility bias under the framework of ittc procedures for uncertainty analysis in addition to ship performance in calm seas recent studies have also examined ship performance in actual seas which requires accurate measurement of added resistance in waves by model tests since added resistance in waves is the dominant component among the external forces acting on a ship in actual seas the international maritime organization imo developed guidelines for calculation of the coefficient f w of the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition imo 2012 those guidelines recommend that use of model test data is preferable for accurate calculation of the decrease in ship speed thus it is necessary to assess uncertainty in the measurement of added resistance in waves in order to evaluate ship performance in actual seas with sufficient accuracy park et al 2015 applied uncertainty analysis to measurement of added resistance in regular waves using the kvlcc2 model they proposed a procedure for uncertainty analysis for added resistance in waves and discussed the effect of each error source but did not discuss the effect of the uncertainty of the added resistance on ship performance in actual seas estimation of ship performance in actual seas by solving an equilibrium equation for the forces acting on a ship requires the mean value within a certain period not an instantaneous value in particular since added resistance in waves is predominant among external forces it should be accurately measured bearing in mind that larger ships encounter relatively shorter waves the authors focused on added resistance in short regular waves and conducted repeat tests for uncertainty analysis at the three facilities in the national maritime research institute japan nmri the comparison of uncertainty among the facilities is reported in this paper further in order to discuss whether the assessed uncertainty is acceptable the decrease in ship speed in actual seas was calculated on the basis of the uncertainty analysis 2 uncertainty analysis the procedures provided by the ansi asme and aiaa define error in measurement as the difference between the measurand and the true value error in measurement is composed of bias error and random error the former is constant error and the latter is error that varies randomly throughout measurements these procedures indicate that assessment of the two components of error sources provides the uncertainty of the output although the procedures of the ansi asme and aiaa give a reasonable assessment of uncertainty there is concern that the true value cannot be measured in reality and it is difficult to assess the uncertainty provided by an uncertainty analysis based on an unknown value to overcome those concerns guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement gum was published by the international organization for standardization iso 1995 gum defines the true value not only as a sole value but also as a group of values that might be the true value which enables construction of a highly reasonable and consistent uncertainty considering the fact that ittc applies gum to the procedure of uncertainty analysis 2014a the authors conducted an uncertainty analysis according to gum consisting of the following steps 2 1 data reduction equation the instruments used in measurement should be appropriately selected and the data reduction equation should be determined for the purpose of measurement this study addresses not only added resistance in waves but also resistance in calm water which is required in order to calculate added resistance in waves the resistance coefficient in calm water c t and the added resistance coefficient in waves k aw are expressed as follows respectively 1 c t r 0 5 ρ s v 2 2 k a w r a w ρ g ζ w 2 b 2 l p p r w r ρ g ζ w 2 b 2 l p p where r is resistance in calm water ρ is density of a fluid s is wetted surface area v is ship speed through water r w is resistance in waves r aw is added resistance in waves g is gravitational acceleration ζ w is incident wave height l pp is ship length between perpendiculars and b is ship breadth 2 2 standard uncertainty assessments of standard uncertainty consist of type a assessment and type b assessment the uncertainty of the type a assessment is obtained by a repeat test based on the results of a repeat test in which the tests are repeated m times the uncertainties of the mean value x of a type a assessment for a single test and a repeat test are given by eq 3 and eq 4 respectively using the standard deviation s obtained by the repeat test 3 u x s for single test 4 u x s m for repeat test the uncertainty of the type b assessment is based on the manufacturer s specifications previous test data the instrument handbook or the experience and knowledge of the experimenter the estimated standard uncertainty of an instrument whose capacity is x c and tolerance is a is calculated by eqs 5 and 6 for a single test and repeat test of m times respectively the authors assigned the value 3 to k d on the assumption

set to 2 0 11 u k c u c y 3 repeat test and uncertainty assessment this study deals with the mean obtained in one test illustrated in fig 1 as the object of uncertainty analysis the authors conducted a repeat test at the 400 m towing tank hereinafter 400m 150 m towing tank hereinafter 150m and actual sea model basin hereinafter act in nmri for uncertainty analysis act has 382 wave generators on its surrounding and can generate waves with accuracy tanizawa et al 2011 while the two towing tanks have a wave generator on their edge the principal particulars of the ship model used in these repeat tests are shown in table 1 the ship type is a pure car carrier the apparatus for measurement in the repeat tests is shown in fig 2 and is usually used for resistance or self propulsion tests in calm water the sway and yaw motions of the ship model were restricted by the fore and aft guide units while heave and pitch motions were free to move the sampling frequencies were set to 100 hz in all measurements table 2 shows the specification of the facilities and the conditions of the repeat test at 400m and act the synchronous measurement system described below has been introduced to ensure repeatability in measurements 3 1 synchronous measurement system the procedure of a model test is often complicated since it consists of many processes such as carriage control clamp activation and trigger input for measurement which are often performed by manually operation however manual operation cannot completely reproduce the time history of such processes and therefore fails to maintain the repeatability of measurements to ensure higher repeatability of measurements nmri installed a synchronous measurement system in 400m and act as the system follows a sequence program constructed prior to the measurement and operates each process automatically it can completely reproduce the time history of the processes in measurements which contributes to decrease deviation among measurements the sequence used in this study is shown in fig 3 the important point in the sequence is that the wave generators are stopped before the measurement is performed the reason is that the measurement should be performed in the minimum number of waves excessive wave making is not desirable since much residual waves having influences on the next test remain on the water surface the time history of the wave height obtained in act using the synchronous measurement system is shown in fig 4 where 10 series of time histories are superimposed fig 4 shows that the synchronous measurement system can reproduce the time history of wave height with high accuracy the correlation factor between measurements is distributed from 0 9842 to 0 9992 and the averaged correlation factor is 0 9954 since a synchronous measurement system has not been installed in 150m the time from measurement start is always monitored to conduct the sequence manually and realize a condition similar to those in 400m and act 3 2 resistance test in calm water the resistance test in calm water is carried out with ship speed v c 1 614 m s f r 0 238 resistance and speed through water were measured in the resistance test the results of the resistance test are shown in figs 5 7 the values plotted in these figures are based on the averaged value in each measurement fig 5 shows that while the speed through water measured in 400m and 150m does not show a qualitative trend that in act decreases as the number of measurements accumulates the residual current profile in act may differ from that in 400m and 150m and seems to generate a following current in act fig 6 shows that a 2 difference in resistance appears among the facilities while the resistance measured in each basin is almost constant throughout the repeat test although the same apparatuses were used in the three facilities details such as the spring in the towing rod installed on the model were different among the facilities it is likely that these differences can affect the resistance coefficient in calm water in fig 7 which requires further consideration considering the comparison among facilities the authors corrected the measured resistance for the common water temperature 15 degrees c in accordance with the ittc procedure 2014b as shown in eq 12 the frictional resistance coefficient is calculated according to the schoenherr implicit formula 12 r ˆ ρ t c ρ t m 1 c f t c c f t m c t t m r where r ˆ is corrected resistance in calm water for common water temperature t c is common water temperature t m is measured water temperature and c f is frictional resistance coefficient in addition to the correction on water temperature the measured resistance should be corrected for the speed through water as well as for water temperature the correction follows eq 13 on the assumption that the resistance in still water is proportional to the square of the speed through water fig 8 shows the corrected resistance on water temperature and speed through water and demonstrates that the resistance in each basin goes to the same value by the correction 13 r v c 2 v 2 r ˆ where v c is target ship speed through water in repeat test and r is corrected resistance in calm water for common speed through water and water temperature 3 3 uncertainty analysis for resistance coefficient in calm water 3 3 1 standard uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water the purpose of the type a assessment is to assess the deviation in resistance and speed through water that occurred in the repeat test the uncertainties of the type a and type b assessments for a single test are calculated by eq 3 and eq 5 respectively where k d in eq 5 is set to 3 on the assumption that uncertainty obeys a uniform distribution on type a assessment of the corrected resistance on the speed through water and water temperature the propagation of the uncertainty due to the correction should be considered the type a assessment of the corrected resistance can be conducted by eq 14 and eq 15 14 u r ˆ 2 r ˆ r u r 2 r ˆ v u v 2 r ˆ t m u t m 2 r ˆ l p p u l p p 2 r ˆ s u s 2 15 u r 2 r r ˆ u r ˆ 2 r v u v 2 since the derivative of the first term in the right hand in eq 14 is ρ t c ρ t m which is almost equal to 1 it is required to carry out an assessment on the contribution of the other terms the assessment reveals that the sum of the second term to the fifth term does not exceed 0 02 of the whole right hand the reason why the percentage is negligibly small is that the water temperature in each basin is close to the common water temperature 15 degrees c the type b assessment related to eq 1 treats the load cell current meter and water temperature detector water temperature is related to eq 1 because the water density is based on the measured water temperature according to the equation described in the ittc procedure 2002 however in the present study the water temperature was measured only once prior to the repeat test this is different from the ittc procedure recommending water temperature measurements before every test it is assumed that the model length has a 0 1 manufacturing error and the wetted surface has a 0 2 error the load cell used in the repeat test is assumed to have a tolerance non linearity and hysteresis in the type b assessment the standard estimated error see of the fitting curve given by calibration as defined by eq 16 is also included 16 s e e k 1 n d y k y l s k 2 n d c where c is number of constant variables in see n d is number of tests in calibration y k is value measured at calibration and y ls k is value used in the fitting curve corresponding to k th test linear approximation of the calibration data yields c 2 the tolerance and see of the fitting curve of the calibration test of the current meter and the resolution and reading error of the water temperature gauge are included in the type b assessment 3 3 2 combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water when the standard uncertainty of resistance speed through water density and wetted surface area are defined as u r u v u ρ and u s respectively the combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of the resistance coefficient in calm water can be calculated by eq 17 and eq 18 respectively 17 u c c t 2 c t r u r 2 c t v u v 2 c t ρ u ρ 2 c t s u s 2 18 u c t 2 0 u c c t 3 3 3 results of uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water the uncertainty analysis for a single test of the resistance coefficient in calm water is shown in tables 3 5 and fig 9 in the tables rate represents the contribution rate of an error source to combined uncertainty and is calculated by eq 19 fig 9 shows the combined uncertainty multiplied by the sensitivity coefficient 19 r a t e u x i 2 u c c t 2 tables 3 5 show that the expanded uncertainty of the resistance coefficient in calm water is 1 15 in 400m 1 44 in 150m and 2 63 in act fig 9 expresses that the component of uncertainty is different among the facilities fig 9 shows that the effects of the density do not appear while those of resistance and speed through water are dominant uncertainty in 150m and in 400m is less than that in act the reason for the smaller uncertainty in 400m and 150m is that they are towing tanks in which the towing carriage is able to run a long distance to ensure steady measurement whereas act has a shorter distance in the towing direction than the others which contributes to larger uncertainty in addition the residual current in act which is deemed to be different from that in the other facilities also contributes to the larger uncertainty further consideration of the time interval between tests may be required as this is closely related to the residual current profile which affects the accuracy of speed through water furthermore fig 9 shows that the component of resistance is almost equal to that of speed through water in act although the most of uncertainty is the speed in 400m and 150m this study treats the corrected resistance on the speed and water temperature which is expected to prevent an increase of uncertainty of resistance this is achieved in 400m and 150m however not achieved in act the main reason of this is the deviation of the speed in act as fig 5 demonstrates the speed in act is gradually going down which gives larger deviation in the speed although this study incorporates the synchronous measurement system in 400m and act which is expected to contribute to smaller uncertainty in measurement there was no improvement in the uncertainty of resistance in calm water among the facilities because synchronous measurement is conducted manually in 150m this suggests that either automatic or manual synchronous measurement should be ensured for measuring resistance in calm water with high repeatability 3 4 added resistance tests in short regular waves while park et al conducted repeat tests to measure added resistance in regular waves for λ l pp 0 5 1 1 and 2 0 where λ is wave length the authors set λ l pp 0 4 as a condition for measurement of added resistance in waves considering the fact that the guidelines for calculating the coefficient for the decrease in ship speed f w developed by imo recommend that model test results for added resistance in short regular waves should be incorporated in the calculation the test speed is set to ship speed v 1 614 m s f r 0 238 and the incident wave height is set to 0 074 m corresponding to 3 0 m in full scale equivalent to beaufort scale 6 which the guidelines define as a representative sea condition since the added resistance test is carried out in regular short waves in which ship motion is negligibly small the apparatus shown in fig 2 was used in this test as well as in the test in calm water tsujimoto et al 2012 non dimensional heave and pitch amplitude measured in the tests is about 0 02 and 0 01 respectively wave height is estimated as the first order term of a fourier series expansion and resistance in waves is estimated as the averaged value within the period in which the fourier series expansion is conducted incident wave height and resistance in waves are measured in the tests the results of the incident wave height resistance in waves and added resistance coefficient in waves are shown in figs 10 12 respectively the resistance in waves measured in 150m is smaller than that in the other facilities since the wave height in 150m is smaller and the added resistance coefficient is almost same among the facilities generally there is an unavoidable gap between the target wave height and the measured wave height to minimize that gap the characteristics of the wave generator should be calibrated prior to every test in waves which is not realistic therefore this study treats the wave height measured by the wave generator whose characteristics is calibrated only before the first test since the measured added resistance differs due to the wave height difference among the facilities as shown in fig 12 the resistance in waves measured in the facilities is provided with a correction for the incident wave height by eq 20 for comparison among the facilities on the assumption that the added resistance in waves is proportional to the square of the incident wave height fig 13 confirms that the corrected resistance in waves measured in the facilities shows almost the same value 20 r w t r w r ζ t ζ w 2 r where ζ t is target wave height r wt is corrected resistance in waves and r is mean value of repeat test for corrected resistance in calm water regarding correction on water temperature the right side of eq 2 contains fluid density which in principle requires density correction when determining added resistance coefficient in waves however the authors did not correct added resistance in waves for water temperature as the viscous effect is small himeno et al 1984 3 5 uncertainty analysis for added resistance coefficient in regular short waves the mean value in certain periods is required in order to predict ship performance in waves since it is necessary to solve an equilibrium equation for the external forces acting on the ship in steady navigation thus the mean value for added resistance in waves and not an instantaneous value should be measured accurately therefore the mean value was treated as the object of uncertainty analysis in this study and oscillation in measurement was not considered 3 5 1 standard uncertainty of resistance coefficient in waves the purpose of the type a assessment is to assess the deviation in resistance in waves incident wave height and resistance in calm water that occurred in the repeat test the deviation in resistance in calm water assessed in the process of the uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water is adopted the type a assessment of the incident wave height can be carried out by eq 21 on the assumption that the non dimensional standard deviation of the mean of incident wave height is constant in eq 21 ζ w is mean of wave height in repeat test 21 u ζ w σ ζ ζ t ζ w the type a assessment of resistance in waves is based on the corrected value obtained by eq 20 this correction propagates the error that occurs in each term on the right side of the equation to the corrected resistance in waves thus the type a assessment of the corrected resistance in waves can be conducted by eq 22 22 u r w t 2 r w t r w u r w 2 r w t r ˆ u r 2 r w t ζ t u ζ t 2 r w t ζ w u ζ w 2 on the right side of eq 22 the 3rd term concerns the specific wave height which yields u ζ t 0 the derivative in the 4th term yields zero since added resistance in waves is assumed to be proportional to the square of the incident wave height accordingly the type a assessment of the corrected resistance in waves can be performed by eq 23 which is transformed from eq 22 23 u r w t 2 r w t r w u r w 2 r w t r ˆ u r 2 the objects of the type b assessment related to eq 2 are the load cell wave gauge and water temperature detector the treatment of the load cell and water temperature detector is the same as that in the uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water the wave gauge tolerance and hysteresis are assessed according to the certification in addition see of the fitting curve given by the calibration test is assessed see of the length and beam of the ship model is assumed to be 0 1 3 5 2 combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves when the standard uncertainty of corrected resistance in waves resistance in calm water incident wave height density ship model length and ship model beam are defined as u r w t u r u ζ w u ρ u l p p and u b respectively the combined uncertainty and expanded uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves can be calculated by eq 24 and eq 25 respectively 24 u c k a w 2 k a w r w t u r w t 2 k a w r ˆ u r 2 k a w ζ w u ζ w 2 k a w ρ u ρ 2 k a w l p p u l p p 2 k a w b u b 2 25 u k a w 2 0 u c k a w 3 5 3 results of uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in regular short waves the results of the uncertainty analysis for the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves are shown in tables 6 8 and fig 14 in the tables rate represents the contribution rate of the error source to the combined uncertainty calculated by the equation given by a replacement of the denominator of eq 19 with the square of the combined uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient the expanded uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves shows qualitatively the same trend as that of the resistance coefficient in calm water the expanded uncertainty is 8 34 in 400m 14 38 in 150m and 12 49 in act uncertainty in 150m is approximately equal to that by park et al who reported 15 54 uncertainty on the other hand the uncertainty in 400m and act are smaller than that in 150m which is attributable to incorporation of the synchronous measurement system in 400m and act which minimizes deviation in the repeat test resulting in high repeatability of measurements and smaller uncertainty fig 14 also shows that the components affecting the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient are resistance in waves resistance in calm water and incident wave height the effects of the components of the ship model and fluid density can be considered negligible in 400m and 150m the predominant and secondary predominant component of the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient is wave height and resistance in waves respectively in act the component on resistance in calm water is predominant in the uncertainty whilst it is smaller than the two components this reason is that the standard uncertainty of resistance in calm water is larger than those in 400m and 150m in ship engineering retesting for confirmation of repeatability of the measurand is often required although the number of retests differs on a case by case basis it is likely that a few tests are repeated during measurement of added resistance waves in such cases uncertainty can be estimated for the mean value of the tests by calculating the standard uncertainty by eq 4 and eq 6 replaced to eq 3 and eq 5 which results in smaller uncertainty as a concrete example a test procedure in which measurements are performed two times in every case can reduce the expanded uncertainty of 150m from 14 38 to 10 33 4 evaluation of results of uncertainty analysis the applications of experimental results for added resistance in waves include predictions of ship performance such as the decrease of ship speed in actual seas which means that the uncertainty of added resistance in waves can be propagated to estimations of performance bearing in mind the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient the authors performed a sensitivity assessment of ship performance in actual seas in order to discuss the acceptable level of uncertainty by calculating the deviation of the decrease of ship speed in actual seas fig 15 sogihara et al 2010 shows the flowchart for the prediction of ship performance in actual seas and indicates that the uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in regular short waves has some influence on predictions of ship speed in actual seas although experimental resistance in calm water has uncertainty width the sensitivity assessment in this study does not deal with such uncertainty 4 1 uncertainty of coefficient of advance speed added resistance in waves k aw is composed of the component due to ship motion k awm and that due to wave reflection at bow k awr as shown in eq 26 k awm can be theoretically predicted by maruo s theorem 1963 while several calculation methods have been proposed for k awr the authors applied the method proposed by tsujimoto et al 2008 which gives a practical correction of k awr by incorporating model test data the coefficient of advance speed c u which is necessary for accurate estimation of k awr is obtained by eq 27 the coordinate system is shown in fig 16 26 k a w k a w m k a w r 27 α u 8 k a w k a w m l p p b f α d 1 c u f r 28 b f 1 b i sin 2 α β w sin β w d l i i sin 2 α β w sin β w d l 29 α d π 2 i 1 2 k e d π 2 i 1 2 k e d k 1 2 k e d 30 k e k 1 ω cos α 31 ω ω v g where α is incident wave direction where 0 means heading waves α d is effect of draft and frequency α u is effect of advance speed β w is slope of line element along the water line ω is circular frequency of incident regular waves b f is bluntness coefficient c u is coefficient of advance speed d is ship draft dl is line element along the water plane i 1 is modified bessel function of the first kind of order 1 k 1 is modified bessel function of the second kind of order 1 k awm is added resistance in waves due to ship motion k awr is added resistance in waves due to wave reflection at bow and k e is wave number corresponding to encountering frequency tsujimoto et al 2015 developed the b f c u chart based on model tests in oblique waves c u in oblique waves can be estimated in accordance with the chart involving c u in heading waves which enables accurate estimation of the added resistance in any direction by means of the model test in short regular heading waves furthermore c u can also contribute to accurate estimation of the added resistance in the short crested irregular waves which ships usually encounter in actual seas c u is a key factor for accurate estimation of added resistance in waves since c u is obtained on the basis of k aw measured in model tests the uncertainty of k aw can propagate to c u based on eq 27 c u directly affects k awr which is dominant in short waves relative to the ship length in other words the effect of the uncertainty of c u on ship performance in actual seas depends on the ship length therefore the authors evaluated the deviation of c u that propagated from the uncertainty of k aw not only for the pure car carrier used in the repeat test but also for a container ship cs chemical tanker ct and vlcc whose principal particulars are shown in table 9 to clarify the sensitivity of uncertainty of k aw to c u the uncertainty of k aw is assumed to be 5 10 15 and 20 here the added resistance in regular short waves is measured at three speeds for the ships in table 9 the results of the tests are shown in fig 17 assuming that the uncertainty of k aw is independent of speed and that k aw obeys a normal distribution of n μ σ where μ is the measured k aw and σ is uncertainty the authors assessed the uncertainty of c u by the monte carlo method k aw at each speed can be generated randomly under the aforementioned normal distribution extracting one k aw randomly at each speed gives one c u and 1000 random generations of a series of k aw forms a group of 1000 c u accordingly the uncertainty of c u can be assessed by statistical analysis of the group of randomly generated c u the probability density function pdf of c u is shown in fig 18 for the pure car carrier random means the pdf based on the randomly generated c u and n d means a normal distribution n μ c σ c where μ c and σ c are the mean and standard deviation of the group of c u respectively fig 18 shows that the pdf of c u also obeys a normal distribution the coefficient of determination r 2 is 0 9813 and 0 8266 for the uncertainty of k aw of 5 0 and 20 0 respectively the statistical analysis of c u for the subject ships is summarized in table 10 where s d means standard deviation table 11 confirms that an increase in the uncertainty of k aw results in a higher standard deviation 4 2 coefficient for decrease of ship speed in actual seas f w to evaluate the results of the uncertainty analysis of k aw the authors calculated the decrease of ship speed in actual seas for the ships shown in table 9 by incorporating the mean c u and lower and upper confidence limit c u given based on table 10 the decrease of ship speed in actual seas was calculated by the ship performance simulator vesta 2015 developed by nmri vesta treats a ship in a steady navigating condition on a fixed course and numerically solves the equilibrium equation for the external forces acting on the ship as this study addresses the decrease of ship speed in heading waves and winds the added resistance due to drift motion and rudder operation is not considered added resistance in waves is estimated based on the method proposed by tsujimoto et al 2013 which originated from their previous method 2008 and was expanded to following wave systems added resistance in short crested irregular waves is obtained by linear superposition of the product of added resistance in regular waves by the frequency spectrum and directional spreading function which are prescribed in iacs rec no 34 rec 2000 corr 2001 added resistance in winds is calculated by the regression formula proposed by fujiwara et al 2006 the sea condition representing actual seas for the calculation is shown in table 11 the decrease of ship speed in actual seas is calculated when the engine output is constant at 75 mcr the guideline for the calculation of the coefficient f w for the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition is defined as follows 32 f w v w v r e f where v ref and v w denotes ship speed in calm sea condition and that in a representative sea condition respectively the guidelines define bf6 in table 11 as a representative sea condition and this is also applied to the present study for calculation of the ship speed in actual seas three c u are set mean c u m lower confidence limit c u l and upper confidence limit c u u which are set based on table 10 accordingly values of f w are obtained for each c u mentioned above the authors define δf w in eq 33 as the width of f w derived from the uncertainty of k aw 33 δ f w f w l f w u f w m where f w l f w m f w u are f w calculated with c u l c u m c u u respectively fig 19 shows the relationship between the uncertainty of k aw and the width of f w for all the subject ships fig 19 shows that the width of f w increases in proportion to the uncertainty of k aw fig 19 also indicates that the trends in the ct and vlcc are different from those in the pcc and cs more concretely the impact of the uncertainty of k aw on estimation of f w for the blunt ships is larger than that for the fine ships for the fine ships even though uncertainty reaches 20 the width of f w is less than 2 fine ships are usually installed with high output engine due to the necessity of keeping time schedules as this prevents a large decrease in ship speed in actual seas this also means that decreases in ship speed in actual seas are relatively unaffected by the uncertainty of k aw in fine ships blunt ships have relatively lower output engines and operate at lower speeds which results in a larger decrease in ship speed in actual seas than in fine ships this indicates that the sensitivity of uncertainty of k aw to decrease in ship speed is more remarkable in blunt ships suggesting that higher accuracy is required in measurement of the added resistance in waves fig 19 also shows that the width of f w for the vlcc is larger than that for the ct because the experimentally obtained k aw for the vlcc is larger than that for the ct as shown in fig 17 it is obvious that the relationship between the uncertainty of k aw and the width of f w depends on the value of k aw however the difference in the trend of the width of f w between the fine ships and the blunt ships holds generally this means that the required accuracy in measurements of added resistance in waves should be adjusted depending on the specifications of the subject ship this study has clarified the fact that for the fine ships 20 uncertainty of k aw is acceptable for estimation of f w with less than 2 0 deviation but for the blunt ships 5 uncertainty of k aw is required in order to obtain the same 2 0 deviation as in fine ships 5 concluding remarks the authors conducted repeat tests for measurement of resistance in calm water and added resistance in short regular waves at the facilities in nmri using the same ship model and performed an uncertainty analysis for the resistance coefficient in calm water and added resistance coefficient in waves according to the procedure published by iso for comparison among the facilities correction on speed through water water temperature and wave height was conducted to the common experimental condition the uncertainty analysis shows that the component of error source of resistance coefficient in calm water and that of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves are different among the facilities the results of the uncertainty analysis of the added resistance coefficient in waves were also evaluated by calculating the decrease of ship speed in actual seas for a pure car carrier a container ship a chemical tanker and a vlcc prior to the calculation the deviation in the coefficient of advance speed which is a key parameter for accurate estimation of the added resistance due to wave reflection at the bow was assessed on the assumption that the added resistance coefficient in waves obeys a normal distribution based on the above calculation the acceptable level of uncertainty of added resistance in waves was discussed the conclusions of this study are as follows 1 the component of uncertainty of resistance coefficient in calm water is different between the towing tanks 400m and 150m and the basin act in the towing tanks speed through water is predominant coefficient of the uncertainty while in the basin the speed and resistance have similar influence on the uncertainty this results from larger deviation of the speed in the basin than that in the towing tank 2 the component of uncertainty of added resistance coefficient in short regular waves is also different between the towing tanks and the basin in the towing tanks wave height is the predominant component of the uncertainty while in the basin resistance in calm water is predominant 3 use of the synchronous measurement system to ensure high reproducibility of measurements contributes to smaller uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in short regular waves although it does not contribute in the measurements of resistance in calm water the reason for this is that the synchronous measurement system can control of the carriage and wave generator but cannot control the profile of residual current in the facilities 4 this study demonstrated that the acceptable level of uncertainty of the added resistance coefficient in waves depends on the ship type for the ships in this study the estimation of the coefficient of the decrease in ship speed in a representative sea condition with less than 2 0 deviation showed that uncertainty of 20 was acceptable for fine ships whereas 5 was required for the blunt ships credit author statement naoto sogihara formal analysis he had a main role of this

21478,a novel three dimensional dynamic model is developed to investigate the vortex induced vibrations vivs in flexible risers with buoyant blocks conveying the internal fluid flow the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with wake dynamics are modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators that consider the coupling between the structure and the fluid furthermore our model considers the loads of buoyancy weight tension pressure temperature and seawater current owing to wind tide and waves as well as the nonlinear effect of the large deflection of the riser on the loads the riser is discretized into slender beam elements the distributed van der pol wake oscillators are also discretized on the element nodes and each node has six degrees of freedom allowing it to describe the vibrations of the risers in lateral axis and torsion simultaneously the boundary conditions include the displacements and rotations at the up end and free bottom end in the presence of additional weight the computational program is prepared using matlab r2014a the simulation results exhibit good agreement with the existing experimental data verifying the validity of the model and the parameters finally the viv simulations are conducted for more realistic risers when they are entering 500 3000 m deep water denoting the effects of buoyant blocks entry speed and water depth upon the drop point offset of the bottom end of the risers the tension stresses as well as the values and positions of the maximum bending stresses with respect to the risers these data can be used to select a good operational condition for ensuring the entry of a riser this study provides a computational framework for conducting subsequent research and the obtained results can be applied to construct ocean floating platforms more scientifically safely and economically keywords flexible riser vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction large deflection mathematical simulation 1 introduction earth contains abundant oil and gas resources majority of these resources are probably present at a considerable depth under water ward et al 1999 this has resulted in the exploration of ever deeper water to meet the global demand of oil and gas thus there is an urgent requirement for developing advanced analytical tools to design and assess floating production systems at depths of greater than 3000 m the drilling riser which is an indispensable equipment is the main channel from the wellhead at the seabed to the drilling platform the riser is subjected to several loads including the hydrodynamic forces of wind induced water flow wave flow ocean current and the wake the weight and buoyancy of the mud and the pipe and the mounted buoyant blocks the tension exerted by the tensioner of the platform the pressure difference between the internal mud and external seawater and the strains owing to the temperature difference with respect to the surface and subsea which can vary with the depth of water furthermore the buoyant blocks can reduce the tension but enlarge the hydrodynamic forces on the riser therefore considerably powerful tools are required for mechanically assessing the riser under deep water conditions otherwise various accidents including the failure of the feed column during the drilling processes in the gulf of mexico and the brazilian sea can occur resulting in huge capital loss and severe environmental pollution breihan et al 2001 sathuvalli et al 2002 the length to diameter ratio l d of a riser is referred to as its aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is small e g less than 10 the riser can be treated as a rigid body exhibiting a maximum of six degrees of freedom or natural modes lehn 2003 however for large aspect ratios the riser is observed to become considerably flexible further the riser should be considered to be a long slender elastic structure implying the presence of innumerable natural modes therefore in 3000 m deep water the riser thus the aspect ratio will become approximately 6000 is a typical three dimensional flexible fluid solid interaction structure when currents cross through a vertical riser the riser will be in motion in the in line il direction and vortices will be shed from the side surface of the riser frequently resulting in the formation of the wake the wake excites the riser vibrating in cross flow cf direction and affects the il motion also furthermore the tension applied to the two ends of the riser can regulate the deflection and excitation of the riser majority of the shedding frequencies along the span will be modified toward the natural frequency if a shedding frequency is approximately similar to the natural frequency of a riser exhibiting a small aspect ratio this can be referred to as the frequency lock in phenomenon or lock in for short in contrast the lock in occurs elusively from time to time and from part to part when the aspect ratio is large thus the vortex induced vibrations are a typical example of truly self excited and self sustained oscillations the details of the aforementioned discussions can be found in the comprehensive reviews of sarpkaya 1979 sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benar oya 2005 gabbai and benaroya 2005 bearman 2011 bearman 2011 and wu et al 2012 wu et al 2012 many experiments have been conducted with respect to deep water risers having large l d values tognarelli et al 2004 chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 vandiver et al 2006 tognarelli et al 2008 vandiver et al 2009 huang et al 2011 gu et al 2013 gao et al 2015 in addition several computational fluid dynamics cfd studies have been conducted with respect to the vortex induced vibrations vivs of the flexible cylinders willden and graham 2001 willden and graham 2001 used a quasi three dimensional q3d method to simulate the transverse vibration in case of a cylinder subjected to shear flow in case of low reynolds number when l d 100 meneghini et al 2004 meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 yamamoto et al 2004 presented numerical simulations of long marine risers having l d values of up to 4600 via the q3d discrete vortex method where several two dimensional 2d strips were distributed over the length of the riser for reducing the computational requirements using an entirely 3d cfd approach wang and xiao 2016 wang and xiao 2016 studied the combined il and cf viv of a vertical riser when l d 481 5 in case of uniform and linearly sheared currents and captured the features of the viv riser in detail resulting in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 developed a 3d nonlinear model to investigate the vivs of the flexible pipes conveying internal fluid flow where the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics were modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators by considering the coupling between the structure and the fluid as well as the structural buckling effects further the first order galerkin technique was used to discretize a pipe with pinned pinned supports and obtain the numerical solution for a riser with l d 200 the usage of van der pol oscillators to mimic the wake effects on the structures in the presence of currents has been extensively discussed facchinetti et al 2004 hartlen and currie 1970 kim and perkins 2002 this can considerably reduce the computational demands and capture the main features of the viv structures however the galerkin technique is infeasible in case of a riser subjected to axially varying loads or risers having nonuniform diameters e g the one partially mounted buoyant blocks and complex boundary conditions e g those subject to shear currents and nonuniform pressures resulting in the vibration of the upper end of the riser with the floating platform when the weighted bottom end swings slowly the cfd simulations are considered to be ideal to predict the viv of long and slender cylinders however these simulations are very rare because the 3d cfd simulations at realistic reynolds numbers are limited by the extensive computational requirements and the realistic aspect ratios of the risers are larger than several thousands in case of deep water oil and gas explorations in this study we intend to simulate the mechanical responses of risers when they enter into water of depths greater than 3000 m and experience realistic difficulties to serve the oil industry more efficiently we propose a 3d viv model for a vertical riser under deep water conditions including internal fluid flow the loads of buoyancy weight tension pressure temperature and seawater currents owing to wind tide and waves as well as the loads nonlinearly affected by the large deflection of the riser and the boundary conditions of displacement and rotation at the upper end and free bottom end in the presence of weight of the blowout preventer bop stacks the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics were modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators by considering the coupling between the structure and the fluid the risers were discretized using slender beam elements and each node exhibited six degrees of freedom allowing the riser to vibrate in axis torsion and lateral simultaneously the distributed van der pol wake oscillators were also discretized with respect to the nodes of the finite element model fem of the riser the fem was evaluated using the newmark method whereas the van der pol wake oscillators were evaluated using the fourth order runge kutta method by considering the same time step length as that considered in the former case the models are derived and described in section 2 in section 3 model verification and the determination of the model parameter values are performed by comparing the simulation results with the existing experimental data in section 4 the viv simulation results of the realistic risers with buoyant blocks that enter into 3000 m deep water are presented and discussed finally the conclusions of this study are presented in section 5 2 model and solution 2 1 analytical model as shown in fig 1 a certain right hand coordinate system is defined with y and z in the horizontal plane and x in the vertically upright position the riser can be simplified as a uniform flexible free span circular cylinder having length l constant outer diameter d here and below if not specified do not consider the buoyant blocks when there is a buoyant block it is easily handled by the fem in subsection 2 2 and material density ρ r conveying a steady fluid with density ρ f and flow velocity u i the up end of the riser hangs from the platform whereas the bottom end is connected to a blowout preventer bop having weight p e x the riser is also subjected to cf with velocity u perpendicular to the riser s undisturbed axis i e the x axis and at an angle β with respect to the y axis when the riser enters into water its top vertical velocity is denoted as u 0 and the temperature difference between the water at the top and bottom of the riser is δ t r under these conditions the models for the vertical lateral and torsional vibrations of the riser can be established via hamilton s principle and the finite element method according to hamilton s principle the vibration equation of the riser can be given as follows 1 i f t h i s e q u a t i o n d o e s n t f i t o n o n e l i n e p l e a s e s e p

derivation of eq 1 are listed in appendix a in eq 1 dx denotes the differential length of the riser m r ρ r a r denotes the mass of the riser per unit length and a r denotes its cross sectional area m a ρ w π d 2 4 denotes the additional mass added to the riser per unit length whereas ρ w denotes the density of the water around the riser here we assume that this is constant if not it will be obtained via fem as presented in subsection 2 2 m f ρ f a i denotes the mass of the fluid contained in the riser per unit length and a i denotes the internal cross sectional area of the riser e and g are respectively young s modulus and shear modulus of the riser i and i x are the moments of inertia of the riser s cross section with respect to diameter and x axis respectively j x denotes the moment of inertia of the riser per unit length with respect to the axis of the column ε x 0 denotes the initial axial strain of the riser owing to assembly and processing and or the temperature strain expressed as α t δ t r where α t is the linear expansion coefficient of the pipe p i denotes the internal pressure when the external pressure p e exists p i should be replaced by p i p e t 0 denotes the additional end tension of the riser it does not consider the gravity and buoyancy of the riser or other forces such as friction and damping therefore the magnitude of t 0 does not change with the length of the riser for example is equal to the weight of the bop when a bop weight is hung at the lower end of the riser c denotes the damping coefficient and the forces f x x t f y x t and f z x t include the gravity buoyancy and interactions of the pipe with the external water and wake hydrodynamics u x u y and u z are the translational displacements of the riser in the directions of the x y and z axes respectively and θ x denotes the angular displacement of the riser cross section with respect to the x axis δ u x δ u y δ u z and δ θ x are corresponding virtual displacements u x u x t u y u y t and u z u z t are the translational velocities along the x y and z axes respectively and θ x θ x t denote the angular velocity of the riser cross section with respect to the x axis u y u y x and u z u z x denote the angular displacements of the cross section of the riser with respect to the z and y axes respectively u x u x x ε x denotes the axial strain it does not include the initial axial strain ε x 0 and θ x θ x x denotes the torsional strain u y 2 u y x 2 and u z 2 u z x 2 are the flexural strains of the pipe about the y and z axes respectively furthermore in eq 1 the damping coefficient c can be used to model the viscous dissipation in the structure or damping of the structure c s as well as the fluid added damping or fluid viscous damping c f 2 c c s c f 3 c s 2 ζ m ω r 4 c f ϑ ω s ρ w d 2 where ζ is the structure damping ratio m m r m f m a ω r is the lowest angular frequency of the riser ϑ is a stall parameter that may be set to 0 8 facchinetti et al 2004 ge et al 2009 even though it is usually determined experimentally and ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency strouhal frequency that is defined as wang et al 2018 5 ω s 2 π s t u d here s t denotes the strouhal number u denotes the current speed and d denotes the outer diameter of the riser in the literature morgan 1990 the reynolds number r e is a major factor that affects the vortex formation shedding process when r e ranges from 2 102 to 2 105 s t exhibits a small scatter ranging from 0 15 to 0 2 for a static rigid cylinder in contrast a moving flexible cylinder is considered to be the present riser according to the definition r e ρ u d ν a principle difference with respect to r e can be observed between a static rigid cylinder and a moving flexible cylinder when calculating u in this study u denotes the resultant speed of the incoming velocity of the fluid 0 3 5 5 m s relative to the moving velocity of the riser 0 1 2 5 m s which must be obtained via numerical testing when the aspect ratio of the riser is varied from 100 to 6000 ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of seawater approximately equal to 1 pa s ρ ρ w denotes the seawater density approximately 1030 kg m3 and d denotes the outer diameter of the drilling risers ranging from 0 508 to 0 912 m based on these data we obtain r e 2 102 8 103 in which s t 0 15 0 2 lie et al 1997 zanganeh and srinil 2016 païdoussis et al 2010 thus we set s t to be 0 2 which is similar to that in a previously conducted study lie et al 1997 by assuming that the same reynolds number corresponds to the same strouhal number in case of the moving flexible and static rigid cylinders 2 2 finite element model when compared with the riser model established in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 eq 1 additionally includes the initial axial strain ε x 0 and the pressure of the conveying fluid p i which can be obtained as p i p 0 ρ w ρ f g x here p 0 denotes the pumping pressure and g denotes the acceleration due to gravity therefore p i will be absent if and only if p 0 0 and ρ f ρ w furthermore because ε x 0 includes the factor α t δ t r it can be applied to describe the effect of temperature on the mechanics of the riser in eq 1 the term 2 u i ρ f a i u y δ u y u z δ u z represents the coriolis inertial force that is generated by the mass of ρ f a i moving with velocity u i through a body with angular velocity u y u z therefore it is impossible to obtain an analytical solution for eq 1 using the method of separation of variables however this coriolis inertial force can be neglected in case of small and slow deflection as well as little to no flow in the pipe an analytical solution for eq 1 can be easily obtained if the loads and supports on the pipe were considerably simple however this is not the case discussed in our study here the riser exhibits a span of 3000 m or more and enters into deep and fast flowing water a moving boundary condition is observed at the upper end of the riser and a lump mass of approximately 3000 kn which can move freely is hung from the lower end of the riser in such a situation the maximum deflection will be more than 100 m therefore we decide to use the finite element method to solve eq 1 because complicated boundary conditions and loads can be easily simulated using the finite element method when compared with other approaches to solve eq 1 using the finite element method we use the well established 3d slender beam mode to discretize the riser into an fem the essential unknown functions with respect to eq 1 include u x u x x t u y u y x t u z u z x t and θ x θ x x t therefore the general displacement of an element of the riser can be expressed as 6 f x t u x x t u y x t u z x t θ x x t t assuming u x a 1 a 2 x u y a 3 a 4 x a 5 x 2 a 6 x 3 u z a 7 a 8 x a 9 x 2 a 10 x 3 and θ x a 11 a 12 x 0 x l where l denotes the length of the element solving the constants a k k 1 2 12 based on the displacements at the two ends nodes numbered as i and j respectively of the element at a point in time and applying separation of variables to separate x and t we can rewrite eq 6 as 7 f x t n x x f i j t 8 f i j t u x i u y i u z i θ x i θ y i θ z i u x j u y j u z j θ x j θ y j θ z j t where n x x is referred to as the shape function of the element of a 3d slender beam having a size of 4 12 and f i j t having a size of 12 1 is referred to as the column vector of the displacements of the nodes of an element according to eq 7 we can obtain δ f n x δ f i j f n x f i j f n x f i j and f n x f i j by substituting these equations into eq 1 performing the integral with respect to x for an element of the riser and rearranging it we can obtain 9 m f i j c f i j k f i j f i j where m c c i c e and k k a k b k t denote the general mass matrix damping matrix stiffness matrix of an element respectively all have a size of 12 12 the details of derivation of them are listed in appendix b and f i j has a size of 12 1 is referred to as the column vector of the loads of the nodes of an element it can be obtained as follows 10 f i j 0 l n x t f x f y f z 0 t d x the damping matrix c in eq 9 comprises c i and c e the c i reflects a type of coriolis inertia effect because the fluid flows in u i relative to the pipe where lateral vibrations or rotations of its cross section exist the c e is similar to the second term in eq 2 i e it only reflects the fluid damping thus an additional structural damping should be considered in eq 9 for ensuring consistency with the first term in eq 2 according to rayleigh damping χ 1 2 ζ 1 ω r 1 χ 2 ω r 1 2 χ 2 2 ζ 1 ω r 1 ζ 2 ω r 2 ω r 1 2 ω r 2 2 and c s χ 1 m χ 2 k b we obtain 11 c s 2 ζ 1 m ω r 1 2 ω r 1 2 m k b ζ 1 ω r 1 ζ 2 ω r 2 ω r 1 2 ω r 2 2 where ω r 1 and ω r 2 are the lowest first and second angular frequencies of the riser respectively while m and k b are computed using eqs b 1 and b 7 in appendix b and ζ 1 and ζ 2 are the first and second order damping ratios of the structure respectively the first term in eq 11 is comparable to eq 3 thus it may be suitable to set ζ 1 ζ 0 03 similar to that in eq 3 and ζ 2 min ω r 2 ω r 1 5 ζ 1 similar to that in majority of the applications zanganeh and srinil 2016 based on eqs 9 and 10 for a vertically placed riser and the coordinate system as shown in fig 1 we obtain 12 f x f b m r m a g f b b m b g where f b is the buoyancy weight coefficient that can be expressed as f b 1 π d 2 ρ w 4 m r m a f b b is the buoyancy coefficient of the buoyant blocks that can be written as f b b 1 ρ b ρ w and ρ b and m b are the block density and block mass respectively f y and f z are produced by the external hydrodynamics including the vortex shedding and wake effects and can be expressed as follows wang et al 2018 13 f y f d 0 f d f l u u y 14 f z f l f d u u y here f d 0 is the average drag force f d is the vortex induced fluctuating drag force and f l is the lift force exerted on the pipe 15 f d 0 1 2 c d 0 ρ w d u 2 16 f d 1 2 c d i ρ w d u 2 17 f l 1 2 c l ρ w d u 2 where c d 0 is the mean drag coefficient for a fixed cylinder c d i is a vortex induced drag term that varies with time and c l is the lift coefficient c d i and c l can be modeled as wang et al 2018 18 c d i c d i 0 p x t 2 19 c l c l 0 q x t 2 where c d i 0 and c l 0 are the associated unsteady drag and lift coefficients of a stationary riser experiencing vortex shedding p x t and q x t represent the non dimensional vortex wake variables in the y and z directions respectively and will be modeled as two van der pol equations for wake oscillators as demonstrated in the next section it is noted that in eqs 5 and 15 17 if buoyant block is absent in the riser or a section of the riser d is the outer diameter of the riser otherwise d d b is the outer diameter of the blocks when the deflection of a riser becomes large the deflection slope will alter the distribution of the loads therefore eqs 10 and 12 14 should be modified as 20 f x m f x cos α i 21 f y m f y f x sin α i cos β i 22 f z m f z f x sin α i sin β i where cos α i δ u x δ r x y z sin α i δ r y z δ r x y z cos β i δ r y δ r y z sin β i δ r z δ r y z δ u x u x j u x i δ u y u y j u y i δ u z u z j u z i δ r y z u y j u y i u z j u z i and δ r x y z u x j u x i u y j u y i u z j u z i hence the f x f y and f z in eq 10 will be replaced by the f x m f y m and f z m in eq 20 22 correspondingly the modified values will be updated for each time step in the simulations it means that the deflection and the loads on the riser is a nonlinear iterative relationship the modifications will inhibit the deflection of the rise causing it to decrease and to close to the true number 2 3 wake oscillator models according to the basic concept of coupled system models païdoussis et al 2010 vortex induced vibrations can be generally attributed to the coupling of the pipe and the wake therefore the corresponding formulation can be obtained using two governing equations where one equation governs the riser variables i e u y x t and u z x t described in eq 1 or eq 9 and the other governs the two wake variables i e p x t and q x t which have been included in eqs 18 and 19 thus eq 13 17 and eqs 9 and 10 facchinett proposed a van der pol oscillator model facchinetti et al 2004 in their recent study which considered majority of the developments achieved with respect to the wake oscillator models since the work of hartlen and currie hartlen and currie 1970 the two non dimensional wake variables p x t and q x t are governed by the following two van der pol equations wang et al 2018 23 q ε z ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q a z d u z 24 p 2 ε y ω s p 2 1 p 4 ω s 2 p a y d u y where ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency defined by eq 3 and ε y ε z a y and a z are the non dimensional parameters that are estimated via experiments for a rigid cylinder undergoing viv a z ε z is in the order of 30 50 facchinetti et al 2004 for a flexible cylinder oscillating in the cf and il directions a z ε z and a y ε y are in the order of 40 1920 keber and wiercigroch 2008 zanganeh and srinil 2014 herein we set ε y 0 02 ε y 0 04 a y 96 2 π a z 12 2 π furthermore the strouhal number s t contained in the expression of ω s in eq 5 is set to be 0 2 as discussed previously other parameters in eqs 15 19 which are related to p x t and q x t will be set as c d i 0 0 8 facchinetti et al 2004 c d 0 1 26 and c l 0 1 13 and will be discussed in section 3 however the u that is coupled with ω s will vary with the riser length because the external cf is considerably complex in deep water the vibration accelerations of the riser u y and u z will also vary with the riser length and evolve with time according to eq 1 or 9 therefore although the wake oscillator equations eqs 23 and 24 can be numerically solved using the runge kutta method after setting the parameters and the initial conditions of the variables they are coupled with the riser at each point in time and space 2 4 solution strategy the basic equations of the system include two sets one as shown in eqs 1 and 9 is used to describe the vibrations of the solid structure of a riser excited by the internal flow along the pipe as well as the vortex wake generated by the external flow across the pipe the other set as shown in eqs 23 and 24 models vortex shedding from the pipe as the pipe vibrates the interactions between pipe vibration and internal flow are coupled by their terms in eq 1 such as those containing the products of u i velocity of the internal fluid flow and u y angular speed of the pipe in xy plane u i 2 and u y curvature of the pipe in the xy plane and p i pressure of the fluid in the pipe and u y further the interactions between pipe vibration and external flow are coupled by the nonhomogenous terms in eq 9 and eqs 23 and 24 f i j is the nonhomogenous term of eq 9 defined using eqs 10 and 20 22 and its components f y and f z contain vortex wake variables p x t and q x t obtained through eqs 15 19 and 23 and 24 p x t and q x t in eqs 23 and 24 are stimulated by u y x t and u z x t respectively which are the translational accelerations of the pipe in the y and z directions obtained using eq 1 or 9 according to these relations the solution procedures can be roughly designed as follows i for the eigenvalues obtained using eq 9 find the lowest first and second angular frequencies of the riser i e ω r 1 and ω r 2 respectively and solve eq 11 to obtain c s ii set the initial conditions t t 0 0 as u y x i t 0 u z x i t 0 0 u y x i t 0 0 u z x i t 0 0 p x i t 0 q x i t 0 0 and p x i t 0 q x i t 0 0 iii solve eqs 12 22 and substitute the obtained values into eq 9 iv solve eq 9 using the newmark method extract u y x i t k and u z x i t k and substitute them into eqs 23 and 24 v solve eqs 23 and 24 using the runge kutta method extract p x i t k and q x i t k and substitute them into eqs 12 22 and 9 thereby completing a cycle let t k 1 t k δ t where δ t 0 01 s or less 0 01s go to iii and continue until t k 1 60 s or more or less 60s here the subscript i 1 2 n n indicates the number of nodes in the finite element structure n is determined by the riser length l and the element length l we take l 8 d in this study and the subscript k 0 1 n n is the total number of time steps from 0 to 60s or more or less 60s generally before solving eq 9 all the related matrices and vectors expressed in the local element coordinates must be converted into global structure coordinates and integrated into structure matrices and vectors hence the differential equation of the fem of the riser structure corresponding to eq 9 with respect to every term may be given as follows 25 m x c x k x f to solve the eigenvalue problem of eq 9 the homogeneous form of eq 25 should be solved further it should be determined when the fluid damping matrix c e in eq 9 is absent from c based on the definition of an eigenvalue problem the term c i in eq 9 does not denote real damping in physics however it is a solid liquid coupling term that should be retained furthermore c i now included in c and k a in eq 9 now included in k are asymmetric matrices to ensure that the solution can be obtained using standard computer programs we use the method proposed by meirovitch to solve the eigenvalues meirovitch 1980 let the homogeneous form of eq 25 be augmented into 26 a s b s 0 27 a c m k 0 28 b k 0 0 k 29 s x x 30 s x x subsequently transform it into a standard eigenvalue problem as 31 1 λ i s b 1 a s where i b 1 b is a unit diagonal matrix the eigenvalues λ i and eigenvectors s i obtained from eq 31 have been proved to be the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original equation eq 25 meirovitch 1980 3 model validation via numerical and experimental comparisons 3 1 natural frequency validation although several viv experiments have been conducted with respect to risers chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 feng 1968 chen and jendrzejczyk 1979 brika and laneville 1993 sarpkaya 1995 the model data obtained for a drilling riser when it enters into deep water involves many factors that are not considered by eqs 1 31 therefore before applying our model to a case in which all these factors may be nonnegligible we validate it by comparing the modeling results with those obtained based on the existing experiments and the theoretical or numerical solutions obtained in a few simple cases the hydrodynamic forces that act upon the structure become increasingly prominent as the structure begins to oscillate especially in the resonance region bishop and hassan 1964 when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure the vortex distribution would deviate from strouhal s law and synchronize with the oscillating frequency which is known as frequency lock in zanganeh and srinil 2016 in the lock in state the risk of fatigue damage to the solid structure is observed to considerably increase therefore the evolution of several lowest natural frequencies of the fluid conveying pipe in the absence of cf should be initially observed for comparison purposes the same geometric and material parameters are selected as those in the experimental model of a previously conducted study franzini et al 2004 there are no buoyant blocks on the riser the riser length l 9 63 m outer diameter of the pipe d 20 mm wall thickness t w 0 45 mm riser l d 481 5 mass ratio m 2 23 mass density of the external fluid ρ w 1020 kg m3 mass density of the internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 and young s modulus of the solid pipe e 102 5 gpa furthermore the flow direction is parallel to the global y axis and additional tensions of t 0 817 n are applied to each end of the riser which is supported by a universal hinge at each end allowing free rotation the natural frequencies of the vertical riser were tested at marintek by exxonmobil lehn 2003 lehn 2003 and calculated for example by wang et al 2016 wang and xiao 2016 and wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 using the fem in the ansys software and an analytical method respectively further we solved eq 31 and set m a 0 wang and xiao 2016 wang et al 2018 to calculate the natural frequencies of the riser these results as well as those obtained in this study are summarized in table 1 when compared with the test the relative errors of the finite element analysis fea wang and xiao 2016 and the proposed method in table 1 are less than those obtained with respect to the analytical method although all the presented errors are acceptable in view of the applications for an analytical solution the coriolis inertial force with respect to the fluid solid interaction of the riser is usually neglected moreover the pressure acting on the model riser was not considered in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 resulting in errors in the model riser the density of the fluid inside the pipe is different from that outside the pipe therefore an equivalent pressure caused by the density difference should be present on the wall of the riser furthermore the vertically positioned riser linearly changes the pressure along the riser that increases the difficulties associated with finding an analytical solution thus it is more practical to use numerical methods to obtain a solution further the frequencies of all the eight lowest modes obtained using the proposed method are less than 1 of those presented by fea wang and xiao 2016 both are based on finite element method resulting in good agreement 3 2 vibration amplitude validation subsequently we examine the vibration amplitude of the riser as an example we consider case 1105 in lehn s experiment lehn 2003 for comparison the parameters in case 1105 are similar to those in a previously conducted study wang and xiao 2016 unless the incoming flow is specified to be uniform and the velocity is considered to be 0 42 m s table 2 summarizes the maximum root mean square rms amplitudes of the model s lateral vibration for case 1105 i e a y rms max d and a z rms max d in a dimensionless form for the il and cf cases respectively these values were obtained from exxonmobil s test of marintek lehn 2003 the fem calculations of huang et al 2011a huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 wang and xiao 2016 and the proposed method the present results are observed to be considerably similar to the test data the corresponding profiles of the dimensionless lateral displacements u y d and u z d for certain time points during 20 60 s are shown in fig 2 a and b and a y rms max d and a zrms max d are their statistic values they are defined as 32 a y rms max d 1 2 max i 1 n 1 max k 1 n 1 u y x i t k min k 1 n 1 u y x i t k d 33 a z rms max d 1 2 max i 1 n 1 max k 1 n 1 u z x i t k min k 1 n 1 u z x i t k d where n is the total number of finite elements of the riser and n is the total number of time steps from 20 to 60 s the elementary experiments in the hydrodynamics literature and several simulations facchinetti et al 2004 zanganeh and srinil 2014 dao et al 2001 allowed us to determine a set of coefficients for the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 16 18 and 19 and the van der pol equations in eqs 23 and 24 as shown in table 2 bringing a y rms max d and a zrms max d close to the test data c d 0 c d i 0 and c l 0 can take different values according to reynolds number and a y ε y or a z ε z can be in the order of 30 1920 in the cf direction only or in case of the il and cf oscillations as discussed previously lehn 2003 however a y rms max d and a zrms max d are comprehensive statistic numbers for viv indicating that their values in a similar viv would be likely to be similar as shown in the next section however because of the definitions of a y rms max d and a zrms max d including n and n and the details of the procedures mentioned by others in table 3 are different or unclear these results cannot be appropriately compared 3 3 fluid conveying velocity and the axial tension validation finally we examine the effects of the fluid conveying velocity and the axial tension of the riser on the natural frequency because they are related to the design and control of the hanging weight of the riser when entering water as well as the fluid in the pipe that has to be replenished released or replaced with a fluid of a different density similar geometric and material parameters when compared with those in previously conducted studies are selected for comparison purposes wang et al 2018 dai et al 2013 pipe length l 50m outer diameter of the pipe d 0 25 m inner diameter d i 0 125 m young s modulus of the solid pipe e 210 gpa mass density of the pipe ρ r 7850 kg m3 mass density of the external fluid ρ w 1020 kg m3 and mass density of the internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 we discuss the above problem when the pipe is in a stable state i e when the internal flow velocity is lower than the critical value observing that the axial force is in tension and that the mass density of the external fluid is greater than that of the internal fluid thereby increasing the stability of the riser the stability of the pipe can be determined by successively increasing the internal flow velocity in this case the natural frequencies obtained from the present model can be compared with those obtained from the analytical solution for the linearized portion wang et al 2018 further we obtain the system eigenfrequencies using the algorithm presented in eq 26 31 and the solutions of eq 9 the present and previous results are visualized in fig 3 a b and 4 a b respectively for the natural frequencies discussed in this subsection the structure damping and fluid pressure values are set to be zero similar to those in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 and the nondimensionalizations numbers 34 ω r ω r l 2 m f m r m a e i 35 u i u i l m f e i and 36 γ t 0 l 2 e i are used for obtaining the pipe s dimensional angular frequency ω r internal fluid velocity u i and axial tension t 0 respectively fig 3 a and b denote that the three lowest natural frequencies of the riser decrease with an increase in the conveying fluid velocity in the global xy and xz planes respectively when the velocity is lower than the critical value these results agree well with those in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 except for the cf first mode in fig 3 b when the velocity is close to the critical value where the natural frequency should be close to zero even though it is not wang et al 2018 fig 4 a and b denote that the three lowest natural frequencies increase along with the axial tension of the riser in the global xy and xz planes respectively although the analytical solution and experimental data are absent the trend is consistent with the physical properties of the riser because its flexural rigidity is increased by the tension i e the greater the rigidity the greater will be the frequency the aforementioned comparisons with the experiment computation and analytical solutions obtained using a single model verify that the present model algorithm and computer code are credible and efficient to describe the mechanical response of the riser to the conveying fluid and the axial tension as well as the vortex induced interaction with respect to the uniform incoming flow in next section we will use the proposed method to evaluate and discuss the response of a drilling riser when it enters into deep water 4 mechanical response of a drilling riser with buoyant blocks when it enters into deep water 4 1 parameter setting and an overview of the typical results in this section eq 9 31 are used and the coefficients for hydrodynamic force and the van der pol oscillator equations are set similar to that in table 3 riser length l 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 and 3 000 m outer diameter d 533 4 mm inner diameter d i 501 65 mm young s modulus of the solid riser e 210 gpa poission s ratio μ 0 3 mass density of the pipe ρ r 7850 kg m3 mass density of the internal fluid ρ f 1 030 kg m3 conveying fluid velocity u i 0 riser entry velocities u 0 0 0 15 and 0 3 m s bop weight pex 2 000 kn in air and external fluid mass density ρ w 1 030 kg m3 the mass density of the buoyant blocks ρ b 405 18 kg m3 and the outer diameter of the buoyant blocks is d b 2 238d the total length of the blocks is l b and l b is measured from the bottom end of the riser usually the velocity of an ocean current decreases with the depth therefore lowering the mounting position of the buoyant blocks will reduce the hydrodynamic forces to measure the impact of the buoyant blocks we define a buoyancy weight ratio r bw as the ratio of the buoyancy weight of the borne buoyant blocks to the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant block itself by the r bw l b can be determined the greater the r bw the greater the l b and more buoyant blocks are used in addition let us assume a water depth d l the water particle movement velocity caused by the waves in deep water conditions is in accordance with the linear theory of a plane wave for example in the xy plane at depth x and time t the velocity v w y can be obtained as boccotti 2000 37 v w y π h w t w exp k w x cos k w y ω w t d x 0 t 0 where h w is the wave height t w is the wave period k w ω w 2 g is the wave number g is the acceleration of gravity and ω w 2 π t w is the angular frequency of the wave the wavelength can be computed by l w t w 2 g 2 π furthermore the water depth dependent velocities of the water particles owing to wind induced water flow and ocean current including tidal current are evaluated as boccotti 2000 38 v c 1 v m 1 x d 1 7 d x 0 39 v c 2 v t 1 x d d x 0 where v m and v t are of the velocities of the water particles at the surface by wind and ocean current while the angle between v m and the y axis is β m and that between v t and the y axis is β t in this section unless mentioned otherwise h w 6 5m t w 13s v m 0 2 m s v t 3 5 m s β m 0 and β t π 2 i e v m is parallel to the y axis and v t is parallel to the z axis are assumed to be constant under the mild sea conditions d 500 m should be ensured to achieve the deep water condition i e l w d 0 5 thus the fluid velocity outside the riser can be given as u v y 2 v z 2 v y v c 1 v w y assuming that the directions of the wind and wave are same and parallel to the y axis and v z v c 2 that is parallel to the z axis which are also related to the vortex shedding the relative coefficients are the same as those in table 3 subsequently by performing the calculation a set of typical results characterized by the deformations stresses of the risers and distributions of the van der pol oscillators around a single riser can be obtained as shown in fig 5 where the drilling riser reach a maximum depth of 1 000 m fig 5 a shows the deformation of vibration of the drilling riser in xy plane at a time point in which the vertical coordinates indicate the points on the axis of the riser and the horizontal coordinates indicate the lateral displacements of the riser the maximun displacement u y 51 01 m is at the bottom end x 1000 m at this moment noting that the bottom end is free in this process the buoyant blocks a string of green circles are on the lower part of the riser having length l b 315 m for r bw 0 5 similarly fig 5 b and c show the deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xz plane and xyz space at the time point respectively fig 5 d shows a set of deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xy plane at different time points in which one curve corresponds to one time point and the bandwidth of the curves at x indicates the range of vibration of the point x on the axis of the riser noting that the absolute maximun displacement in y direction is equal to u y 65 31 m at x 739 23 m rather than at the bottom end according to the data setting in fig 5 d u y is mainly caused by the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction and vortex shedding in y direction of the ocean current in z direction similarly fig 5 e shows a set of deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xz plane at different time points which however are mainly caused by ocean current in z direction and the vortex shedding in z direction of the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction in fig 5 e all u z are always located on the positive side of the z axis which indicates that the pushing effect of the ocean current in z direction on the riser is more than the swaying effect of the vortex shedding in z direction of the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction on the riser resulting in the maximum u z at the bottom of the riser reaching 100 66 m fig 5 f shows the maximun bending stresses and corresponding locations through the riser at different time points which are concetrated in the range from x 950 m to x 620 m and the maximal bending stress is 389 1 mpa at x 713 7 m suggesting that fatigue damage may occur at this region fig 5 g shows the values of van der pol wake variables p and q surround the single riser in a three dimensional space at different time points the complicated distribution of p and q reflects complex coupling between the vortex shedding and riser vibrating and the significant enlargement of p and q nearby the lower part of the riser are resulted from the larger size of the buoyant blocks as well as the larger motion of the riser in this region fig 5 h and i show the spatial and temporal evolution of the van der pol wake variables p x t and q x t along the axis of the riser and with time t here p x t represents the effect of vortex shedding in y direction due to the ocean current crossing the riser in z direction while q x t represents the effect of vortex shedding in z direction due to the wind induced flow and wave flow crossing the riser in y direction both p x t and q x t developed appear as a complex travelling wave affected by the larger size of the buoyant blocks and the larger motion of the lower part of the riser fig 5 j shows the axial stress σ nx at the sections of bottom end σ nx b middle σ nx m and upper end σ nx u varying with time σ nx b is in the lowest level and fluctuating slightly owing to the hanging weight at the bottom end σ nx m is always and σ nx u is mostly with negtive values which indicate that the riser is mostly in a compression state owing to having too much buoyant blocks on the riser however if the buoyant blocks were too less or even absent σ nx u would be in tension noting that a high tension stress at the upper end of the riser requires a great platform and a high strength of the tensioner fig 5 k shows the bending stresses at the middle section x 500 m of the riser varying with time σ m y m and σ m z m represent the bending stresses when the bending existing in xy and xz plane respectively which depend on the curvatures of the curves in fig 5 d and e at x 500 m and σ m b m σ m y m 2 σ m z m 2 is the resultant stress of σ m y m and σ m z m noting that the maximal bending stress does not occur at the middle section of the riser compared to the distribution of the maximum bending stress in fig 5 f 4 2 influence of the entry speed in this subsection let us assume that there are three buoyant block mounted risers all have the same length l 3 000 m outer diameter d 533 4 mm hanging weight pex 2 000 kn buoyancy weight ratio r bw 0 5 and model parameters first each riser is vertically put into water to its full length then simulations were conducted under the conditions of ocean current wind induced flow and wave flow and so listed in subsection 4 1 unless β m π 2 and β t 0 each lasting 60 s during the simulations let one riser stop entering u 0 0 while the other two maintain velocities u 0 0 15 m s and 0 3 m s respectively we examine the maximal lateral displacements through the risers and the displacements at the bottom end of the risers in y and z axes and maximal tension and maximal resultant bending stresses during the simulations the results are summarized in fig 6 from which it is observed that an increase of entery speed u 0 barely affects the maximum displacements in both y and z directions the maximum bottom s displacements in both y and z directions fig 6 a and the maximum bending stresses fig 6 b however it significantly decreases the maximum tension stresses fig 6 b on the theory of elasticity the maximum bending stresses are proportional to the maximum bending displacements the maximum bending stresses are positive correlated to the fatigue damage of the riser and the maximum bending displacements affect the axial movement of the objects contained in the riser thus both have to be limited although they are independent of entry velocity in this case as for the maximum tension stresses fig 6 b they decrease with increases of entering velocity of the riser for example there is a 47 8 less at u 0 0 3 m s than at u 0 0 this is because of the damping effect of the water on axial movement of the riser i e the more the u 0 the more the damping which helps to lift the riser on the other hand under the same u 0 u ymax u zmax and u zbottom u ybottom the u ymax u zmax is because the velocity of the incoming flow in y direction is more than that in z direction on the data given in subsection 4 1 the former is mainly caused by ocean current the latter is mainly caused by wind induced flow and wave flow in contrast the velocity of the cross flow in z direction is more than that in y direction leading to u zbottom u ybottom because for the former the vortex shedding is mainly caused by ocean current and the latter it is mainly caused by wind induced flow and wave flow while the velocity of ocean current is more than those of wind induced flow and wave flow on the data given in subsection 4 1 it should be noticed that u ybottom and u zbottom affect the alignment of the riser with the wellhead in the subsea during riser s entering into the water and the subsequent instoration thus properly increasing the entry speed can reduce the maximum tension stresses a lot and almost no side effects are observed upon the entering risers needless to say it can shorten the time in position of the risers 4 3 influence of riser length and buoyancy weight ratio in this subsection let us assume that 15 riser samples are equally divided into five groups all risers possess the same properties and sizes except the length and buoyancy weight ratio they are under the same oceanic conditions as described in subsection 4 1 now let l 1 000 1 500 and 3 000 m be the lengths of the risers in groups 1 2 5 respectively i e each group includes three equal length risers in each group each riser takes one of the buoyancy weight ratios r bw 0 0 25 and 0 5 put the risers vertically into water one by one to their full length then set u 0 0 pex 2 000 kn v t 3 5 m s v m 0 2 m s β t 0 and β m π 2 i e v t from the ocean current is parallel to the y axis whereas v m from the wind induced is parallel to the z axis and the other parameters as mentioned in subsection 4 1 for simulation these settings are unchanged for all risers in this subsection and each simulation lasts 60 s we examine the maximal lateral displacements u ymax in the global xy plane y direction and u zmax in the xz plane z direction bottom end lateral displacements in y direction u ybottom and in z direction u zbottom as well as the maximal tension stresses at upper end and the maximal bending stresses varying with l and r bw respectively the results are summarized in figs 7 and 8 by the definition of r bw r bw 0 0 25 and 0 5 indicate the buoyant blocks bear a 0 25 and 50 of the total buoyancy weight of the riser system including the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant blocks itself respectively r bw 0 indicate the buoyant block is absent fig 7 a shows that when r bw is a constant u ymax increases with the increase of l this is because a large l corresponds to a large flexibility for example when r bw 0 the u ymax 103 74 m at l 3 000 m is 67 9 more than u ymax 61 78 m at l 1 000m however with the increase of l the growth rate of u ymax decreases gradually because the self weight of the riser also increases with the increase of l that causes the riser to straighten and move towards the vertical position of itself at rest on the other hand when l is a constant u ymax decreases with the decrease of r bw owing to that a less r bw means less buoyant blocks used and the naked pipe has less outer diameter than the block mounted one thus less hydrodynamic forces generated see eq 15 17 however the differences of u ymax caused by different values of r bw will vanish when l 2000m owing to that the incoming flow velocity is negatively correlated with the depth of water see eq 37 39 the differences of u ymax between the risers with r bw 0 and 0 25 are much less than that with r bw 0 25 and 0 5 owing to that a certain length of blocks mounted on deeper riser will generate much less hydrodynamic forces than the same length of blocks mounted on upper riser for the same reason the differences exist in u zmax u ybottom and u zbottom as shown in fig 7 b c and d it is observed that for r bw 0 5 when l increases from 1 000m to 3 000m u zmax fig 7 b and u zbottom fig 7 d are changed from both 100 71 m 65 39 m and 48 04 m decreased by 32 5 and 52 3 respectively while u ybottom fig 7 c fluctuates nearby its mean level 36 36 m slightly however for r bw 0 and 0 25 u zmax u ybottom and u zbottom are barely changed with l and the absolute values of them are less than 2 1 m which can be ignored fig 8 a shows that the maximum bending stresses decrease with the increase of the riser length l especially when the buoyancy weight ratios r bw is greater r bw 0 5 and with the decrease of r bw the maximum bending stresses decrease it is consistence with the experience and computing result that under a same r bw less depth of water leads to more buoyant blocks involving in more current flow velocity thus generating more hydrodynamic forces for example for a constant r bw 0 5 when the water depth d and riser length l are equal to 1 000 m the total buoyant blocks length l b is computed to be 315 m the blocks accounting for l b l 0 315 will be subject to the current and the maximum current velocity on the blocks is computed to be 1 27 m s whereas when d l 3000 m resulting in l b 630 m the blocks accounting for 0 21 will be subject to the current and the maximum current velocity on the blocks is 0 895 m s fig 8 b shows that however increasing l and decreasing r bw can increase the maximum tensions this is because the tensions at the upper end firstly depends upon the self weight of the riser i e the longer the riser the heavier the riser thus more tension needed at the upper end whereas less r bw means less buoyant blocks used thus less lift force provided as we know the bending stress is related to the fatigue damage of the riser and the tension at the up end of the riser is related to the strength of the platform and the tenssioner of the riser both must be controlled fig 9 a and b show that in order to make both the maximum bending stress σ mb max and the maximum tension stress σ nx max to be equal or equal to their minimum values for a given depth of water or riser length l how many buoyant blocks indicated by r bw should be mounted on the riser fig 9 a is for l 1 000 2 000 m in which the curves of σ mb max versus r bw and the curves of σ nx max versus r bw are put together it is observed that there is a cross point at r bw 0 08 for the curves σ nx max and σ mb max with l 2 000 m at which σ nx max σ mb max 127 4 mpa in addition r bw 0 08 corresponds to l b 76 m the length of the entire buoyant blocks in case of the buoyant block density ρ b 405 18 kg m3 and its outer diameter d b 1 194m however r bw 0 08 is not the optimal value of r bw for the riser of l 2 000 m the optimal result for l 2 000m is r bw 0 4 l b 315 m where σ mb max 127 mpa and σ nx max 62 2 mpa similarly in fig 9 a the other two optimal results are l 1 000m r bw 0 25 l b 95m σ mb max 128 9 mpa and σ nx max 54 mpa and l 1500 m r bw 0 25 l b 197 m σ mb max 126 8 mpa and σ nx max 70 mpa finally fig 9 b is for l 2 000 3 000 m in which the situation when l 2 000 m listed for comparison is as same as in fig 9 a and has been discussed above the other two optimal results as observed are l 2 500 m r bw 0 4 l b 441 m σ mb max 127 mpa and σ nx max 83 3 mpa and l 3 000 m r bw 0 4 l b 504 m σ mb max 126 9 mpa and σ nx max 99 3 mpa although the cross point exist between each pair of σ mb max and σ nx max thus in this study the buoyant blocks should be mounted on the risers to bear a 25 of the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant blocks itself for l 1 000 1 500 m and 40 for l 2 000 3 000 m respectively to ensure both bending stresses and tension stresses generated in the lowest level 5 conclusions in this study we developed a novel 3d dynamic model of viv in drilling risers that convey internal fluid flow to simulate the mechanical responses of the risers when they enter into water at depth of 3 000 m under realistic environmental conditions almost all types of loads and boundary conditions and the nonlinear effect of the large deflection of the risers on their loads were considered further we compared the simulation results with the existing experimental data exhibiting good agreement and verifying the validity of the model and parameters we discussed the effects of the entry speed buoyant blocks and water depth on the drop point offset of the bottom end of the risers tension stresses and the values as well as positions of the maximum stresses on the risers when lowering a drilling riser into deep water under mild sea conditions increasing the entry speed can reduce the maximum tension stresses it does not significantly affect the drop point offset although a long drilling riser is required in case of deep water it does not enlarge the drop point offset because the lateral displacement of the bottom of the riser nonlinearly decreases with increasing riser length in addition increasing the buoyant blocks can reduce the tension at the upper end but increase the offset of the drop point of the end of the risers and the maximum bending stress to ensure both the bending stresses and tension stresses generated in the lowest level the buoyant blocks should bear a 25 of the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant block itself for l 1 000 1 500m and 40 for l 2 000 3 000m respectively thus when risers enter into deep water appropriately increasing the buoyant blocks and the entry speed can control the maximum tension stress that will not enlarge the drop point offset and bending stress too much credit authorship

21478,a novel three dimensional dynamic model is developed to investigate the vortex induced vibrations vivs in flexible risers with buoyant blocks conveying the internal fluid flow the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with wake dynamics are modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators that consider the coupling between the structure and the fluid furthermore our model considers the loads of buoyancy weight tension pressure temperature and seawater current owing to wind tide and waves as well as the nonlinear effect of the large deflection of the riser on the loads the riser is discretized into slender beam elements the distributed van der pol wake oscillators are also discretized on the element nodes and each node has six degrees of freedom allowing it to describe the vibrations of the risers in lateral axis and torsion simultaneously the boundary conditions include the displacements and rotations at the up end and free bottom end in the presence of additional weight the computational program is prepared using matlab r2014a the simulation results exhibit good agreement with the existing experimental data verifying the validity of the model and the parameters finally the viv simulations are conducted for more realistic risers when they are entering 500 3000 m deep water denoting the effects of buoyant blocks entry speed and water depth upon the drop point offset of the bottom end of the risers the tension stresses as well as the values and positions of the maximum bending stresses with respect to the risers these data can be used to select a good operational condition for ensuring the entry of a riser this study provides a computational framework for conducting subsequent research and the obtained results can be applied to construct ocean floating platforms more scientifically safely and economically keywords flexible riser vortex induced vibration fluid structure interaction large deflection mathematical simulation 1 introduction earth contains abundant oil and gas resources majority of these resources are probably present at a considerable depth under water ward et al 1999 this has resulted in the exploration of ever deeper water to meet the global demand of oil and gas thus there is an urgent requirement for developing advanced analytical tools to design and assess floating production systems at depths of greater than 3000 m the drilling riser which is an indispensable equipment is the main channel from the wellhead at the seabed to the drilling platform the riser is subjected to several loads including the hydrodynamic forces of wind induced water flow wave flow ocean current and the wake the weight and buoyancy of the mud and the pipe and the mounted buoyant blocks the tension exerted by the tensioner of the platform the pressure difference between the internal mud and external seawater and the strains owing to the temperature difference with respect to the surface and subsea which can vary with the depth of water furthermore the buoyant blocks can reduce the tension but enlarge the hydrodynamic forces on the riser therefore considerably powerful tools are required for mechanically assessing the riser under deep water conditions otherwise various accidents including the failure of the feed column during the drilling processes in the gulf of mexico and the brazilian sea can occur resulting in huge capital loss and severe environmental pollution breihan et al 2001 sathuvalli et al 2002 the length to diameter ratio l d of a riser is referred to as its aspect ratio when the aspect ratio is small e g less than 10 the riser can be treated as a rigid body exhibiting a maximum of six degrees of freedom or natural modes lehn 2003 however for large aspect ratios the riser is observed to become considerably flexible further the riser should be considered to be a long slender elastic structure implying the presence of innumerable natural modes therefore in 3000 m deep water the riser thus the aspect ratio will become approximately 6000 is a typical three dimensional flexible fluid solid interaction structure when currents cross through a vertical riser the riser will be in motion in the in line il direction and vortices will be shed from the side surface of the riser frequently resulting in the formation of the wake the wake excites the riser vibrating in cross flow cf direction and affects the il motion also furthermore the tension applied to the two ends of the riser can regulate the deflection and excitation of the riser majority of the shedding frequencies along the span will be modified toward the natural frequency if a shedding frequency is approximately similar to the natural frequency of a riser exhibiting a small aspect ratio this can be referred to as the frequency lock in phenomenon or lock in for short in contrast the lock in occurs elusively from time to time and from part to part when the aspect ratio is large thus the vortex induced vibrations are a typical example of truly self excited and self sustained oscillations the details of the aforementioned discussions can be found in the comprehensive reviews of sarpkaya 1979 sarpkaya 1979 bearman 1984 bearman 1984 williamson and govardhan 2004 williamson and govardhan 2004 gabbai and benar oya 2005 gabbai and benaroya 2005 bearman 2011 bearman 2011 and wu et al 2012 wu et al 2012 many experiments have been conducted with respect to deep water risers having large l d values tognarelli et al 2004 chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 lie and kaasen 2006 vandiver et al 2006 tognarelli et al 2008 vandiver et al 2009 huang et al 2011 gu et al 2013 gao et al 2015 in addition several computational fluid dynamics cfd studies have been conducted with respect to the vortex induced vibrations vivs of the flexible cylinders willden and graham 2001 willden and graham 2001 used a quasi three dimensional q3d method to simulate the transverse vibration in case of a cylinder subjected to shear flow in case of low reynolds number when l d 100 meneghini et al 2004 meneghini et al 2004 and yamamoto et al 2004 yamamoto et al 2004 presented numerical simulations of long marine risers having l d values of up to 4600 via the q3d discrete vortex method where several two dimensional 2d strips were distributed over the length of the riser for reducing the computational requirements using an entirely 3d cfd approach wang and xiao 2016 wang and xiao 2016 studied the combined il and cf viv of a vertical riser when l d 481 5 in case of uniform and linearly sheared currents and captured the features of the viv riser in detail resulting in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 developed a 3d nonlinear model to investigate the vivs of the flexible pipes conveying internal fluid flow where the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics were modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators by considering the coupling between the structure and the fluid as well as the structural buckling effects further the first order galerkin technique was used to discretize a pipe with pinned pinned supports and obtain the numerical solution for a riser with l d 200 the usage of van der pol oscillators to mimic the wake effects on the structures in the presence of currents has been extensively discussed facchinetti et al 2004 hartlen and currie 1970 kim and perkins 2002 this can considerably reduce the computational demands and capture the main features of the viv structures however the galerkin technique is infeasible in case of a riser subjected to axially varying loads or risers having nonuniform diameters e g the one partially mounted buoyant blocks and complex boundary conditions e g those subject to shear currents and nonuniform pressures resulting in the vibration of the upper end of the riser with the floating platform when the weighted bottom end swings slowly the cfd simulations are considered to be ideal to predict the viv of long and slender cylinders however these simulations are very rare because the 3d cfd simulations at realistic reynolds numbers are limited by the extensive computational requirements and the realistic aspect ratios of the risers are larger than several thousands in case of deep water oil and gas explorations in this study we intend to simulate the mechanical responses of risers when they enter into water of depths greater than 3000 m and experience realistic difficulties to serve the oil industry more efficiently we propose a 3d viv model for a vertical riser under deep water conditions including internal fluid flow the loads of buoyancy weight tension pressure temperature and seawater currents owing to wind tide and waves as well as the loads nonlinearly affected by the large deflection of the riser and the boundary conditions of displacement and rotation at the upper end and free bottom end in the presence of weight of the blowout preventer bop stacks the unsteady hydrodynamic forces associated with the wake dynamics were modeled using two distributed van der pol wake oscillators by considering the coupling between the structure and the fluid the risers were discretized using slender beam elements and each node exhibited six degrees of freedom allowing the riser to vibrate in axis torsion and lateral simultaneously the distributed van der pol wake oscillators were also discretized with respect to the nodes of the finite element model fem of the riser the fem was evaluated using the newmark method whereas the van der pol wake oscillators were evaluated using the fourth order runge kutta method by considering the same time step length as that considered in the former case the models are derived and described in section 2 in section 3 model verification and the determination of the model parameter values are performed by comparing the simulation results with the existing experimental data in section 4 the viv simulation results of the realistic risers with buoyant blocks that enter into 3000 m deep water are presented and discussed finally the conclusions of this study are presented in section 5 2 model and solution 2 1 analytical model as shown in fig 1 a certain right hand coordinate system is defined with y and z in the horizontal plane and x in the vertically upright position the riser can be simplified as a uniform flexible free span circular cylinder having length l constant outer diameter d here and below if not specified do not consider the buoyant blocks when there is a buoyant block it is easily handled by the fem in subsection 2 2 and material density ρ r conveying a steady fluid with density ρ f and flow velocity u i the up end of the riser hangs from the platform whereas the bottom end is connected to a blowout preventer bop having weight p e x the riser is also subjected to cf with velocity u perpendicular to the riser s undisturbed axis i e the x axis and at an angle β with respect to the y axis when the riser enters into water its top vertical velocity is denoted as u 0 and the temperature difference between the water at the top and bottom of the riser is δ t r under these conditions the models for the vertical lateral and torsional vibrations of the riser can be established via hamilton s principle and the finite element method according to hamilton s principle the vibration equation of the riser can be given as follows 1 i f t h i s e q u a t i o n d o e s n t f i t o n o n e l i n e p l e a s e s e p

derivation of eq 1 are listed in appendix a in eq 1 dx denotes the differential length of the riser m r ρ r a r denotes the mass of the riser per unit length and a r denotes its cross sectional area m a ρ w π d 2 4 denotes the additional mass added to the riser per unit length whereas ρ w denotes the density of the water around the riser here we assume that this is constant if not it will be obtained via fem as presented in subsection 2 2 m f ρ f a i denotes the mass of the fluid contained in the riser per unit length and a i denotes the internal cross sectional area of the riser e and g are respectively young s modulus and shear modulus of the riser i and i x are the moments of inertia of the riser s cross section with respect to diameter and x axis respectively j x denotes the moment of inertia of the riser per unit length with respect to the axis of the column ε x 0 denotes the initial axial strain of the riser owing to assembly and processing and or the temperature strain expressed as α t δ t r where α t is the linear expansion coefficient of the pipe p i denotes the internal pressure when the external pressure p e exists p i should be replaced by p i p e t 0 denotes the additional end tension of the riser it does not consider the gravity and buoyancy of the riser or other forces such as friction and damping therefore the magnitude of t 0 does not change with the length of the riser for example is equal to the weight of the bop when a bop weight is hung at the lower end of the riser c denotes the damping coefficient and the forces f x x t f y x t and f z x t include the gravity buoyancy and interactions of the pipe with the external water and wake hydrodynamics u x u y and u z are the translational displacements of the riser in the directions of the x y and z axes respectively and θ x denotes the angular displacement of the riser cross section with respect to the x axis δ u x δ u y δ u z and δ θ x are corresponding virtual displacements u x u x t u y u y t and u z u z t are the translational velocities along the x y and z axes respectively and θ x θ x t denote the angular velocity of the riser cross section with respect to the x axis u y u y x and u z u z x denote the angular displacements of the cross section of the riser with respect to the z and y axes respectively u x u x x ε x denotes the axial strain it does not include the initial axial strain ε x 0 and θ x θ x x denotes the torsional strain u y 2 u y x 2 and u z 2 u z x 2 are the flexural strains of the pipe about the y and z axes respectively furthermore in eq 1 the damping coefficient c can be used to model the viscous dissipation in the structure or damping of the structure c s as well as the fluid added damping or fluid viscous damping c f 2 c c s c f 3 c s 2 ζ m ω r 4 c f ϑ ω s ρ w d 2 where ζ is the structure damping ratio m m r m f m a ω r is the lowest angular frequency of the riser ϑ is a stall parameter that may be set to 0 8 facchinetti et al 2004 ge et al 2009 even though it is usually determined experimentally and ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency strouhal frequency that is defined as wang et al 2018 5 ω s 2 π s t u d here s t denotes the strouhal number u denotes the current speed and d denotes the outer diameter of the riser in the literature morgan 1990 the reynolds number r e is a major factor that affects the vortex formation shedding process when r e ranges from 2 102 to 2 105 s t exhibits a small scatter ranging from 0 15 to 0 2 for a static rigid cylinder in contrast a moving flexible cylinder is considered to be the present riser according to the definition r e ρ u d ν a principle difference with respect to r e can be observed between a static rigid cylinder and a moving flexible cylinder when calculating u in this study u denotes the resultant speed of the incoming velocity of the fluid 0 3 5 5 m s relative to the moving velocity of the riser 0 1 2 5 m s which must be obtained via numerical testing when the aspect ratio of the riser is varied from 100 to 6000 ν denotes the kinematic viscosity of seawater approximately equal to 1 pa s ρ ρ w denotes the seawater density approximately 1030 kg m3 and d denotes the outer diameter of the drilling risers ranging from 0 508 to 0 912 m based on these data we obtain r e 2 102 8 103 in which s t 0 15 0 2 lie et al 1997 zanganeh and srinil 2016 païdoussis et al 2010 thus we set s t to be 0 2 which is similar to that in a previously conducted study lie et al 1997 by assuming that the same reynolds number corresponds to the same strouhal number in case of the moving flexible and static rigid cylinders 2 2 finite element model when compared with the riser model established in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 eq 1 additionally includes the initial axial strain ε x 0 and the pressure of the conveying fluid p i which can be obtained as p i p 0 ρ w ρ f g x here p 0 denotes the pumping pressure and g denotes the acceleration due to gravity therefore p i will be absent if and only if p 0 0 and ρ f ρ w furthermore because ε x 0 includes the factor α t δ t r it can be applied to describe the effect of temperature on the mechanics of the riser in eq 1 the term 2 u i ρ f a i u y δ u y u z δ u z represents the coriolis inertial force that is generated by the mass of ρ f a i moving with velocity u i through a body with angular velocity u y u z therefore it is impossible to obtain an analytical solution for eq 1 using the method of separation of variables however this coriolis inertial force can be neglected in case of small and slow deflection as well as little to no flow in the pipe an analytical solution for eq 1 can be easily obtained if the loads and supports on the pipe were considerably simple however this is not the case discussed in our study here the riser exhibits a span of 3000 m or more and enters into deep and fast flowing water a moving boundary condition is observed at the upper end of the riser and a lump mass of approximately 3000 kn which can move freely is hung from the lower end of the riser in such a situation the maximum deflection will be more than 100 m therefore we decide to use the finite element method to solve eq 1 because complicated boundary conditions and loads can be easily simulated using the finite element method when compared with other approaches to solve eq 1 using the finite element method we use the well established 3d slender beam mode to discretize the riser into an fem the essential unknown functions with respect to eq 1 include u x u x x t u y u y x t u z u z x t and θ x θ x x t therefore the general displacement of an element of the riser can be expressed as 6 f x t u x x t u y x t u z x t θ x x t t assuming u x a 1 a 2 x u y a 3 a 4 x a 5 x 2 a 6 x 3 u z a 7 a 8 x a 9 x 2 a 10 x 3 and θ x a 11 a 12 x 0 x l where l denotes the length of the element solving the constants a k k 1 2 12 based on the displacements at the two ends nodes numbered as i and j respectively of the element at a point in time and applying separation of variables to separate x and t we can rewrite eq 6 as 7 f x t n x x f i j t 8 f i j t u x i u y i u z i θ x i θ y i θ z i u x j u y j u z j θ x j θ y j θ z j t where n x x is referred to as the shape function of the element of a 3d slender beam having a size of 4 12 and f i j t having a size of 12 1 is referred to as the column vector of the displacements of the nodes of an element according to eq 7 we can obtain δ f n x δ f i j f n x f i j f n x f i j and f n x f i j by substituting these equations into eq 1 performing the integral with respect to x for an element of the riser and rearranging it we can obtain 9 m f i j c f i j k f i j f i j where m c c i c e and k k a k b k t denote the general mass matrix damping matrix stiffness matrix of an element respectively all have a size of 12 12 the details of derivation of them are listed in appendix b and f i j has a size of 12 1 is referred to as the column vector of the loads of the nodes of an element it can be obtained as follows 10 f i j 0 l n x t f x f y f z 0 t d x the damping matrix c in eq 9 comprises c i and c e the c i reflects a type of coriolis inertia effect because the fluid flows in u i relative to the pipe where lateral vibrations or rotations of its cross section exist the c e is similar to the second term in eq 2 i e it only reflects the fluid damping thus an additional structural damping should be considered in eq 9 for ensuring consistency with the first term in eq 2 according to rayleigh damping χ 1 2 ζ 1 ω r 1 χ 2 ω r 1 2 χ 2 2 ζ 1 ω r 1 ζ 2 ω r 2 ω r 1 2 ω r 2 2 and c s χ 1 m χ 2 k b we obtain 11 c s 2 ζ 1 m ω r 1 2 ω r 1 2 m k b ζ 1 ω r 1 ζ 2 ω r 2 ω r 1 2 ω r 2 2 where ω r 1 and ω r 2 are the lowest first and second angular frequencies of the riser respectively while m and k b are computed using eqs b 1 and b 7 in appendix b and ζ 1 and ζ 2 are the first and second order damping ratios of the structure respectively the first term in eq 11 is comparable to eq 3 thus it may be suitable to set ζ 1 ζ 0 03 similar to that in eq 3 and ζ 2 min ω r 2 ω r 1 5 ζ 1 similar to that in majority of the applications zanganeh and srinil 2016 based on eqs 9 and 10 for a vertically placed riser and the coordinate system as shown in fig 1 we obtain 12 f x f b m r m a g f b b m b g where f b is the buoyancy weight coefficient that can be expressed as f b 1 π d 2 ρ w 4 m r m a f b b is the buoyancy coefficient of the buoyant blocks that can be written as f b b 1 ρ b ρ w and ρ b and m b are the block density and block mass respectively f y and f z are produced by the external hydrodynamics including the vortex shedding and wake effects and can be expressed as follows wang et al 2018 13 f y f d 0 f d f l u u y 14 f z f l f d u u y here f d 0 is the average drag force f d is the vortex induced fluctuating drag force and f l is the lift force exerted on the pipe 15 f d 0 1 2 c d 0 ρ w d u 2 16 f d 1 2 c d i ρ w d u 2 17 f l 1 2 c l ρ w d u 2 where c d 0 is the mean drag coefficient for a fixed cylinder c d i is a vortex induced drag term that varies with time and c l is the lift coefficient c d i and c l can be modeled as wang et al 2018 18 c d i c d i 0 p x t 2 19 c l c l 0 q x t 2 where c d i 0 and c l 0 are the associated unsteady drag and lift coefficients of a stationary riser experiencing vortex shedding p x t and q x t represent the non dimensional vortex wake variables in the y and z directions respectively and will be modeled as two van der pol equations for wake oscillators as demonstrated in the next section it is noted that in eqs 5 and 15 17 if buoyant block is absent in the riser or a section of the riser d is the outer diameter of the riser otherwise d d b is the outer diameter of the blocks when the deflection of a riser becomes large the deflection slope will alter the distribution of the loads therefore eqs 10 and 12 14 should be modified as 20 f x m f x cos α i 21 f y m f y f x sin α i cos β i 22 f z m f z f x sin α i sin β i where cos α i δ u x δ r x y z sin α i δ r y z δ r x y z cos β i δ r y δ r y z sin β i δ r z δ r y z δ u x u x j u x i δ u y u y j u y i δ u z u z j u z i δ r y z u y j u y i u z j u z i and δ r x y z u x j u x i u y j u y i u z j u z i hence the f x f y and f z in eq 10 will be replaced by the f x m f y m and f z m in eq 20 22 correspondingly the modified values will be updated for each time step in the simulations it means that the deflection and the loads on the riser is a nonlinear iterative relationship the modifications will inhibit the deflection of the rise causing it to decrease and to close to the true number 2 3 wake oscillator models according to the basic concept of coupled system models païdoussis et al 2010 vortex induced vibrations can be generally attributed to the coupling of the pipe and the wake therefore the corresponding formulation can be obtained using two governing equations where one equation governs the riser variables i e u y x t and u z x t described in eq 1 or eq 9 and the other governs the two wake variables i e p x t and q x t which have been included in eqs 18 and 19 thus eq 13 17 and eqs 9 and 10 facchinett proposed a van der pol oscillator model facchinetti et al 2004 in their recent study which considered majority of the developments achieved with respect to the wake oscillator models since the work of hartlen and currie hartlen and currie 1970 the two non dimensional wake variables p x t and q x t are governed by the following two van der pol equations wang et al 2018 23 q ε z ω s q 2 1 q ω s 2 q a z d u z 24 p 2 ε y ω s p 2 1 p 4 ω s 2 p a y d u y where ω s is the vortex shedding angular frequency defined by eq 3 and ε y ε z a y and a z are the non dimensional parameters that are estimated via experiments for a rigid cylinder undergoing viv a z ε z is in the order of 30 50 facchinetti et al 2004 for a flexible cylinder oscillating in the cf and il directions a z ε z and a y ε y are in the order of 40 1920 keber and wiercigroch 2008 zanganeh and srinil 2014 herein we set ε y 0 02 ε y 0 04 a y 96 2 π a z 12 2 π furthermore the strouhal number s t contained in the expression of ω s in eq 5 is set to be 0 2 as discussed previously other parameters in eqs 15 19 which are related to p x t and q x t will be set as c d i 0 0 8 facchinetti et al 2004 c d 0 1 26 and c l 0 1 13 and will be discussed in section 3 however the u that is coupled with ω s will vary with the riser length because the external cf is considerably complex in deep water the vibration accelerations of the riser u y and u z will also vary with the riser length and evolve with time according to eq 1 or 9 therefore although the wake oscillator equations eqs 23 and 24 can be numerically solved using the runge kutta method after setting the parameters and the initial conditions of the variables they are coupled with the riser at each point in time and space 2 4 solution strategy the basic equations of the system include two sets one as shown in eqs 1 and 9 is used to describe the vibrations of the solid structure of a riser excited by the internal flow along the pipe as well as the vortex wake generated by the external flow across the pipe the other set as shown in eqs 23 and 24 models vortex shedding from the pipe as the pipe vibrates the interactions between pipe vibration and internal flow are coupled by their terms in eq 1 such as those containing the products of u i velocity of the internal fluid flow and u y angular speed of the pipe in xy plane u i 2 and u y curvature of the pipe in the xy plane and p i pressure of the fluid in the pipe and u y further the interactions between pipe vibration and external flow are coupled by the nonhomogenous terms in eq 9 and eqs 23 and 24 f i j is the nonhomogenous term of eq 9 defined using eqs 10 and 20 22 and its components f y and f z contain vortex wake variables p x t and q x t obtained through eqs 15 19 and 23 and 24 p x t and q x t in eqs 23 and 24 are stimulated by u y x t and u z x t respectively which are the translational accelerations of the pipe in the y and z directions obtained using eq 1 or 9 according to these relations the solution procedures can be roughly designed as follows i for the eigenvalues obtained using eq 9 find the lowest first and second angular frequencies of the riser i e ω r 1 and ω r 2 respectively and solve eq 11 to obtain c s ii set the initial conditions t t 0 0 as u y x i t 0 u z x i t 0 0 u y x i t 0 0 u z x i t 0 0 p x i t 0 q x i t 0 0 and p x i t 0 q x i t 0 0 iii solve eqs 12 22 and substitute the obtained values into eq 9 iv solve eq 9 using the newmark method extract u y x i t k and u z x i t k and substitute them into eqs 23 and 24 v solve eqs 23 and 24 using the runge kutta method extract p x i t k and q x i t k and substitute them into eqs 12 22 and 9 thereby completing a cycle let t k 1 t k δ t where δ t 0 01 s or less 0 01s go to iii and continue until t k 1 60 s or more or less 60s here the subscript i 1 2 n n indicates the number of nodes in the finite element structure n is determined by the riser length l and the element length l we take l 8 d in this study and the subscript k 0 1 n n is the total number of time steps from 0 to 60s or more or less 60s generally before solving eq 9 all the related matrices and vectors expressed in the local element coordinates must be converted into global structure coordinates and integrated into structure matrices and vectors hence the differential equation of the fem of the riser structure corresponding to eq 9 with respect to every term may be given as follows 25 m x c x k x f to solve the eigenvalue problem of eq 9 the homogeneous form of eq 25 should be solved further it should be determined when the fluid damping matrix c e in eq 9 is absent from c based on the definition of an eigenvalue problem the term c i in eq 9 does not denote real damping in physics however it is a solid liquid coupling term that should be retained furthermore c i now included in c and k a in eq 9 now included in k are asymmetric matrices to ensure that the solution can be obtained using standard computer programs we use the method proposed by meirovitch to solve the eigenvalues meirovitch 1980 let the homogeneous form of eq 25 be augmented into 26 a s b s 0 27 a c m k 0 28 b k 0 0 k 29 s x x 30 s x x subsequently transform it into a standard eigenvalue problem as 31 1 λ i s b 1 a s where i b 1 b is a unit diagonal matrix the eigenvalues λ i and eigenvectors s i obtained from eq 31 have been proved to be the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the original equation eq 25 meirovitch 1980 3 model validation via numerical and experimental comparisons 3 1 natural frequency validation although several viv experiments have been conducted with respect to risers chaplin et al 2005 trim et al 2005 feng 1968 chen and jendrzejczyk 1979 brika and laneville 1993 sarpkaya 1995 the model data obtained for a drilling riser when it enters into deep water involves many factors that are not considered by eqs 1 31 therefore before applying our model to a case in which all these factors may be nonnegligible we validate it by comparing the modeling results with those obtained based on the existing experiments and the theoretical or numerical solutions obtained in a few simple cases the hydrodynamic forces that act upon the structure become increasingly prominent as the structure begins to oscillate especially in the resonance region bishop and hassan 1964 when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure the vortex distribution would deviate from strouhal s law and synchronize with the oscillating frequency which is known as frequency lock in zanganeh and srinil 2016 in the lock in state the risk of fatigue damage to the solid structure is observed to considerably increase therefore the evolution of several lowest natural frequencies of the fluid conveying pipe in the absence of cf should be initially observed for comparison purposes the same geometric and material parameters are selected as those in the experimental model of a previously conducted study franzini et al 2004 there are no buoyant blocks on the riser the riser length l 9 63 m outer diameter of the pipe d 20 mm wall thickness t w 0 45 mm riser l d 481 5 mass ratio m 2 23 mass density of the external fluid ρ w 1020 kg m3 mass density of the internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 and young s modulus of the solid pipe e 102 5 gpa furthermore the flow direction is parallel to the global y axis and additional tensions of t 0 817 n are applied to each end of the riser which is supported by a universal hinge at each end allowing free rotation the natural frequencies of the vertical riser were tested at marintek by exxonmobil lehn 2003 lehn 2003 and calculated for example by wang et al 2016 wang and xiao 2016 and wang et al 2018 wang et al 2018 using the fem in the ansys software and an analytical method respectively further we solved eq 31 and set m a 0 wang and xiao 2016 wang et al 2018 to calculate the natural frequencies of the riser these results as well as those obtained in this study are summarized in table 1 when compared with the test the relative errors of the finite element analysis fea wang and xiao 2016 and the proposed method in table 1 are less than those obtained with respect to the analytical method although all the presented errors are acceptable in view of the applications for an analytical solution the coriolis inertial force with respect to the fluid solid interaction of the riser is usually neglected moreover the pressure acting on the model riser was not considered in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 resulting in errors in the model riser the density of the fluid inside the pipe is different from that outside the pipe therefore an equivalent pressure caused by the density difference should be present on the wall of the riser furthermore the vertically positioned riser linearly changes the pressure along the riser that increases the difficulties associated with finding an analytical solution thus it is more practical to use numerical methods to obtain a solution further the frequencies of all the eight lowest modes obtained using the proposed method are less than 1 of those presented by fea wang and xiao 2016 both are based on finite element method resulting in good agreement 3 2 vibration amplitude validation subsequently we examine the vibration amplitude of the riser as an example we consider case 1105 in lehn s experiment lehn 2003 for comparison the parameters in case 1105 are similar to those in a previously conducted study wang and xiao 2016 unless the incoming flow is specified to be uniform and the velocity is considered to be 0 42 m s table 2 summarizes the maximum root mean square rms amplitudes of the model s lateral vibration for case 1105 i e a y rms max d and a z rms max d in a dimensionless form for the il and cf cases respectively these values were obtained from exxonmobil s test of marintek lehn 2003 the fem calculations of huang et al 2011a huang et al 2011 and wang et al 2016 wang and xiao 2016 and the proposed method the present results are observed to be considerably similar to the test data the corresponding profiles of the dimensionless lateral displacements u y d and u z d for certain time points during 20 60 s are shown in fig 2 a and b and a y rms max d and a zrms max d are their statistic values they are defined as 32 a y rms max d 1 2 max i 1 n 1 max k 1 n 1 u y x i t k min k 1 n 1 u y x i t k d 33 a z rms max d 1 2 max i 1 n 1 max k 1 n 1 u z x i t k min k 1 n 1 u z x i t k d where n is the total number of finite elements of the riser and n is the total number of time steps from 20 to 60 s the elementary experiments in the hydrodynamics literature and several simulations facchinetti et al 2004 zanganeh and srinil 2014 dao et al 2001 allowed us to determine a set of coefficients for the hydrodynamic forces in eqs 16 18 and 19 and the van der pol equations in eqs 23 and 24 as shown in table 2 bringing a y rms max d and a zrms max d close to the test data c d 0 c d i 0 and c l 0 can take different values according to reynolds number and a y ε y or a z ε z can be in the order of 30 1920 in the cf direction only or in case of the il and cf oscillations as discussed previously lehn 2003 however a y rms max d and a zrms max d are comprehensive statistic numbers for viv indicating that their values in a similar viv would be likely to be similar as shown in the next section however because of the definitions of a y rms max d and a zrms max d including n and n and the details of the procedures mentioned by others in table 3 are different or unclear these results cannot be appropriately compared 3 3 fluid conveying velocity and the axial tension validation finally we examine the effects of the fluid conveying velocity and the axial tension of the riser on the natural frequency because they are related to the design and control of the hanging weight of the riser when entering water as well as the fluid in the pipe that has to be replenished released or replaced with a fluid of a different density similar geometric and material parameters when compared with those in previously conducted studies are selected for comparison purposes wang et al 2018 dai et al 2013 pipe length l 50m outer diameter of the pipe d 0 25 m inner diameter d i 0 125 m young s modulus of the solid pipe e 210 gpa mass density of the pipe ρ r 7850 kg m3 mass density of the external fluid ρ w 1020 kg m3 and mass density of the internal fluid ρ f 870 kg m3 we discuss the above problem when the pipe is in a stable state i e when the internal flow velocity is lower than the critical value observing that the axial force is in tension and that the mass density of the external fluid is greater than that of the internal fluid thereby increasing the stability of the riser the stability of the pipe can be determined by successively increasing the internal flow velocity in this case the natural frequencies obtained from the present model can be compared with those obtained from the analytical solution for the linearized portion wang et al 2018 further we obtain the system eigenfrequencies using the algorithm presented in eq 26 31 and the solutions of eq 9 the present and previous results are visualized in fig 3 a b and 4 a b respectively for the natural frequencies discussed in this subsection the structure damping and fluid pressure values are set to be zero similar to those in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 and the nondimensionalizations numbers 34 ω r ω r l 2 m f m r m a e i 35 u i u i l m f e i and 36 γ t 0 l 2 e i are used for obtaining the pipe s dimensional angular frequency ω r internal fluid velocity u i and axial tension t 0 respectively fig 3 a and b denote that the three lowest natural frequencies of the riser decrease with an increase in the conveying fluid velocity in the global xy and xz planes respectively when the velocity is lower than the critical value these results agree well with those in a previously conducted study wang et al 2018 except for the cf first mode in fig 3 b when the velocity is close to the critical value where the natural frequency should be close to zero even though it is not wang et al 2018 fig 4 a and b denote that the three lowest natural frequencies increase along with the axial tension of the riser in the global xy and xz planes respectively although the analytical solution and experimental data are absent the trend is consistent with the physical properties of the riser because its flexural rigidity is increased by the tension i e the greater the rigidity the greater will be the frequency the aforementioned comparisons with the experiment computation and analytical solutions obtained using a single model verify that the present model algorithm and computer code are credible and efficient to describe the mechanical response of the riser to the conveying fluid and the axial tension as well as the vortex induced interaction with respect to the uniform incoming flow in next section we will use the proposed method to evaluate and discuss the response of a drilling riser when it enters into deep water 4 mechanical response of a drilling riser with buoyant blocks when it enters into deep water 4 1 parameter setting and an overview of the typical results in this section eq 9 31 are used and the coefficients for hydrodynamic force and the van der pol oscillator equations are set similar to that in table 3 riser length l 500 1 000 1 500 2 000 2 500 and 3 000 m outer diameter d 533 4 mm inner diameter d i 501 65 mm young s modulus of the solid riser e 210 gpa poission s ratio μ 0 3 mass density of the pipe ρ r

density ρ w 1 030 kg m3 the mass density of the buoyant blocks ρ b 405 18 kg m3 and the outer diameter of the buoyant blocks is d b 2 238d the total length of the blocks is l b and l b is measured from the bottom end of the riser usually the velocity of an ocean current decreases with the depth therefore lowering the mounting position of the buoyant blocks will reduce the hydrodynamic forces to measure the impact of the buoyant blocks we define a buoyancy weight ratio r bw as the ratio of the buoyancy weight of the borne buoyant blocks to the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant block itself by the r bw l b can be determined the greater the r bw the greater the l b and more buoyant blocks are used in addition let us assume a water depth d l the water particle movement velocity caused by the waves in deep water conditions is in accordance with the linear theory of a plane wave for example in the xy plane at depth x and time t the velocity v w y can be obtained as boccotti 2000 37 v w y π h w t w exp k w x cos k w y ω w t d x 0 t 0 where h w is the wave height t w is the wave period k w ω w 2 g is the wave number g is the acceleration of gravity and ω w 2 π t w is the angular frequency of the wave the wavelength can be computed by l w t w 2 g 2 π furthermore the water depth dependent velocities of the water particles owing to wind induced water flow and ocean current including tidal current are evaluated as boccotti 2000 38 v c 1 v m 1 x d 1 7 d x 0 39 v c 2 v t 1 x d d x 0 where v m and v t are of the velocities of the water particles at the surface by wind and ocean current while the angle between v m and the y axis is β m and that between v t and the y axis is β t in this section unless mentioned otherwise h w 6 5m t w 13s v m 0 2 m s v t 3 5 m s β m 0 and β t π 2 i e v m is parallel to the y axis and v t is parallel to the z axis are assumed to be constant under the mild sea conditions d 500 m should be ensured to achieve the deep water condition i e l w d 0 5 thus the fluid velocity outside the riser can be given as u v y 2 v z 2 v y v c 1 v w y assuming that the directions of the wind and wave are same and parallel to the y axis and v z v c 2 that is parallel to the z axis which are also related to the vortex shedding the relative coefficients are the same as those in table 3 subsequently by performing the calculation a set of typical results characterized by the deformations stresses of the risers and distributions of the van der pol oscillators around a single riser can be obtained as shown in fig 5 where the drilling riser reach a maximum depth of 1 000 m fig 5 a shows the deformation of vibration of the drilling riser in xy plane at a time point in which the vertical coordinates indicate the points on the axis of the riser and the horizontal coordinates indicate the lateral displacements of the riser the maximun displacement u y 51 01 m is at the bottom end x 1000 m at this moment noting that the bottom end is free in this process the buoyant blocks a string of green circles are on the lower part of the riser having length l b 315 m for r bw 0 5 similarly fig 5 b and c show the deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xz plane and xyz space at the time point respectively fig 5 d shows a set of deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xy plane at different time points in which one curve corresponds to one time point and the bandwidth of the curves at x indicates the range of vibration of the point x on the axis of the riser noting that the absolute maximun displacement in y direction is equal to u y 65 31 m at x 739 23 m rather than at the bottom end according to the data setting in fig 5 d u y is mainly caused by the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction and vortex shedding in y direction of the ocean current in z direction similarly fig 5 e shows a set of deformations of vibration of the drilling riser in xz plane at different time points which however are mainly caused by ocean current in z direction and the vortex shedding in z direction of the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction in fig 5 e all u z are always located on the positive side of the z axis which indicates that the pushing effect of the ocean current in z direction on the riser is more than the swaying effect of the vortex shedding in z direction of the wind induced flow and wave flow both are in y direction on the riser resulting in the maximum u z at the bottom of the riser reaching 100 66 m fig 5 f shows the maximun bending stresses and corresponding locations through the riser at different time points which are concetrated in the range from x 950 m to x 620 m and the maximal bending stress is 389 1 mpa at x 713 7 m suggesting that fatigue damage may occur at this region fig 5 g shows the values of van der pol wake variables p and q surround the single riser in a three dimensional space at different time points the complicated distribution of p and q reflects complex coupling between the vortex shedding and riser vibrating and the significant enlargement of p and q nearby the lower part of the riser are resulted from the larger size of the buoyant blocks as well as the larger motion of the riser in this region fig 5 h and i show the spatial and temporal evolution of the van der pol wake variables p x t and q x t along the axis of the riser and with time t here p x t represents the effect of vortex shedding in y direction due to the ocean current crossing the riser in z direction while q x t represents the effect of vortex shedding in z direction due to the wind induced flow and wave flow crossing the riser in y direction both p x t and q x t developed appear as a complex travelling wave affected by the larger size of the buoyant blocks and the larger motion of the lower part of the riser fig 5 j shows the axial stress σ nx at the sections of bottom end σ nx b middle σ nx m and upper end σ nx u varying with time σ nx b is in the lowest level and fluctuating slightly owing to the hanging weight at the bottom end σ nx m is always and σ nx u is mostly with negtive values which indicate that the riser is mostly in a compression state owing to having too much buoyant blocks on the riser however if the buoyant blocks were too less or even absent σ nx u would be in tension noting that a high tension stress at the upper end of the riser requires a great platform and a high strength of the tensioner fig 5 k shows the bending stresses at the middle section x 500 m of the riser varying with time σ m y m and σ m z m represent the bending stresses when the bending existing in xy and xz plane respectively which depend on the curvatures of the curves in fig 5 d and e at x 500 m and σ m b m σ m y m 2 σ m z m 2 is the resultant stress of σ m y m and σ m z m noting that the maximal bending stress does not occur at the middle section of the riser compared to the distribution of the maximum bending stress in fig 5 f 4 2 influence of the entry speed in this subsection let us assume that there are three buoyant block mounted risers all have the same length l 3 000 m outer diameter d 533 4 mm hanging weight pex 2 000 kn buoyancy weight ratio r bw 0 5 and model parameters first each riser is vertically put into water to its full length then simulations were conducted under the conditions of ocean current wind induced flow and wave flow and so listed in subsection 4 1 unless β m π 2 and β t 0 each lasting 60 s during the simulations let one riser stop entering u 0 0 while the other two maintain velocities u 0 0 15 m s and 0 3 m s respectively we examine the maximal lateral displacements through the risers and the displacements at the bottom end of the risers in y and z axes and maximal tension and maximal resultant bending stresses during the simulations the results are summarized in fig 6 from which it is observed that an increase of entery speed u 0 barely affects the maximum displacements in both y and z directions the maximum bottom s displacements in both y and z directions fig 6 a and the maximum bending stresses fig 6 b however it significantly decreases the maximum tension stresses fig 6 b on the theory of elasticity the maximum bending stresses are proportional to the maximum bending displacements the maximum bending stresses are positive correlated to the fatigue damage of the riser and the maximum bending displacements affect the axial movement of the objects contained in the riser thus both have to be limited although they are independent of entry velocity in this case as for the maximum tension stresses fig 6 b they decrease with increases of entering velocity of the riser for example there is a 47 8 less at u 0 0 3 m s than at u 0 0 this is because of the damping effect of the water on axial movement of the riser i e the more the u 0 the more the damping which helps to lift the riser on the other hand under the same u 0 u ymax u zmax and u zbottom u ybottom the u ymax u zmax is because the velocity of the incoming flow in y direction is more than that in z direction on the data given in subsection 4 1 the former is mainly caused by ocean current the latter is mainly caused by wind induced flow and wave flow in contrast the velocity of the cross flow in z direction is more than that in y direction leading to u zbottom u ybottom because for the former the vortex shedding is mainly caused by ocean current and the latter it is mainly caused by wind induced flow and wave flow while the velocity of ocean current is more than those of wind induced flow and wave flow on the data given in subsection 4 1 it should be noticed that u ybottom and u zbottom affect the alignment of the riser with the wellhead in the subsea during riser s entering into the water and the subsequent instoration thus properly increasing the entry speed can reduce the maximum tension stresses a lot and almost no side effects are observed upon the entering risers needless to say it can shorten the time in position of the risers 4 3 influence of riser length and buoyancy weight ratio in this subsection let us assume that 15 riser samples are equally divided into five groups all risers possess the same properties and sizes except the length and buoyancy weight ratio they are under the same oceanic conditions as described in subsection 4 1 now let l 1 000 1 500 and 3 000 m be the lengths of the risers in groups 1 2 5 respectively i e each group includes three equal length risers in each group each riser takes one of the buoyancy weight ratios r bw 0 0 25 and 0 5 put the risers vertically into water one by one to their full length then set u 0 0 pex 2 000 kn v t 3 5 m s v m 0 2 m s β t 0 and β m π 2 i e v t from the ocean current is parallel to the y axis whereas v m from the wind induced is parallel to the z axis and the other parameters as mentioned in subsection 4 1 for simulation these settings are unchanged for all risers in this subsection and each simulation lasts 60 s we examine the maximal lateral displacements u ymax in the global xy plane y direction and u zmax in the xz plane z direction bottom end lateral displacements in y direction u ybottom and in z direction u zbottom as well as the maximal tension stresses at upper end and the maximal bending stresses varying with l and r bw respectively the results are summarized in figs 7 and 8 by the definition of r bw r bw 0 0 25 and 0 5 indicate the buoyant blocks bear a 0 25 and 50 of the total buoyancy weight of the riser system including the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant blocks itself respectively r bw 0 indicate the buoyant block is absent fig 7 a shows that when r bw is a constant u ymax increases with the increase of l this is because a large l corresponds to a large flexibility for example when r bw 0 the u ymax 103 74 m at l 3 000 m is 67 9 more than u ymax 61 78 m at l 1 000m however with the increase of l the growth rate of u ymax decreases gradually because the self weight of the riser also increases with the increase of l that causes the riser to straighten and move towards the vertical position of itself at rest on the other hand when l is a constant u ymax decreases with the decrease of r bw owing to that a less r bw means less buoyant blocks used and the naked pipe has less outer diameter than the block mounted one thus less hydrodynamic forces generated see eq 15 17 however the differences of u ymax caused by different values of r bw will vanish when l 2000m owing to that the incoming flow velocity is negatively correlated with the depth of water see eq 37 39 the differences of u ymax between the risers with r bw 0 and 0 25 are much less than that with r bw 0 25 and 0 5 owing to that a certain length of blocks mounted on deeper riser will generate much less hydrodynamic forces than the same length of blocks mounted on upper riser for the same reason the differences exist in u zmax u ybottom and u zbottom as shown in fig 7 b c and d it is observed that for r bw 0 5 when l increases from 1 000m to 3 000m u zmax fig 7 b and u zbottom fig 7 d are changed from both 100 71 m 65 39 m and 48 04 m decreased by 32 5 and 52 3 respectively while u ybottom fig 7 c fluctuates nearby its mean level 36 36 m slightly however for r bw 0 and 0 25 u zmax u ybottom and u zbottom are barely changed with l and the absolute values of them are less than 2 1 m which can be ignored fig 8 a shows that the maximum bending stresses decrease with the increase of the riser length l especially when the buoyancy weight ratios r bw is greater r bw 0 5 and with the decrease of r bw the maximum bending stresses decrease it is consistence with the experience and computing result that under a same r bw less depth of water leads to more buoyant blocks involving in more current flow velocity thus generating more hydrodynamic forces for example for a constant r bw 0 5 when the water depth d and riser length l are equal to 1 000 m the total buoyant blocks length l b is computed to be 315 m the blocks accounting for l b l 0 315 will be subject to the current and the maximum current velocity on the blocks is computed to be 1 27 m s whereas when d l 3000 m resulting in l b 630 m the blocks accounting for 0 21 will be subject to the current and the maximum current velocity on the blocks is 0 895 m s fig 8 b shows that however increasing l and decreasing r bw can increase the maximum tensions this is because the tensions at the upper end firstly depends upon the self weight of the riser i e the longer the riser the heavier the riser thus more tension needed at the upper end whereas less r bw means less buoyant blocks used thus less lift force provided as we know the bending stress is related to the fatigue damage of the riser and the tension at the up end of the riser is related to the strength of the platform and the tenssioner of the riser both must be controlled fig 9 a and b show that in order to make both the maximum bending stress σ mb max and the maximum tension stress σ nx max to be equal or equal to their minimum values for a given depth of water or riser length l how many buoyant blocks indicated by r bw should be mounted on the riser fig 9 a is for l 1 000 2 000 m in which the curves of σ mb max versus r bw and the curves of σ nx max versus r bw are put together it is observed that there is a cross point at r bw 0 08 for the curves σ nx max and σ mb max with l 2 000 m at which σ nx max σ mb max 127 4 mpa in addition r bw 0 08 corresponds to l b 76 m the length of the entire buoyant blocks in case of the buoyant block density ρ b 405 18 kg m3 and its outer diameter d b 1 194m however r bw 0 08 is not the optimal value of r bw for the riser of l 2 000 m the optimal result for l 2 000m is r bw 0 4 l b 315 m where σ mb max 127 mpa and σ nx max 62 2 mpa similarly in fig 9 a the other two optimal results are l 1 000m r bw 0 25 l b 95m σ mb max 128 9 mpa and σ nx max 54 mpa and l 1500 m r bw 0 25 l b 197 m σ mb max 126 8 mpa and σ nx max 70 mpa finally fig 9 b is for l 2 000 3 000 m in which the situation when l 2 000 m listed for comparison is as same as in fig 9 a and has been discussed above the other two optimal results as observed are l 2 500 m r bw 0 4 l b 441 m σ mb max 127 mpa and σ nx max 83 3 mpa and l 3 000 m r bw 0 4 l b 504 m σ mb max 126 9 mpa and σ nx max 99 3 mpa although the cross point exist between each pair of σ mb max and σ nx max thus in this study the buoyant blocks should be mounted on the risers to bear a 25 of the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant blocks itself for l 1 000 1 500 m and 40 for l 2 000 3 000 m respectively to ensure both bending stresses and tension stresses generated in the lowest level 5 conclusions in this study we developed a novel 3d dynamic model of viv in drilling risers that convey internal fluid flow to simulate the mechanical responses of the risers when they enter into water at depth of 3 000 m under realistic environmental conditions almost all types of loads and boundary conditions and the nonlinear effect of the large deflection of the risers on their loads were considered further we compared the simulation results with the existing experimental data exhibiting good agreement and verifying the validity of the model and parameters we discussed the effects of the entry speed buoyant blocks and water depth on the drop point offset of the bottom end of the risers tension stresses and the values as well as positions of the maximum stresses on the risers when lowering a drilling riser into deep water under mild sea conditions increasing the entry speed can reduce the maximum tension stresses it does not significantly affect the drop point offset although a long drilling riser is required in case of deep water it does not enlarge the drop point offset because the lateral displacement of the bottom of the riser nonlinearly decreases with increasing riser length in addition increasing the buoyant blocks can reduce the tension at the upper end but increase the offset of the drop point of the end of the risers and the maximum bending stress to ensure both the bending stresses and tension stresses generated in the lowest level the buoyant blocks should bear a 25 of the total buoyancy weight including of the riser the fluid in the riser and the buoyant block itself for l 1 000 1 500m and 40 for l 2 000 3 000m respectively thus when risers enter into deep water appropriately increasing the buoyant blocks and the entry speed can control the maximum tension stress that will not enlarge the drop point offset and bending stress too much credit authorship

21479,considering that the ship hydrodynamic behaviours differ by the ship types and dimensions the effect of biofouling on ship resistance can also vary with different ships in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans based towed ship models were developed to simulate the roughness effect of biofouling on ship resistance a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 representing slender and a full hull forms were modelled with various scale factors and speeds the cfd simulations were conducted with several fouling conditions by embedding the roughness function of barnacles into the wall function of the cfd model i e modified wall function approach the fouling effects on the resistance components form factors wake fractions and the flow characteristics were investigated from the simulations significant differences were observed varying with the hull types lengths scales and speeds of the ships and it was concluded that these differences are dominated by two parameters relative roughness height and the roughness reynolds number keywords biofouling ship resistance kriso container ship kcs kriso tanker kvlcc2 computational fluid dynamics cfd 1 introduction it is well established that the power and fuel consumption of a ship increases with the hull roughness hull roughness can be caused by various factors including mechanical causes e g mechanical damage sand blasting plate waviness welds mechanical damage to the marine coatings chemical and electrochemical processes i e corrosion and finally the colonisation of biofouling which is often the most critical tezdogan and demirel 2014 townsin 2003 the economic and environmental problems due to the increased hull roughness include increases in ship resistance fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the mitigation measures are also associated with costly antifouling coatings and drydocking schultz et al 2011 therefore accurate predictions of the impact of hull roughness on ship performance are needed for the best choice of antifouling coatings and scheduling of hull cleaning uzun et al 2019 the most prevalent method for predicting the roughness effect on ship resistance is the similarity law scaling of granville 1958 1978 which has been widely used over the decades by many researchers schultz 2002 2004 schultz and flack 2007 flack and schultz 2010 schultz et al 2011 demirel et al 2017a 2019 li et al 2019 uzun et al 2020 however this scaling method has several disadvantages as criticised by demirel et al 2017b the most critical one is that in this method the frictional resistance of the rough hull is assumed to be equal to that of an equivalent length flat plate and hence the three dimensional 3d effects are discarded accordingly this method cannot predict the roughness effect on other ship resistance components which are closely related to the 3d hull shapes another arguable simplification is the uniform and constant distribution of the roughness reynolds number k and roughness function u along with the whole flat plate which is not the case in the real world on the other hand there have been active efforts to model the roughness effect using computational fluid dynamics cfd the advantage of using cfd is that the above mentioned demerits of granville s flat plate approach can be avoided in cfd simulations the 3d effects can be taken into account and the simulations are free from the scale effect once they are modelled in full scale also the local friction velocity u τ is dynamically computed for each discretised cell in the simulations and therefore the dynamically varying roughness reynolds number k and corresponding roughness function u can be considered in the computations atlar et al 2018 accordingly there have been recent studies using cfd simulations to investigate the roughness effect on ship resistance e g demirel et al 2014 demirel et al 2017b farkas et al 2018 farkas et al 2019 song et al 2019a and propeller performance owen et al 2018 song et al 2019b 2020a as well as ship self propulsion characteristics song et al 2020b farkas et al 2020a recently song et al 2020c extended the validation of the roughness modelling in cfd by comparing their method which had been only validated against flat plates before with a model ship towing test of song et al 2020d the findings of demirel et al 2017b and song et al 2019a are especially important as their results suggest that the hull roughness does affect not only the ship frictional resistance but also the other resistance components e g the viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance this is certainly notable since it had been widely believed that the roughness effect on the wave making resistance is negligible e g carchen et al 2019 however these findings cannot be generalised as these studies were conducted only for a single type of hull form kcs considering that the ship hydrodynamic behaviours vary with different ship types and dimensions the roughness effect can also vary with different ship forms recently farkas et al 2019 observed differences in the roughness effect on the form factors and the nominal wake between two different ship types i e container ship and bulk carrier also it is well established that the form factors of ships change by scales garcı a gómez 2000 min and kang 2010 van et al 2011 dogrul et al 2020 in this context it is worth investigating the roughness effect on the ship hydrodynamic characteristics of different ships with variations of the scales and speeds to the best of the authors knowledge there exists no specific study investigating the roughness effect on the ship resistance of different hull forms with different scales and speeds therefore the aim of this study is to fill this gap by performing a series of cfd simulations of different hull forms in different scales and speeds in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans based ship models of a container ship and a tanker were developed each vessel was modelled in three different scales namely model scale moderate scale and full scale the modified wall function approach was used with the roughness function of barnacles determined by demirel et al 2017a to represent the surface roughness of barnacle fouling the simulations of each vessel kcs and kvlcc2 in different scales were performed with a range of speeds finally the effect of biofouling on ship resistance components form factor and flow characteristics around the hulls were investigated 2 background 2 1 roughness function and modified wall function approach the surface roughness causes an increase in turbulence hence the skin friction increases the roughness effect can be observed as a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer this downward shift is termed as the roughness function u the non dimensional velocity profile in the log law region for a rough surface is then given as 1 u 1 k i n y where u is the mean velocity at the normal distance y from the wall u τ is the friction velocity defined as τ w ρ τ w is the wall shear stress υ is the kinematic viscosity defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to the fluid density μ ρ κ is the von karman constant and β is the log low intercept the roughness function u can be expressed as a function of the roughness reynolds number κ defined as 2 k κ u τ υ it should be noted that fxsimply vanishes in the case of a smooth condition demirel et al 2017a determined the roughness function of barnacles through towing tests of a flat plate covered with artificial barnacle patches with varying sizes small medium and big and coverages 10 50 from the experimental results they observed that the roughness functions of the barnacles follow the colebrook type roughness function model of grigson 1992 as shown in fig 1 given by 3 u 1 κ ι n 1 κ in this study three representative surface conditions s20 m20 and b20 were selectively used for the simulations rather than including all the surface conditions of demirel et al 2017a table 1 shows the roughness length scales for the fouling conditions used in this study recently song et al 2019a employed this roughness function into the wall function in the cfd model and conducted simulations of a towed flat plate to validate the modified wall function approach the simulation results showed good agreement with the experiment of demirel et al 2017a in this study the same modified wall function approach with the same roughness function is used to investigate the effect of barnacles on kcs and kvlcc2 2 2 resistance components the total resistance r t of a ship can be divided into two main components the frictional resistance r f and the residuary resistance r r given by 4 r t r f r r the frictional resistance arises from the friction between the fluid and the hull surface while the residuary resistance is a pressure related resistance consisting of viscous pressure resistance r v p and wave making resistance r w given by 5 r t r f r v p r w the viscous pressure or also known as form drag is broadly assumed to be proportional to the frictional resistance lewis 1988 with the use of form factor κ as given 6 r v p κ r f 7 r t 1 κ r f r w the resistance components can be normalised by dividing each term by the dynamic pressure 1 2 ρ v 2 and the wetted surface area of the ship hull s the resistance coefficients can be defined as 8 c t c f c r 9 c t c f c v p c w 10 c t 1 κ c f c w where c t c f and c r is the coefficient of the total frictional and residuary resistance respectively 3 numerical modelling 3 1 governing equations and physical modelling the proposed cfd models were developed based on the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans method using a commercial cfd software package star ccm version 13 06 the second order upwind convection scheme and a first order temporal discretisation were used for the momentum equations the overall solution procedure was based on a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple type algorithm the shear stress transport sst κ ω turbulence model was used to predict the effects of turbulence which combines the advantages of the κ ω and the κ ε turbulence model menter 1994 a second order convection scheme was used for the equations of the turbulent model for the simulations where the free surface exists the volume of fluid vof method was used with high resolution interface capturing hric 3 2 geometry and boundary conditions in order to investigate the effect of biofouling on different ships the benchmark ship hulls of a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 were used for the cfd simulations figs 2 and 3 show the hull geometries of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively while tables 2 and 3 depict the principal particulars of these vessels as shown in the figures and the tables kcs represents a fast container ship with a sharp bow shape a slender hull form and a relatively shallow draught i e c b 0 65 f n 0 26 l p p t 21 30 whereas kvlcc2 represents a slow tanker with a fuller bow shape and hull form and a relatively deep draught i e c b 0 81 fx 0 14 fx 15 38 table 4 shows the simulation cases used in this study each vessel was modelled in two different computational domain types namely double body and free surface models for the purpose of decomposing the resistance components in a double body simulation the free surface is replaced by the symmetry boundary condition such that there is no wave making behaviour and hence there exist only the viscous resistance i e r t r v r f r v p on the other hand the free surface simulations have the free surface and hence consider the wave making behaviours such that the wave making resistance is included in the total ship resistance i e r t r f r v p r w the double body simulations were modelled in three different scales i e model scale moderate scale and full scale while the free surface simulations were modelled only in the full scales of the vessel in order to examine the effect of different ship speeds the simulations were conducted at froude number ranges of 0 130 0 282 for kcs and 0 083 0 156 for kvlcc2 at each scale fig 4 illustrates the computational domain and the boundary conditions of the double body and free surface simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 in terms of the free surface simulations the velocity inlet and the pressure outlet boundary conditions were applied for the opposite faces in the longitudinal direction the top and bottom far field boundaries were defined as velocity inlet symmetry boundary conditions were used for the vertical centre and side wall boundaries as similarly used by terziev et al 2019a the surface boundary conditions of the hull and rudder were defined as no slip walls for the smooth surface condition the smooth type wall function was used whereas the rough type roughness functions including the additional term of the roughness function were used for the fouling cases the difference for the double body simulations is that the z 0 plane is replaced with a symmetry plane such the simulation does not have the free surface it is of note that all the simulations were conducted in fixed conditions i e no sink or trim motions were allowed 3 3 mesh generation cut cell grids with prism layer mesh on the walls were generated using the built in meshing tool of star ccm version 13 06 local refinements were made for finer grids in the critical regions such as the bulbous bow rudder stern and the region near the free surface in case of the free surface simulations as shown in fig 5 the thickness of the first layer cell on the surface was chosen such that the wall y values are higher than 30 and also higher than the k values as recommended by demirel et al 2017b and siemens 2018 it is of note that the same mesh was used for all the smooth and rough surface conditions including the near wall refinement the mean wall y values at the design speed on the wetted surface area of the model moderate and full scale kcs simulations were 39 63 and 205 respectively while those for kvlcc2 simulations were 66 52 and 93 respectively 4 results 4 1 verification and validation 4 1 1 verification study in order to estimate the numerical uncertainties of the cfd models and also to determine the sufficient grid spacings and the time step size δ t a verification study was performed by conducting the simulations with three different resolutions of mesh and time steps namely fine medium and coarse then the spatial and temporal uncertainties u g r i d and u δ t were estimated using the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 it is of note that although the gci method was firstly proposed for spatial convergence studies it can also be used to estimate the temporal uncertainties of the simulations tezdogan et al 2015 terziev et al 2018 2019b 2020 tables 5 and 6 show the spatial and temporal uncertainties of the kcs and kvlcc simulations obtained from the grid and time step convergence study the spatial and temporal uncertainties were calculated based on the fine mesh and the fine time step for each case in this study the fine mesh and fine time step were used for each case 4 1 2 validation study in order to validate the cfd models used in this study the total resistance coefficients c t obtained from the free surface simulations were compared with c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 at the design speed although the free surface simulations with fouling conditions were modelled only at the full scale model scale free surface simulations were additionally conducted in this subsection to be compared against the model test of kim et al 2001 full scale c t values were compared with other full scale cfd studies available from the literature as well as the extrapolated c t values based on the experimental data of kim et al 2001 it is of note that the c t of kcs was extrapolated using froude s 2d scaling while that of kvlcc2 was extrapolated using hughes 3d scaling as per the suggestion of dogrul et al 2020 the c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 from the different sources and methods are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively the relative differences were calculated using the current cfd results as the reference values the model scale results for kcs and kvlcc2 showed good agreement with the experimental data of kim et al 2001 showing the relative differences of 0 35 and 1 59 respectively in terms of full scale simulations both the kcs and kvlcc2 results from the present cfd showed good agreement with other full scale cfd results in the literature showing relative differences up to 1 25 however the current kvlcc2 simulation showed a rather large difference with the extrapolated result 4 69 as similarly observed by dogrul et al 2020 and farkas et al 2020b 4 2 roughness effect on c f and c v in order to investigate the roughness effect on the frictional resistance c f and viscous resistance c v the double body simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 were performed as mentioned earlier the total resistance of the vessels calculated in the double body simulations is assumed to be equal to the viscous resistance i e c t c v while c f is calculated by simply considering the shear drag only in the simulations figs 6 and 7 show the c f and c v values obtained from the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations respectively in different surface conditions smooth s20 m20 and b20 as shown in the figures the c f and c v values increase significantly due to the hull fouling for the kcs cases the percentage increase in the frictional resistance δ c f with the most severe fouling condition b20 are up to 93 89 and 86 at the model moderate and full scales respectively and those of kvlcc2 are 79 74 and 69 one can notice that the δ c f values are larger for kcs than kvlcc2 while these values become smaller as the ship length increases this can be explained by two factors the relative roughness height k l and the roughness reynolds number k k u τ ν where k u τ and ν are the roughness height friction velocity and the kinematic viscosity respectively it is a well known fact that the skin friction over a rough wall increases with the k l values moody 1944 demirel et al 2019 therefore even with the same fouling condition the roughness effect on c f is stronger for smaller vessels due to the larger k l ratios on the other hand considering the significant changes in ship lengths the changes in δ c f with the scale is relatively small for example while the ship length of kvlcc2 increases 58 times i e the k l ratio becomes 58 times smaller the δ c f reduces by 10 only this can be attributed to the fact that the k values increase due to the increasing ship speeds with the scale at the same f n therefore higher k values result in stronger roughness effects in the turbulent boundary layer which diminishes the decreasing trends of δ c f due to the rapid changes in the k l ratio fig 8 compares the k values on the hull of kcs and kvlcc2 at their design speed constant f n with the b20 fouling condition the k values appear to be higher with larger scales and also higher for kcs due to the higher speeds when it comes to the viscous resistance c v similar trends were observed for the kcs cases the percentage increase in the viscous resistance δ c v due to the most severe fouling condition b20 are up to 88 87 and 84 at the model moderate and full scales respectively and those of kvlcc2 are 78 74 and 71 it can also be found that the differences between c v and c f are larger for kvlcc2 than kcs including the smooth surface condition which signifies larger viscous pressure resistance c v p and hence larger form factor values 1 k 4 3 roughness effect on form factor 1 k fig 9 compares the form factors 1 k of kcs and kvlcc2 with the different surface conditions the 1 k values were calculated using the c f and c v values obtained from the double body simulations as 1 k c v c f as shown in the figure the roughness effect of barnacles on the 1 k values showed different trends for kcs and kvlcc2 for the kcs cases the 1 k values decrease due to hull fouling and these decreases become more significant as the hull size increases the reduction in the form factor implies that the increase due to hull fouling is more significant for c f than c v p on the other hand differences were found in the kvlcc2 cases although the roughness effect on the 1 k values of kvlcc2 showed a different trend at each scale in the model scale λ 58 the 1 k values increase with the presence of hull fouling the roughness effect on 1 k become minor at the moderate scale λ 10 and finally the 1 k values decrease at the full scale λ 58 these different trends indicate that the roughness effect of c v p is more significant than that of c f at small scales but the effect of c f becomes dominant as the hull size increases which agrees with the kcs cases these differences in the roughness effect on the form factors can be more clearly seen in fig 10 which compares the percentage increase in the frictional and viscous pressure resistance components δ c f and δ c v p the y x line was drawn together for comparison which indicates that δ c f and δ c v p are equal along the line for kcs the results shown in fig 10 are located under the y x line which means that the roughness effect of c f dominates to that of c v p and the results move to the right bottom side as the scale increases suggesting that this dominance becomes stronger with larger hull sizes when it comes to the kvlcc2 case the results for the model scale λ 58 simulation are found above the y x line showing the dominance of the roughness effect of c v p over c f but move to the right bottom side of the graph as the scale increases similarly to the kcs case the general trend in these differences can be summarised that as the scale increases the roughness effect of c f becomes more important than that of c v p for both the vessels 4 4 free surface simulations 4 4 1 roughness effect on c t in order to investigate the roughness effect on the total resistance c t full scale free surface simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 were conducted with varying speeds for the smooth and fouling s20 m20 b20 surface conditions figs 11 and 12 show the c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with and without the presence of hull fouling significant increases in c t were recorded for both the ships the percentage increases δ c t due to the most severe fouling condition b20 for kcs and kvlcc2 were up to 66 and 78 respectively it is interesting to note that the kvlcc2 case shows higher δ c t values although they have smaller δ c f as shown in section 4 2 this can be explained by the fact that kvlcc2 has a higher contribution of the frictional resistance in the total resistance than kcs due to slower speed lower f n another interesting feature is to note that the δ c t values of kcs show a decreasing trend with the ship speed while those of kvlcc2 show the opposite in order to find the rationale behind these differences the total resistance components were divided into different components and discussed in the following sections 4 4 2 roughness effect on c f and c r the total resistance coefficients c t were decomposed into the frictional resistance coefficients c f and the residuary resistance coefficients c r by simply dividing the total drag acting on the ship into the shear and pressure force components figs 13 and 14 show the c f and c r values of the full scale kcs and kvlcc2 models respectively in the smooth and fouled s20 m20 b20 hull conditions it is of note that the c f values in figs 13 and 14 are from the free surface simulations and these values can be slightly different 1 form the c f values of the double body simulations figs 6 and 7 mainly because of the changes in the wetted surface area due to free surface elevations both the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations showed significant increases in c f due to the hull fouling as already observed in figs 6 and 7 while some differences were observed on c r of kcs and kvlcc2 the c r values of kvlcc2 show significant increases due to the hull fouling and these increases are consistent with the varying speeds on the other hand the c r values of kcs showed relatively small increases with hull fouling at low speed these increases become smaller as the speed increases and eventually turn into decreases at higher speeds together with this feature the increasing dominance of c r in c t for the kcs case can be related to the decreasing δ c t values of kcs as the speed increases as shown in fig 11 in order to understand the rationale of the changing trends of the roughness effect on c r the residuary resistance values were further decomposed into the viscous pressure resistance c v p and the wave making resistance c w and discussed in the following section 4 4 3 roughness effect on c vp and c w the c r values were decomposed into c v p and c w using the form factor values obtained from the double body simulations as 11 c v p k c f 12 c w c r c v p figs 15 and 16 show the c v p and c w values of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with the smooth and fouled s20 m20 b20 hull conditions in terms of c v p both the kcs and kvlcc2 cases show significant increases due to the hull fouling up to 52 and 74 for kcs and kvlcc2 respectively on the other hand differences were also found on c w between the two hull types for the kcs case the c w values have relatively high contributions in c r and increase sharply as the speed increases and eventually become dominant over c v p the roughness effect on the c w values of kcs is negligible at the lowest speed but becomes more pronounced as the ship speed increases which can be related to the higher k values at higher speeds the c w values of kcs show decreases due to hull fouling and the magnitudes of decrease become larger as the dominance of c w increases consequently for the fouled kcs cases the decreases in c w cancel the increases in c v p and eventually the c r values start to decrease at higher speeds on the other hand the c w values of kvlcc2 have minor contributions and remain rather consistent with the speed accordingly for kvlcc2 the roughness effect on c r follows the trend of c v p it is interesting that at the high speeds the roughness effect causes increases in c w unlike the kcs case however these changes in c w are too small i e δ c w c t 0 5 to draw any reliable conclusion on their effects considering that the estimated numerical uncertainty of c t of the free surface kvlcc2 simulation is larger than these changes u total 0 78 it is of note that the numerical uncertainty of the c w values u c w c w c t u c t 2 c w c v u c v 2 u c t 2 u c v 2 for the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations at the design speeds are 2 36 and 54 6 respectively this observation suggests that the roughness effect on the wave making resistance can differ by the hull forms and also by the speed these differences can be correlated with many different factors e g the block coefficient and the froude number f n further investigations with sufficient variations are required to understand better the correlations between these factors and the roughness effect on c w 4 5 roughness effect on the flow field 4 5 1 velocity field figs 17 and 18 show the axial velocity contours around the kcs and kvlcc2 hulls respectively in different scales with the smooth surface conditions and the most severe fouling conditions b20 the mean axial velocity was normalised by dividing the velocity with the advance speed of the ship v x v s h i p as shown in the figures for both the hull forms at the respective scales the roughness effect brings significant changes in the velocity field around the hulls as expected the smaller sizes with fouling showed larger wake regions due to the decelerated flow velocity at the stern the roughness effect on the wake field can be more clearly seen in fig 19 which compares the axial velocity contours behind the hull on the propeller plane x 0 0175 l p p in order to quantify the increases in the stern wake the nominal wake fractions w n were calculated by surface averaging the local wake fraction w x v s h i p v x v s h i p on the propeller disc i e the disc where the propeller will be located figs 20 and 21 compare the w n of the kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with the smooth and most severe fouling conditions b20 the inner and outer circles represent the hub diameter and propeller diameter for both the hull forms the hull fouling resulted in significant increases in the w n values the percentage increases in the w n of kcs due to the hull fouling at the model moderate and the full scale are 53 54 and 45 while those for the kvlcc2 case are 35 43 and 43 4 5 2 boundary layer thickness another notable feature of the fouling effect is observed in figs 17 and 18 is the increase in the boundary layer thickness especially on the hull bottom as well as on the aft end region the increases in the boundary layer thicknesses can be seen more clearly in figs 22 and 23 where the boundary layers are represented by the axial velocity contours limited to v x v s h i p 0 9 the figures vividly show the growth in the boundary layer thickness due to the hull fouling b20 for both the ships at all the scales these arguments in the boundary layer thickness that can be related to the presence of hull fouling reflect on to the frictional and viscous pressure resistance as discussed earlier 4 5 3 pressure field figs 24 and 25 illustrate the surface pressure distribution on the stern region of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively in both the smooth and fouled b20 conditions the pressure was normalised by dividing it by the dynamic pressure 1 2 ρ v s h i p 2 for both the ship types in all the scales reduced pressure magnitudes at the stern were observed with the presence of surface fouling i e reduced pressure recovery correspondingly the decreased stern pressures bring increased viscous pressure resistances as shown in figs 15 and 16 4 5 4 wave elevation fig 26 compares the kelvin wave around the kcs hull with and without the surface fouling at low and high speeds while considerable differences were observed between the smooth and fouled b20 hulls at the high speed f n 0 282 almost no effects were noted at the low speed f n 0 13 these speed dependant effects of the roughness on the wave elevations are in agreement with those on the wave making resistance c w of kcs as shown in fig 16 where the effect was negligible at the low speed whereas the effect becomes substantial as the speed increases likewise as shown in fig 27 the roughness effect on the kelvin wave around the kvlcc2 showed correspondences with the roughness effect on the c w values also shown in fig 17 for both the low and high speeds the free surface elevations around the kvlcc2 hull showed almost no differences regardless of the presence of hull fouling 4 5 5 concluding remarks in the study presented here urans based cfd simulation models of two different types of hulls and sizes were developed to investigate the effect of the ship type and scales on the resistances of these ships in the presence of fouling the cfd simulations were performed using the benchmark ship hulls of a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 for the representation of the roughness effect due to hull fouling the modified wall function approach was used with the roughness function of barnacles spatial and temporal convergence studies were performed using the grid convergence index gci method to estimate the numerical uncertainties of the proposed cfd models and to determine sufficient grid spacings and time steps by using two different computational domain types i e double body and free surface the ship resistance was decomposed into its individual components the results showed that the hull fouling causes significant increases in the frictional resistance and the viscous resistance regardless of the hull forms and scales i e sizes on the other hand while the form factors of kvlcc2 showed a different trend at each scale those of kcs consistently showed decreases with hull fouling differences between the effects of the hull types were also found through the roughness effect on the wave making resistance whereas the wave making resistance of kvlcc2 showed almost no differences regardless of the presence of the hull fouling kcs showed considerable roughness effects on the wave making resistance at the high speed in contrast this effect was negligible at the low speed of kcs finally the effect of hull fouling on the flow characteristics around the hulls was examined that included the velocity field downstream of the hulls and nominal wake flow at the propeller planes boundary layer thickness and pressure distribution on the hulls and the kelvin wave patterns the study provided several important findings including the first investigation into the different features of roughness effect for different hull forms ship size and speeds however to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the correlations of the roughness effect with various factors such as block coefficient froude number etc the study should be further extended with sufficient variations of hull forms scales and speeds credit authorship contribution statement soonseok song writing original draft formal analysis investigation validation

21479,considering that the ship hydrodynamic behaviours differ by the ship types and dimensions the effect of biofouling on ship resistance can also vary with different ships in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans based towed ship models were developed to simulate the roughness effect of biofouling on ship resistance a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 representing slender and a full hull forms were modelled with various scale factors and speeds the cfd simulations were conducted with several fouling conditions by embedding the roughness function of barnacles into the wall function of the cfd model i e modified wall function approach the fouling effects on the resistance components form factors wake fractions and the flow characteristics were investigated from the simulations significant differences were observed varying with the hull types lengths scales and speeds of the ships and it was concluded that these differences are dominated by two parameters relative roughness height and the roughness reynolds number keywords biofouling ship resistance kriso container ship kcs kriso tanker kvlcc2 computational fluid dynamics cfd 1 introduction it is well established that the power and fuel consumption of a ship increases with the hull roughness hull roughness can be caused by various factors including mechanical causes e g mechanical damage sand blasting plate waviness welds mechanical damage to the marine coatings chemical and electrochemical processes i e corrosion and finally the colonisation of biofouling which is often the most critical tezdogan and demirel 2014 townsin 2003 the economic and environmental problems due to the increased hull roughness include increases in ship resistance fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the mitigation measures are also associated with costly antifouling coatings and drydocking schultz et al 2011 therefore accurate predictions of the impact of hull roughness on ship performance are needed for the best choice of antifouling coatings and scheduling of hull cleaning uzun et al 2019 the most prevalent method for predicting the roughness effect on ship resistance is the similarity law scaling of granville 1958 1978 which has been widely used over the decades by many researchers schultz 2002 2004 schultz and flack 2007 flack and schultz 2010 schultz et al 2011 demirel et al 2017a 2019 li et al 2019 uzun et al 2020 however this scaling method has several disadvantages as criticised by demirel et al 2017b the most critical one is that in this method the frictional resistance of the rough hull is assumed to be equal to that of an equivalent length flat plate and hence the three dimensional 3d effects are discarded accordingly this method cannot predict the roughness effect on other ship resistance components which are closely related to the 3d hull shapes another arguable simplification is the uniform and constant distribution of the roughness reynolds number k and roughness function u along with the whole flat plate which is not the case in the real world on the other hand there have been active efforts to model the roughness effect using computational fluid dynamics cfd the advantage of using cfd is that the above mentioned demerits of granville s flat plate approach can be avoided in cfd simulations the 3d effects can be taken into account and the simulations are free from the scale effect once they are modelled in full scale also the local friction velocity u τ is dynamically computed for each discretised cell in the simulations and therefore the dynamically varying roughness reynolds number k and corresponding roughness function u can be considered in the computations atlar et al 2018 accordingly there have been recent studies using cfd simulations to investigate the roughness effect on ship resistance e g demirel et al 2014 demirel et al 2017b farkas et al 2018 farkas et al 2019 song et al 2019a and propeller performance owen et al 2018 song et al 2019b 2020a as well as ship self propulsion characteristics song et al 2020b farkas et al 2020a recently song et al 2020c extended the validation of the roughness modelling in cfd by comparing their method which had been only validated against flat plates before with a model ship towing test of song et al 2020d the findings of demirel et al 2017b and song et al 2019a are especially important as their results suggest that the hull roughness does affect not only the ship frictional resistance but also the other resistance components e g the viscous pressure resistance and wave making resistance this is certainly notable since it had been widely believed that the roughness effect on the wave making resistance is negligible e g carchen et al 2019 however these findings cannot be generalised as these studies were conducted only for a single type of hull form kcs considering that the ship hydrodynamic behaviours vary with different ship types and dimensions the roughness effect can also vary with different ship forms recently farkas et al 2019 observed differences in the roughness effect on the form factors and the nominal wake between two different ship types i e container ship and bulk carrier also it is well established that the form factors of ships change by scales garcı a gómez 2000 min and kang 2010 van et al 2011 dogrul et al 2020 in this context it is worth investigating the roughness effect on the ship hydrodynamic characteristics of different ships with variations of the scales and speeds to the best of the authors knowledge there exists no specific study investigating the roughness effect on the ship resistance of different hull forms with different scales and speeds therefore the aim of this study is to fill this gap by performing a series of cfd simulations of different hull forms in different scales and speeds in this study unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans based ship models of a container ship and a tanker were developed each vessel was modelled in three different scales namely model scale moderate scale and full scale the modified wall function approach was used with the roughness function of barnacles determined by demirel et al 2017a to represent the surface roughness of barnacle fouling the simulations of each vessel kcs and kvlcc2 in different scales were performed with a range of speeds finally the effect of biofouling on ship resistance components form factor and flow characteristics around the hulls were investigated 2 background 2 1 roughness function and modified wall function approach the surface roughness causes an increase in turbulence hence the skin friction increases the roughness effect can be observed as a downward shift of the mean velocity profile in the turbulent boundary layer this downward shift is termed as the roughness function u the non dimensional velocity profile in the log law region for a rough surface is then given as 1 u 1 k i n y where u is the mean velocity at the normal distance y from the wall u τ is the friction velocity defined as τ w ρ τ w is the wall shear stress υ is the kinematic viscosity defined as the ratio of dynamic viscosity to the fluid density μ ρ κ is the von karman constant and β is the log low intercept the roughness function u can be expressed as a function of the roughness reynolds number κ defined as 2 k κ u τ υ it should be noted that fxsimply vanishes in the case of a smooth condition demirel et al 2017a determined the roughness function of barnacles through towing tests of a flat plate covered with artificial barnacle patches with varying sizes small medium and big and coverages 10 50 from the experimental results they observed that the roughness functions of the barnacles follow the colebrook type roughness function model of grigson 1992 as shown in fig 1 given by 3 u 1 κ ι n 1 κ in this study three representative surface conditions s20 m20 and b20 were selectively used for the simulations rather than including all the surface conditions of demirel et al 2017a table 1 shows the roughness length scales for the fouling conditions used in this study recently song et al 2019a employed this roughness function into the wall function in the cfd model and conducted simulations of a towed flat plate to validate the modified wall function approach the simulation results showed good agreement with the experiment of demirel et al 2017a in this study the same modified wall function approach with the same roughness function is used to investigate the effect of barnacles on kcs and kvlcc2 2 2 resistance components the total resistance r t of a ship can be divided into two main components the frictional resistance r f and the residuary resistance r r given by 4 r t r f r r the frictional resistance arises from the friction between the fluid and the hull surface while the residuary resistance is a pressure related resistance consisting of viscous pressure resistance r v p and wave making resistance r w given by 5 r t r f r v p r w the viscous pressure or also known as form drag is broadly assumed to be proportional to the frictional resistance lewis 1988 with the use of form factor κ as given 6 r v p κ r f 7 r t 1 κ r f r w the resistance components can be normalised by dividing each term by the dynamic pressure 1 2 ρ v 2 and the wetted surface area of the ship hull s the resistance coefficients can be defined as 8 c t c f c r 9 c t c f c v p c w 10 c t 1 κ c f c w where c t c f and c r is the coefficient of the total frictional and residuary resistance respectively 3 numerical modelling 3 1 governing equations and physical modelling the proposed cfd models were developed based on the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans method using a commercial cfd software package star ccm version 13 06 the second order upwind convection scheme and a first order temporal discretisation were used for the momentum equations the overall solution procedure was based on a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple type algorithm the shear stress transport sst κ ω turbulence model was used to predict the effects of turbulence which combines the advantages of the κ ω and the κ ε turbulence model menter 1994 a second order convection scheme was used for the equations of the turbulent model for the simulations where the free surface exists the volume of fluid vof method was used with high resolution interface capturing hric 3 2 geometry and boundary conditions in order to investigate the effect of biofouling on different ships the benchmark ship hulls of a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 were used for the cfd simulations figs 2 and 3 show the hull geometries of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively while tables 2 and 3 depict the principal particulars of these vessels as shown in the figures and the tables kcs represents a fast container ship with a sharp bow shape a slender hull form and a relatively shallow draught i e c b 0 65 f n 0 26 l p p t 21 30 whereas kvlcc2 represents a slow tanker with a fuller bow shape and hull form and a relatively deep draught i e c b 0 81 fx 0 14 fx 15 38 table 4 shows the simulation cases used in this study each vessel was modelled in two different computational domain types namely double body and free surface models for the purpose of decomposing the resistance components in a double body simulation the free surface is replaced by the symmetry boundary condition such that there is no wave making behaviour and hence there exist only the viscous resistance i e r t r v r f r v p on the other hand the free surface simulations have the free surface and hence consider the wave making behaviours such that the wave making resistance is included in the total ship resistance i e r t r f r v p r w the double body simulations were modelled in three different scales i e model scale moderate scale and full scale while the free surface simulations were modelled only in the full scales of the vessel in order to examine the effect of different ship speeds the simulations were conducted at froude number ranges of 0 130 0 282 for kcs and 0 083 0 156 for kvlcc2 at each scale fig 4 illustrates the computational domain and the boundary conditions of the double body and free surface simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 in terms of the free surface simulations the velocity inlet and the pressure outlet boundary conditions were applied for the opposite faces in the longitudinal direction the top and bottom far field boundaries were defined as velocity inlet symmetry boundary conditions were used for the vertical centre and side wall boundaries as similarly used by terziev et al 2019a the surface boundary conditions of the hull and rudder were defined as no slip walls for the smooth surface condition the smooth type wall function was used whereas the rough type roughness functions including the additional term of the roughness function were used for the fouling cases the difference for the double body simulations is that the z 0 plane is replaced with a symmetry plane such the simulation does not have the free surface it is of note that all the simulations were conducted in fixed conditions i e no sink or trim motions were allowed 3 3 mesh generation cut cell grids with prism layer mesh on the walls were generated using the built in meshing tool of star ccm version 13 06 local refinements were made for finer grids in the critical regions such as the bulbous bow rudder stern and the region near the free surface in case of the free surface simulations as shown in fig 5 the thickness of the first layer cell on the surface was chosen such that the wall y values are higher than 30 and also higher than the k values as recommended by demirel et al 2017b and siemens 2018 it is of note that the same mesh was used for all the smooth and rough surface conditions including the near wall refinement the mean wall y values at the design speed on the wetted surface area of the model moderate and full scale kcs simulations were 39 63 and 205 respectively while those for kvlcc2 simulations were 66 52 and 93 respectively 4 results 4 1 verification and validation 4 1 1 verification study in order to estimate the numerical uncertainties of the cfd models and also to determine the sufficient grid spacings and the time step size δ t a verification study was performed by conducting the simulations with three different resolutions of mesh and time steps namely fine medium and coarse then the spatial and temporal uncertainties u g r i d and u δ t were estimated using the grid convergence index gci method celik et al 2008 it is of note that although the gci method was firstly proposed for spatial convergence studies it can also be used to estimate the temporal uncertainties of the simulations tezdogan et al 2015 terziev et al 2018 2019b 2020 tables 5 and 6 show the spatial and temporal uncertainties of the kcs and kvlcc simulations obtained from the grid and time step convergence study the spatial and temporal uncertainties were calculated based on the fine mesh and the fine time step for each case in this study the fine mesh and fine time step were used for each case 4 1 2 validation study in order to validate the cfd models used in this study the total resistance coefficients c t obtained from the free surface simulations were compared with c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 at the design speed although the free surface simulations with fouling conditions were modelled only at the full scale model scale free surface simulations were additionally conducted in this subsection to be compared against the model test of kim et al 2001 full scale c t values were compared with other full scale cfd studies available from the literature as well as the extrapolated c t values based on the experimental data of kim et al 2001 it is of note that the c t of kcs was extrapolated using froude s 2d scaling while that of kvlcc2 was extrapolated using hughes 3d scaling as per the suggestion of dogrul et al 2020 the c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 from the different sources and methods are shown in tables 7 and 8 respectively the relative differences were calculated using the current cfd results as the reference values the model scale results for kcs and kvlcc2 showed good agreement with the experimental data of kim et al 2001 showing the relative differences of 0 35 and 1 59 respectively in terms of full scale simulations both the kcs and kvlcc2 results from the present cfd showed good agreement with other full scale cfd results in the literature showing relative differences up to 1 25 however the current kvlcc2 simulation showed a rather large difference with the extrapolated result 4 69 as similarly observed by dogrul et al 2020 and farkas et al 2020b 4 2 roughness effect on c f and c v in order to investigate the roughness effect on the frictional resistance c f and viscous resistance c v the double body simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 were performed as mentioned earlier the total resistance of the vessels calculated in the double body simulations is assumed to be equal to the viscous resistance i e c t c v while c f is calculated by simply considering the shear drag only in the simulations figs 6 and 7 show the c f and c v values obtained from the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations respectively in different surface conditions smooth s20 m20 and b20 as shown in the figures the c f and c v values increase significantly due to the hull fouling for the kcs cases the percentage increase in the frictional resistance δ c f with the most severe fouling condition b20 are up to 93 89 and 86 at the model moderate and full scales respectively and those of kvlcc2 are 79 74 and 69 one can notice that the δ c f values are larger for kcs than kvlcc2 while these values become smaller as the ship length increases this can be explained by two factors the relative roughness height k l and the roughness reynolds number k k u τ ν where k u τ and ν are the roughness height friction velocity and the kinematic viscosity respectively it is a well known fact that the skin friction over a rough wall increases with the k l values moody 1944 demirel et al 2019 therefore even with the same fouling condition the roughness effect on c f is stronger for smaller vessels due to the larger k l ratios on the other hand considering the significant changes in ship lengths the changes in δ c f with the scale is relatively small for example while the ship length of kvlcc2 increases 58 times i e the k l ratio becomes 58 times smaller the δ c f reduces by 10 only this can be attributed to the fact that the k values increase due to the increasing ship speeds with the scale at the same f n therefore higher k values result in stronger roughness effects in the turbulent boundary layer which diminishes the decreasing trends of δ c f due to the rapid changes in the k l ratio fig 8 compares the k values on the hull of kcs and kvlcc2 at their design speed constant f n with the b20 fouling condition the k values appear to be higher with larger scales and also higher for kcs due to the higher speeds when it comes to the viscous resistance c v similar trends were observed for the kcs cases the percentage increase in the viscous resistance δ c v due to the most severe fouling condition b20 are up to 88 87 and 84 at the model moderate and full scales respectively and those of kvlcc2 are 78 74 and 71 it can also be found that the differences between c v and c f are larger for kvlcc2 than kcs including the smooth surface condition which signifies larger viscous pressure resistance c v p and hence larger form factor values 1 k 4 3 roughness effect on form factor 1 k fig 9 compares the form factors 1 k of kcs and kvlcc2 with the different surface conditions the 1 k values were calculated using the c f and c v values obtained from the double body simulations as 1 k c v c f as shown in the figure the roughness effect of barnacles on the 1 k values showed different trends for kcs and kvlcc2 for the kcs cases the 1 k values decrease due to hull fouling and these decreases become more significant as the hull size increases the reduction in the form factor implies that the increase due to hull fouling is more significant for c f than c v p on the other hand differences were found in the kvlcc2 cases although the roughness effect on the 1 k values of kvlcc2 showed a different trend at each scale in the model scale λ 58 the 1 k values increase with the presence of hull fouling the roughness effect on 1 k become minor at the moderate scale λ 10 and finally the 1 k values decrease at the full scale λ 58 these different trends indicate that the roughness effect of c v p is more significant than that of c f at small scales but the effect of c f becomes dominant as the hull size increases which agrees with the kcs cases these differences in the roughness effect on the form factors can be more clearly seen in fig 10 which compares the percentage increase in the frictional and viscous pressure resistance components δ c f and δ c v p the y x line was drawn together for comparison which indicates that δ c f and δ c v p are equal along the line for kcs the results shown in fig 10 are located under the y x line which means that the roughness effect of c f dominates to that of c v p and the results move to the right bottom side as the scale increases suggesting that this dominance becomes stronger with larger hull sizes when it comes to the kvlcc2 case the results for the model scale λ 58 simulation are found above the y x line showing the dominance of the roughness effect of c v p over c f but move to the right bottom side of the graph as the scale increases similarly to the kcs case the general trend in these differences can be summarised that as the scale increases the roughness effect of c f becomes more important than that of c v p for both the vessels 4 4 free surface simulations 4 4 1 roughness effect on c t in order to investigate the roughness effect on the total resistance c t full scale free surface simulations of kcs and kvlcc2 were conducted with varying speeds for the smooth and fouling s20 m20 b20 surface conditions figs 11 and 12 show the c t values of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with and without the presence of hull fouling significant increases in c t were recorded for both the ships the percentage increases δ c t due to the most severe fouling condition b20 for kcs and kvlcc2 were up to 66 and 78 respectively it is interesting to note that the kvlcc2 case shows higher δ c t values although they have smaller δ c f as shown in section 4 2 this can be explained by the fact that kvlcc2 has a higher contribution of the frictional resistance in the total resistance than kcs due to slower speed lower f n another interesting feature is to note that the δ c t values of kcs show a decreasing trend with the ship speed while those of kvlcc2 show the opposite in order to find the rationale behind these differences the total resistance components were divided into different components and discussed in the following sections 4 4 2 roughness effect on c f and c r the total resistance coefficients c t were decomposed into the frictional resistance coefficients c f and the residuary resistance coefficients c r by simply dividing the total drag acting on the ship into the shear and pressure force components figs 13 and 14 show the c f and c r values of the full scale kcs and kvlcc2 models respectively in the smooth and fouled s20 m20 b20 hull conditions it is of note that the c f values in figs 13 and 14 are from the free surface simulations and these values can be slightly different 1 form the c f values of the double body simulations figs 6 and 7 mainly because of the changes in the wetted surface area due to free surface elevations both the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations showed significant increases in c f due to the hull fouling as already observed in figs 6 and 7 while some differences were observed on c r of kcs and kvlcc2 the c r values of kvlcc2 show significant increases due to the hull fouling and these increases are consistent with the varying speeds on the other hand the c r values of kcs showed relatively small increases with hull fouling at low speed these increases become smaller as the speed increases and eventually turn into decreases at higher speeds together with this feature the increasing dominance of c r in c t for the kcs case can be related to the decreasing δ c t values of kcs as the speed increases as shown in fig 11 in order to understand the rationale of the changing trends of the roughness effect on c r the residuary resistance values were further decomposed into the viscous pressure resistance c v p and the wave making resistance c w and discussed in the following section 4 4 3 roughness effect on c vp and c w the c r values were decomposed into c v p and c w using the form factor values obtained from the double body simulations as 11 c v p k c f 12 c w c r c v p figs 15 and 16 show the c v p and c w values of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with the smooth and fouled s20 m20 b20 hull conditions in terms of c v p both the kcs and kvlcc2 cases show significant increases due to the hull fouling up to 52 and 74 for kcs and kvlcc2 respectively on the other hand differences were also found on c w between the two hull types for the kcs case the c w values have relatively high contributions in c r and increase sharply as the speed increases and eventually become dominant over c v p the roughness effect on the c w values of kcs is negligible at the lowest speed but becomes more pronounced as the ship speed increases which can be related to the higher k values at higher speeds the c w values of kcs show decreases due to hull fouling and the magnitudes of decrease become larger as the dominance of c w increases consequently for the fouled kcs cases the decreases in c w cancel the increases in c v p and eventually the c r values start to decrease at higher speeds on the other hand the c w values of kvlcc2 have minor contributions and remain rather consistent with the speed accordingly for kvlcc2 the roughness effect on c r follows the trend of c v p it is interesting that at the high speeds the roughness effect causes increases in c w unlike the kcs case however these changes in c w are too small i e δ c w c t 0 5 to draw any reliable conclusion on their effects considering that the estimated numerical uncertainty of c t of the free surface kvlcc2 simulation is larger than these changes u total 0 78 it is of note that the numerical uncertainty of the c w values u c w c w c t u c t 2 c w c v u c v 2 u c t 2 u c v 2 for the kcs and kvlcc2 simulations at the design speeds are 2 36 and 54 6 respectively this observation suggests that the roughness effect on the wave making resistance can differ by the hull forms and also by the speed these differences can be correlated with many different factors e g the block coefficient and the froude number f n further investigations with sufficient variations are required to understand better the correlations between these factors and the roughness effect on c w 4 5 roughness effect on the flow field 4 5 1 velocity field figs 17 and 18 show the axial velocity contours around the kcs and kvlcc2 hulls respectively in different scales with the smooth surface conditions and the most severe fouling conditions b20 the mean axial velocity was normalised by dividing the velocity with the advance speed of the ship v x v s h i p as shown in the figures for both the hull forms at the respective scales the roughness effect brings significant changes in the velocity field around the hulls as expected the smaller sizes with fouling showed larger wake regions due to the decelerated flow velocity at the stern the roughness effect on the wake field can be more clearly seen in fig 19 which compares the axial velocity contours behind the hull on the propeller plane x 0 0175 l p p in order to quantify the increases in the stern wake the nominal wake fractions w n were calculated by surface averaging the local wake fraction w x v s h i p v x v s h i p on the propeller disc i e the disc where the propeller will be located figs 20 and 21 compare the w n of the kcs and kvlcc2 respectively with the smooth and most severe fouling conditions b20 the inner and outer circles represent the hub diameter and propeller diameter for both the hull forms the hull fouling resulted in significant increases in the w n values the percentage increases in the w n of kcs due to the hull fouling at the model moderate and the full scale are 53 54 and 45 while those for the kvlcc2 case are 35 43 and 43 4 5 2 boundary layer thickness another notable feature of the fouling effect is observed in figs 17 and 18 is the increase in the boundary layer thickness especially on the hull bottom as well as on the aft end region the increases in the boundary layer thicknesses can be seen more clearly in figs 22 and 23 where the boundary layers are represented by the axial velocity contours limited to v x v s h i p 0 9 the figures vividly show the growth in the boundary layer thickness due to the hull fouling b20 for both the ships at all the scales these arguments in the boundary layer thickness that can be related to the presence of hull fouling reflect on to the frictional and viscous pressure resistance as discussed earlier 4 5 3 pressure field figs 24 and 25 illustrate the surface pressure distribution on the stern region of kcs and kvlcc2 respectively in both the smooth and fouled b20 conditions the pressure was normalised by dividing it by the dynamic pressure 1 2 ρ v s h i p 2 for both the ship types in all the scales reduced pressure magnitudes at the stern were observed with the presence of surface fouling i e reduced pressure recovery correspondingly the decreased stern pressures bring increased viscous pressure resistances as shown in figs 15 and 16 4 5 4 wave elevation fig 26 compares the kelvin wave around the kcs hull with and without the surface fouling at low and high speeds while considerable differences were observed between the smooth and fouled b20 hulls at the high speed f n 0 282 almost no effects were noted at the low speed f n 0 13 these speed dependant effects of the roughness on the wave elevations are in agreement with those on the wave making resistance c w of kcs as shown in fig 16 where the effect was negligible at the low speed whereas the effect becomes substantial as the speed increases likewise as shown in fig 27 the roughness effect on the kelvin wave around the kvlcc2 showed correspondences with the roughness effect on the c w values also shown in fig 17 for both the low and high speeds the free surface elevations around the kvlcc2 hull showed almost no differences regardless of the presence of hull fouling 4 5 5 concluding remarks in the study presented here urans based cfd simulation models of two different types of hulls and sizes were developed to investigate the effect of the ship type and scales on the resistances of these ships in the presence of fouling the cfd simulations were performed using the benchmark ship hulls of a container ship kcs and a tanker kvlcc2 for the representation of the roughness effect due to hull fouling the modified wall function approach was used with the roughness function of barnacles spatial and temporal convergence studies were performed using the grid convergence index gci method to estimate the numerical uncertainties of the proposed cfd models and to determine sufficient grid spacings and time steps by using two different computational domain types i e double body and free surface the ship resistance was decomposed into its individual components the results showed that the hull fouling causes significant increases in the frictional resistance and the viscous resistance regardless of the hull forms and scales i e sizes on the other hand while the form factors of kvlcc2 showed a different trend at each scale those of kcs consistently showed decreases with hull fouling differences between the effects of the hull types were also found through the roughness effect on the wave making resistance whereas the wave making resistance of kvlcc2 showed almost no differences regardless of the presence of the hull fouling kcs showed considerable roughness effects on the wave making resistance at the high speed in contrast this effect was negligible at the low speed of kcs finally the effect of hull fouling on the flow characteristics around the hulls was examined that included the velocity field downstream of the hulls and nominal wake flow at the propeller planes boundary layer thickness and pressure distribution on the hulls and the kelvin wave patterns the study provided several important findings including the first investigation into the different features of roughness effect for different hull forms ship size and speeds however to establish a more comprehensive understanding of the correlations of the roughness effect with various factors such as block coefficient froude number etc the study should be further extended with sufficient variations of hull forms scales and speeds credit authorship contribution statement soonseok song writing original draft formal analysis investigation validation
