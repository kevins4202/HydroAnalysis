result energy conservation as well as carbon dioxide emission reduction have become hot subjects around the world despite being the world s most populous country china s per capita resource share is lower than worldwide average which is worse than other countries and the carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gdp will be 18 lower by 2020 than 2015 li et al 2018 overall carbon emissions will be well controlled and specific regions carbon dioxide emissions will peak first chen et al 2018 since the first publication in 1993 the issue of greenhouse gas ghg emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs has been focused on worldwide particularly in canada brazil and united states khadom et al 2020 however the size of the global ghg discharge from reservoirs is still up for debate which is around 2 of worldwide carbon emissions from inland waters sun et al 2021 ghg emissions tend to decrease as reservoir latitude and age increase another essential factor to consider when considering internal source of carbon emissions is initial organic carbon in flooded areas despite their importance and unpredictability many locations currently lack measurable co2 emissions from reservoirs leaving a crucial gap in global co2 budgets one of the most frequent methods is the statistical regression method which uses regression equations to show the link between co2 emissions and factors unlike conventional methods which require environmental inputs a mathematical approach based on notion of soc was used to extrapolate values from one reservoir to another directly because these pioneering models had low

forecasting method based on rough set grey prediction methodand svm method to anticipate carbon emissions from 2012 to 2017 findings suggest that combined strategy can accurately predict china s future carbon emissions in comparison to nns svm and other algorithms elm requires simply the configuration of the network structure making it easier to use the elm is essentially a hidden layer nn method with a single hidden layer weights of input layer to hidden layer are determined at random in the meantime during the execution of the technique no adjustments are required and weights from

examined fig 1 depicts the entire proposed architecture of course the necessity to avoid co2 production is due to ghg emissions co2 admits the sun s rays in but prevents heat radiation from re emerging similar to how glass in a greenhouse prevents heat radiation from re emerging as a result greenhouse gases heat the entire earth on the other hand extra million tonnes of co2 gas discharged into the atmosphere appears to be upsetting the natural balance table 1 illustrates the co2 emissions by region around world developing countries are experiencing a more significant increase in global

global emissions from 2007 to 2035 global energy related carbon dioxide emissions were enhanced by an average of 1 3 per year because human carbon dioxide emissions are predominantly caused by combustion of fossil fuels world energy usage remains at the core of the climate change discussion the only concern with sustainable energy is reducing human emissions renewable energy rather than fossil energy has been found as the only long term energy source for a stable future earth traditional biomass which is primarily utilized for developing nations as well as space heating in cold climates accounts for around 9 of total energy consumption and is dropping in some places as biomass energy is utilized significantly or replaced by modern energy sources new renewables account for 2

including an input layer hidden layer s and output layer srnns with one hidden layer are thought to be capable of describing any finite non linear connection with acceptable performance every layer has multiple neurons that transmit input values as well as processed by a set of weights before being passed on to next layer a model training set of four categories of energy consumption and carbon emissions data from 2000 to 2010 was utilized as well as method test set of data from 2011 to 2016 was employed best regular coefficients as well as kernel function parameters were discovered after a

activation function determining the output value step sigmoid and linear functions were used as representative activation functions bp was used to alter the appropriate weights in the learning process the dnn model is frequently used in place of mathematical models to address non theoretical issues like pattern recognition classification and prediction backpropagation is a supervised learning approach for learning nn in which the signals are propagated both forward and backward the lma levenberg marquardt algorithm is commonly utilized as a learning function of the dnn model the lma is a nonlinear least squares problem solution algorithm according to optimization the link weight and bias values are updated a dnn model is proposed to evaluate the heating energy consumption of historic dwellings in this study the procedure of selecting important input variables setting initial method conditions optimization was used to construct a dnn method for predicting heating energy usage in ancient houses the model s prediction accuracy is influenced by the major input variables chosen if input variables are chosen poorly technique prediction accuracy may suffer as a result identify the

picking the most appropriate structural variables and parameters impacting learning speed from initial nn method to enhance model s predictive performance is known as model optimization simulation in range of number of hidden layers 1 10 and number of neurons in hidden layers with high prediction accuracy r2 value for the selected key input variables influence of settings that alter simulation s learning speed was not considered in this investigation 4 performance analysis age mean depth and npp0 were the factors with the highest absolute value of correlation coefficient but the lowest value of significance coefficient furthermore earlier research has identified latitude as a crucial component and the sample size provided is enough as a result latitude is considered as an input and the reasonableness is checked using sensitivity analysis the association between these characteristics does not need to be investigated because they are independent as a result four characteristics were chosen as alternative input variables for co2 prediction methods only reservoir data with adequate and available records for the four parameters were used otherwise this data collection would be discarded following the deletion of the incorrect data a dataset consisting of 251 data sets was chosen for simulation dataset description the majority of co2 emission fluxes from reservoir surfaces

learning speed was not considered in this investigation 4 performance analysis age mean depth and npp0 were the factors with the highest absolute value of correlation coefficient but the lowest value of significance coefficient furthermore earlier research has identified latitude as a crucial component and the sample size provided is enough as a result latitude is considered as an input and the reasonableness is checked using sensitivity analysis the association between these characteristics does not need to be investigated because they are independent as a result four characteristics were chosen as alternative input variables for co2 prediction methods only reservoir data with adequate and available records for the four parameters were used otherwise this data collection would be discarded following the deletion of the incorrect data a dataset consisting of 251 data sets was chosen for simulation dataset description the majority of co2 emission fluxes from reservoir surfaces

24316,error propagation is an important consideration in individual based modeling but it has been considered insufficiently studied we investigated the propagation of error due to uncertainty in initial conditions using a previously published spatially explicit individual based model that simulates infestation of sorghum by an invasive pest aphid melanaphis sorghi theobald sorghum aphid previously published as sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner we initialized the model with aphids in three alternative initial infestation locations using one of three neighboring cells and analyzed the resulting model outputs in three pairwise scenario comparisons the spatio temporal patterns of aphid infestation as estimated by timing and probability of first infestation were statistically significantly different between the scenarios but the differences were locally restricted and scenario dependent in particular the two pairwise differences between scenarios originating from neighboring cells indicated that error propagation through the studied system depends not only on the physical distance between the alternative initialization cells i e the extent of the initial spatial uncertainty but also on the actual location of the model initialization cells likely reflecting differences in the environmental characteristics of those locations despite the statistical significance the differences were small from the perspective of practical application with few highly localized exceptions the spatio temporal trajectories of the propagating error indicate that within the examined range the spatial uncertainty in model initialization has a low effect on the timing and probability of first infestation and the propagation of the error in the observed variables is limited by the system itself keywords error propagation individual based model initialization error integrated model uncertainty in initial condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction error propagation is one of the challenges faced by individual based modelers grimm and railsback 2005 uncertainty in individual based model parameterization may propagate through the system resulting in high uncertainty at the system level grimm and railsback 2005 prediction errors that result from the lack of knowledge of the initial state of a system may exceed an acceptable level and thus may limit the ability to predict the state of the system lorenz 1969 considering initially small errors that may propagate through the system in time lorenz 1969 distinguished three potential trajectories 1 error does not increase through time 2 error increases through time but can be made arbitrarily small if the initial error is made sufficiently small however it will become large in a distant future unless it is zero and 3 error increases through time and there is a threshold below which it cannot be reduced regardless of the extent of the initial error unpredictable system level effects of small initial errors appear to be of particular concern in system of systems modeling iwanaga et al 2021 in which the error may propagate through interactions between the constituent models iwanaga et al 2021 similarly in case of integrated models in which model complexity may increase due to the integration of existing models uncertainty in one integration component may propagate through the entire system voinov and shugart 2013 this effect may be amplified across scales iwanaga et al 2021 lippe et al 2019 nevertheless in case of individual based models propagation of error due to small changes in parameter values that are then magnified through system s interactions seems to be rarely of serious concern grimm and railsback 2005 mooij and deangelis 2003 showed that uncertainty may impact spatially explicit dispersal models less than simpler models given that information on landscape details is used by the model mooij and deangelis 2003 pattern oriented modeling grimm et al 1996 in which error propagation is constrained by the match between modeled and observed patterns has been proposed as a viable solution wiegand et al 2003 however investigations of error propagation merit further attention grimm and railsback 2005 parker et al 2003 particularly when only a small number of individuals are represented in the model system level effects that result from the uncertainty in initial conditions have been investigated by some authors for instance mooij and deangelis 1999 found no strong effect of dispersal mortality error on the dispersal success in a simple spatially explicit population model for organisms dispersing in a fragmented landscape ruckelshaus et al 1997 deutschman et al 1999 investigated community level behavior of sortie a northeastern forest individual based simulation model pacala et al 1993 pacala et al 1996 with respect to details in calculation of a local resource light they found that the precision of light measurement was important at the level of individual tree but at large spatio temporal scales i e at the forest level the level of detail of light availability became unimportant and thus the emergent forest dynamics did not depend on the local resource dubé et al 2001 investigated the impact of differences in initial seedling distribution in sortie they found that the spatio temporal behavior of canopy gaps was stable in the long term however they observed subtle local differences between replicates and noted that different seedling distributions can lead to transient dynamics that vary between initial conditions despite the similar long term dynamics dubé et al 2001 similarly no strong or unpredictable error propagation was found in the study on instream railsback and harvey 2001 an individual based model of trout in the stream environment although the model was sensitive to some parameters there was no evidence of strong error propagation and the model predicted ranking of watershed actions to produce greatest biomass was robust to parameter uncertainty cunningham 2007 harvey and railsback 2007 here we used a previously developed spatially explicit individual based model that simulates sorghum aphid melanaphis sorghi theobald previously published as sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner hemiptera aphididae brewer et al 2022 infestation of sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench poales poaceae in the great plains of north america wang et al 2019 during simulations the model tracks environmental conditions including availability of sorghum and atmospheric conditions in each landscape cell within the modeled landscape moreover selected cells are initialized with aphids at the beginning of each simulation our objective was to investigate the impact of minimum spatial initialization uncertainty on the model output in space and time we compared three infestation scenarios in which the model was initialized in one of three landscape cells in the southernmost area of the modeled landscape we were interested in the resulting differences in all season timing and probability of infestation as well as in spatio temporal dynamics of the differences in probability of infestation of previously uninfested cells therefore following lorenz 1969 we defined pairwise differences in the emerging patterns as errors our hypothesis was that the error inherent in the estimate of the initial infestation location and in subsequent mapping of that location to the modeled landscape cell 1 will propagate through the modeled space and time and 2 will propagate differently for different scenarios 2 methods 2 1 summary of model description the model of wang et al 2019 is a spatially explicit individual based model that simulates sorghum aphid infestations of sorghum fields spatial domain of the model includes southern to central great plains of north america kansas oklahoma and texas of the united states where the majority of us sorghum is grown the study region is divided into landscape cells of the size of 0 5 longitude by 0 5 latitude temporal extent of the model is one year which encompasses one sorghum growing season and the temporal resolution is one day the regional sorghum aphid infestations of sorghum fields are modeled by integrating two modeling components that represent terrestrial and aeroecological parts of the model these components regularly exchange information during model execution koralewski et al 2019 the terrestrial component of the model was custom written in the netlogo programming environment wilensky 1999 and represents the phenological development of sorghum sorghum growth and stages of sorghum aphid life cycle development dispersal and colonization aphids are small and weak fliers and thus their aerial movement is largely controlled by wind consequently they are considered inert air particles in the model therefore the aeroecological component of the model that represents long distance aphid migration and deposition aeroecological stage of the aphid life cycle was modeled using hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model stein et al 2015 a broadly used atmospheric transport and dispersion model the integrated model was parameterized and calibrated using 2017 weather and sorghum data wang et al 2019 in the baseline scenario the model was initialized by aphid infestations on march 28 2017 day of year 87 in seven landscape cells in rio grande valley of texas that represented the initial infestation of sorghum in the region by aphids 2 2 data generation in this study we used the model of wang et al 2019 to investigate propagation of small model initialization error through the modeled system we assumed that the initialization error was spatial in nature i e it resulted from uncertainty in the localization of the initial infestation in the rio grande valley of texas this assumption is consistent with the spatially variable nature of the sorghum aphid in this sorghum system brewer et al 2022 since the spatial resolution of the model of wang et al 2019 is one cell we selected the three southernmost neighboring landscape cells cell 206 235 and 264 out of the seven cells that were used for model initialization by wang et al 2019 we initialized the model with aphids in one of the three cells on march 28 2017 day of year 87 we ran 1000 simulations for each of the three scenarios scenario s 206 s 235 and s 264 3000 simulation runs in total to mitigate stochastic differences between replicates particularly in cells with low infestation probability because we initialized the model in one cell as opposed to seven cells in wang et al 2019 the spatiotemporal patterns derived here are not directly comparable with those derived previously moreover since we retained the original model calibration the model output may or may not be an appropriate representation of the actual aphid spread throughout the region instead alternative model initialization allowed us to investigate propagation of the known initial spatial deviation through the modeled space and time the study region and the landscape cells in which sorghum was planted during 2017 are shown in fig 1 2 3 analysis we defined first infestation as an event when a previously uninfested cell becomes newly infested with aphids we defined the day of first infestation dinf as day of year on which first infestation occurred considering the entire sorghum growing season analogously we defined the probability of first infestation pinf as probability that first infestation occurs within a considered time frame we estimated dinf for each cell by calculating the median using data from those simulation runs in which the cell was infested moreover for each cell we counted the number of simulation runs in which the cell was infested at any time during the entire season equal to the number of simulation runs in which the cell became first infested at some point in time during the entire season we then repeated the counting process using a moving window approach non overlapping 14 day time frames from day of year 89 to day of year 289 fifteen intervals the last interval was 5 days long which corresponded to the earliest and the latest day respectively when new infestations occurred due to within model aphid migration only first infestations that occurred within a given time frame were counted we estimated pinf of a given cell as a proportion of simulation runs during which a cell became first infested we used the pinf notation for both all season and moving window estimates the three cells used for model initialization cell 206 235 and 264 were removed from analysis which resulted in a total number of 420 landscape cells where aphid infestations could potentially occur we compared the three scenarios pairwise s 206 vs s 235 s 206 vs s 264 and s 235 vs s 264 by calculating pairwise differences in dinf and in pinf for each cell δdinf and δpinf respectively a positive δdinf or δpinf value indicates a higher dinf or pinf value respectively in the first of the two compared scenarios we then applied the syrjala s test syrjala 1996 and computed the getis ord gi statistic getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 syrjala s test is a test for a difference between spatial distributions of two populations with the nonparametric null hypothesis that the two compared distributions are the same syrjala 1996 getis ord gi statistic is a measure of spatial association at the local level getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 to compare scenarios pairwise with regard to all season dinf we retained only those cells that were infested in at least one simulation run in both compared scenarios to compare scenarios pairwise with regard to all season pinf and moving window pinf we retained only those cells that were first infested in at least one simulation run in at least one of the two compared scenarios within a considered time frame we calculated δdinf and δpinf for each retained cell and applied syrjala s test syrjala 1996 using the r package ecespa v 1 1 13 de la cruz rot 2008 designed for spatial point pattern analysis we used the function syrjala that implements the syrjala s test we used the cramer von mises test statistic and the number of permutations nperm was set to 1000 to identify areas where two compared scenarios differed we calculated the getis ord gi statistic getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 using the function localg from the r package spdep v 1 1 7 bivand and wong 2018 bivand et al 2013 with the critical values of the statistic provided by ord and getis 1995 the package spdep provides among other functions a collection of tests for spatial autocorrelation analysis and the function localg calculates the statistics gi and gi prior to running the function localg we assigned neighbors to each cell using the functions dnearneigh and include self package spdep the maximum distance between centroids of the neighboring cells was set to 0 71 which allowed for maximum of nine neighbors including self and assigned spatial weights using the function nb2listw package spdep in case of δdinf and δpinf statistically significant positive gi values indicate areas where cells with high δdinf or high δpinf values dominate whereas statistically significant negative gi values indicate the contrary moreover for cells retained in a given scenario in each pairwise comparison we calculated moving window median pinf with the corresponding 25th and 75th percentiles we analyzed simulation output data assuming significance level α 0 05 and generated plots using r v 3 6 2 r core team 2019 we generated maps with differences in dinf and in pinf and with the corresponding getis ord gi statistic using the r package maps v 3 3 0 brownrigg et al 2018 designed to draw geographical maps 2 4 definition of error we define error ε to represent differences in the occurrence of first infestations and to investigate dynamics of these differences through time the probability of first infestation pinf of cell cm in scenario si during time frame tk is p i n f s i t k c m n s i t k c m n s i where for scenario si n si tk cm is the number of simulation runs in which cell cm became first infested during time frame tk and n si is the total number of simulation runs here n si 1000 analogously considering only those simulation runs in scenario si during which cell cm became first infested we define the proportion of simulation runs finf in which cell cm became first infested during time frame tk as f i n f s i t k c m n s i t k c m n s i c m where for scenario si n si cm is the number of simulation runs during which cell cm became first infested n si cm n si we define narrow sense error εn between scenarios si and sj i j within a given time frame tk as the median difference δ n in finf ε n s i s j t k δ n s i s j t k where δ n s i s j t k c m f i n f s i t k c m f i n f s j t k c m similarly broad sense error εb between scenarios si and sj i j within a given time frame tk is the median difference δ b in pinf ε b s i s j t k δ b s i s j t k where δ b s i s j t k c m p i n f s i t k c m p i n f s j t k c m in the case of our study i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 k 89 102 103 116 285 289 and m 1 2 420 the narrow sense error εn represents differences through time in distribution of all first infestations that occurred during the season the broad sense error εb accounts additionally for the overall susceptibility of the cell to become infested throughout the season that could be influenced by environmental factors 3 results the analysis allowed tracking the propagation of the initialization error through space and time in the modeled system overall median pinf peaked during mid season fig 2 which corresponds to sorghum availability minimum possible change in the location of the model initialization shift by one landscape cell resulted in different spatio temporal infestation patterns figs 3 9 but the actual location of the initialized cell appears to also have impact on the extent of the error see moving window comparisons of pairs of scenarios with model initialized in neighboring cells s 206 vs s 235 and s 235 vs s 264 figs 2 and 10 12 ranges of dinf were very similar for scenarios s 206 and s 235 from 108 to 248 and from 107 to 252 respectively but for scenario s 264 the range of dinf was noticeably narrower from 118 to 231 5 syrjala s test detected a statistically significant difference in dinf between s 235 vs s 264 p 0 014 but there were no statistically significant differences in the other two comparisons p 0 223 for s 206 vs s 235 and p 0 302 for s 206 vs s 264 the greatest differences in dinf between scenarios occurred in the northeastern part of the study area eastern kansas and eastern oklahoma fig 3 where relatively less sorghum is grown and where the probability of infestation is low koralewski et al 2020 in scenario s 235 infestations occurred later than in s 206 in eastern oklahoma one cell showed a reverse trend in eastern kansas and later than in s 264 in eastern kansas and eastern oklahoma the difference between scenarios s 206 and s 264 was not as pronounced in eastern kansas infestations occurred later in scenario s 206 whereas in eastern oklahoma infestations occurred later in scenario s 264 each pairwise scenario comparison showed a statistically significant difference in all season pinf syrjala s test p 0 001 for s 206 vs s 235 p 0 001 for s 206 vs s 264 and p 0 003 for s 235 vs s 264 however only small clusters of cells in southeastern and central texas showed statistically significant local differences in all season pinf statistically significant getis ord gi where all season pinf was lower for s 206 as compared to both s 235 and s 264 fig 3 therefore although there were no local differences in all season pinf throughout the northeastern part of the study area one could expect the probability of first infestation in some of those cells to vary throughout the season depending on the scenario to the contrary in the southeastern part of the study area the all season pinf varied in two pairwise comparisons but there were no local differences in timing of the forecasted infestations in the area the moving window approach provided additional insights into how pinf changed throughout the season two shifts in pinf value became apparent in comparison of scenarios s 206 and s 235 figs 4 and 7 initially pinf in scenario s 206 was lower in southern texas during the first two time frames 89 102 and 103 116 but became higher during the next two time frames 117 130 and 131 144 later during the season pinf in scenario s 206 was again lower in central and western kansas a cluster of cells started forming during the time frame 131 144 and increased in size during the time frames 145 158 and 159 172 a shift occurred in central and western kansas during time frame 173 186 a cluster of cells formed with higher pinf in s 206 with range and intensity gradually decreasing towards the end of the season syrjala s test was not statistically significant during this time frame fig 10 but it was statistically significant during five preceding and three following time frames this result confirmed the mid season shift in difference in pinf on the regional scale higher p values in syrjala s test at the beginning and at the end of the season likely reflect a low number of cells with sorghum and with first infestations during those time frames a similar spatio temporal pattern emerged from the comparison of scenarios s 206 and s 264 figs 5 and 8 pinf in scenario s 206 was lower initially but a shift in southern texas occurred during the third time frame 117 130 and pinf in scenario s 206 became higher than in s 264 a relationship that continued through the fourth time frame 131 144 additionally a second cluster formed in central texas with lower pinf in scenario s 206 a shift occurred also in eastern kansas during the time frame 173 186 a cluster with initially lower pinf values in s 206 time frames 145 158 and 159 172 transformed into higher pinf values in s 206 just as in the case of comparison s 206 and s 235 syrjala s test was not statistically significant during the time frame 173 186 fig 10 in both pairwise comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 syrjala s test was not statistically significant during the time frame 173 186 there was a cluster of cells in eastern central kansas where immediately before this time frame pinf values in s 206 were lower than in the other compared scenario immediately after this time frame a cluster of similar intensity and in approximately the same location formed with pinf values in s 206 higher than in the other compared scenario the lack of statistical significance in syrjala s test during this time frame corresponds to this transition in the third pairwise scenario comparison s 235 vs s 264 syrjala s test was statistically significant only during the time frames 117 130 and 131 144 fig 10 this result reflected well the spatio temporal pattern in figs 6 and 9 a cluster formed in southern texas during the first three time frames during which pinf was higher in the scenario s 264 and pinf became dominant in s 235 during the time frame 131 144 only a small cluster formed in kansas later during the season but it was not detected by syrjala s test these results suggested that patterns of spatio temporal differences between scenarios may not depend on the physical distance between their respective initialization cells nor the physical location of the initialization cells relative to all other cells in the modeled landscape or that these aspects may be outweighed by other factors the differences between scenarios were more pronounced in both pairwise comparisons that involved scenario s 206 the differences between scenarios s 206 and s235 were more evident than those between scenarios s 235 and s264 despite that in both cases the initialized cells were neighbors therefore differences in patterns in pairwise scenario comparisons emerged not only from the difference in physical location or in physical distance between the initially infested cells but perhaps more importantly from the overall characteristics of these cells due to overall conditions at their physical location the distinct mid season bumps in fig 10 in the comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 resulted from the fact that the major wave of infestations in the first of the compared scenarios s 206 occurred later than in the respective second one s 235 and s 264 getis ord gi statistic showed that the differences in the initial conditions could result in statistically significant differences figs 3 and 7 9 that were strongly localized and that could occur in time and space distant to the model initialization the effects in pairwise comparisons described here were well reflected by the narrow sense error εn and its changes through time fig 11 in the case of the first two pairwise comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 there was a distinct sign change that corresponded to the time frame 173 186 see above and the two graphs resembled digit 8 the error in the third comparison s 235 vs s 264 was much smaller and the sign changed frequently the broad sense error εb fig 12 behaved in a more erratic way with frequent sign changes in all three pairwise comparisons as compared with narrow sense error εn the difference was likely due to other factors that impact aphid colonization success that is environmental conditions that affect the dynamics of long distance dispersal and the availability of sorghum which impacts how soon a new local aphid infestation can establish 4 discussion we used the model of wang et al 2019 to investigate propagation of error due to uncertainty in initial condition through the modeled system to make a clear distinction between alternative initial conditions we initialized the model with aphids in only one cell which was different from the original study wang et al 2019 in which the model was initialized in seven cells we used the smallest spatial distance between cells and thus used neighboring cells for the smallest possible spatial difference between alternative initial conditions importantly the model of wang et al 2019 was parameterized and calibrated to match specific environmental conditions in 2017 and evaluated using field data from 2015 to 2018 koralewski et al 2022 altering the initial condition may result in departure of model projections studied here from projections of the model with the original initialization setup however our objective was to analyze error propagation through the system and not the actual sensitivity of the model to uncertainty in the initial condition such a study would have been designed with consideration of all cells used for model initialization by wang et al 2019 our results supported our hypothesis of error propagation through the modeled space and time and showed that initialization of the model in alternative cells can affect the spatio temporal patterns of error propagation in pairwise scenario comparisons our results suggested that characterizing differences between the model initialization cells in terms of physical distance or geographic coordinates may not be optimal this was evident from comparisons of the patterns of propagating error in pairs of scenarios in which the model was initialized in neighboring cells s 206 vs s 235 and s 235 vs s 264 error propagation patterns varied between these two pairs despite the same physical distance between the initialization cells in each pair apart from physical location each landscape cell is also characterized by specific environmental conditions such as availability of sorghum air movement and temperature these characteristics apply to the cell and its neighborhood although nearby neighborhoods may partially overlap the local variability in non overlapping parts may also contribute to the dynamics of dispersal for instance local differences in air movement directly affect direction and distance of aphid dispersal whereas sorghum availability affects aphid colonization success therefore from the perspective of our study physical cell location should be seen rather as a proxy for the combination of these factors and the differences between initialization cells should be seen with consideration of environmental conditions however from the practical perspective field observations of aphids are described using geographic coordinates and hence we constructed our hypothesis with reference to spatial aspects of initialization uncertainty a single cell offset in model initialization location resulted in small localized areas with differences in dinf and pinf at the season level the moving window approach indicated that those differences change over time the differences in dinf were small except for a few cells in eastern kansas and in eastern oklahoma the differences in pinf were also small and were more evenly scattered throughout the study region although such differences could result from stochastic effects in areas with low probability of infestation koralewski et al 2021 in this study stochastic effects were mitigated by a large number of simulation runs 1000 per scenario moreover each emergent aphid dispersal pattern was unambiguously attributable to the single cell in which the model was initialized therefore uncertainty in model initialization with aphids appears to be a more likely explanation in other potential initialization cases in which alternative scenarios were to be initialized in several cells that represent partially overlapping areas the initialization cells common in the compared pair of scenarios would likely mitigate differences due to scenario specific cells the results would likely depend on the proportion of the initially infested cells that are common in compared scenarios in addition to the characteristics of the scenario specific cells in general one would expect the emergent patterns to become more similar as the proportion of the common cells increases nevertheless despite the distinct initial conditions our analysis showed that system level conclusions remain consistent regardless of the model initialization cell which has high practical relevance studies on the models sortie deutschman et al 1999 dubé et al 2001 and instream cunningham 2007 harvey and railsback 2007 show that sensitivity of a model to initial conditions can manifest itself at certain levels of the model output and yet may have no impact at the level of question asked transient differences in model performance may or may not be noticeable depending on the focus of the observer or they may be unimportant our analysis shows that the effect of initialization error propagation in the model of wang et al 2019 with respect to dinf and pinf is highly dynamic but the system level effects are highly temporally and spatially constrained figs 7 9 the all season results allow for detection of error propagation in very small clusters of cells fig 3 the starting point and the arbitrary duration of the moving window may also impact the ability to detect error for instance if the moving window was of different length we might miss the transition during the time frame 173 186 fig 10 in this work our analysis is centered on the events of first infestation presence of sorghum is the property of the cell that makes it available to modeled infestations at the landscape cell level an uninfested cell may become infested for the first time only once during a given simulation run a shift of the cell s state from uninfested to infested considering an uninfested cell as an abstract resource that could be consumed only once per simulation run a change of state from uninfested to infested the resource is depleted as soon as the cell becomes infested by aphids and it cannot be infested for the first time again pairwise analysis of the three scenarios shows the differences in how the resource cells never infested before is used by the aphid population over time while the overall use of the resource is nearly the same fig 3 it is the timing that differs between the scenarios figs 7 9 therefore the error is limited by the availability of the resource at a given time step oscillations in error behavior figs 11 and 12 are likely due to the variable intensity of resource consumption throughout the season in the compared scenarios in a given scenario if more resource is consumed at the beginning of the season less resource is available at the later stages it is unclear if the propagating error studied here can be controlled below an arbitrary threshold as described by lorenz 1969 discrete delineation of the initialization location cell imposes a discrete set of environmental conditions that characterize each cell and thus a minimum initial error that cannot be reduced further a finer differentiation of the characteristics of the initialization location would involve consideration of a broader range of cell characteristics and cell characteristics are an inherent property of the model different numbers and different distributions of the initialization cells with related variability in overlap of such multi cell initialization locations would also need to be considered however from the practical perspective the amount of error may be negligible at a given point in space and time even if it exceeds acceptable levels in a different point in space and time cf dubé et al 2001 for example in the system studied here error decreases mid season after the earlier period of growth but then grows again later in the season and eventually decreases at the end of the season figs 11 and 12 if we were to reverse our logic and if we considered the pair of scenarios originating from the two more distant cells s 206 and s 264 reduction of the distance between the initialization cells would lead to a clear reduction of error in the case of scenarios s 235 and s 264 but not in the case of scenarios s 206 and s 235 figs 11 and 12 it is possible that initialization of the model in different initialization cells may result in acceptable levels of error in different regions or at different times during the season nevertheless as we consider model purpose model scales and model structure error propagation studied here has low practical implications the structure of the model of wang et al 2019 may provide sufficient model initialization flexibility to control the propagating error below an acceptable level as described by lorenz 1969 in summary our study shows that the three alternative indivisible model initialization locations lead to different spatio temporal infestation trajectories but the propagation of error in pinf between compared scenarios is limited by the system itself the practical impact of the model initialization uncertainty within the examined spatial range and with respect to dinf and pinf is rather low moreover the extent and the distribution of error may depend on the actual location of the initialization cells and not solely on the distance between them this is evident from the comparison of scenarios initialized in neighboring cells and it likely reflects differences in the overall environmental characteristics of those locations and their neighborhoods credit authorship contribution statement tomasz e koralewski conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft hsiao hsuan wang conceptualization

24316,error propagation is an important consideration in individual based modeling but it has been considered insufficiently studied we investigated the propagation of error due to uncertainty in initial conditions using a previously published spatially explicit individual based model that simulates infestation of sorghum by an invasive pest aphid melanaphis sorghi theobald sorghum aphid previously published as sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner we initialized the model with aphids in three alternative initial infestation locations using one of three neighboring cells and analyzed the resulting model outputs in three pairwise scenario comparisons the spatio temporal patterns of aphid infestation as estimated by timing and probability of first infestation were statistically significantly different between the scenarios but the differences were locally restricted and scenario dependent in particular the two pairwise differences between scenarios originating from neighboring cells indicated that error propagation through the studied system depends not only on the physical distance between the alternative initialization cells i e the extent of the initial spatial uncertainty but also on the actual location of the model initialization cells likely reflecting differences in the environmental characteristics of those locations despite the statistical significance the differences were small from the perspective of practical application with few highly localized exceptions the spatio temporal trajectories of the propagating error indicate that within the examined range the spatial uncertainty in model initialization has a low effect on the timing and probability of first infestation and the propagation of the error in the observed variables is limited by the system itself keywords error propagation individual based model initialization error integrated model uncertainty in initial condition data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction error propagation is one of the challenges faced by individual based modelers grimm and railsback 2005 uncertainty in individual based model parameterization may propagate through the system resulting in high uncertainty at the system level grimm and railsback 2005 prediction errors that result from the lack of knowledge of the initial state of a system may exceed an acceptable level and thus may limit the ability to predict the state of the system lorenz 1969 considering initially small errors that may propagate through the system in time lorenz 1969 distinguished three potential trajectories 1 error does not increase through time 2 error increases through time but can be made arbitrarily small if the initial error is made sufficiently small however it will become large in a distant future unless it is zero and 3 error increases through time and there is a threshold below which it cannot be reduced regardless of the extent of the initial error unpredictable system level effects of small initial errors appear to be of particular concern in system of systems modeling iwanaga et al 2021 in which the error may propagate through interactions between the constituent models iwanaga et al 2021 similarly in case of integrated models in which model complexity may increase due to the integration of existing models uncertainty in one integration component may propagate through the entire system voinov and shugart 2013 this effect may be amplified across scales iwanaga et al 2021 lippe et al 2019 nevertheless in case of individual based models propagation of error due to small changes in parameter values that are then magnified through system s interactions seems to be rarely of serious concern grimm and railsback 2005 mooij and deangelis 2003 showed that uncertainty may impact spatially explicit dispersal models less than simpler models given that information on landscape details is used by the model mooij and deangelis 2003 pattern oriented modeling grimm et al 1996 in which error propagation is constrained by the match between modeled and observed patterns has been proposed as a viable solution wiegand et al 2003 however investigations of error propagation merit further attention grimm and railsback 2005 parker et al 2003 particularly when only a small number of individuals are represented in the model system level effects that result from the uncertainty in initial conditions have been investigated by some authors for instance mooij and deangelis 1999 found no strong effect of dispersal mortality error on the dispersal success in a simple spatially explicit population model for organisms dispersing in a fragmented landscape ruckelshaus et al 1997 deutschman et al 1999 investigated community level behavior of sortie a northeastern forest individual based simulation model pacala et al 1993 pacala et al 1996 with respect to details in calculation of a local resource light they found that the precision of light measurement was important at the level of individual tree but at large spatio temporal scales i e at the forest level the level of detail of light availability became unimportant and thus the emergent forest dynamics did not depend on the local resource dubé et al 2001 investigated the impact of differences in initial seedling distribution in sortie they found that the spatio temporal behavior of canopy gaps was stable in the long term however they observed subtle local differences between replicates and noted that different seedling distributions can lead to transient dynamics that vary between initial conditions despite the similar long term dynamics dubé et al 2001 similarly no strong or unpredictable error propagation was found in the study on instream railsback and harvey 2001 an individual based model of trout in the stream environment although the model was sensitive to some parameters there was no evidence of strong error propagation and the model predicted ranking of watershed actions to produce greatest biomass was robust to parameter uncertainty cunningham 2007 harvey and railsback 2007 here we used a previously developed spatially explicit individual based model that simulates sorghum aphid melanaphis sorghi theobald previously published as sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari zehntner hemiptera aphididae brewer et al 2022 infestation of sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench poales poaceae in the great plains of north america wang et al 2019 during simulations the model tracks environmental conditions including availability of sorghum and atmospheric conditions in each landscape cell within the modeled landscape moreover selected cells are initialized with aphids at the beginning of each simulation our objective was to investigate the impact of minimum spatial initialization uncertainty on the model output in space and time we compared three infestation scenarios in which the model was initialized in one of three landscape cells in the southernmost area of the modeled landscape we were interested in the resulting differences in all season timing and probability of infestation as well as in spatio temporal dynamics of the differences in probability of infestation of previously uninfested cells therefore following lorenz 1969 we defined pairwise differences in the emerging patterns as errors our hypothesis was that the error inherent in the estimate of the initial infestation location and in subsequent mapping of that location to the modeled landscape cell 1 will propagate through the modeled space and time and 2 will propagate differently for different scenarios 2 methods 2 1 summary of model description the model of wang et al 2019 is a spatially explicit individual based model that simulates sorghum aphid infestations of sorghum fields spatial domain of the model includes southern to central great plains of north america kansas oklahoma and texas of the united states where the majority of us sorghum is grown the study region is divided into landscape cells of the size of 0 5 longitude by 0 5 latitude temporal extent of the model is one year which encompasses one sorghum growing season and the temporal resolution is one day the regional sorghum aphid infestations of sorghum fields are modeled by integrating two modeling components that represent terrestrial and aeroecological parts of the model these components regularly exchange information during model execution koralewski et al 2019 the terrestrial component of the model was custom written in the netlogo programming environment wilensky 1999 and represents the phenological development of sorghum sorghum growth and stages of sorghum aphid life cycle development dispersal and colonization aphids are small and weak fliers and thus their aerial movement is largely controlled by wind consequently they are considered inert air particles in the model therefore the aeroecological component of the model that represents long distance aphid migration and deposition aeroecological stage of the aphid life cycle was modeled using hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model stein et al 2015 a broadly used atmospheric transport and dispersion model the integrated model was parameterized and calibrated using 2017 weather and sorghum data wang et al 2019 in the baseline scenario the model was initialized by aphid infestations on march 28 2017 day of year 87 in seven landscape cells in rio grande valley of texas that represented the initial infestation of sorghum in the region by aphids 2 2 data generation in this study we used the model of wang et al 2019 to investigate propagation of small model initialization error through the modeled system we assumed that the initialization error was spatial in nature i e it resulted from uncertainty in the localization of the initial infestation in the rio grande valley of texas this assumption is consistent with the spatially variable nature of the sorghum aphid in this sorghum system brewer et al 2022 since the spatial resolution of the model of wang et al 2019 is one cell we selected the three southernmost neighboring landscape cells cell 206 235 and 264 out of the seven cells that were used for model initialization by wang et al 2019 we initialized the model with aphids in one of the three cells on march 28 2017 day of year 87 we ran 1000 simulations for each of the three scenarios scenario s 206 s 235 and s 264 3000 simulation runs in total to mitigate stochastic differences between replicates particularly in cells with low infestation probability because we initialized the model in one cell as opposed to seven cells in wang et al 2019 the spatiotemporal patterns derived here are not directly comparable with those derived previously moreover since we retained the original model calibration the model output may or may not be an appropriate representation of the actual aphid spread throughout the region instead alternative model initialization allowed us to investigate propagation of the known initial spatial deviation through the modeled space and time the study region and the landscape cells in which sorghum was planted during 2017 are shown in fig 1 2 3 analysis we defined first infestation as an event when a previously uninfested cell becomes newly infested with aphids we defined the day of first infestation dinf as day of year on which first infestation occurred considering the entire sorghum growing season analogously we defined the probability of first infestation pinf as probability that first infestation occurs within a considered time frame we estimated dinf for each cell by calculating the median using data from those simulation runs in which the cell was infested moreover for each cell we counted the number of simulation runs in which the cell was infested at any time during the entire season equal to the number of simulation runs in which the cell became first infested at some point in time during the entire season we then repeated the counting process using a moving window approach non overlapping 14 day time frames from day of year 89 to day of year 289 fifteen intervals the last interval was 5 days long which corresponded to the earliest and the latest day respectively when new infestations occurred due to within model aphid migration only first infestations that occurred within a given time frame were counted we estimated pinf of a given cell as a proportion of simulation runs during which a cell became first infested we used the pinf notation for both all season and moving window estimates the three cells used for model initialization cell 206 235 and 264 were removed from analysis which resulted in a total number of 420 landscape cells where aphid infestations could potentially occur we compared the three scenarios pairwise s 206 vs s 235 s 206 vs s 264 and s 235 vs s 264 by calculating pairwise differences in dinf and in pinf for each cell δdinf and δpinf respectively a positive δdinf or δpinf value indicates a higher dinf or pinf value respectively in the first of the two compared scenarios we then applied the syrjala s test syrjala 1996 and computed the getis ord gi statistic getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 syrjala s test is a test for a difference between spatial distributions of two populations with the nonparametric null hypothesis that the two compared distributions are the same syrjala 1996 getis ord gi statistic is a measure of spatial association at the local level getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 to compare scenarios pairwise with regard to all season dinf we retained only those cells that were infested in at least one simulation run in both compared scenarios to compare scenarios pairwise with regard to all season pinf and moving window pinf we retained only those cells that were first infested in at least one simulation run in at least one of the two compared scenarios within a considered time frame we calculated δdinf and δpinf for each retained cell and applied syrjala s test syrjala 1996 using the r package ecespa v 1 1 13 de la cruz rot 2008 designed for spatial point pattern analysis we used the function syrjala that implements the syrjala s test we used the cramer von mises test statistic and the number of permutations nperm was set to 1000 to identify areas where two compared scenarios differed we calculated the getis ord gi statistic getis and ord 1992 ord and getis 1995 using the function localg from the r package spdep v 1 1 7 bivand and wong 2018 bivand et al 2013 with the critical values of the statistic provided by ord and getis 1995 the package spdep provides among other functions a collection of tests for spatial autocorrelation analysis and the function localg calculates the statistics gi and gi prior to running the function localg we assigned neighbors to each cell using the functions dnearneigh and include self package spdep the maximum distance between centroids of the neighboring cells was set to 0 71 which allowed for maximum of nine neighbors including self and assigned spatial weights using the function nb2listw package spdep in case of δdinf and δpinf statistically significant positive gi values indicate areas where cells with high δdinf or high δpinf values dominate whereas statistically significant negative gi values indicate the contrary moreover for cells retained in a given scenario in each pairwise comparison we calculated moving window median pinf with the corresponding 25th and 75th percentiles we analyzed simulation output data assuming significance level α 0 05 and generated plots using r v 3 6 2 r core team 2019 we generated maps with differences in dinf and in pinf and with the corresponding getis ord gi statistic using the r package maps v 3 3 0 brownrigg et al 2018 designed to draw geographical maps 2 4 definition of error we define error ε to represent differences in the occurrence of first infestations and to investigate dynamics of these differences through time the probability of first infestation pinf of cell cm in scenario si during time frame tk is p i n f s i t k c m n s i t k c m n s i where for scenario si n si tk cm is the number of simulation runs in which cell cm became first infested during time frame tk and n si is the total number of simulation runs here n si 1000 analogously considering only those simulation runs in scenario si during which cell cm became first infested we define the proportion of simulation runs finf in which cell cm became first infested during time frame tk as f i n f s i t k c m n s i t k c m n s i c m where for scenario si n si cm is the number of simulation runs during which cell cm became first infested n si cm n si we define narrow sense error εn between scenarios si and sj i j within a given time frame tk as the median difference δ n in finf ε n s i s j t k δ n s i s j t k where δ n s i s j t k c m f i n f s i t k c m f i n f s j t k c m similarly broad sense error εb between scenarios si and sj i j within a given time frame tk is the median difference δ b in pinf ε b s i s j t k δ b s i s j t k where δ b s i s j t k c m p i n f s i t k c m p i n f s j t k c m in the case of our study i 1 2 3 j 1 2 3 k 89 102 103 116 285 289 and m 1 2 420 the narrow sense error εn represents differences through time in distribution of all first infestations that occurred during the season the broad sense error εb accounts additionally for the overall susceptibility of the cell to become infested throughout the season that could be influenced by environmental factors 3 results the analysis allowed tracking the propagation of the initialization error through space and time in the modeled system overall median pinf peaked during mid season fig 2 which corresponds to sorghum availability minimum possible change in the location of the model initialization shift by one landscape cell resulted in different spatio temporal infestation patterns figs 3 9 but the actual location of the initialized cell appears to also have impact on the extent of the error see moving window comparisons of pairs of scenarios with model initialized in neighboring cells s 206 vs s 235 and s 235 vs s 264 figs 2 and 10 12 ranges of dinf were very similar for scenarios s 206 and s 235 from 108 to 248 and from 107 to 252 respectively but for scenario s 264 the range of dinf was noticeably narrower from 118 to 231 5 syrjala s test detected a statistically significant difference in dinf between s 235 vs s 264 p 0 014 but there were no statistically significant differences in the other two comparisons p 0 223 for s 206 vs s 235 and p 0 302 for s 206 vs s 264 the greatest differences in dinf between scenarios occurred in the northeastern part of the study area eastern kansas and eastern oklahoma fig 3 where relatively less sorghum is grown and where the probability of infestation is low koralewski et al 2020 in scenario s 235 infestations occurred later than in s 206 in eastern oklahoma one cell showed a reverse trend in eastern kansas and later than in s 264 in eastern kansas and eastern oklahoma the difference between scenarios s 206 and s 264 was not as pronounced in eastern kansas infestations occurred later in scenario s 206 whereas in eastern oklahoma infestations occurred later in scenario s 264 each pairwise scenario comparison showed a statistically significant difference in all season pinf syrjala s test p 0 001 for s 206 vs s 235 p 0 001 for s 206 vs s 264 and p 0 003 for s 235 vs s 264 however only small clusters of cells in southeastern and central texas showed statistically significant local differences in all season pinf statistically significant getis ord gi where all season pinf was lower for s 206 as compared to both s 235 and s 264 fig 3 therefore although there were no local differences in all season pinf throughout the northeastern part of the study area one could expect the probability of first infestation in some of those cells to vary throughout the season depending on the scenario to the contrary in the southeastern part of the study area the all season pinf varied in two pairwise comparisons but there were no local differences in timing of the forecasted infestations in the area the moving window approach provided additional insights into how pinf changed throughout the season two shifts in pinf value became apparent in comparison of scenarios s 206 and s 235 figs 4 and 7 initially pinf in scenario s 206 was lower in southern texas during the first two time frames 89 102 and 103 116 but became higher during the next two time frames 117 130 and 131 144 later during the season pinf in scenario s 206 was again lower in central and western kansas a cluster of cells started forming during the time frame 131 144 and increased in size during the time frames 145 158 and 159 172 a shift occurred in central and western kansas during time frame 173 186 a cluster of cells formed with higher pinf in s 206 with range and intensity gradually decreasing towards the end of the season syrjala s test was not statistically significant during this time frame fig 10 but it was statistically significant during five preceding and three following time frames this result confirmed the mid season shift in difference in pinf on the regional scale higher p values in syrjala s test at the beginning and at the end of the season likely reflect a low number of cells with sorghum and with first infestations during those time frames a similar spatio temporal pattern emerged from the comparison of scenarios s 206 and s 264 figs 5 and 8 pinf in scenario s 206 was lower initially but a shift in southern texas occurred during the third time frame 117 130 and pinf in scenario s 206 became higher than in s 264 a relationship that continued through the fourth time frame 131 144 additionally a second cluster formed in central texas with lower pinf in scenario s 206 a shift occurred also in eastern kansas during the time frame 173 186 a cluster with initially lower pinf values in s 206 time frames 145 158 and 159 172 transformed into higher pinf values in s 206 just as in the case of comparison s 206 and s 235 syrjala s test was not statistically significant during the time frame 173 186 fig 10 in both pairwise comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 syrjala s test was not statistically significant during the time frame 173 186 there was a cluster of cells in eastern central kansas where immediately before this time frame pinf values in s 206 were lower than in the other compared scenario immediately after this time frame a cluster of similar intensity and in approximately the same location formed with pinf values in s 206 higher than in the other compared scenario the lack of statistical significance in syrjala s test during this time frame corresponds to this transition in the third pairwise scenario comparison s 235 vs s 264 syrjala s test was statistically significant only during the time frames 117 130 and 131 144 fig 10 this result reflected well the spatio temporal pattern in figs 6 and 9 a cluster formed in southern texas during the first three time frames during which pinf was higher in the scenario s 264 and pinf became dominant in s 235 during the time frame 131 144 only a small cluster formed in kansas later during the season but it was not detected by syrjala s test these results suggested that patterns of spatio temporal differences between scenarios may not depend on the physical distance between their respective initialization cells nor the physical location of the initialization cells relative to all other cells in the modeled landscape or that these aspects may be outweighed by other factors the differences between scenarios were more pronounced in both pairwise comparisons that involved scenario s 206 the differences between scenarios s 206 and s235 were more evident than those between scenarios s 235 and s264 despite that in both cases the initialized cells were neighbors therefore differences in patterns in pairwise scenario comparisons emerged not only from the difference in physical location or in physical distance between the initially infested cells but perhaps more importantly from the overall characteristics of these cells due to overall conditions at their physical location the distinct mid season bumps in fig 10 in the comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 resulted from the fact that the major wave of infestations in the first of the compared scenarios s 206 occurred later than in the respective second one s 235 and s 264 getis ord gi statistic showed that the differences in the initial conditions could result in statistically significant differences figs 3 and 7 9 that were strongly localized and that could occur in time and space distant to the model initialization the effects in pairwise comparisons described here were well reflected by the narrow sense error εn and its changes through time fig 11 in the case of the first two pairwise comparisons s 206 vs s 235 and s 206 vs s 264 there was a distinct sign change that corresponded to the time frame 173 186 see above and the two graphs resembled digit 8 the error in the third comparison s 235 vs s 264 was much smaller and the sign changed frequently the broad sense error εb fig 12 behaved in a more erratic way with frequent sign changes in all three pairwise comparisons as compared with narrow sense error εn the difference was likely due to other factors that impact aphid colonization success that is environmental conditions that affect the dynamics of long distance dispersal and the availability of sorghum which impacts how soon a new local aphid infestation can establish 4 discussion we used the model of wang et al 2019 to investigate propagation of error due to uncertainty in initial condition through the modeled system to make a clear distinction between alternative initial conditions we initialized the model with aphids in only one cell which was different from the original study wang et al 2019 in which the model was initialized in seven cells we used the smallest spatial distance between cells and thus used neighboring cells for the smallest possible spatial difference between alternative initial conditions importantly the model of wang et al 2019 was parameterized and calibrated to match specific environmental conditions in 2017 and evaluated using field data from 2015 to 2018 koralewski et al 2022 altering the initial condition may result in departure of model projections studied here from projections of the model with the original initialization setup however our objective was to analyze error propagation through the system and not the actual sensitivity of the model to uncertainty in the initial condition such a study would have been designed with consideration of all cells used for model initialization by wang et al 2019 our results supported our hypothesis of error propagation through the modeled space and time and showed that initialization of the model in alternative cells can affect the spatio temporal patterns of error propagation in pairwise scenario comparisons our results suggested that characterizing differences between the model initialization cells in terms of physical distance or geographic coordinates may not be optimal this was evident from comparisons of the patterns of propagating error in pairs of scenarios in which the model was initialized in neighboring cells s 206 vs s 235 and s 235 vs s 264 error propagation patterns varied between these two pairs despite the same physical distance between the initialization cells in each pair apart from physical location each landscape cell is also characterized by specific environmental conditions such as availability of sorghum air movement and temperature these characteristics apply to the cell and its neighborhood although nearby neighborhoods may partially overlap the local variability in non overlapping parts may also contribute to the dynamics of dispersal for instance local differences in air movement directly affect direction and distance of aphid dispersal whereas sorghum availability affects aphid colonization success therefore from the perspective of our study physical cell location should be seen rather as a proxy for the combination of these factors and the differences between initialization cells should be seen with consideration of environmental conditions however from the practical perspective field observations of aphids are described using geographic coordinates and hence we constructed our hypothesis with reference to spatial aspects of initialization uncertainty a single cell offset in model initialization location resulted in small localized areas with differences in dinf and pinf at the season level the moving window approach indicated that those differences change over time the differences in dinf were small except for a few cells in eastern kansas and in eastern oklahoma the differences in pinf were also small and were more evenly scattered throughout the study region although such differences could result from stochastic effects in areas with low probability of infestation koralewski et al 2021 in this study stochastic effects were mitigated by a large number of simulation runs 1000 per scenario moreover each emergent aphid dispersal pattern was unambiguously attributable to the single cell in which the model was initialized therefore uncertainty in model initialization with aphids appears to be a more likely explanation in other potential initialization cases in which alternative scenarios were to be initialized in several cells that represent partially overlapping areas the initialization cells common in the compared pair of scenarios would likely mitigate differences due to scenario specific cells the results would likely depend on the proportion of the initially infested cells that are common in compared scenarios in addition to the characteristics of the scenario specific cells in general one would expect the emergent patterns to become more similar as the proportion of the common cells increases nevertheless despite the distinct initial conditions our analysis showed that system level conclusions remain consistent regardless of the model initialization cell which has high practical relevance studies on the models sortie deutschman et al 1999 dubé et al 2001 and instream cunningham 2007 harvey and railsback 2007 show that sensitivity of a model to initial conditions can manifest itself at certain levels of the model output and yet may have no impact at the level of question asked transient differences in model performance may or may not be noticeable depending on the focus of the observer or they may be unimportant our analysis shows that the effect of initialization error propagation in the model of wang et al 2019 with respect to dinf and pinf is highly dynamic but the system level effects are highly temporally and spatially constrained figs 7 9 the all season results allow for detection of error propagation in very small clusters of cells fig 3 the starting point and the arbitrary duration of the moving window may also impact the ability to detect error for instance if the moving window was of different length we might miss the transition during the time frame 173 186 fig 10 in this work our analysis is centered on the events of first infestation presence of sorghum is the property of the cell that makes it available to modeled infestations at the landscape cell level an uninfested cell may become infested for the first time only once during a given simulation run a shift of the cell s state from uninfested to infested considering an uninfested cell as an abstract resource that could be consumed only once per simulation run a change of state from uninfested to infested the resource is depleted as soon as the cell becomes infested by aphids and it cannot be infested for the first time again pairwise analysis of the three scenarios shows the differences in how the resource cells never infested before is used by the aphid population over time while the overall use of the resource is nearly the same fig 3 it is the timing that differs between the scenarios figs 7 9 therefore the error is limited by the availability of the resource at a given time step oscillations in error behavior figs 11 and 12 are likely due to the variable intensity of resource consumption throughout the season in the compared scenarios in a given scenario if more resource is consumed at the beginning of the season less resource is available at the later stages it is unclear if the propagating error studied here can be controlled below an arbitrary threshold as described by lorenz 1969 discrete delineation of the initialization location cell imposes a discrete set of environmental conditions that characterize each cell and thus a minimum initial error that cannot be reduced further a finer differentiation of the characteristics of the initialization location would involve consideration of a broader range of cell characteristics and cell characteristics are an inherent property of the model different numbers and different distributions of the initialization cells with related variability in overlap of such multi cell initialization locations would also need to be considered however from the practical perspective the amount of error may be negligible at a given point in space and time even if it exceeds acceptable levels in a different point in space and time cf dubé et al 2001 for example in the system studied here error decreases mid season after the earlier period of growth but then grows again later in the season and eventually decreases at the end of the season figs 11 and 12 if we were to reverse our logic and if we considered the pair of scenarios originating from the two more distant cells s 206 and s 264 reduction of the distance between the initialization cells would lead to a clear reduction of error in the case of scenarios s 235 and s 264 but not in the case of scenarios s 206 and s 235 figs 11 and 12 it is possible that initialization of the model in different initialization cells may result in acceptable levels of error in different regions or at different times during the season nevertheless as we consider model purpose model scales and model structure error propagation studied here has low practical implications the structure of the model of wang et al 2019 may provide sufficient model initialization flexibility to control the propagating error below an acceptable level as described by lorenz 1969 in summary our study shows that the three alternative indivisible model initialization locations lead to different spatio temporal infestation trajectories but the propagation of error in pinf between compared scenarios is limited by the system itself the practical impact of the model initialization uncertainty within the examined spatial range and with respect to dinf and pinf is rather low moreover the extent and the distribution of error may depend on the actual location of the initialization cells and not solely on the distance between them this is evident from the comparison of scenarios initialized in neighboring cells and it likely reflects differences in the overall environmental characteristics of those locations and their neighborhoods credit authorship contribution statement tomasz e koralewski conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft hsiao hsuan wang conceptualization

24317,motivated by the annual life histories of insects residing in the temperate regions of the world there is a rich tradition of modeling their population dynamics using a discrete time formalism here we consider an antagonistic interaction between two insect species a parasitoid wasp that lays an egg within its host insect species the egg hatches into juvenile parasitoid that develops within the body of the host by using it as resource and this ultimately results in host death the parasitoid emerges from the host as a free living insect that goes on to attack other hosts such interaction are ubiquitous with over 65 000 known species of parasitoid wasps and such wasps have potential in biologic control of pest insect species we introduce a general class of discrete time models for capturing the population dynamics of two competing parasitoid species that attack the same vulnerable stage of the host species these models are characterized by two density dependent functions an escape response defined by the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism and a competition response defined by the fraction of parasitized hosts that develop into adult parasitoids of either species model analysis reveals remarkably simple stability conditions for the coexistence of competing parasitoids coexistence occurs if and only if the adult host population increases with host reproduction rate and the log sensitivity of the competition response is less than half the latter condition implies that any increase in the adult parasitoid population will result in a sufficiently slow increase in the fraction of parasitized hosts that develop into parasitoids of that type we also consider a semi discrete formulation of a competing species model that incorporates host density dependence in the attack rate this model expands the class of models for which the analytical results apply and we systematically compare the numerical results of this model to the established coexistence conditions keywords host parasitoid stability conditions functional response hybrid modeling biological control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction host parasitoid interactions constitute an important class of consumer resource systems in ecological food webs with more than 65 000 known species of parasitoids all across the world fig 1 there is increasing usage of parasitoids as biological control agents where a natural enemy such as a parasitoid is introduced to suppress the pest population hajek 2018 the interaction between a single parasitoid species with its host is formulated as a discrete time model 1a h t 1 r h t f h t p t 1b p t 1 r h t 1 f h t p t where h t and p t are the adult host and the adult parasitoid densities respectively at the start of year t hassell 2000 gurney and nisbet 1998 murdoch et al 2003 the model is motivated by a typical host parasitoid life cycle as shown in fig 1 which consists of adult hosts emerging during spring laying eggs that hatch into larvae hajek 2004 godfray 1994 waage and greathead 1986 host larvae then overwinter in the pupal stage and metamorphosize as adults the following year without loss of any generality we assume that the host becomes vulnerable to parasitoid attacks in the larval stage adult female parasitoids emerge during spring search and attack hosts by laying an egg into the body of the host while adult parasitoids die after this time window the parasitoid egg hatches into a juvenile parasitoid that grows at the host s expense by using it as a food source and this ultimately results in the death of the host the juvenile parasitoids pupate overwinter and emerge as adult parasitoids the following year in 1 r h t is the host larval population exposed to parasitoid attacks at the start of the vulnerable stage where r 1 denotes the number of viable eggs produced by each adult host the function f h t p t 1 is the fraction of host larvae escaping parasitism and is referred to as the escape response thus r h t f h t p t is the total amount of larvae escaping parasitism to become adult hosts for next year finally r h t 1 f h t p t is the population of parasitized larvae that give rise to adult female parasitoids in the next generation the simplest formulation of 1 is the classical nicholson bailey model 2a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 2b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c t p t with a parasitoid dependent escape response exp c t p t where c 0 represents the rate at which parasitoids attack hosts and t is the duration of the host vulnerable stage nicholson and bailey 1935 the nicholson bailey model is characterized by diverging oscillations in population densities resulting in an unstable population dynamics nicholson and bailey 1935 recent work has identified two orthogonal mechanisms by which stability can arise in models of the form 1 the first mechanism is when the escape response f p t only depends on the parasitoid population and then the non trivial host parasitoid equilibrium is stable if and only if the equilibrium adult host population is an increasing function of the host reproduction rate r singh et al 2009 this type of stability arises through several related processes such as a fraction of the host population being in a refuge i e protected from parasitoid attacks bešo et al 2020 murdoch et al 2003 large host to host difference in parasitism risk taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 parasitoid interference bernstein 1986 free et al 1977 rogers and hassell 1974 and aggregation in parasitoid attacks reeve et al 1994 rohani et al 1994 may 1978 the second mechanism is a type iii functional response where the parasitoid attack rate accelerates sufficiently rapidly with increasing host population singh and nisbet 2007 here the escape response f depends on both the host and parasitoid population and interestingly in this case stability leads to the adult host equilibrium being a decreasing function of the host reproduction rate r singh and emerick 2020 singh 2021a b a key focus of this work is to expand these results to multi parasitoid communities we consider two competing parasitoid species that attack the same vulnerable stage of the host species as has been well documented in nature bográn et al 2002 hogarth and diamond 1984 ortiz martínez et al 2019 feng et al 2015 xu et al 2013 harvey et al 2013 bonsall et al 2004 the general class of models considered in section 2 takes into account a fraction of hosts surviving that is dependent solely on the parasitoid populations remarkably simple coexistence conditions are established in section 3 for these models in section 4 we consider the stability of a model where the fraction of hosts surviving depends not only on the parasitoid densities but also the host density we compare the numerical output of this model to the coexistence conditions established in section 3 we conclude the paper with a discussion of our results 2 formulation of a parasitoid competition model following along the lines of model 1 we introduce a class of parasitoid competition models that take the form 3a h t 1 r h t f p t q t 3b p t 1 r h t 1 f p t q t g p t q t 3c q t 1 r h t 1 f p t q t 1 g p t q t where p t and q t represent the densities of the two competing parasitoids in year t the escape response f p t q t is assumed to depend only on the parasitoid densities and is a continuously differentiable function that is monotonically decreasing in both arguments in the absence of both parasitoids 4 f 0 0 1 and the host population grows unboundedly as 5 h t 1 r h t recall that r h t 1 f p t q t is the net population of parasitized larvae the function 0 g p t q t 1 represents the competition response that is the fraction of parasitized larvae that will develop into adult parasitoids p t 1 in the next generation similarly 1 g p t q t is the fraction of parasitized larvae that will develop into adult parasitoids q t 1 to be ecologically relevant g p t q t is an increasing function of p t but a decreasing function of q t with the following properties 6 g 0 q t 0 g p t 0 1 generally a semi discrete framework is needed for a derivation of 3 that mechanistically captures the population interactions during the host s vulnerable stage singh and nisbet 2008 emerick and singh 2016 singh and nisbet 2007 pachepsky et al 2007 emerick and singh 2020 we consider an example of this in section 4 taking a more phenomenological approach here a simple example of the competition response is 7 g p t q t c p p t h c p p t h c q q t h for positive constants c p c q and h 1 here c p and c q typically represent the rate of parasitoid attack for each respective parasitoid species the non trivial equilibrium densities h p q of the competition model 3 satisfy 8a 1 r f p q 8b p r 1 h g p q 8c p q g p q 1 g p q where the last equation determines the ratio of the parasitoid densities for example the competition response 7 leads to the ratio 9 p q c q c p h h 1 before performing a systematic stability analysis it is important to point out that model 3 generalizes previous multi parasitoid host models many of which implicitly assume that different parasitoid species attack different host developmental stages kakehashi et al 1984 may and hassell 1981 briggs et al 1993 hackett jones et al 2009 van velzen et al 2016 3 conditions for parasitoid coexistence we begin by defining dimensionless log sensitivities of the equilibrium densities to the host reproduction rate r

small perturbations h t p t and q t 13 h t h t h p t p t p q t q t q and linearizing model nonlinearities in 3 around the equilibrium results in the following linear discrete time system 14 h t 1 p t 1 q t 1 a h t p t q t a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 11 a 12 a 13 where the entries of the jacobian matrix a are given by 15a a 11 1 15b a 12 h f p p 15c a 13 h f q q 15d a 21 r 1 g p q 15e a 22 g

following result known as the jury stability criterion for a three dimensional discrete system let 16a c 1 a 11 a 22 a 33 16b c 2 k 1 3 d e t a k 16c c 3 d e t a where a k is the 2 2 matrix obtained from matrix a by deleting row k and column k and det represents the matrix determinant then the non trivial fixed point h p q is asymptotically stable if and only if the following inequalities hold 17a 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 0 17b 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 0 17c c 2 c 1 c 3 1 c 3 2 ledder 2013 elaydi 1996 these conditions represent the discrete analog of the routh hurwitz criterion 3 1 the symmetric case consider the symmetric case with equal densities p q and assuming 12 our analysis shows that inequality 17a holds iff 18 g p 1 2 inequality 17b is always true and inequality 17c holds iff 19 d h d r 0 thus competing parasitoids can coexist as long as the adult host population is an increasing function of r and a sufficiently low sensitivity of the competition response to the parasitoid population exists for the symmetric case c c p c q p q g p 1 2 corresponds to having h 1 in 7 while these results hold for any general function f we illustrate them using the escape response 20 f p t q t 1 1 c p c v p 2 p t 1 c v p 2 1 1 c q c v q 2 q t 1 c v q 2 that is motivated by differences in parasitism risk among individual hosts in particular for each host the parasitoids have a different attack rate i e risk that is assumed to be independent between the two species and follows a gamma distribution singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 here c p and c q denote the average attack rates for parasitoids p and q with the coefficient of variation in the attack rate given by c v p and c v q respectively an alternative interpretation of this escape response is that the parasitoid species independently aggregate attacks on a subpopulation of hosts with 1 c v p and 1 c v q quantifying the extent of clumping in parasitoid attacks may and hassell 1981 for the symmetric case c c p c q c v c v p c v q 21 f p t q t 1 1 c c v 2 p t 1 c v 2 1 1 c c v 2 q t 1 c v 2 which solving 8a leads to the adult host equilibrium 22 h 2 r c v 2 2 1 c c v 2 r 1 that is an increasing function of r and hence a stable equilibrium iff c v 2 2 in essence coexistence of symmetric parasitoids on their shared host requires g p 1 2 and c v 2 2 note that stable interaction of a single parasitoid species and its host requires c v 2 1 taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 and our result c v 2 2 shows that coexistence of multi parasitoid communities requires hosts to have much larger variation in parasitism risk these results are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 where a low sensitivity of the competition response h 1 in 7 leads to coexistence of all three species in contrast a high sensitivity of the competition response h 1 in 7 leads to extinction of one of the parasitoid species the stability of the models is a structural property of the discrete time dynamics systems and independent of the initial conditions chosen in the simulation of figs 2 and 3 it is interesting to point out that coexistence of competing parasitoids leads to a much lower host population in fig 2 as compared to a single parasitoid species in fig 3 and this has important implications for biological control of pests lane et al 2006 pedersen and mills 2004 abram et al 2016 jervis et al 1996 3 2 the asymmetric case we next turn our attention to the asymmetric case where g p q 1 2 that results in 23 p q g p q 1 g p q 1 it turns out that assuming 12 inequality 17a becomes 24 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 1 g p q g p 1 g p q r 1 r r 1 h r 0 resulting in the stability condition 25 g p 1 g p q together with 19 that is still needed to satisfy inequality 17c a simple interpretation of 25 is that as one parasitoid species gets more dominant coexistence requires the competition response to become even more insensitive revisiting the escape response 20 and assuming r 1 such that 26 f p t q t 1 c p c v p 2 p t 1 c v p 2 1 c q c v q 2 q t 1 c v q 2 results in 27 h r 1 1 c v p 2 1 c v q 2 1 g p q r 1 c p c v p 2 1 c v p 2 c q c v q 2 1 g p q g p q 1 c v q 2 the adult host population being an increasing function of r leads to the stability criterion 28 1 c v p 2 1 c v q 2 1 for the symmetric case c v c v p c v q 28 reduces to our earlier result c v 2 2 and also implies that having both c v p 2 c v q 2 1 is a necessary condition for coexistence 4 combination of stabilizing mechanisms we consider a formulation that differs from the model in 3 but incorporates stabilizing mechanisms such as variability in risk and type iii functional response our focus is to briefly explore the stabilizing effect of type iii response with competing parasitoids in contrast to the models presented above we assume a host dependence in the escape response which is a result of a mechanistically driven model that assumes both parasitoid species attack over the same host vulnerable stage each parasitoid population attacks the shared host on disjoint time intervals during the vulnerable period in the following model we use a semi discrete approach to construct the yearly update assuming the p t population attacks first leaving only a reduced proportion of the shared host for the q t parasitoid population to attack we incorporate a variability in the host risk during the attack from the p t population this yields a coefficient of variation c v p 2 with average attack rate c p as in the previous models in the supplemental material we implement an approach similar to the single parasitoid models of singh and nisbet 2007 and singh and emerick 2020 and assume the continuous attack rate for q t is given by the type iii functional response c q l n where l is the population of host larvae during the vulnerable period we assume each parasitoid population oviposits at disjoint intervals over the vulnerable period after solving the system of odes see supplemental material explicitly we arrive at the following discrete yearly update 29a h t 1 r h t f p q h t p t q t 29b p t 1 r h t 1 f p p t 29c q t 1 r h t f p p t f p q h t p t q t where f p q the fraction of hosts surviving includes both an escape and competitive response and is given by 30 f p q h t p t q t 1 n c q r h t n q t 1 c p c v p 2 p t n c v p 2 1 n here the proportion of hosts surviving depends on both competing parasitoid species since p t attacks first the proportion of hosts succumbing to parasitism by p t is 1 f p where 31 f p p t 1 1 c p p t c v p 2 1 c v p 2 in this model the function f p is analogous to the function f in the models discussed in the previous section the combined escape response f p q in this model contains the competition response previously denoted as g in the previous models linearization around the nontrivial fixed point of model 29 and a numerical computation of the jacobian results in the stability region of fig 4 where the boundary of the stability region is determined by the conditions in eqs 17 in the single parasitoid population case the extent of parasitism attack n generally induces stability if n 1 singh and nisbet 2007 in the competition scenario we see that this condition is not relaxed however as c v p 2 gets larger a smaller value of n is required for stability with a limiting value of one this is true for c v p 2 as n grows if c v p 2 n we see that each parameter must be approximately equal to 1 6 for stability to occur 5 conclusion much prior work investigating the population dynamics of multiple parasitoid species exploiting a single host has used the framework of may and hassell 1981 where parasitoid attacks are assumed to be temporally separated for example parasitoid p attack first and hosts escaping parasitism from p are then subjected to attacks from parasitoid q in the context of both parasitoids attacking simultaneously this would imply that one parasitoid is superior to the other i e a host parasitized by both p and q will yield only parasitoid adults of one species a major contribution of this work is to expand these models to consider a more general framework characterized by an escape response and a competition response the former quantifies the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism from both species while the latter competition response gives the probability of an infected host developing into parasitoids p vs q if multiple parasitoids emerge from a single infected host then the competition response can also be interpreted as a fraction of these adults being p vs q while the models here are restricted to only two parasitoid species this framework can be easily extended to multi parasitoid systems for this class of models we presented necessary and sufficient conditions for the coexistence of all three species which turns out to be quite simple and elegant when both the escape and competition response only depend on the parasitoid densities these conditions are the adult host equilibrium increases with the host reproduction rate and the inter species competition is sufficiently small the latter condition is captured by the log sensitivity of the competition response being low as given by 25 where any increase in the parasitoid p population does not lead to a sharp decrease in the parasitized larvae for parasitoid q this condition can be put in the context of known mechanisms of coexistence in the field for example in many cases parasitoid attacks are skewed towards a small fraction of vulnerable hosts or parasitoids can label the infected host with a chemical compound to prevent attack from the other species both such cases will reduce competition and any increases in one parasitoid s density will not detrimentally impact the number of juvenile parasitoids of the other species our stability results can be tested with field observation by monitoring population densities across generations it is well known that the unstable population dynamics of the nicholson bailey model can be stabilized by incorporating differences in parasitism risk among individual hosts singh et al 2009 hassell et al 1991 taylor 1993 chesson and murdoch 1986 zoroa et al 2017 these works have led to the famous c v 2 1 rule for stability where c v refers to the coefficient of variation in host risk to parasitism another significant contribution of this work has been to extend this rule to multiple parasitoid species leading to 28 where the harmonic mean of both parasitoids c v 2 has to be less than two this automatically implies that c v 1 for each parasitoid is a necessary condition for the stable coexistence of both species many field studies of parasitism indeed showed the c v 1 to be satisfied for diverse host parasitoid systems pacala and hassell 1991 and the novel analytical criterion provided here clearly motivates studies of parasitism patterns in the context of consumer competition for a single resource the class of discrete time models presented are quite general enough but do have a drawback in the sense that they do not take into consideration any known mechanisms for resource sharing between multiple parasitic species hajek 2018 2004 as alluded to earlier parasitoids can indicate an infected host through molecular labeling which prevents exploitation by another parasitoid the semi discrete formulation presented here and in our earlier work singh and nisbet 2007 emerick and singh 2016 2020 can be used to mechanistically derive population dynamics models which can then be put in the general form 1 to explore parameter regimes leading to different types of population dynamic behavior in the model presented in eq 3 it is assumed that a simple proportion of those infected is separated to the populations p and q after the egg laying process occurs that is no density dependence on the population of p and q during the vulnerable period has any effect on the probability that an egg is laid this type of dynamic response must be incorporated during the vulnerable period as in the model presented in section 4 however simple analytical results as for the class presented here are likely not as clear we seek to investigate such models with a density dependence and determine the optimal conditions for two or more parasitoid populations to coexist on a single host future work will focus on incorporating correlations in the attack rate allowing for one of the parasitoid to have a type iii functional response while the attacking interval of each parasitoid occurs at the same time during the vulnerable period and also exploring spatial mechanisms for parasitoid coexistence slone and allen 2005 porter and hawkins 2003 snyder et al 2005 amarasekare 2003 credit authorship contribution statement

attack rate this model expands the class of models for which the analytical results apply and we systematically compare the numerical results of this model to the established coexistence conditions keywords host parasitoid stability conditions functional response hybrid modeling biological control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction host parasitoid interactions constitute an important class of consumer resource systems in ecological food webs with more than 65 000 known species of parasitoids all across the world fig 1 there is increasing usage of parasitoids as biological control agents where a natural enemy such as a parasitoid is introduced to suppress the pest population hajek 2018 the interaction between a single parasitoid species with its host is formulated as a discrete time model 1a h t 1 r h t f h t p t 1b p t 1 r h t 1 f h t p t where h t and p t are the adult host and the adult parasitoid densities respectively at the start of year t hassell 2000 gurney and nisbet 1998 murdoch et al 2003 the model is motivated by a typical host parasitoid life cycle as shown in fig 1 which consists of adult hosts emerging during spring laying eggs that hatch into larvae hajek 2004 godfray 1994 waage and greathead 1986 host larvae then overwinter in the pupal stage and metamorphosize as adults the following year without loss of any generality we assume that the host becomes vulnerable to parasitoid attacks in the larval stage adult female parasitoids emerge during spring search and attack hosts by laying an egg into the body of the host while adult parasitoids die after this time window the parasitoid egg hatches into a juvenile parasitoid that grows at the host s expense by using it as a food source and this ultimately results in the death of the host the juvenile parasitoids pupate overwinter and emerge as adult parasitoids the following year in 1 r h t is the host larval population exposed to parasitoid attacks at the start of the vulnerable stage where r 1 denotes the number of viable eggs produced by each adult host the function f h t p t 1 is the fraction of host larvae escaping parasitism and is referred to as the escape response thus r h t f h t p t is the total amount of larvae escaping parasitism to become adult hosts for next year finally r h t 1 f h t p t is the population of parasitized larvae that give rise to adult female parasitoids in the next generation the simplest formulation of 1 is the classical nicholson bailey model 2a h t 1 r h t exp c t p t 2b p t 1 k r h t 1 exp c t p t with a parasitoid dependent escape response exp c t p t where c 0 represents the rate at which parasitoids attack hosts and t is the duration of the host vulnerable stage nicholson and bailey 1935 the nicholson bailey model is characterized by diverging oscillations in population densities resulting in an unstable population dynamics nicholson and bailey 1935 recent work has identified two orthogonal mechanisms by which stability can arise in models of the form 1 the first mechanism is when the escape response f p t only depends on the parasitoid population and then the non trivial host parasitoid equilibrium is stable if and only if the equilibrium adult host population is an increasing function of the host reproduction rate r singh et al 2009 this type of stability arises through several related processes such as a fraction of the host population being in a refuge i e protected from parasitoid attacks bešo et al 2020 murdoch et al 2003 large host to host difference in parasitism risk taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 parasitoid interference bernstein 1986 free et al 1977 rogers and hassell 1974 and aggregation in parasitoid attacks reeve et al 1994 rohani et al 1994 may 1978 the second mechanism is a type iii functional response where the parasitoid attack rate accelerates sufficiently rapidly with increasing host population singh and nisbet 2007 here the escape response f depends on both the host and parasitoid population and interestingly in this case stability leads to the adult host equilibrium being a decreasing function of the host reproduction rate r singh and emerick 2020 singh 2021a b a key focus of this work is to expand these results to multi parasitoid communities we consider two competing parasitoid species that attack the same vulnerable stage of the host species as has been well documented in nature bográn et al 2002 hogarth and diamond 1984 ortiz martínez et al 2019 feng et al 2015 xu et al 2013 harvey et al 2013 bonsall et al 2004 the general class of models considered in section 2 takes into account a fraction of hosts surviving that is dependent solely on the parasitoid populations remarkably simple coexistence conditions are established in section 3 for these models in section 4 we consider the stability of a model where the fraction of hosts surviving depends not only on the parasitoid densities but also the host density we compare the numerical output of this model to the coexistence conditions established in section 3 we conclude the paper with a discussion of our results 2 formulation of a parasitoid competition model following along the lines of model 1 we introduce a class of parasitoid competition models that take the form 3a h t 1 r h t f p t q t 3b p t 1 r h t 1 f p t q t g p t q t 3c q t 1 r h t 1 f p t q t 1 g p t q t where p t and q t represent the densities of the two competing parasitoids in year t the escape response f p t q t is assumed to depend only on the parasitoid densities and is a continuously differentiable function that is monotonically decreasing in both arguments in the absence of both parasitoids 4 f 0 0 1 and the host population grows unboundedly as 5 h t 1 r h t recall that r h t 1 f p t q t is the net population of parasitized larvae the function 0 g p t q t 1 represents the competition response that is the fraction of parasitized larvae that will develop into adult parasitoids p t 1 in the next generation similarly 1 g p t q t is the fraction of parasitized larvae that will develop into adult parasitoids q t 1 to be ecologically relevant g p t q t is an increasing function of p t but a decreasing function of q t with the following properties 6 g 0 q t 0 g p t 0 1 generally a semi discrete framework is needed for a derivation of 3 that mechanistically captures the population interactions during the host s vulnerable stage singh and nisbet 2008 emerick and singh 2016 singh and nisbet 2007 pachepsky et al 2007 emerick and singh 2020 we consider an example of this in section 4 taking a more phenomenological approach here a simple example of the competition response is 7 g p t q t c p p t h c p p t h c q q t h for positive constants c p c q and h 1 here c p and c q typically represent the rate of parasitoid attack for each respective parasitoid species the non trivial equilibrium densities h p q of the competition model 3 satisfy 8a 1 r f p q 8b p r 1 h g p q 8c p q g p q 1 g p q where the last equation determines the ratio of the parasitoid densities for example the competition response 7 leads to the ratio 9 p q c q c p h h 1 before performing a systematic stability analysis it is important to point out that model 3 generalizes previous multi parasitoid host models many of which implicitly assume that different parasitoid species attack different host developmental stages kakehashi et al 1984 may and hassell 1981 briggs et al 1993 hackett jones et al 2009 van velzen et al 2016 3 conditions for parasitoid coexistence we begin by defining dimensionless log sensitivities of the equilibrium densities to the host reproduction rate r 10 h r r h d h d r p r r p d p d r q r r q d q d r similarly we define log sensitivities of the escape competition response to the parasitoid densities 11a f p p f p q f p t q t p t p t p q t q 11b f

response with respect to p t evaluated at the equilibrium point note that for the competition response 7 the log sensitivities sum to zero i e 12 g p g q irrespective of c p c q and h considering small perturbations h t p t and q t 13 h t h t h p t p t p q t q t q and linearizing model nonlinearities in 3 around the equilibrium results in the following linear discrete time system 14 h t 1 p t 1 q t 1 a h t p t q t a a 11 a 12 a 13 a 11 a 12 a 13 a 11 a 12 a 13 where the entries of the jacobian matrix a are given by 15a a 11 1 15b a 12 h f p p 15c a 13 h f q q 15d a 21 r 1 g p q 15e a 22 g

following result known as the jury stability criterion for a three dimensional discrete system let 16a c 1 a 11 a 22 a 33 16b c 2 k 1 3 d e t a k 16c c 3 d e t a where a k is the 2 2 matrix obtained from matrix a by deleting row k and column k and det represents the matrix determinant then the non trivial fixed point h p q is asymptotically stable if and only if the following inequalities hold 17a 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 0 17b 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 0 17c c 2 c 1 c 3 1 c 3 2 ledder 2013 elaydi 1996 these conditions represent the discrete analog of the routh hurwitz criterion 3 1 the symmetric case consider the symmetric case with equal densities p q and assuming 12 our analysis shows that inequality 17a holds iff 18 g p 1 2 inequality 17b is always true and inequality 17c holds iff 19 d h d r 0 thus competing parasitoids can coexist as long as the adult host population is an increasing function of r and a sufficiently low sensitivity of the competition response to the parasitoid population exists for the symmetric case c c p c q p q g p 1 2 corresponds to having h 1 in 7 while these results hold for any general function f we illustrate them using the escape response 20 f p t q t 1 1 c p c v p 2 p t 1 c v p 2 1 1 c q c v q 2 q t 1 c v q 2 that is motivated by differences in parasitism risk among individual hosts in particular for each host the parasitoids have a different attack rate i e risk that is assumed to be independent between the two species and follows a gamma distribution singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 here c p and c q denote the average attack rates for parasitoids p and q with the coefficient of variation in the attack rate given by c v p and c v q respectively an alternative interpretation of this escape response is that the parasitoid species independently aggregate attacks on a subpopulation of hosts with 1 c v p and 1 c v q quantifying the extent of clumping in parasitoid attacks may and hassell 1981 for the symmetric case c c p c q c v c v p c v q 21 f p t q t 1 1 c c v 2 p t 1 c v 2 1 1 c c v 2 q t 1 c v 2 which solving 8a leads to the adult host equilibrium 22 h 2 r c v 2 2 1 c c v 2 r 1 that is an increasing function of r and hence a stable equilibrium iff c v 2 2 in essence coexistence of symmetric parasitoids on their shared host requires g p 1 2 and c v 2 2 note that stable interaction of a single parasitoid species and its host requires c v 2 1 taylor 1993 hassell et al 1991 singh et al 2009 pacala and hassell 1991 and our result c v 2 2 shows that coexistence of multi parasitoid communities requires hosts to have much larger variation in parasitism risk these results are illustrated in figs 2 and 3 where a low sensitivity of the competition response h 1 in 7 leads to coexistence of all three species in contrast a high sensitivity of the competition response h 1 in 7 leads to extinction of one of the parasitoid species the stability of the models is a structural property of the discrete time dynamics systems and independent of the initial conditions chosen in the simulation of figs 2 and 3 it is interesting to point out that coexistence of competing parasitoids leads to a much lower host population in fig 2 as compared to a single parasitoid species in fig 3 and this has important implications for biological control of pests lane et al 2006 pedersen and mills 2004 abram et al 2016 jervis et al 1996 3 2 the asymmetric case we next turn our attention to the asymmetric case where g p q 1 2 that results in 23 p q g p q 1 g p q 1 it turns out that assuming 12 inequality 17a becomes 24 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 1 g p q g p 1 g p q r 1 r r 1 h r 0 resulting in the stability condition 25 g p 1 g p q together with 19 that is still needed to satisfy inequality 17c a simple interpretation of 25 is that as one parasitoid species gets more dominant coexistence requires the competition response to become even more insensitive revisiting the escape response 20 and assuming r 1 such that 26 f p t q t 1 c p c v p 2 p t 1 c v p 2 1 c q c v q 2 q t 1 c v q 2 results in 27 h r 1 1 c v p 2 1 c v q 2 1 g p q r 1 c p c v p 2 1 c v p 2 c q c v q 2 1 g p q g p q 1 c v q 2 the adult host population being an increasing function of r leads to the stability criterion 28 1 c v p 2 1 c v q 2 1 for the symmetric case c v c v p c v q 28 reduces to our earlier result c v 2 2 and also implies that having both c v p 2 c v q 2 1 is a necessary condition for coexistence 4 combination of stabilizing mechanisms we consider a formulation that differs from the model in 3 but incorporates stabilizing mechanisms such as variability in risk and type iii functional response our focus is to briefly explore the stabilizing effect of type iii response with competing parasitoids in contrast to the models presented above we assume a host dependence in the escape response which is a result of a mechanistically driven model that assumes both parasitoid species attack over the same host vulnerable stage each parasitoid population attacks the shared host on disjoint time intervals during the vulnerable period in the following model we use a semi discrete approach to construct the yearly update assuming the p t population attacks first leaving only a reduced proportion of the shared host for the q t parasitoid population to attack we incorporate a variability in the host risk during the attack from the p t population this yields a coefficient of variation c v p 2 with average attack rate c p as in the previous models in the supplemental material we implement an approach similar to the single parasitoid models of singh and nisbet 2007 and singh and emerick 2020 and assume the continuous attack rate for q t is given by the type iii functional response c q l n where l is the population of host larvae during the vulnerable period we assume each parasitoid population oviposits at disjoint intervals over the vulnerable period after solving the system of odes see supplemental material explicitly we arrive at the following discrete yearly update 29a h t 1 r h t f p q h t p t q t 29b p t 1 r h t 1 f p p t 29c q t 1 r h t f p p t f p q h t p t q t where f p q the fraction of hosts surviving includes both an escape and competitive response and is given by 30 f p q h t p t q t 1 n c q r h t n q t 1 c p c v p 2 p t n c v p 2 1 n here the proportion of hosts surviving depends on both competing parasitoid species since p t attacks first the proportion of hosts succumbing to parasitism by p t is 1 f p where 31 f p p t 1 1 c p p t c v p 2 1 c v p 2 in this model the function f p is analogous to the function f in the models discussed in the previous section the combined escape response f p q in this model contains the competition response previously denoted as g in the previous models linearization around the nontrivial fixed point of model 29 and a numerical computation of the jacobian results in the stability region of fig 4 where the boundary of the stability region is determined by the conditions in eqs 17 in the single parasitoid population case the extent of parasitism attack n generally induces stability if n 1 singh and nisbet 2007 in the competition scenario we see that this condition is not relaxed however as c v p 2 gets larger a smaller value of n is required for stability with a limiting value of one this is true for c v p 2 as n grows if c v p 2 n we see that each parameter must be approximately equal to 1 6 for stability to occur 5 conclusion much prior work investigating the population dynamics of multiple parasitoid species exploiting a single host has used the framework of may and hassell 1981 where parasitoid attacks are assumed to be temporally separated for example parasitoid p attack first and hosts escaping parasitism from p are then subjected to attacks from parasitoid q in the context of both parasitoids attacking simultaneously this would imply that one parasitoid is superior to the other i e a host parasitized by both p and q will yield only parasitoid adults of one species a major contribution of this work is to expand these models to consider a more general framework characterized by an escape response and a competition response the former quantifies the fraction of hosts escaping parasitism from both species while the latter competition response gives the probability of an infected host developing into parasitoids p vs q if multiple parasitoids emerge from a single infected host then the competition response can also be interpreted as a fraction of these adults being p vs q while the models here are restricted to only two parasitoid species this framework can be easily extended to multi parasitoid systems for this class of models we presented necessary and sufficient conditions for the coexistence of all three species which turns out to be quite simple and elegant when both the escape and competition response only depend on the parasitoid densities these conditions are the adult host equilibrium increases with the host reproduction rate and the inter species competition is sufficiently small the latter condition is captured by the log sensitivity of the competition response being low as given by 25 where any increase in the parasitoid p population does not lead to a sharp decrease in the parasitized larvae for parasitoid q this condition can be put in the context of known mechanisms of coexistence in the field for example in many cases parasitoid attacks are skewed towards a small fraction of vulnerable hosts or parasitoids can label the infected host with a chemical compound to prevent attack from the other species both such cases will reduce competition and any increases in one parasitoid s density will not detrimentally impact the number of juvenile parasitoids of the other species our stability results can be tested with field observation by monitoring population densities across generations it is well known that the unstable population dynamics of the nicholson bailey model can be stabilized by incorporating differences in parasitism risk among individual hosts singh et al 2009 hassell et al 1991 taylor 1993 chesson and murdoch 1986 zoroa et al 2017 these works have led to the famous c v 2 1 rule for stability where c v refers to the coefficient of variation in host risk to parasitism another significant contribution of this work has been to extend this rule to multiple parasitoid species leading to 28 where the harmonic mean of both parasitoids c v 2 has to be less than two this automatically implies that c v 1 for each parasitoid is a necessary condition for the stable coexistence of both species many field studies of parasitism indeed showed the c v 1 to be satisfied for diverse host parasitoid systems pacala and hassell 1991 and the novel analytical criterion provided here clearly motivates studies of parasitism patterns in the context of consumer competition for a single resource the class of discrete time models presented are quite general enough but do have a drawback in the sense that they do not take into consideration any known mechanisms for resource sharing between multiple parasitic species hajek 2018 2004 as alluded to earlier parasitoids can indicate an infected host through molecular labeling which prevents exploitation by another parasitoid the semi discrete formulation presented here and in our earlier work singh and nisbet 2007 emerick and singh 2016 2020 can be used to mechanistically derive population dynamics models which can then be put in the general form 1 to explore parameter regimes leading to different types of population dynamic behavior in the model presented in eq 3 it is assumed that a simple proportion of those infected is separated to the populations p and q after the egg laying process occurs that is no density dependence on the population of p and q during the vulnerable period has any effect on the probability that an egg is laid this type of dynamic response must be incorporated during the vulnerable period as in the model presented in section 4 however simple analytical results as for the class presented here are likely not as clear we seek to investigate such models with a density dependence and determine the optimal conditions for two or more parasitoid populations to coexist on a single host future work will focus on incorporating correlations in the attack rate allowing for one of the parasitoid to have a type iii functional response while the attacking interval of each parasitoid occurs at the same time during the vulnerable period and also exploring spatial mechanisms for parasitoid coexistence slone and allen 2005 porter and hawkins 2003 snyder et al 2005 amarasekare 2003 credit authorship contribution statement

24318,reducing the water footprint per unit of crop production reduces the pressure on the limited freshwater resources this study used data from a four year field experiment conducted in the agro pastoral ecotone ape of northern china to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model and determine the impacts of planting dates on the water footprint wf of potatoes under rain fed and irrigated conditions results showed that the rain fed potato yields were 14 6 18 9 and 19 9 t ha 1 under the early normal and late planting dates respectively and the irrigated yields were 19 7 31 8 and 30 9 t ha 1 under the three planting daets the blue wf of the potatoe were 25 6 0 m3 t 1 27 2 0 m3 t 1 and 26 4 0 m3 t 1 in early normal and late planting dates respectively under rainfed condition and the value was highest in normal planting date green wf of the potato was 24 4 m3 t 1 16 0 m3 t 1 and 13 5 m3 t 1 under early normal and late planting dates respectively the total wf was 20 3 m3 t 1 under the early planting dates which was 50 3 and 87 9 higher than that under normal and late planting dates respectively under the irrigated conditions early planting exhibited the highest blue wf 33 2 77 9 m3 t 1 followed by normal 32 1 67 4 m3 t 1 and late planting dates 26 6 61 3 m3 t 1 the green wf was 104 9 m3 t 1 under the early planting dates which was 48 8 and 45 9 higher than that under normal and late planting dates furthermore the total wf of potatoes decreased with delayed planting with the average values of 161 1 117 8 and 114 2 m3 t 1 under early normal and late planting dates respectively these findings suggest the potential of reducing potato wf across the ape by adjusting the planting dates keywords potato planting date water requirement water footprint agro pastoral ecotone data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction freshwater plays an important role in ensuring food security while freshwater shortage affects one third of the global population lu et al 2016 morillo et al 2015 china the largest food consuming country worldwide has insufficient water resources per capita due to the uneven distribution of water resources cao et al 2014 the land area of northern china accounts for 64 of the whole country while its water resource is only about 20 1 of china mwr 2011 thus there is a need to address the imbalance between china s water resources and crop production cao et al 2014 wu et al 2010 potato is the fourth most important food crop globally after maize rice and wheat with an annual total production of approximately 360 million tons fao 2021 in china fresh potato production has reached 9 6 107 t with the total production area accounting for more than one quarter of the potato growing areas worldwide tang et al 2018a north china is a major potato growing area in china accounting for about 45 of total production in china tang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the agro pastoral ecotone ape is one of the main potato production regions in china with a total potato planting area of about 4 105 ha tang et al 2016 however potato production in ape is greatly limited by water shortage tang et al 2018b in some ape regions local farmers irrigate their lands using 100 300 mm of groundwater to obtain a high yield qin et al 2013 tang et al 2019 however the impacts of these irrigation activities on local water resources have not been systematically explored water footprint wf has been widely recognized as an index for determining the impacts of water use by agricultural production systems on freshwater resources herath et al 2014a the wf distinguishes water in three colors blue green and gray chen et al 2021 whereby the blue wf represents the surface and groundwater used by the production systems herath et al 2014b thus irrigation industry and domestic water all have a blue water footprint ahmadi et al 2021 green wf is the amount of rainwater used in a production system important for agriculture and forestry herath et al 2014b while gray wf is the volume of freshwater required to dilute the pollutants produced in the production process of a product ahmadi et al 2021 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 most studies have focused on quantifying the wf components of different crops lu et al 2016 have revealed that the total wf of grain crops in north china plain decreased from 900 m3 t 1 to 780 m3 t 1 in 1980 2014 in heao irrigation district of china the average total wf of wheat maize and sunflower were 1036 774 and 1510 m3 t 1 and their proportions of green water consumption were 22 3 26 1 and 29 4 respectively luan et al 2018 li et al 2018 reported that the blue and green wf of rice were 802 m3 t 1 and 160 m3 t 1 in the jinlin province and the green wf was lowest in the drier years moreover it has been shown that the wf in the pampean region of argentina was 324 m3 t 1 for potatoes where the blue water was more important than green one rodriguez et al 2015 however studies on the potato wf in the ape are limited crop production and water use are the preconditions determining the wf cao et al 2014 therefore reduced wf of crop production could be realized by improving agricultural management irrigation and fertilization efficiencies providing technical advice to farmers and establishing legal and tax regulations on groundwater usage rodriguez et al 2015 cao et al 2014 revealed that establishing the new water saving technologies mainly reduced the total wf in hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china furthermore hou 2013 has demonstrated that adjusting the cropping structure is effective in reducing the total wf especially the blue wf in gansu province china improving the soil conditions to control drainage is also effective in reducing crop wf jahani et al 2017 previous studies covering the ape have only focused on increasing the water usage efficiency wue qin et al 2013 and our previous study has shown that adjusting the planting dates is an effective way for improving potato wue in the ape tang et al 2018a however the impacts of the water used by agricultural production systems on freshwater resources could not be determined by evaluating only the wue herath et al 2014a lu et al 2016 moreover the rainfall and groundwater components used by potatoes for growth could not be established in previous studies considering that quantifying the different water types used during the potato growth period is important for sustainable agricultural production in the ape therefore this study aimed to 1 evaluate the potato yield and water use water requirement and water deficit in the ape under different planting dates and 2 investigate the water footprint of potatoes in the ape at different planting dates 2 materials and methods

tang et al 2021 the region includes eight provinces of heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi shannxi ningxia and gansu and the inner mongolia autonomous region we selected 27 sites with relatively uniform distributions in the ape as shown in fig 1 based on the onset of the rainy season the ape was divided into three sections i e eastern ape central ape and western ape the detailed meteorological and crop management conditions during the growing season of three ape sections are shown in table 1 historical climate data including maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and sunshine hours from 1981 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration daily sunshine duration was used to calculate the solar radiation based on the ångström equation black et al

1756 m inner mongolia the serial planting experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 on five planting dates including april 26 may 6 may 16 may 26 and may 31 each year and each planting date was replicated four times the harvesting dates were august 22 september 2 september 4 september 8 and september 9 in 2011 while in 2012 the harvesting date was august 26 for the first planting and september 10 for other planting dates the plots were 25 m2 with the same length and width the potato cultivar kexin 1 was used across all planting dates at the planting density of 4 plants per m2 with similar row spacing the water and n fertilizer coupling experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at four irrigation levels 0 90 180 and 360 mm coupled with four n fertilizer levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 each treatment was conducted in triplicate the couplings of different irrigation and n fertilizer levels were denoted winj where i and j ranged from 0 to 4 with an interval of 1 the potato

fertilizer levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 respectively the key phenological stages including planting emergence tuberization tuber bulking and maturity were recorded for both experiments soil moisture was taken every 15 days at the depth of 1 m for every 10 cm using the oven drying method and one sample was taken per plot the fresh tuber yield with a moisture content of 80 was measured after harvesting detailed descriptions of the serial planting experiments could be referred from tang et al 2018 while that of the water and n coupling experiment could be obtained from tang et al 2021 2 3 calibration and validation of the apsim potato model apsim potato model is a process based crop model developed using the potato soilwat soiln and surfaceom key modules and a management module in the apsim plant net framework brown et al 2011 the model simulates the potato development process dry matter accumulation and yield production in response to daily solar radiation temperature photoperiod soil water content and soil nitrogen content brown et al 2011 in this study we evaluated the ability of the apsim potato model to simulate the response of potato growth to different planting dates and combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer applications for the serial planting experiment the data obtained in 2011 and 2012 at the different planting dates were used to calibrate and validate the model similarly the data obtained in 2015 and 2016 at the different levels of irrigation and n fertilizer treatment were used to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model for the water and n fertilizer coupling experiment the calibrations and validation included the comparisons of the observed and simulated potato fresh yield and soil water content at 1 m depth the trial and error method was used to derive the genetic parameters of potatoes and those related to the n assimilation process as shown in table 2 2 4 determining the impacts of planting date on potato yield water requirement and water deficit three planting date categories including early normal and late planting dates were set for the apsim potato model to explore the impacts of planting date adjustment on potato yield water requirements and water deficit under different watering conditions rain fed and irrigation the normal planting dates were may 10 may 20 and may 30 in the eastern central and western ape the early planting dates were 20 days earlier than the normal ones while the late planting dates were 20 days later than the normal ones the water requirement of potatoes was the water consumption that achieved potential yield at different planting dates the potential yield was defined as the yield that a modern potato cultivar kexin 1 used in the simulation could achieve without water nutrient and pest and insect stress at different planting dates water consumption was the sum of soil evaporation and crop transpiration simulated by the apsim potato water deficit was calculated as the difference between water requirement and precipitation during the potato growth period 2 5 evaluating the water footprint of potatoes under the different planting dates water footprint wf includes blue wf green wf and gray wf groundwater served as the blue water source while soil water was considered the green water source gray wf refers to the amount of freshwater needed to assimilate pollutant load based on the existing ambient water quality standards and not the amount consumed by crops thus we only considered the actual water consumption i e the blue and green wf for potato production in this study 2 5 1 calculation of the blue water footprint the blue wf of potato wfblue at different planting dates was calculated based on the hydrological components described by herath et al 2011 as shown by the following equation 1 w f blue 10 i d r y where wf blue m3 t 1 is the blue water footprint representing the net use of blue water from groundwater and i is the amount of irrigation water used mm no irrigation water was used for the rain fed potato while 240 mm of irrigation water was used for the irrigated potato d is the root zone drainage mm r is the surface runoff mm and y is fresh potato yield t ha 1 the value 10 is a unit conversion factor 2 5 2 calculation of the green water footprint the green wf of potato was calculated as the net usage of soil water storage which is the difference between outflows and inflows of the soil water system as described by herath et al 2011 using the following equation 2 w f green 10 t e d r p p i y where wf green m3 t 1 is the green wf representing the net usage of the green water consumption from the soil water store t is the potato transpiration mm e is the soil evaporation mm p is the precipitation mm and p i is the canopy intercepted precipitation mm the value 10 is a unit conversion factor 2 6 statistical analysis the efficiency of the apsim potato model in simulating the soil water content and potato yield was evaluated using regression analysis the regression lines of the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and normalized rmse nrmse were determined using observed and simulated values as follows 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o avg s i s avg 2 i 1 n o i o avg 2 i 1 n s i s avg 2 4 r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 n r m s e r m s e o avg where o i s i o avg and s avg are the observed simulated observed mean and simulated mean values respectively and n is the number of observations we interpolated the values of the 27 selected sites serving as the simulation variables to the whole ape using the inverse distance weighted method idw 3 results 3 1 efficiency of the apsim potato model apsim potato model simulated the soil water content at 1 m depth well the nrmse between

for assessing the hydrological process during crop production evaluating the water balance can provide a better understanding of the impacts of water usage on crop production mosleh et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and crop models have been widely used to investigate the relationship between crop yield and water balance moursi et al 2022 yi et al 2022 in this study resluts showed that the apsim potato model could explain 74 81 of the variation in observed values including soil water content and potato yield under five planting dates and four levels of irrigation and n fertilizer treatments a previous study reported that the most effective calibration of the apsim potato model involved the use of data from contrasting environments containing in season growth measurements he et al 2017 in this study data from two experiments conducted under different environmental conditions using the same potato cultivar were used to calibrate the apsim potato model we found that the derived cultivar parameters could effectively decrease the simulation inefficiency previous studies also determined the relationship between crop yield and water balance using other crop models such as dssat rzwqm and stics models and showed that these crop models could be effective tools if the accuracy is more than 70 coucheney et al 2015 fang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 thus the simulations by the apsim potato model in this study are reliable 4 2 impacts of planting dates on the rain fed and irrigated potato yield adjusting planting dates can effectively increase potato yield and precipitation usage efficiency in semi arid regions hu et al 2017 tang et al 2018a a previous study revealed that early planting could enhance crop yield while late planting would reduce crop yield due to the short crop growth periods khan et al 2011 however in this study we found that the rain fed potato yield increased with delayed planting this could be because planting potatoes early would lead to slow emergence and growth rate due to low soil temperature and soil water content of the ape moreover the emergence rate is relatively low during this period and the water sensitive stage ends before the rainy season shen et al 2012 wang et al 2015 resulting in low potato yield we further analyzed the relationship between potato water requirement and precipitation distribution during the growth periods and found that the positive association increased with delayed planting dates this resulted in a higher yield of the rain fed potato sunder late planting dates besides the three planting dates we also simulated the potato yield under a later planting date data not shown and found that the yield was much lower due to a shorter growth period this suggests that rain fed potatoes should not be planted in the ape later than our recommendation time irrigated potato yield was the highest under the normal planting dates water shortage is not a limiting factor for irrigated potatoes in the ape tang et al 2021 xia et al 2010 we analyzed the temperature and solar radiation in the different growth stages of irrigated potatoes under different planting dates we found that during the tuberization and tuber bulking stages the temperature was lower than the optimal temperature for potato growth under early planting dates but it was higher than the optima temperature under the late planting dates this suggests that the irrigated potatoes should be planted earlier than the normal planting dates to cope with the future climate warming in the region 4 3 impacts of planting dates on potato water requirement and water deficit water availability especially freshwater is a global problem which is more critical in the arid and semi arid regions mosleh et al 2017 determining water requirement and deficit of crops is key in optimizing irrigation management gong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this study water requirement of potatoes during the planting emergence period decreased with delayed planting because temperature increases with delayed planting time which is also associated with shorter growth periods tang et al 2018a similarly the water requirement of potatoes showed a decreasing trend with delayed planting dates during the emergence tuberization tuberization tuber bulking and tuber bulking maturity periods since crop evapotranspiration includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration stewart and peterson 2015 we analyzed soil evaporation and potato transpiration during different growing periods the results showed that soil evaporation increased with delayed planting while the total transpiration decreased more than the soil evaporation this indicates that we could enhance irrigation efficiency and save water resources by reducing soil evaporation the water deficit during planting emergence emergence tuberizaiton and tuberization tuber bulking periods also decreased with delayed planting dates this is because soil evaporation was higher under the early planting dates and the positive association between precipitation and potato water requirement was also high under delayed planting time lowering the water deficit however during the tuber bulking maturity period water deficit increased with delayed planting dates possibly because potato growth was better under the late planting dates which had high transpiration rates wang et al 2015 4 4 impacts of planting dates on potato water footprint the water footprint is a new technique for evaluating the utilization of water resources in the agricultural production processes chen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 generally crop wf is determined by crop water usage during the growth period and crop yield per unit area dang et al 2022 this study analyzed the green and blue wf of potatoes under different watering conditions rain fed and irrigated and found that the blue wf increased with delayed planting date under the rain fed condition two reasons could have attributed to this finding first precipitation was the only water source for rain fed treatment deihimfard et al 2022 and more water could have been used by potatoes for transpiration during delayed planting the drainage might have also decreased under normal and late planting dates due to the better growth conditions provided by the rain secondly potato yield was higher under late planting dates thus based on the relationship between wf and crop yield the blue wf increased with delayed planting dates contrarily the green wf decreased with delayed planting mainly because of increased yield we found that the effects of precipitation amount had no significant difference with the different planting dates moreover the changing trend of the total wf was similar to that of green wf showing that adjusting planting dates could effectively reduce the wf of rain fed potatoes under irrigation condition green water has a lower opportunity cost than blue water hirwa et al 2022 yu et al 2021 moreover blue water is generally scarce and its usage is restricted by its high opportunity cost and various environmental effects wang et al 2022 therefore efficient usage of rainwater whenever possible would reduce blue water demand deihimfard et al 2022 in this study the blue wf of the irrigated potatoes decreased with delayed planting dates the proportion of water consumed by potatoes transpiration increased with delayed planting dates and potato yield also increased under normal and late planting dates indicating that the blue wf was low under normal and late planting dates the green wf of potatoes was much higher under early planting dates compared with the normal and late planting dates due to the lower yield associated with early planting dates conversely the total wf of the irrigated potatoes decreased with delayed planting dates the lower total wf of potatoes under normal and late planting dates was due to the higher yield associated with these two planting dates thus the planting of irrigated potatoes should be later than the normal planting dates 5 conclusions adjusting the planting dates significantly impacted the rain fed and irrigated potato yield in the ape and the yield variation of irrigated potatoes was more drastic than rain fed potatoes under the different planting dates the potato water requirement during the entire growth period was 4 7 and 11 5 higher under the early planting dates than the normal and late planting dates respectively moreover the water requirement of potatoes at the different growth stages decreased with the delayed planting date and the variations in potato water deficit at the different growth stages differed under different planting dates we also found that the wf of potatoes especially irrigated potatoes could be significantly reduced by delaying the planting date thus the findings of our study improve the understanding of water footprint reduction by adjusting planting dates credit authorship contribution

24318,reducing the water footprint per unit of crop production reduces the pressure on the limited freshwater resources this study used data from a four year field experiment conducted in the agro pastoral ecotone ape of northern china to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model and determine the impacts of planting dates on the water footprint wf of potatoes under rain fed and irrigated conditions results showed that the rain fed potato yields were 14 6 18 9 and 19 9 t ha 1 under the early normal and late planting dates respectively and the irrigated yields were 19 7 31 8 and 30 9 t ha 1 under the three planting daets the blue wf of the potatoe were 25 6 0 m3 t 1 27 2 0 m3 t 1 and 26 4 0 m3 t 1 in early normal and late planting dates respectively under rainfed condition and the value was highest in normal planting date green wf of the potato was 24 4 m3 t 1 16 0 m3 t 1 and 13 5 m3 t 1 under early normal and late planting dates respectively the total wf was 20 3 m3 t 1 under the early planting dates which was 50 3 and 87 9 higher than that under normal and late planting dates respectively under the irrigated conditions early planting exhibited the highest blue wf 33 2 77 9 m3 t 1 followed by normal 32 1 67 4 m3 t 1 and late planting dates 26 6 61 3 m3 t 1 the green wf was 104 9 m3 t 1 under the early planting dates which was 48 8 and 45 9 higher than that under normal and late planting dates furthermore the total wf of potatoes decreased with delayed planting with the average values of 161 1 117 8 and 114 2 m3 t 1 under early normal and late planting dates respectively these findings suggest the potential of reducing potato wf across the ape by adjusting the planting dates keywords potato planting date water requirement water footprint agro pastoral ecotone data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction freshwater plays an important role in ensuring food security while freshwater shortage affects one third of the global population lu et al 2016 morillo et al 2015 china the largest food consuming country worldwide has insufficient water resources per capita due to the uneven distribution of water resources cao et al 2014 the land area of northern china accounts for 64 of the whole country while its water resource is only about 20 1 of china mwr 2011 thus there is a need to address the imbalance between china s water resources and crop production cao et al 2014 wu et al 2010 potato is the fourth most important food crop globally after maize rice and wheat with an annual total production of approximately 360 million tons fao 2021 in china fresh potato production has reached 9 6 107 t with the total production area accounting for more than one quarter of the potato growing areas worldwide tang et al 2018a north china is a major potato growing area in china accounting for about 45 of total production in china tang et al 2019 yang et al 2018 the agro pastoral ecotone ape is one of the main potato production regions in china with a total potato planting area of about 4 105 ha tang et al 2016 however potato production in ape is greatly limited by water shortage tang et al 2018b in some ape regions local farmers irrigate their lands using 100 300 mm of groundwater to obtain a high yield qin et al 2013 tang et al 2019 however the impacts of these irrigation activities on local water resources have not been systematically explored water footprint wf has been widely recognized as an index for determining the impacts of water use by agricultural production systems on freshwater resources herath et al 2014a the wf distinguishes water in three colors blue green and gray chen et al 2021 whereby the blue wf represents the surface and groundwater used by the production systems herath et al 2014b thus irrigation industry and domestic water all have a blue water footprint ahmadi et al 2021 green wf is the amount of rainwater used in a production system important for agriculture and forestry herath et al 2014b while gray wf is the volume of freshwater required to dilute the pollutants produced in the production process of a product ahmadi et al 2021 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 most studies have focused on quantifying the wf components of different crops lu et al 2016 have revealed that the total wf of grain crops in north china plain decreased from 900 m3 t 1 to 780 m3 t 1 in 1980 2014 in heao irrigation district of china the average total wf of wheat maize and sunflower were 1036 774 and 1510 m3 t 1 and their proportions of green water consumption were 22 3 26 1 and 29 4 respectively luan et al 2018 li et al 2018 reported that the blue and green wf of rice were 802 m3 t 1 and 160 m3 t 1 in the jinlin province and the green wf was lowest in the drier years moreover it has been shown that the wf in the pampean region of argentina was 324 m3 t 1 for potatoes where the blue water was more important than green one rodriguez et al 2015 however studies on the potato wf in the ape are limited crop production and water use are the preconditions determining the wf cao et al 2014 therefore reduced wf of crop production could be realized by improving agricultural management irrigation and fertilization efficiencies providing technical advice to farmers and establishing legal and tax regulations on groundwater usage rodriguez et al 2015 cao et al 2014 revealed that establishing the new water saving technologies mainly reduced the total wf in hetao irrigation district in inner mongolia china furthermore hou 2013 has demonstrated that adjusting the cropping structure is effective in reducing the total wf especially the blue wf in gansu province china improving the soil conditions to control drainage is also effective in reducing crop wf jahani et al 2017 previous studies covering the ape have only focused on increasing the water usage efficiency wue qin et al 2013 and our previous study has shown that adjusting the planting dates is an effective way for improving potato wue in the ape tang et al 2018a however the impacts of the water used by agricultural production systems on freshwater resources could not be determined by evaluating only the wue herath et al 2014a lu et al 2016 moreover the rainfall and groundwater components used by potatoes for growth could not be established in previous studies considering that quantifying the different water types used during the potato growth period is important for sustainable agricultural production in the ape therefore this study aimed to 1 evaluate the potato yield and water use water requirement and water deficit in the ape under different planting dates and 2 investigate the water footprint of potatoes in the ape at different planting dates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study region climate and soil data the study region was the agro pastoral ecotone ape a transitional zone between the arid and semi arid pastoral grasslands to intensive cropland in north china tang et al 2021 the region includes eight provinces of heilongjiang jilin liaoning hebei shanxi shannxi ningxia and gansu and the inner mongolia autonomous region we selected 27 sites with relatively uniform distributions in the ape as shown in fig 1 based on the onset of the rainy season the ape was divided into three sections i e eastern ape central ape and western ape the detailed meteorological and crop management conditions during the growing season of three ape sections are shown in table 1 historical climate data including maximum and minimum temperature precipitation and sunshine hours from 1981 to 2016 were obtained from the china meteorological administration daily sunshine duration was used to calculate the solar radiation based on the ångström equation black et al 1954 furthermore the soil parameters including the bulk density and soil moisture at a lower limit of 15 bar ll15 drained upper limit dul and saturation dat were obtained from the soil scientific database of china http www soil csdb cn 2 2 plant materials and experimental design two field experiments were used to calibrate the apsim potato the serial planting at different dates and the water irrigation and n fertilizer coupling experiments the experiments were conducted at the scientific and observing experimental station of agro environment in wuchuan county 41 06 n 111 28 e altitude 1756 m inner mongolia the serial planting experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 on five planting dates including april 26 may 6 may 16 may 26 and may 31 each year and each planting date was replicated four times the harvesting dates were august 22 september 2 september 4 september 8 and september 9 in 2011 while in 2012 the harvesting date was august 26 for the first planting and september 10 for other planting dates the plots were 25 m2 with the same length and width the potato cultivar kexin 1 was used across all planting dates at the planting density of 4 plants per m2 with similar row spacing the water and n fertilizer coupling experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016 at four irrigation levels 0 90 180 and 360 mm coupled with four n fertilizer levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 each treatment was conducted in triplicate the couplings of different irrigation and n fertilizer levels were denoted winj where i and j ranged from 0 to 4 with an interval of 1 the potato cultivar kexin 1 was planted in 7 5 4 m plots for all water and n fertilizer coupling treatments for each plot the amount of n fertilizer applied was 0 0 59 1 18 and 2 36 kg of urea 46 of n for the n fertilizer levels 0 90 180 and 360 kg ha 1 respectively the key phenological stages including planting emergence tuberization tuber bulking and maturity were recorded for both experiments soil moisture was taken every 15 days at the depth of 1 m for every 10 cm using the oven drying method and one sample was taken per plot the fresh tuber yield with a moisture content of 80 was measured after harvesting detailed descriptions of the serial planting experiments could be referred from tang et al 2018 while that of the water and n coupling experiment could be obtained from tang et al 2021 2 3 calibration and validation of the apsim potato model apsim potato model is a process based crop model developed using the potato soilwat soiln and surfaceom key modules and a management module in the apsim plant net framework brown et al 2011 the model simulates the potato development process dry matter accumulation and yield production in response to daily solar radiation temperature photoperiod soil water content and soil nitrogen content brown et al 2011 in this study we evaluated the ability of the apsim potato model to simulate the response of potato growth to different planting dates and combinations of irrigation and n fertilizer applications for the serial planting experiment the data obtained in 2011 and 2012 at the different planting dates were used to calibrate and validate the model similarly the data obtained in 2015 and 2016 at the different levels of irrigation and n fertilizer treatment were used to calibrate and validate the apsim potato model for the water and n fertilizer coupling experiment the calibrations and validation included the comparisons of the observed and simulated potato fresh yield and soil water content at 1 m depth the trial and error method was used to derive the genetic parameters of potatoes and those related to the n assimilation process as shown in table 2 2 4 determining the impacts of planting date on potato yield water requirement and water deficit three planting date categories including early normal and late planting dates were set for the apsim potato model to explore the impacts of planting date adjustment on potato yield water requirements and water deficit under different watering conditions rain fed and irrigation the normal planting dates were may 10 may 20 and may 30 in the eastern central and western ape the early planting dates were 20 days earlier than the normal ones while the late planting dates were 20 days later than the normal ones the water requirement of potatoes was the water consumption that achieved potential yield at different planting dates the potential yield was defined as the yield that a modern potato cultivar kexin 1 used in the simulation could achieve without water nutrient and pest and insect stress at different planting dates water consumption was the sum of soil evaporation and crop transpiration simulated by the apsim potato water deficit was calculated as the difference between water requirement and precipitation during the potato growth period 2 5 evaluating the water footprint of potatoes under the different planting dates water footprint wf includes blue wf green wf and gray wf groundwater served as the blue water source while soil water was considered the green water source gray wf refers to the amount of freshwater needed to assimilate pollutant load based on the existing ambient water quality standards and not the amount consumed by crops thus we only considered the actual water consumption i e the blue and green wf for potato production in this study 2 5 1 calculation of the blue water footprint the blue wf of potato wfblue at different planting dates was calculated based on the hydrological components described

for assessing the hydrological process during crop production evaluating the water balance can provide a better understanding of the impacts of water usage on crop production mosleh et al 2017 xu et al 2019 and crop models have been widely used to investigate the relationship between crop yield and water balance moursi et al 2022 yi et al 2022 in this study resluts showed that the apsim potato model could explain 74 81 of the variation in observed values including soil water content and potato yield under five planting dates and four levels of irrigation and n fertilizer treatments a previous study reported that the most effective calibration of the apsim potato model involved the use of data from contrasting environments containing in season growth measurements he et al 2017 in this study data from two experiments conducted under different environmental conditions using the same potato cultivar were used to calibrate the apsim potato model we found that the derived cultivar parameters could effectively decrease the simulation inefficiency previous studies also determined the relationship between crop yield and water balance using other crop models such as dssat rzwqm and stics models and showed that these crop models could be effective tools if the accuracy is more than 70 coucheney et al 2015 fang et al 2008 liu et al 2011 thus the simulations by the apsim potato model in this study are reliable 4 2 impacts of planting dates on the rain fed and irrigated potato yield adjusting planting dates can effectively increase potato yield and precipitation usage efficiency in semi arid regions hu et al 2017 tang et al 2018a a previous study revealed that early planting could enhance crop yield while late planting would reduce crop yield due to the short crop growth periods khan et al 2011 however in this study we found that the rain fed potato yield increased with delayed planting this could be because planting potatoes early would lead to slow emergence and growth rate due to low soil temperature and soil water content of the ape moreover the emergence rate is relatively low during this period and the water sensitive stage ends before the rainy season shen et al 2012 wang et al 2015 resulting in low potato yield we further analyzed the relationship between potato water requirement and precipitation distribution during the growth periods and found that the positive association increased with delayed planting dates this resulted in a higher yield of the rain fed potato sunder late planting dates besides the three planting dates we also simulated the potato yield under a later planting date data not shown and found that the yield was much lower due to a shorter growth period this suggests that rain fed potatoes should not be planted in the ape later than our recommendation time irrigated potato yield was the highest under the normal planting dates water shortage is not a limiting factor for irrigated potatoes in the ape tang et al 2021 xia et al 2010 we analyzed the temperature and solar radiation in the different growth stages of irrigated potatoes under different planting dates we found that during the tuberization and tuber bulking stages the temperature was lower than the optimal temperature for potato growth under early planting dates but it was higher than the optima temperature under the late planting dates this suggests that the irrigated potatoes should be planted earlier than the normal planting dates to cope with the future climate warming in the region 4 3 impacts of planting dates on potato water requirement and water deficit water availability especially freshwater is a global problem which is more critical in the arid and semi arid regions mosleh et al 2017 determining water requirement and deficit of crops is key in optimizing irrigation management gong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 in this study water requirement of potatoes during the planting emergence period decreased with delayed planting because temperature increases with delayed planting time which is also associated with shorter growth periods tang et al 2018a similarly the water requirement of potatoes showed a decreasing trend with delayed planting dates during the emergence tuberization tuberization tuber bulking and tuber bulking maturity periods since crop evapotranspiration includes soil evaporation and crop transpiration stewart and peterson 2015 we analyzed soil evaporation and potato transpiration during different growing periods the results showed that soil evaporation increased with delayed planting while the total transpiration decreased more than the soil evaporation this indicates that we could enhance irrigation efficiency and save water resources by reducing soil evaporation the water deficit during planting emergence emergence tuberizaiton and tuberization tuber bulking periods also decreased with delayed planting dates this is because soil evaporation was higher under the early planting dates and the positive association between precipitation and potato water requirement was also high under delayed planting time lowering the water deficit however during the tuber bulking maturity period water deficit increased with delayed planting dates possibly because potato growth was better under the late planting dates which had high transpiration rates wang et al 2015 4 4 impacts of planting dates on potato water footprint the water footprint is a new technique for evaluating the utilization of water resources in the agricultural production processes chen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 generally crop wf is determined by crop water usage during the growth period and crop yield per unit area dang et al 2022 this study analyzed the green and blue wf of potatoes under different watering conditions rain fed and irrigated and found that the blue wf increased with delayed planting date under the rain fed condition two reasons could have attributed to this finding first precipitation was the only water source for rain fed treatment deihimfard et al 2022 and more water could have been used by potatoes for transpiration during delayed planting the drainage might have also decreased under normal and late planting dates due to the better growth conditions provided by the rain secondly potato yield was higher under late planting dates thus based on the relationship between wf and crop yield the blue wf increased with delayed planting dates contrarily the green wf decreased with delayed planting mainly because of increased yield we found that the effects of precipitation amount had no significant difference with the different planting dates moreover the changing trend of the total wf was similar to that of green wf showing that adjusting planting dates could effectively reduce the wf of rain fed potatoes under irrigation condition green water has a lower opportunity cost than blue water hirwa et al 2022 yu et al 2021 moreover blue water is generally scarce and its usage is restricted by its high opportunity cost and various environmental effects wang et al 2022 therefore efficient usage of rainwater whenever possible would reduce blue water demand deihimfard et al 2022 in this study the blue wf of the irrigated potatoes decreased with delayed planting dates the proportion of water consumed by potatoes transpiration increased with delayed planting dates and potato yield also increased under normal and late planting dates indicating that the blue wf was low under normal and late planting dates the green wf of potatoes was much higher under early planting dates compared with the normal and late planting dates due to the lower yield associated with early planting dates conversely the total wf of the irrigated potatoes decreased with delayed planting dates the lower total wf of potatoes under normal and late planting dates was due to the higher yield associated with these two planting dates thus the planting of irrigated potatoes should be later than the normal planting dates 5 conclusions adjusting the planting dates significantly impacted the rain fed and irrigated potato yield in the ape and the yield variation of irrigated potatoes was more drastic than rain fed potatoes under the different planting dates the potato water requirement during the entire growth period was 4 7 and 11 5 higher under the early planting dates than the normal and late planting dates respectively moreover the water requirement of potatoes at the different growth stages decreased with the delayed planting date and the variations in potato water deficit at the different growth stages differed under different planting dates we also found that the wf of potatoes especially irrigated potatoes could be significantly reduced by delaying the planting date thus the findings of our study improve the understanding of water footprint reduction by adjusting planting dates credit authorship contribution

processes to date resource use and recycling between animals plants and soil vegetation regrowth after grazing and drought stress effects on plants are only partially understood in their spatio temporal context complexity increases further as herder decisions interact with biophysical processes as herrero et al 2012 pointed out the agricultural and pastoral sectors are changing at unprecedented rates and are becoming more difficult to project integrated assessments are becoming a key step towards understanding change but increasing in complexity and difficult to put together

basis for the newly developed model system mll mpmas lucia livsim presented in this study 1 4 rationale and study aim sustainability assessment of land use options in savannah ecosystems needs to dynamically and spatially explicitly account for water and matter flows and herd movement plant and animal performance and herders cropping and grazing buying and selling decisions the aim of the present study was to develop a tool capable of simulating a grazing management options for sustainable use of forage resources b herd composition and herders household economy c options for preventing resource overuse and environmental degradation in savannah ecosystems and d resilience against shocks such a tool would represent in a process based manner i plant growth depending on climatic and edaphic conditions influenced by grazing and human management ii herd composition performance and mortality in response to pasture availability and quality as well as herd management and iii human decisions taking plant development animal performance and herd status into account when buying or selling animals or moving herds between paddocks for this purpose we coupled the abovementioned mpmas lucia and livsim models into the dynamic and spatially explicit soil plant animal human model system mll to assess pastoral systems over longer time spans at the landscape level the present study focused on the methodological aspects of model coupling and highlights the interactions between plants animals and humans as represented by the three coupled models our working hypotheses were that a the coupled models produce added value in their respective domains compared to simulations with the standalone models i e the interactions produce outputs ideally explain processes that cannot be produced by the individual models b the outputs plausibly reflect observed trends and c the coupled models are sensitive to inputs and interactions and sensible in terms of biophysical processes the following requirements for the coupled model system were defined 1 dynamic process based spatially explicit simulation of soil plant and livestock components in grazing and farming systems accounting for impacts of land use and animal grazing on system level nutrient and water balances 2 a plant module combining agronomic management options and ecological processes such as competition for resources in tree and shrub savannahs adequate representation of seasonal dynamics of forage quantity and quality under grazing and plant stress induced by climatic extremes 3 a herd model suited for sub tropical farming and pastoral systems 4 socio economic decision making processes on herd composition buying and selling of animals herd movement and trade offs with crop production accounting for agent behaviour learning and technology adoption 5 a framework to dynamically couple the individual models integrating their time steps and spatial scales developing highly complex integrated modelling systems to capture multiple biophysical and socioeconomic processes is not a trivial task the attempt often leads to integronsters voinov and shugart 2013 given the many interactions in agricultural and pastoral systems especially model testing calibrating and validating a complex integrated model poses a challenge arnold et al 2015 argued for a step wise procedure initially testing individual components subsequently moving to larger partly integrated units before finally assessing the full model system following this suggestion our study focused on a single herd and household system to keep model interactions traceable and demonstrate the mechanisms of model coupling and system interactions interactions between several hundred human agents have been simulated in a coupled mpmas lucia framework marohn et al 2013b herd herd and plant plant competition have been tested in standalone and coupled model runs they will be addressed in a follow up study 2 materials and methods in the first part of this section we will describe the full logic and capability of mll in general following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2020 2006 in the second part we explain model parameterization and initialization for a proof of concept study to analyse the plausibility of simulated agent environment feedbacks to ensure a thorough evaluation and discussion of the specific feedback loops in focus this parameterization limits complexity for the test case by abstracting from cultivation of crops agent agent and herd herd interactions it focuses on the feedback between a confined rangeland area a cattle herd and the decisions of one single pastoralist household in managing the herd under perceived open access conditions 2 1 overview of the coupled model system 2 1 1 purpose and patterns mll was constructed to simulate the feedback processes between humans herds and land management decisions vegetation growth nutrient cycling and water flows animal performance as well as human livelihoods in pastoral savannah land use systems as influenced by the biophysical and economic environment the overall aim is to enable the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of the savannah land use system and herders livelihoods to external drivers including climatic extremes reduced land access uptake of new economic activities land conversion and population pressure the rationale for building the model was to explore and identify patterns of system behavior that result from combining process knowledge including under counterfactual situations model development was not primarily pattern driven but rather process knowledge driven nevertheless we expect the model to be able to reproduce observed and plausible patterns in system behavior namely quantitative relationships and feedback dynamics between herd size grazing area rainfall grass regrowth depletion and soil nutrient dynamics that correspond to local knowledge empirical observation or generic scientific experience specific quantities and even dynamic patterns that can be used for evaluation are not necessarily universal but may depend on local circumstances and are hence discussed for our case study specifically results section not in this general model description 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales mll comprises the following entities a human agents herder households characterized by the state variables livestock owned herds managed land access cash reserves household composition and observed landscape state as well as behavioural parameters governing decisions and expectations b animals here cattle characterized by breed sex age body weight condition gestation status lactation stage feed intake nutritional requirements and nutrient excretion c herds collectives of animals characterized by their position in the landscape and parameters governing their potential movement and feed intake d landscape cells characterized by location topography local drain direction land use and sub entities vegetation with plant growth state variables and parameters and soil with state variables and parameters describing water flows carbon and nutrient cycling and e grazing units at which access rights of agents and monthly herd movement are defined a grazing unit typically consists of various map cells pixels in the model scales raster based spatial resolution i e pixel size is flexible and chosen to be 9 ha for the simulations in the present study temporal resolution for plant growth soil processes grazing and herd movement is one day animal states are updated and herd management and livelihood decisions are taken on a monthly basis 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling fig 1 provides an overview of the feedbacks in the model system how they are distributed over the three coupled models and which state variables are communicating between components in mll a herder agent makes land herd and household management decisions at the beginning of each month the agent decides which animals to sell or slaughter how to subdivide the remaining animals into herds and within which grazing units it will let these herds roam in addition it decides on milk sales grain purchases for human consumption food consumption non food expenditure and cash savings these decisions occur simultaneously as part of one agent optimization problem which is solved by mpmas per herder household for each herd pasture biomass demand and excreta deposition are then projected for the upcoming month by livsim on each day of the month lucia first simulates plant growth and soil processes for each cell based on biomass quantity and quality at the current location herds move autonomously between cells within the grazing units selected by the herder agent for the current month the herd grazes and the quantity and quality of excreta is determined by pasture quantity and quality and affects vegetation and soil state at its location once all days of a month have been simulated livsim updates the state of all animals in the herds as a result of actual forage quality and consumption during the month the updated herd and grassland states are observed by the herder agents and form the basis for their individual management decisions at the beginning of the following month 2 2 design concepts basic principles emergence and observation mll combines process based plant physiology and growth soil and som related processes and nutrient and energy metabolism of the animals and their reproduction with a conceptualization of human behaviour that is rooted in bounded rationality and considers multiple objectives of herder activities it is designed to simulate grassland and soil state including temporal pasture degradation herd size and composition and herder food security income and wealth as emergent properties of the system adaptation and objectives a herder agent uses constrained optimization to adapt its monthly decisions on herd management to the states of herd grassland cash reserves household demands and prices in order to satisfy multiple objectives which partly reflect immediate utility criteria and partly precautionary rules to ensure long term viability these objectives are i meeting the household minimum cereal for human consumption milk meat and non food expenditure demands ii keeping a minimum reproductive herd size iii keeping a minimum reserve of cash savings iv selling cattle not used for breeding at a well marketable age v keeping as many animals as possible for reproductive purposes as in kind savings and for social status and vi maximize discretionary spending and or saving i e spending beyond the minimum household demands and saving beyond minimum cash reserve objectives are associated with utility weights to allow for prioritisation if they cannot be fulfilled at the same time herd movement within an assigned grazing unit follows fixed rules based on observed standing biomass and herd biomass demand in the current grazing paddock pixel while target pixels depend on standing biomass quality sensing prediction learning a herder observes the state of pasture herd household and prices at the moment he or she takes the monthly decisions to decide which animals to sell or keep the herder agent predicts the utility value of the animal in the following month based on the current state of the animal and current prices interaction herds and animals compete for pasture if grazing on the same paddock i e pixel the available pasture is divided proportionally to feed demand estimated based on the intake module of livsim between herds and between animals within one herd in principle herder agents compete for grazing grounds but they try to avoid competition by keeping herds apart if enough free paddocks are available within their accessible area collectives herds as collectives of animals are endogenously formed by the herder agent considering restrictions in movement for specific animal types e g calves lactating animals accompanying herders and pasture availability in reality pastoralist communities take collective resource management decisions e g by defining exclosures for dry season grazing or for keeping young animals these decisions are currently not endogenously modelled but imposed as exogenous access rules stochasticity both livsim and mpmas allow stochastic simulation of mortality fertility and newborns sex of animals resp household members for the present study these variables were simulated deterministically in livsim while household composition in mpmas was kept constant 2 3 details 2 3 1 initialization at the start of the model simulation household composition cash reserves and herd composition are initialised based on existing information on the study area vegetation and soil state are initialized based on field and literature data 2 3 2 input external boundary conditions considered in the model system are daily weather monthly prices and seasonal grazing unit access rules defined by herder communities 2 3 3 submodel herder decisions mpmas to simulate pastoralist systems we extended the newest version of mpmas troost et al 2022 mössinger et al 2022 to allow for monthly rather than yearly decision intervals communal land ownership community based access rights to land and competitive use of pastoral areas also we added decision components for individual animal states herd formation and movement and interfaces to exchange herd and grassland state as well as herd movement rules with lucia and livsim monthly each herder agent solves a multi objective mixed integer programming mo mip problem piecewise linear penalty functions weigh different degrees of not meeting the six individual objectives mentioned in design concepts against each other and establish a priority order for example the agent might be willing to reduce non food expenditure by 70 before starting to reduce cereal consumption if that does not suffice the agent might prefer to first reduce cereal consumption by up to 10 before further reducing non food expenditure generally the agent gives priority to the minimum objectives i iii milk and meat are provided by the herd while cereals have to be bought cash for cereal purchase and non food expenditure has to be obtained by selling live cattle or milk to be able to reflect animal state in the mip model animals are categorized into discrete state classes for example the continuous body weight from livsim is categorized into a ten level weight index representing age specific weight classes equally spaced between age specific minimum and maximum weight from 0 severely undernourished close to survival threshold to 9 extremely well fed close to maximum expected body weight the agent prioritises herd size i e keeping animals as soon as minimum household consumption and cash reserve demands have been met this reflects pastoralist culture in which wealth and status are projected by herd size and mutual solidarity rules discourage unnecessary sales hurst et al 2012 but potentially also economic rationality given that high inflation rates and limited access to a bank account complicate monetary savings and may make in cattle savings attractive nevertheless even without immediate need for cash the herder agent will sell male animals not used for breeding before they get too old to obtain a good price or old cows no longer expected to reproduce depending on scenario settings also very weak animals that are close to the age specific minimum weight are sold obj iv cash obtained in this way is not always immediately needed to cover agent minimum objectives and hence available for discretionary spending or saving in different scenarios we explore different rules to prioritise either agent spending or saving in these cases agents can assign and prioritise the grazing units for their herd for the following month considering observed or expected standing pasture biomass distance between grazing units and expected grazing by other herders 2 3 4 submodel animal status livsim for the present study the modified livsim version from bateki and dickhoefer 2020 was used n p k and lignin concentrations in forage biomass are converted to crude protein p and k concentrations per kg of feeds for further metabolization by animals using multiple linear regression models presented in warth et al in prep we estimated metabolizable and gross energy dry matter digestibility and neutral detergent fibre concentrations in the feed at the start of each month animal fertility live weight changes and milk yield are influenced by feed availability i e quantity and quality feed dry matter intake is estimated based on the nutritional status and performance of each animal based on feed intake and digestibility the total amount of fecal dry matter and its n p k contents are simulated as nutrients returned to the soil and indirectly to the vegetation thus livsim simulates nutritional and reproductive status of the herd and mpmas provides herd composition as far as affected by the herder s decisions e g selling slaughtering 2 3 5 submodel plant soil and landscape processes lucia in lucia plant growth is determined by species specific physiology of annual and perennial herbaceous and woody plants soil properties weather data nutrient supply management actions and grazing for the present study lucia was extended with a grassland module that reflects plant dormancy by determining onset and length of the growing period depending on plant available water plants react to grazing by a dynamic shift in assimilate allocation allocation of assimilates to plant organs was amended with a source sink approach that allows preferential resprouting of leaves after defoliation and storage of surplus assimilates in a reserve pool heavy grazing and low net assimilation rates deplete the reserve pool and limit resprouting this may cause plant degradation and eventually plant death once reserves and leaf area are depleted a standing litter pool was introduced so that dry leaf and stem necromass are not directly transferred into the soil litter pools but are available for grazing further details can be found in warth et al 2021 2 3 6 submodel herd movement and grazing the model system was completed by introducing a herd movement and grazing module within the grazing units assigned by mpmas agents on a monthly basis and which typically entail multiple pixels herds can autonomously take daily movement decisions whenever the forage reserve on the currently grazed pixel does not meet herd demand for the next two days the herd moves to the pixel with highest amount of edible crude protein in the above ground biomass edcpagb a combination of forage quantity and quality within the assigned grazing unit should all pixels determined by the herder be depleted below the demand for two days the herd can enter a second round of autonomous paddock selection by edcpagb this mechanism reflects grazing below a threshold that may hamper pasture regeneration which real world herders would avoid if possible simulated animals prefer leaves over fruits stems and dead standing biomass which change in proportion during plant development this herbivore selectivity depends on animal species and grazing preference forage nutritional quality crude protein lignin and p concentrations varies with plant development stage up to two plant species e g grass under acacia sp can grow on a pixel and are grazed proportionally according to their crude protein concentrations and relative palatability accessibility 2 3 7 technical implementation of coupling and model availability both lucia and livsim are implemented in python which allows the livsim component to be used directly by lucia in process multiple non spatial livsim instances are run simultaneously each representing a single herd in contrast mpmas written in c runs as a separate process lucia and mpmas processes communicate via tcp ip connection using a custom protocol for data exchange an overview of the scheduling and data exchange between components is given in fig 1 the mll model used for our study i e software and data is provided for download at http

under https lucia uni hohenheim de and for mpmas under https mp mas uni hohenheim de 2 4 case study and scenarios our case study was located on the borana plateau a region in southern ethiopia dominated by cattle herding but under beginning land use change to cropping 2 4 1 study site model parameterization and calibration we modelled a watershed of approximately 600 km² at an altitude between 1100 and 2200 m above sea level cambisols leptosols luvisols and vertisols are dominant soils glatzle 2012 hengl et al 2017 in the study area fig 2 average annual rainfall between 2004 and 2013 was 645 mm a ranging from 327 to 1343 mm a and the mean temperature was 20 c tuffa and treydte 2017 the landscape for modelling was generated based on elevation soil and land cover maps from primary and secondary data as described by warth et al 2021 and with a pixel length of 300 m i e pixel area 9 ha this resolution was chosen as representative for extensive grazing and produced reasonable herd movement intervals the abovementioned area allowed us to incorporate biophysical data from a previous project and corresponded to dirre site in wario et al 2016 where typical herd movements have been recorded maximum herd distance from a homestead can be set in mpmas but this was not done for this study the selected area and resolution resulted in reasonable model run times we distinguished four vegetation types acacia spp with grassland in the northern leptosol areas pure grassland on lepto and luvisols woodlands in the sw mountain ranges on nitisol and maize in the se vertisol areas see warth et al 2021 for topography map in our simulations animals were allowed to access only the grasslands lucia and livsim were calibrated and tested individually before the coupled simulations were run to calibrate lucia including the newly developed grassland module we used aboveground vegetation data for grassland and acacia spp as described by warth et al 2021 within the modelled landscape we focused as described above on a single herder household by assigning the agent an area of exclusive access to the agent undisturbed by the influence of other herders however we let the agent act as in a community managed open access situation assuming economic rationality that perceives that it cannot exclude others from access beyond access rules specified by the herder community 1 1 in situations where exclusive access is perceived economic theory would expect herders to maximize benefit by possibly not grazing as much pasture as possible at a certain time e g by keeping a lower herd size in order to reap the benefits of better grown pasture at later points of time in open access situations the herder cannot be sure to reap those benefits him herself because other herders might have their herds graze it effects of own grazing on pasture regrowth are hence considered as a potential benefit in the perceived exclusive access situation but not in the perceived open access situation in the latter case only collective action can set boundaries on access optimization of grazing for pasture regrowth has to occur at the collective level e g through reserve areas the size of the exclusive access area 54 ha was chosen such that we expected it to allow for maintenance of a self reproducing herd providing for reliable incomes in a semi arid rangeland region in east africa meshesha et al 2019 report carrying capacities for the borana research area between 0 1 tropical livestock units tlu per hectare ha and year tache and sjaastad 2010 found that pastoralist households considered as rich by the borana owned about 60 tlu on average while self reliant households own 30 tlu thin handed 12 tlu and poor 7 tlu on average thus an initial herd size of 29 heads of cattle on the 54 ha grazing land was chosen allowing herd growth up to a rich level from an initially low stocking rate the livsim version used in the present study already contained breed specific information for boran cattle in the study region rufino 2008 mpmas household composition consumption demands and prices were estimated from the ibli household survey ibli yearbook 2 4 2 scenarios to explore model feedbacks and system stability under a variety of external stress and behavioural assumptions we ran a combination of scenarios table 2 representing climate change i e increased frequency of dry years access to different extent of grazing areas and varying cattle prices relative to grain prices as well as potential herders mitigation strategies dry season reserves emergency selling saving behaviour in response to cattle conditions or meat milk shortages during fodder limitations simulations were run for 20 years while only six selected map cells were made accessible to our simulated herder all map cells of the watershed were simulated two weather scenarios were created one representing typical rainfall regime and the other prolonged periodic drought conditions as observed in the area the typical rain scenario was built from recordings by the national meteorological agency of ethiopia for nearby stations yabelo see tuffa and treydte 2017 in 2014 total 526 mm and mega lat 4 07 lon 38 32 in 2016 gap filled total 463 mm combined into a 5 year sequence 2016 2014 2014 2014 2016 these years represented a drier and a wetter year derived from nearly complete measurement data this 5 year period was looped four times for the drought scenario all rain events in years 3 and 4 of every 5 year period were reduced to 60 fig 3 bottom this resulted in an artificial drought dataset that excluded effects of changes in rainfall distribution air temperature and reference evapotranspiration et0 were obtained from weather station recordings in madhecho starting in august 2012 raw data by seckinger 2014 and radiation from satellite data pfeifroth et al 2019 these data were available for one year and looped 20 times for our scenario runtime we explored two different management responses to drought as a community response we considered the declaration of reserve areas that are not grazed during the rainy season and opened only during the dry season reserved area wario et al 2016 as an individual agent response we distinguished three emergency selling assumptions that control whether the agent pre emptively sells animals in the lowest age specific weight class or keeps them even if they might die of hunger soon drought resilience theoretically also depends on an agent s propensity to save income and keep cash reserves which depends on unobserved individual preferences while we originally compared many different prioritization schemes for discretionary spending saving behaviour differences in simulation results between most schemes were small and we focused our discussion in this article on two extreme schemes only limited spending in which non food spending is governed by a monthly minimum and maximum and all remaining cash is saved and minimal saving with all money except for a cash reserve equivalent to one month of grain expenditure being immediately spent 3 results 3 1 herd size development in a first step of analysis of the simulation results we focus on climate size of accessible grazing area and different meat price scenarios because these had a strong impact on herd dynamics and demonstrate well the range of outputs achieved in the typical rainfall scenario after an initial herd growth herd size in the examples with 54 ha of accessible grazing area remained close to 90 heads the upper limit set by the agent s household labour capacity with a fairly stable composition of decently fed animals body weight index 4 out of 9 fig 4 a and c in the middle of the 20 year simulation relative body weight modestly deteriorated and subsequently herd size dropped to 55 heads thereafter relative body weight and herd size recovered with more intensive droughts herd size oscillated between 45 and 75 heads in approximately 4 year intervals associated with a shift between a very poorly fed herd body weight index 2 and a quite well fed herd fig 4b and d dry season reserves softened the intermediate drop in herd sizes and maintained a higher more stable relative herd body weight in the standard prices scenarios fig 4e and g their effect in the drought scenario however was ambiguous fig 4f and h the cattle meat price scenarios 50 price reduction did not alter the general pattern of herd development in the 54 ha scenarios just somewhat shifting herd size peaks when the grazing area was reduced to only 27 ha the herd size was reduced to around 30 animals under typical rainfall and less than 27 heads under drought conditions fig 4i k and l when increased drought stress and extended low cattle sales prices occurred simultaneously the herd and herder agent family could not be sustained on 27 ha fig 4m the observed trends in herd development resulted from multiple feedback loops between pasture herd and herder to disentangle the individual effects we will describe the responses of each subsystem to the development in the other subsystems in detail in the following sections 3 2 grassland dynamics 3 2 1 above ground biomass related to herd body weight above ground biomass agb under grazing oscillated seasonally between 0 01 and 1 5 mg dry matter ha when herders had access to the full area the agb long term trend remained stable full recovery after grazing over the 20 year simulation period fig 5 a h in the drought scenarios agb declined for extended periods to near zero in drought years with corresponding reductions in herd body weight fig 5b d f and h peak agb was higher in the drought scenarios compared to the respective corresponding typical rainfall regime particularly during times of reduced grazing pressure this may be explained with reduced stocking rates as indicated by reduced herd size in fig 4 and body weight fig 5 due to sales or starvation under the scenarios of limited grazing area 27 ha or 3 pixels combined with drought fig 5k and m the herd did not fully recover after the first drought in year 3 for example depletion of the pasture resource on all three pixels under drought between days 900 and 1100 led to a drop of herd body weight from 8000 to 5000 mg fig 5k or even complete loss of the herd fig 5m when drought was combined with low meat price and hence increased selling of animals the loss of herd body weight was also reflected in the individual animals body weight light colour in fig 4k and m after herd collapse pasture agb recovered beyond its initial grazed levels fig 5m as plant growth at the beginning of the rainy seasons rising limbs was undisturbed by grazing 3 2 2 feedback between herd body weight grazing and vegetation during most periods the quantity of grazed vegetation was determined by the demand rather than the supply side i e more pasture was available than could be consumed hence dynamics of grazed agb closely matched those of herd body weight which was linearly related to potential uptake of pasture rather than seasonal patterns fig 6 periods with very low amounts of grazed pasture occurred more frequently in the typical rainfall scenario fig 6a where herd body weight continuously rose to 16 18 mg combined with normal seasonal low rainfall periods under severe drought conditions fig 6b herd body weight abruptly dropped during dry years and so did pasture consumption the fact that reductions in herd weight preceded reductions in consumption may be an indicator of herders foresight to sell part of the herd before pasture would become limiting when pasture agb became limiting grazed vegetation live and dead material was larger than agb i e only living material meaning that herds resorted exclusively to consuming available standing litter these situations occurred regularly under the typical rainfall scenario once herd body weight had built up fig 7 a but only during few extremely dry years in the corresponding drought scenario fig 7b situations with very low quantities of grazed biomass i e a high proportion of standing litter occurred more frequently during the typical rainfall scenario this is reflected by frequent herd movement changing graph colours in fig 7 3 2 3 nutritional quality and selective grazing of pasture although agb is quantitatively limiting during dry seasons tropical pastures are often additionally of low quality cattle grazed selectively preferring leaves over stems seeds and standing litter compared to the typical rainfall scenario fig 8 a the drought scenario regularly caused break down of biomass consumption fig 8b periods when cattle fed mainly on stems and standing litter were more frequent in the typical rainfall scenario additionally seasonally a shift from leaf to stem biomass occurred in both scenarios during rainy seasons a fraction of stems and standing litter was always consumed as part of our scenario settings reflecting imperfect discrimination of cattle between leaves and stems the simulated changes in grazed plant composition resulted consequently in altered forage quality due to different nutritional qualities of different plant fractions the resulting average crude protein concentration of the grazed biomass oscillated between 10 to 19 while neutral detergent fibre ndf concentration varied between 50 67 impacting sensitive on animal performance data not shown 3 2 4 the effect of access to grazing areas on agb regrowth we analysed the effect of different paddock access rules on regrowth of agb resilience to grazing comparing scenarios of year round full access vs seasonally limited access to dry reserves both under reduced meat prices and drought stress conditions shown in fig 5d and h on pixel 50 89 where part of the land was set aside from grazing during rainy seasons agb was in most years preserved for a longer time into the dry season fig 9 a in contrast to pixel 50 89 average available agb across all six grazed pixels fig 9b hardly differed between both access scenarios indicating that animals could partly compensate for limited access however during periods of increasing stocking rates during the last five years agb in the scenario with set aside land appeared to be more resilient to overgrazing 3 3 animal performance the cattle productive performance i e body weight gain and milk yield was influenced by the changes in quantity of forage biomass available over time in all scenarios for example under full area access 54 ha a higher individual animal productive performance was observed under the typical rainfall fig 10 a compared to the drought fig 10b scenario animal performance was most strongly influenced by limitations in metabolizable energy me supply while under typical rainfall a seasonally short period of low me supply and hence me intake only moderately reduced growth performance me intake was lower than maintenance requirements though never zero over prolonged periods up to three months in the drought scenario which lead to losses in body weight even though directly after the severe drought me supply to and me intake of individual animals were seasonally less limited than in the typical rainfall scenario due to a lower stocking rate and thus reduced inter animal competition animal reproductive performance was limited due to overall insufficient body condition reduced me intake during periods of forage shortage not only affected body condition and animal body weight gain but also cattle reproductive performance mean age at calving or mean number of calves born in the herd were on average only slightly reduced by drought scenarios it must be considered that the differences in total number of calves in a herd table 3 are the combined result of altered reproductive performance and herders management i e sale of animals under the two climate scenarios as discussed below in addition animals produced more milk under the typical rainfall than the drought scenario 3 4 herd management and herder income fig 11 compares the different emergency selling and spending savings strategies under extended drought conditions illustrating the development of the herd composition in terms of age sex and pregnancy or lactation state we can observe cycles in the number of both pregnant and lactating animals subsumed in one class in the graph in the herd and with a slight lag in the presence of young animals this cyclic behaviour is a consequence of the reduction or delay in reproduction of cows due to the above shown recurrent drought induced fodder stress situations in these scenarios that led to a lack of young animals up to two years of age once previous generations have been sold males or matured females the agent s default emergency selling strategy male and older female animals only fig 11c and i led to more abrupt herd size reductions than not selling weak animals at all fig 11a and g since more animals were sold than would eventually die of weakness before being sold at conventional timing fig a1 in the appendix we also observe that selling all low weight animals full emergency selling led to lower average herd sizes fig 11e and l in earlier cycles and to complete herd breakdown when only 27 ha were accessible fig 11f as table 4 shows in the drought scenario the default emergency selling strategy increased the herder s overall income measured as the accumulated expenditure and final savings of the agent due to a somewhat faster replacement of older female animals and periodically reduced stocking rates reserving half the area for grazing in the dry season increased overall income under drought conditions or in combination with a minimal saving strategy in the same way the agent s minimal savings strategy generated higher overall incomes due to faster replacement of older female animals however it led to a highly variable spending pattern with considerably more months without any non food expenditure compared with a more evenly distributed spending under the limited spending scenario see table 4 and fig b1 in the appendix the minimal savings strategy led to herd breakdown at 27 ha fig 11h k and m cereal shortages were negligible except in those scenarios that showed herd breakdown 4 discussion our working hypotheses were that we can construct an integrated model system that a simulates coupled key dynamics of herd size and composition grassland depletion and recovery and herder livelihoods as emergent endogenous outcomes from process based system knowledge b achieves plausible orders of magnitude and c is not over constrained but shows plausible reactions to external drivers 4 1 plausibility of simulation outcomes given access to land that allows for a herd size characterized as rich and resilient by local herders at typical local stocking rates the herder was able to sustain a corresponding herd size in the long run under economic or climatic pressure at peak herd size a stocking density of about 1 3 tlu ha was reached which is considered the upper carrying capacity under common grazing conditions in the area meshesha et al 2019 at the same time mll could reproduce herd breakdown when extended external pressure such as frequent severe droughts as expected under future climate change conditions was combined with a minimal saving strategy and reduced area access corresponding to herd sizes considered vulnerable by local herders area access could generally reduce by increasing population pressure or conversion of grassland to cropping areas in reality herd recovery is then often supported by gifts from other herders tache and sjaastad 2010 simulated herd size and dynamics under the different scenarios can hence be considered plausible simulated agb under grazing 0 1 4 mg ha varied within expected ranges warth et al 2020 and increased when grazing ceased nutritional quality of available forage was mostly within the upper range of values reported for the area e g cp 60 200 g kg 1 dm ndf 170 750 g kg 1 dm of individual available forage plants abebe et al 2012 and predictions could be improved in the future by better considering plant physiological effects e g age nutrient remobilization as shown in fig 5 pastures reacted sensitive to drought stress and high stocking rates and regenerated when the latter were reduced e g by selling or death of cattle as expected grazing intervals on individual paddocks pixels decreased during stress periods dry seasons droughts high stocking rate fig 6 simulated vegetation performance and feedbacks can thus be considered plausible cattle growth and reproductive performance were mostly in close agreement to literature values for example mean age at first calving was 5 2 years in our simulations under typical rainfall compared to 4 9 years reported by takele gebissa 2014 our simulated mean milk yield per lactation was with 369 kg per cow and lactation lower compared with the 473 kg reported by duguma et al 2012 but it was still within the surveyed range by takele gebissa 2014 on the other hand milk yields predicted by mll were clearly sensitive to drought with an average reduction of 22 per lactation and cow compared to the typical rainfall scenario reflecting the interplay between availability and nutritional quality of forage e g increased proportion of consumed standing litter under drought conditions and consequently the reduced forage intake and use in cows the detailed coverage of biophysical processes and behavioural rules enables mll to capture how agent herd management decisions may have subtle not directly obvious feedbacks selling very weak animals before they die ensures that the herder agent receives at least some income to cover consumption demands but may also slow down or even endanger herd recovery if female animals are sold that might have recovered and then contributed to reproduction during good times when mostly well nourished animals are sold each animal receives a better price and can cover consumption demands for a longer time so animals can be sold at a slower rate this creates an economic feedback which accelerates simulated herd growth in times of favourable climatic conditions and also accelerates herd size decline during times of water stress thus the coupled mll shows good potential to contribute valuable evidence to the current debate on herders mitigation strategies to cope with ongoing and future climate change setting aside grazing land during rainy seasons to create reserves for dry seasons appears to be an effective strategy for more severe droughts in borana dry reserves are often located close to reliable dry season freshwater sources to minimize walking distances they form an integral part of management wario et al 2016 2015 our simulations do currently not consider drinking water access for animals potentially underestimating the effect of dry conditions as well as the benefits of dry reserves close to water sources care has to be taken however when interpreting income effects of agent management strategies such as the minimal savings and emergency selling strategies discussed here that rely on feedbacks of earlier extraction of animals and consequently reduced stocking rates on the nutritional status of the remaining herd our simulations used an artificial exclusive access scenario in which the herder alone is able to reap the benefits of reduced herd sizes in open access situations this is not guaranteed as other herders might not have reduced their herd size thus reducing or even reversing potential benefits this is also the reason why we did not simulate the herder to anticipate and optimize grassland recovery as in an open access situation the agent only reacts to developments with a time lag 4 2 niche of the mll framework added value and necessary amendments the integration of lucia and livsim provides dynamic feedback between vegetation biomass and quality n p k lignin contents animal nutrition quantity and quality of excreta as well as soil fertility status this feedback loop is an achievement compared with models with uni directional information flows as e g in the set up used by descheemaeker et al 2018 variables are updated daily and lucia accounts for position and lateral water matter and nutrient flows in the landscape local accumulation of plant nutrients in the landscape depletion of vegetation biomass and degradation of soils can thus be captured using mll on the other hand degradation of soils by trampling and compaction still need to be included in lucia the capability to account for plant quality in response to seasons and grazing requires specific field data for model calibration which are not frequently measured lignification as an effect of plant aging is not yet included in lucia compared with many ecological models lucia due to its origin from a crop model is relatively detailed regarding plant physiology e g plant nutrition water stress and response to meteorological inputs it also includes detailed hydrological and soil processes at landscape level trophic mechanisms are simulated in more detail in mll than in other coupled plant animal human models e g scheiter et al 2019 scheiter and higgins 2012 allowing to specifically account for grazing effects on water nutrient and carbon cycling in the landscape on the other hand successional dynamics like bush encroachment endogenous changes in abundance or plants of different age on one pixel are not simulated while two different plant types on one pixel can compete for light water and nutrients plant density and species composition cannot change dynamically instead these would need to be introduced as exogenous land cover change defined grazing positions provide the interface to landscape scale soil processes herd movement is represented in mll by a two level decision mechanism daily response to depletion of fodder availability through lucia and tactical monthly decision by mpmas which a coupling of lucia livsim alone does not provide mpmas further provides a strategic level that can capture dynamic land tenure community level seasonal access rules preferred watering locations post harvest use of croplands and transhumance decisions into distant grazing grounds at monthly resolution the daily movement decisions implemented in lucia ensure operational reaction at the relevant time scale of pasture grazing analogous to the separation of decision levels for crop management in troost et al 2022 they may have to be extended to reflect locations of drinking water sources and maximum daily walking distances the available decision mechanism and the dynamic feedback between models allow mll to flexibly capture many different herd management strategies which are characteristic for pastoralists and reacting to land access soil fertility and vegetation dynamics such strategies include exclosures setting aside grassland reserves for dry seasons stimulating resprouting and avoiding moribund plants by grazing or moving herds to stubble fields after crop harvesting and exploitation of spatio temporal niches among others 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the capability of the coupled mpmas lucia livsim mll to realistically represent complex interactions between a herder agent cattle pasture and the soil in savannah landscapes mll produced plausible outputs for plant growth animal performance and herd dynamics under various selling and land access strategies exogenous cattle prices and rainfall scenarios spatio temporal interactions between grazing animals and plant growth nutrient cycling between plant biomass litter soil animal and faeces as well as pasture depletion and regeneration in response to grazing pressure were plausibly captured by the model as were animal nutritional status body weight milk yield and household income in particular the mll approach demonstrated a unique capacity to realistically capture the impact of different herd and household resource management strategies through accounting for the dynamic feedbacks between the coupled models under climate change conditions our study had been conceptualised as a proof of concept under simplified settings with only one herder agent and one herd in order to address current relevant issues and opportunities in east african savannahs e g conversion of larger pasture areas to cropping systems at various levels of intensification mechanisation or limited herd access to grazing grounds near village areas and during periods of transhumance as well as integrated crop livestock and rotational systems to mention but a few mll and its future model scenarios will be adapted to simulate more complex settings this requires additional model evaluation at higher levels of integration arnold et al 2015 voinov and shugart 2013 the coupled models will further be amended to deal with more sophisticated mutualistic behaviour between herders cooperation vs competition particularly on communal lands and herd movement rules in the landscape our coupling mechanism is based on a previous custom made approach marohn et al 2013b that used a wrapper to couple mpmas and lucia with more models being added to the framework standardised open source approaches like the bmi peckham et al 2013 that support multiple languages and os as well as spatial grid representation will become more and more interesting options for future studies future scenarios will include interactions between several herders and herds on the same land integrated crop shrub livestock systems dynamic agent defined change of land use between farming and pastoral systems these improvements will allow analysing impacts of the changing systems on the environment soil organic matter landscape carbon water and nutrient budgets crop

24319,increasing livestock densities on limited grazing areas in african savannahs lead to resource degradation through overgrazing aggravated by drought assessing herd management strategies over longer periods at landscape scale is important to propose options for sustainable land use this requires an understanding of processes related to hydrology nutrient cycling herd movement pasture degradation and animal resilience that involve dynamic soil plant animal interactions and human decisions about stocking rates livestock purchases and sales we present the coupled model system mpmas lucia livsim mll the combination of a spatially explicit agent based model for human decision making mpmas a spatially distributed landscape model for water flows nutrient cycles and plant growth lucia and a herd model livsim representing grazing body weight nutrition and excreta of individual animals mll represents daily vegetation growth in response to grazing and organic inputs monthly animal performance influenced by forage availability and quality and herders management in response to resource status new modules for selective grazing resprouting of pasture herd movement and model coupling were developed for mll the test case of a pastoral system in the ethiopian borana region demonstrates the capabilities of mll to simulate key soil plant animal human interactions under climate related management scenarios with varying access to grazing land changing cattle prices and different spending saving behaviour of herders 20 year simulations showed the negative impact of consecutive drought years on vegetation biomass on herd development and movement and how reserving grazing areas for dry seasons could mitigate overgrazing and improve income seasonality and drought response of vegetation growth selective grazing of different plant parts resprouting after grazing calving intervals milk yields and lactation in response to forage supply and quality as well as

the areas with highest densities of cattle goat and sheep worldwide gilbert et al 2018 savannahs in subsaharan africa ssa have seen drastic land use and management changes during the last decades hill and guerschman 2020 kibret et al 2016 driven by demographic transition tabutin and schoumaker 2020 large scale investment shankland and gonçalves 2016 and institutional influence ollenburger et al 2016 savannahs in ssa are ecosystems with low carrying capacity fao 2006 additionally pressure on these pasture resources has increased due to expanding crop lands and shrinking grazing areas restricted herd mobility gonin 2016 and increasing livestock populations herrero et al 2012 drought years like 2006 2009 and 2015 in large parts of ethiopia kibret et al 2020 led to acute shortages of animal feed and as a result to resource overuse thus profound changes in ecosystem functions and biome shifts are expected martens et al 2021 the combination of climatic extremes and resource overuse threaten herd populations as economic base of herders limited access to grazing land has already led to violent conflicts in the border region of northern kenya south sudan and southern ethiopia e g human rights watch 2015 strategies to overcome the overuse of natural resources in pastoral systems and related management options at system level require the understanding of underlying biophysical processes to date resource use and recycling between animals plants and soil vegetation regrowth after grazing and drought stress effects on plants are only partially understood in their spatio temporal context complexity increases further as herder decisions interact with biophysical processes as herrero et al 2012 pointed out the agricultural and pastoral sectors are changing at unprecedented rates and are becoming more difficult to project integrated assessments are becoming a key step towards understanding change but increasing in complexity and difficult to put together comprehensively across sectors computer simulation models are increasingly used for the integrated assessment of social ecological systems kolosz et al 2018 because identifying sustainable land use options implies assessing their long term impacts on farm economy and ecosystem functions at the same time shortcomings in existing simulation models have been identified particularly for savannah systems rufino et al 2014 stressed the necessity of developing models that better account for feedback mechanisms between crop and livestock components in integrated systems to facilitate systems thinking whereas rötter et al 2021 identified the need for better integration of economic modelling and mechanistic vegetation modelling at landscape scale to attain more practical relevance 1 2 state

behaviour and adaptive capacity of animals to changing environmental conditions as gaps in grassland ruminant models warth et al 2020 compared 12 physiological and ecological plant animal models for savannah ecosystems and found that plant plant competition effects on tree seedling recruitment trampling and seed dispersal by animals herd movement land use change luc and management effects on herd mobility and grazing pressure were under represented regarding human decisions savanna has been dynamically coupled to the agent based decuma model boone et al 2011 for the purpose of assessing adaptive capacity of herders under stress caused by drought policy and limited access to land households decide on animal buying and selling and on herd movement driven by forage availability and accessibility herd composition as well as water reservoir and household location scenarios on drought blocked access to grazing land and lease of grazing lands for wheat production have been run using the coupled system regarding crop production however the ensemble is non spatial scheiter et al 2019 coupled a dynamic global vegetation model to an economic model optimizing management options for economic value a social ecological savannah model system focusing on the resilience of rangeland systems under shocks stressors and policy interventions was presented by rasch et al 2016 it combines the animal component of an agent based model accounting for forage consumption body weight gain deaths and births gross et al 2006 with the plant model linrange oomen et al 2016 1 3 models used for the present study the livestock simulator livsim is a non spatial dynamic herd model developed to assess the effect of different feed management strategies on cattle performance based on availability and nutritional quality of feed resources descheemaeker et al 2018 table 1 livsim simulates energy and protein requirements monthly changes in body weight milk yield reproductive rate and mortality amounts and concentrations of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in animal excreta rufino et al 2011 2009 the model has been used to evaluate the impact of different feeding strategies on the life time productivity of dairy cattle in the central highlands of kenya rufino et al 2009 and southern mali de ridder et al 2015 however livsim was developed using feeding recommendations for livestock production systems in temperate regions and a feed intake model from highly productive dairy cattle in the united states thus utilizing available data characterizing tropical livestock production systems bateki and dickhoefer 2020 modified the growth and lactation curves the metabolizable energy and protein requirement estimations and implemented a semi mechanistic statistical feed intake

with a specific grassland module to simulate grazing impact on forage availability and nutritional quality as well as pasture degradation under severe stress conditions allocation of plant growth reserves in response to grazing and spatial animal excreta effects determined by user defined herd movement were included in this model version the present study introduces further improvements regarding selective grazing dynamic nutrient cycling between soil plants som and excreta and dynamic demand driven herd movement the mathematical programming based multi agent systems mpmas schreinemachers and berger 2011 is a bioeconomic multi agent simulation model for human decision making that has been applied to a large variety of crop and crop livestock systems e g berger et al

2007 combined household decision making soil productivity change and a herd model to endogenize livestock feeding and stocking rates in poverty analyses for uganda mpmas and lucia have previously been dynamically coupled marohn et al 2013b to simulate the impact of soil conservation measures in cropping systems on household economy crop yields and environment the coupling of mpmas lucia forms the basis for the newly developed model system mll mpmas lucia livsim presented in this study 1 4 rationale and study aim sustainability assessment of land use options in savannah ecosystems needs to dynamically and spatially explicitly account for water and matter flows and herd movement plant and animal performance and herders cropping and grazing buying and selling decisions the aim of the present study was to develop a tool capable of simulating a grazing management options for sustainable use of forage resources b herd composition and herders household economy c options for preventing resource overuse and environmental degradation in savannah ecosystems and d resilience against shocks such a tool would represent in a process based manner i plant growth depending on climatic and edaphic conditions influenced by grazing and human management ii herd composition performance and mortality in response to pasture availability and quality as well as herd management and iii human decisions taking plant development animal performance and herd status into account when buying or selling animals or moving herds between paddocks for this purpose we coupled the abovementioned mpmas lucia and livsim models into the dynamic and spatially explicit soil plant animal human model system mll to assess pastoral systems over longer time spans at the landscape level the present study focused on the methodological aspects of model coupling and highlights the interactions between plants animals and humans as represented by the three coupled models our working hypotheses were that a the coupled models produce added value in their respective domains compared to simulations with the standalone models i e the interactions produce outputs ideally explain processes that cannot be produced by the individual models b the outputs plausibly reflect observed trends and c the coupled models are sensitive to inputs and interactions and sensible in terms of biophysical processes the following requirements for the coupled model system were defined 1 dynamic process based spatially explicit simulation of soil plant and livestock components in grazing and farming systems accounting for impacts of land use and animal grazing on system level nutrient and water balances 2 a plant module combining agronomic management options and ecological processes such as competition for resources in tree and shrub savannahs adequate representation of seasonal dynamics of forage quantity and quality under grazing and plant stress induced by climatic extremes 3 a herd model suited for sub tropical farming and pastoral systems 4 socio economic decision making processes on herd composition buying and selling of animals herd movement and trade offs with crop production accounting for agent behaviour learning and technology adoption 5 a framework to dynamically couple the individual models integrating their time steps and spatial scales developing highly complex integrated modelling systems to capture multiple biophysical and socioeconomic processes is not a trivial task the attempt often leads to integronsters voinov and shugart 2013 given the many interactions in agricultural and pastoral systems especially model testing calibrating and validating a complex integrated model poses a challenge arnold et al 2015 argued for a step wise procedure initially testing individual components subsequently moving to larger partly integrated units before finally assessing the full model system following this suggestion our study focused on a single herd and household system to keep model interactions traceable and demonstrate the mechanisms of model coupling and system interactions interactions between several hundred human agents have been simulated in a coupled mpmas lucia framework marohn et al 2013b herd herd and plant plant competition have been tested in standalone and coupled model runs they will be addressed in a follow up study 2 materials and methods in the first part of this section we will describe the full logic and capability of mll in general following the odd protocol overview design concepts and details for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2020 2006 in the second part we explain model parameterization and initialization for a proof of concept study to analyse the plausibility of simulated agent environment feedbacks to ensure a thorough evaluation and discussion of the specific feedback loops in focus this parameterization limits complexity for the test case by abstracting from cultivation of crops agent agent and herd herd interactions it focuses on the feedback between a confined rangeland area a cattle herd and the decisions of one single pastoralist household in managing the herd under perceived open access conditions 2 1 overview of the coupled model system 2 1 1 purpose and patterns mll was constructed to simulate the feedback processes between humans herds and land management decisions vegetation growth nutrient cycling and water flows animal performance as well as human livelihoods in pastoral savannah land use systems as influenced by the biophysical and economic environment the overall aim is to enable the analysis of vulnerability and resilience of the savannah land use system and herders livelihoods to external drivers including climatic extremes reduced land access uptake of new economic activities land conversion and population pressure the rationale for building the model was to explore and identify patterns of system behavior that result from combining process knowledge including under counterfactual situations model development was not primarily pattern driven but rather process knowledge driven nevertheless we expect the model to be able to reproduce observed and plausible patterns in system behavior namely quantitative relationships and feedback dynamics between herd size grazing area rainfall grass regrowth depletion and soil nutrient dynamics that correspond to local knowledge empirical observation or generic scientific experience specific quantities and even dynamic patterns that can be used for evaluation are not necessarily universal but may depend on local circumstances and are hence discussed for our case study specifically results section not in this general model description 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales mll comprises the following entities a human agents herder households characterized by the state variables livestock owned herds managed land access cash reserves household composition and observed landscape state as well as behavioural parameters governing decisions and expectations b animals here cattle characterized by breed sex age body weight condition gestation status lactation stage feed intake nutritional requirements and nutrient excretion c herds collectives of animals characterized by their position in the landscape and parameters governing their potential movement and feed intake d landscape cells characterized by location topography local drain direction land use and sub entities vegetation with plant growth state variables and parameters and soil with state variables and parameters describing water flows carbon and nutrient cycling and e grazing units at which access rights of agents and monthly herd movement are defined a grazing unit typically consists of various map cells pixels in the model scales raster based spatial resolution i e pixel size is flexible and chosen to be 9 ha for the simulations in the present study temporal resolution for plant growth soil processes grazing and herd movement is one day animal states are updated and herd management and livelihood decisions are taken on a monthly basis 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling fig 1 provides an overview of the feedbacks in the model system how they are distributed over the three coupled models and which state variables are communicating between components in mll a herder agent makes land herd and household management decisions at the beginning of each month the agent decides which animals to sell or slaughter how to subdivide the remaining animals into herds and within which grazing units it will let these herds roam in addition it decides on milk sales grain purchases for human consumption food consumption non food expenditure and cash savings these decisions occur simultaneously as part of one agent optimization problem which is solved by mpmas per herder household for each herd pasture biomass demand and excreta deposition are then projected for the upcoming month by livsim on each day of the month lucia first simulates plant growth and soil processes for each cell based on biomass quantity and quality at the current location herds move autonomously between cells within the grazing units selected by the herder agent for the current month the herd grazes and the quantity and quality of excreta is determined by pasture quantity and quality and affects vegetation and soil state at its location once all days of a month have been simulated livsim updates the state of all animals in the herds as a result of actual forage quality and consumption during the month the updated herd and grassland states are observed by the herder agents and form the basis for their individual management decisions at the beginning of the following month 2 2 design concepts basic principles emergence and observation mll combines process based plant physiology and growth soil and som related processes and nutrient and energy metabolism of the animals and their reproduction with a conceptualization of human behaviour that is rooted in bounded rationality and considers multiple objectives of herder activities it is designed to simulate grassland and soil state including temporal pasture degradation herd size and composition and herder food security income and wealth as emergent properties of the system adaptation and objectives a herder agent uses constrained optimization to adapt its monthly decisions on herd management to the states of herd grassland cash reserves household demands and prices in order to satisfy multiple objectives which partly reflect immediate utility criteria and partly precautionary rules to ensure long term viability these objectives are i meeting the household minimum cereal for human consumption milk meat and non food expenditure demands ii keeping a minimum reproductive herd size iii keeping a minimum reserve of cash savings iv selling cattle not used for breeding at a well marketable age v keeping as many animals as possible for reproductive purposes as in kind savings and for social status and vi maximize discretionary spending and or saving i e spending beyond the minimum household demands and saving beyond minimum cash reserve objectives are associated with utility weights to allow for prioritisation if they cannot be fulfilled at the same time herd movement within an assigned grazing unit follows fixed rules based on observed standing biomass and herd biomass demand in the current grazing paddock pixel while target pixels depend on standing biomass quality sensing prediction learning a herder observes the state of pasture herd household and prices at the moment he or she takes the monthly decisions to decide which animals to sell or keep the herder agent predicts the utility value of the animal in the following month based on the current state of the animal and current prices interaction herds and animals compete for pasture if grazing on the same paddock i e pixel the available pasture is divided proportionally to feed demand estimated based on the intake module of livsim between herds and between animals within one herd in principle herder agents compete for grazing grounds but they try to avoid competition by keeping herds apart if enough free paddocks are available within their accessible area collectives herds as collectives of animals are endogenously formed by the herder agent considering restrictions in movement for specific animal types e g calves lactating animals accompanying herders and pasture availability in reality pastoralist communities take collective resource management decisions e g by defining exclosures for dry season grazing or for keeping young animals these decisions are currently not endogenously modelled but imposed as exogenous access rules stochasticity both livsim and mpmas allow stochastic simulation of mortality fertility and newborns sex of animals resp household members for the present study these variables were simulated deterministically in livsim while household composition in mpmas was kept constant 2 3 details 2 3 1 initialization at the start of the model simulation household composition cash reserves and herd composition are initialised based on existing information on the study area vegetation and soil state are initialized based on field and literature data 2 3 2 input external boundary conditions considered in the model system are daily weather monthly prices and seasonal grazing unit access rules defined by herder communities 2 3 3 submodel herder decisions mpmas to simulate pastoralist systems we extended the newest version of mpmas troost et al 2022 mössinger et al 2022 to allow for monthly rather than yearly decision intervals communal land ownership community based access rights to land and competitive use of pastoral areas also we added decision components for individual animal states herd formation and movement and interfaces to exchange herd and grassland state as well as herd movement rules with lucia and livsim monthly each herder agent solves a multi objective mixed integer programming mo mip problem piecewise linear penalty functions weigh different degrees of not meeting the six individual objectives mentioned in design concepts against each other and establish a priority order for example the agent might be willing to reduce non food expenditure by 70 before starting to reduce cereal consumption if that does not suffice the agent might prefer to first reduce cereal consumption by up to 10 before further reducing non food expenditure generally the agent gives priority to the minimum objectives i iii milk and meat are provided by the herd while cereals have to be bought cash for cereal purchase and non food expenditure has to be obtained by selling live cattle or milk to be able to reflect animal state in the mip model animals are categorized into discrete state classes for example the continuous body weight from livsim is categorized into a ten level weight index representing age specific weight classes equally spaced between age specific minimum and maximum weight from 0 severely undernourished close to survival threshold to 9 extremely well fed close to maximum expected body weight the agent prioritises herd size i e keeping animals as soon as minimum household consumption and cash reserve demands have been met this reflects pastoralist culture in which wealth and status are projected by herd size and mutual solidarity rules discourage unnecessary sales hurst et al 2012 but potentially also economic rationality given that high inflation rates and limited access to a bank account complicate monetary savings and may make in cattle savings attractive nevertheless even without immediate need for cash the herder agent will sell male animals not used for breeding before they get too old to obtain a good price or old cows no longer expected to reproduce depending on scenario settings also very weak animals that are close to the age specific minimum weight are sold obj iv cash obtained in this way is not always immediately needed to cover agent minimum objectives and hence available for discretionary spending or saving in different scenarios we explore different rules to prioritise either agent spending or saving in these cases agents can assign and prioritise the grazing units for their herd for the following month considering observed or expected standing pasture biomass distance between grazing units and expected grazing by other herders 2 3 4 submodel animal status livsim for the present study the modified livsim version from bateki and dickhoefer 2020 was used n p k and lignin concentrations in forage biomass are converted to crude protein p and k concentrations per kg of feeds for further metabolization by animals using multiple linear regression models presented in warth et al in prep we estimated metabolizable and gross energy dry matter digestibility and neutral detergent fibre concentrations in the feed at the start of each month animal fertility live weight changes and milk yield are influenced by feed availability i e quantity and quality feed dry matter intake is estimated based on the nutritional status and performance of each animal based on feed intake and digestibility the total amount of fecal dry matter and its n p k contents are simulated as nutrients returned to the soil and indirectly to the vegetation thus livsim simulates nutritional and reproductive status of the herd and mpmas provides herd composition as far as affected by the herder s decisions e g selling slaughtering 2 3 5 submodel plant soil and landscape processes lucia in lucia plant growth is determined by species specific physiology of annual and perennial herbaceous and woody plants soil properties weather data nutrient supply management actions and grazing for the present study lucia was extended with a grassland module that reflects plant dormancy by determining onset and length of the growing period depending on plant available water plants react to grazing by a dynamic shift in assimilate allocation allocation of assimilates to plant organs was amended with a source sink approach that allows preferential resprouting of leaves after defoliation and storage of surplus assimilates in a reserve pool heavy grazing and low net assimilation rates deplete the reserve pool and limit resprouting this may cause plant degradation and eventually plant death once reserves and leaf area are depleted a standing litter pool was introduced so that dry leaf and stem necromass are not directly transferred into the soil litter pools but are available for grazing further details can be found in warth et al 2021 2 3 6 submodel herd movement and grazing the model system was completed by introducing a herd movement and grazing module within the grazing units assigned by mpmas agents on a monthly basis and which typically entail multiple pixels herds can autonomously take daily movement decisions whenever the forage reserve on the currently grazed pixel does not meet herd demand for the next two days the herd moves to the pixel with highest amount of edible crude protein in the above ground biomass edcpagb a combination of forage quantity and quality within the assigned grazing unit should all pixels determined by the herder be depleted below the demand for two days the herd can enter a second round of autonomous paddock selection by edcpagb this mechanism reflects grazing below a threshold that may hamper pasture regeneration which real world herders would avoid if possible simulated animals prefer leaves over fruits stems and dead standing biomass which change in proportion during plant development this herbivore selectivity depends on animal species and grazing preference forage nutritional quality crude protein lignin and p concentrations varies with plant development stage up to two plant species e g grass under acacia sp can grow on a pixel and are grazed proportionally according to their crude protein concentrations and relative palatability accessibility 2 3 7 technical implementation of coupling and model availability both lucia and livsim are implemented in python which allows the livsim component to be used directly by lucia in process multiple non spatial livsim instances are run simultaneously each representing a single herd in contrast mpmas written in c runs as a separate process lucia and mpmas processes communicate via tcp ip connection using a custom protocol for data exchange an overview of the scheduling and data exchange between components is given in fig 1 the mll model used for our study i e software and data is provided for download at http

dominated by cattle herding but under beginning land use change to cropping 2 4 1 study site model parameterization and calibration we modelled a watershed of approximately 600 km² at an altitude between 1100 and 2200 m above sea level cambisols leptosols luvisols and vertisols are dominant soils glatzle 2012 hengl et al 2017 in the study area fig 2 average annual rainfall between 2004 and 2013 was 645 mm a ranging from 327 to 1343 mm a and the mean temperature was 20 c tuffa and treydte 2017 the landscape for modelling was generated based on elevation soil and land cover maps from primary and secondary data as described by warth et al 2021 and with a pixel length of 300 m i e pixel area 9 ha this resolution was chosen as representative for extensive grazing and produced reasonable herd movement intervals the abovementioned area allowed us to incorporate biophysical data from a previous project and corresponded to dirre site in wario et al 2016 where typical herd movements have been recorded maximum herd distance from a homestead can be set in mpmas but this was not done for this study the selected area and resolution resulted in reasonable model run times we distinguished four vegetation types acacia spp with grassland in the northern leptosol areas pure grassland on lepto and luvisols woodlands in the sw mountain ranges on nitisol and maize in the se vertisol areas see warth et al 2021 for topography map in our simulations animals were allowed to access only the grasslands lucia and livsim were calibrated and tested individually before the coupled simulations were run to calibrate lucia including the newly developed grassland module we used aboveground vegetation data for grassland and acacia spp as described by warth et al 2021 within the modelled landscape we focused as described above on a single herder household by assigning the agent an area of exclusive access to the agent undisturbed by the influence of other herders however we let the agent act as in a community managed open access situation assuming economic rationality that perceives that it cannot exclude others from access beyond access rules specified by the herder community 1 1 in situations where exclusive access is perceived economic theory would expect herders to maximize benefit by possibly not grazing as much pasture as possible at a certain time e g by keeping a lower herd size in order to reap the benefits of better grown pasture at later points of time in open access situations the herder cannot be sure to reap those benefits him herself because other herders might have their herds graze it effects of own grazing on pasture regrowth are hence considered as a potential benefit in the perceived exclusive access situation but not in the perceived open access situation in the latter case only collective action can set boundaries on access optimization of grazing for pasture regrowth has to occur at the collective level e g through reserve areas the size of the exclusive access area 54 ha was chosen such that we expected it to allow for maintenance of a self reproducing herd providing for reliable incomes in a semi arid rangeland region in east africa meshesha et al 2019 report carrying capacities for the borana research area between 0 1 tropical livestock units tlu per hectare ha and year tache and sjaastad 2010 found that pastoralist households considered as rich by the borana owned about 60 tlu on average while self reliant households own 30 tlu thin handed 12 tlu and poor 7 tlu on average thus an initial herd size of 29 heads of cattle on the 54 ha grazing land was chosen allowing herd growth up to a rich level from an initially low stocking rate the livsim version used in the present study already contained breed specific information for boran cattle in the study region rufino 2008 mpmas household composition consumption demands and prices were estimated from the ibli household survey ibli yearbook 2 4 2 scenarios to explore model feedbacks and system stability under a variety of external stress and behavioural assumptions we ran a combination of scenarios table 2 representing climate change i e increased frequency of dry years access to different extent of grazing areas and varying cattle prices relative to grain prices as well as potential herders mitigation strategies dry season reserves emergency selling saving behaviour in response to cattle conditions or meat milk shortages during fodder limitations simulations were run for 20 years while only six selected map cells were made accessible to our simulated herder all map cells of the watershed were simulated two weather scenarios were created one representing typical rainfall regime and the other prolonged periodic drought conditions as observed in the area the typical rain scenario was built from recordings by the national meteorological agency of ethiopia for nearby stations yabelo see tuffa and treydte 2017 in 2014 total 526 mm and mega lat 4 07 lon 38 32 in 2016 gap filled total 463 mm combined into a 5 year sequence 2016 2014 2014 2014 2016 these years represented a drier and a wetter year derived from nearly complete measurement data this 5 year period was looped four times for the drought scenario all rain events in years 3 and 4 of every 5 year period were reduced to 60 fig 3 bottom this resulted in an artificial drought dataset that excluded effects of changes in rainfall distribution air temperature and reference evapotranspiration et0 were obtained from weather station recordings in madhecho starting in august 2012 raw data by seckinger 2014 and radiation from satellite data pfeifroth et al 2019 these data were available for one year and looped 20 times for our scenario runtime we explored two different management responses to drought as a community response we considered the declaration of reserve areas that are not grazed during the rainy season and opened only during the dry season reserved area wario et al 2016 as an individual agent response we distinguished three emergency selling assumptions that control whether the agent pre emptively sells animals in the lowest age specific weight class or keeps them even if they might die of hunger soon drought resilience theoretically also depends on an agent s propensity to save income and keep cash reserves which depends on unobserved individual preferences while we originally compared many different prioritization schemes for discretionary spending saving behaviour differences in simulation results between most schemes were small and we focused our discussion in this article on two extreme schemes only limited spending in which non food spending is governed by a monthly minimum and maximum and all remaining cash is saved and minimal saving with all money except for a cash reserve equivalent to one month of grain expenditure being immediately spent 3 results 3 1 herd size development in a first step of analysis of the simulation results we focus on climate size of accessible grazing area and different meat price scenarios because these had a strong impact on herd dynamics and demonstrate well the range of outputs achieved in the typical rainfall scenario after an initial herd growth herd size in the examples with 54 ha of accessible grazing area remained close to 90 heads the upper limit set by the agent s household labour capacity with a fairly stable composition of decently fed animals body weight index 4 out of 9 fig 4 a and c in the middle of the 20 year simulation relative body weight modestly deteriorated and subsequently herd size dropped to 55 heads thereafter relative body weight and herd size recovered with more intensive droughts herd size oscillated between 45 and 75 heads in approximately 4 year intervals associated with a shift between a very poorly fed herd body weight index 2 and a quite well fed herd fig 4b and d dry season reserves softened the intermediate drop in herd sizes and maintained a higher more stable relative herd body weight in the standard prices scenarios fig 4e and g their effect in the drought scenario however was ambiguous fig 4f and h the cattle meat price scenarios 50 price reduction did not alter the general pattern of herd development in the 54 ha scenarios just somewhat shifting herd size peaks when the grazing area was reduced to only 27 ha the herd size was reduced to around 30 animals under typical rainfall and less than 27 heads under drought conditions fig 4i k and l when increased drought stress and extended low cattle sales prices occurred simultaneously the herd and herder agent family could not be sustained on 27 ha fig 4m the observed trends in herd development resulted from multiple feedback loops between pasture herd and herder to disentangle the individual effects we will describe the responses of each subsystem to the development in the other subsystems in detail in the following sections 3 2 grassland dynamics 3 2 1 above ground biomass related to herd body weight above ground biomass agb under grazing oscillated seasonally between 0 01 and 1 5 mg dry matter ha when herders had access to the full area the agb long term trend remained stable full recovery after grazing over the 20 year simulation period fig 5 a h in the drought scenarios agb declined for extended periods to near zero in drought years with corresponding reductions in herd body weight fig 5b d f and h peak agb was higher in the drought scenarios compared to the respective corresponding typical rainfall regime particularly during times of reduced grazing pressure this may be explained with reduced stocking rates as indicated by reduced herd size in fig 4 and body weight fig 5 due to sales or starvation under the scenarios of limited grazing area 27 ha or 3 pixels combined with drought fig 5k and m the herd did not fully recover after the first drought in year 3 for example depletion of the pasture resource on all three pixels under drought between days 900 and 1100 led to a drop of herd body weight from 8000 to 5000 mg fig 5k or even complete loss of the herd fig 5m when drought was combined with low meat price and hence increased selling of animals the loss of herd body weight was also reflected in the individual animals body weight light colour in fig 4k and m after herd collapse pasture agb recovered beyond its initial grazed levels fig 5m as plant growth at the beginning of the rainy seasons rising limbs was undisturbed by grazing 3 2 2 feedback between herd body weight grazing and vegetation during most periods the quantity of grazed vegetation was determined by the demand rather than the supply side i e more pasture was available than could be consumed hence dynamics of grazed agb closely matched those of herd body weight which was linearly related to potential uptake of pasture rather than seasonal patterns fig 6 periods with very low amounts of grazed pasture occurred more frequently in the typical rainfall scenario fig 6a where herd body weight continuously rose to 16 18 mg combined with normal seasonal low rainfall periods under severe drought conditions fig 6b herd body weight abruptly dropped during dry years and so did pasture consumption the fact that reductions in herd weight preceded reductions in consumption may be an indicator of herders foresight to sell part of the herd before pasture would become limiting when pasture agb became limiting grazed vegetation live and dead material was larger than agb i e only living material meaning that herds resorted exclusively to consuming available standing litter these situations occurred regularly under the typical rainfall scenario once herd body weight had built up fig 7 a but only during few extremely dry years in the corresponding drought scenario fig 7b situations with very low quantities of grazed biomass i e a high proportion of standing litter occurred more frequently during the typical rainfall scenario this is reflected by frequent herd movement changing graph colours in fig 7 3 2 3 nutritional quality and selective grazing of pasture although agb is quantitatively limiting during dry seasons tropical pastures are often additionally of low quality cattle grazed selectively preferring leaves over stems seeds and standing litter compared to the typical rainfall scenario fig 8 a the drought scenario regularly caused break down of biomass consumption fig 8b periods when cattle fed mainly on stems and standing litter were more frequent in the typical rainfall scenario additionally seasonally a shift from leaf to stem biomass occurred in both scenarios during rainy seasons a fraction of stems and standing litter was always consumed as part of our scenario settings reflecting imperfect discrimination of cattle between leaves and stems the simulated changes in grazed plant composition resulted consequently in altered forage quality due to different nutritional qualities of different plant fractions the resulting average crude protein concentration of the grazed biomass oscillated between 10 to 19 while neutral detergent fibre ndf concentration varied between 50 67 impacting sensitive on animal performance data not shown 3 2 4 the effect of access to grazing areas on agb regrowth we analysed the effect of different paddock access rules on regrowth of agb resilience to grazing comparing scenarios of year round full access vs seasonally limited access to dry reserves both under reduced meat prices and drought stress conditions shown in fig 5d and h on pixel 50 89 where part of the land was set aside from grazing during rainy seasons agb was in most years preserved for a longer time into the dry season fig 9 a in contrast to pixel 50 89 average available agb across all six grazed pixels fig 9b hardly differed between both access scenarios indicating that animals could partly compensate for limited access however during periods of increasing stocking rates during the last five years agb in the scenario with set aside land appeared to be more resilient to overgrazing 3 3 animal performance the cattle productive performance i e body weight gain and milk yield was influenced by the changes in quantity of forage biomass available over time in all scenarios for example under full area access 54 ha a higher individual animal productive performance was observed under the typical rainfall fig 10 a compared to the drought fig 10b scenario animal performance was most strongly influenced by limitations in metabolizable energy me supply while under typical rainfall a seasonally short period of low me supply and hence me intake only moderately reduced growth performance me intake was lower than maintenance requirements though never zero over prolonged periods up to three months in the drought scenario which lead to losses in body weight even though directly after the severe drought me supply to and me intake of individual animals were seasonally less limited than in the typical rainfall scenario due to a lower stocking rate and thus reduced inter animal competition animal reproductive performance was limited due to overall insufficient body condition reduced me intake during periods of forage shortage not only affected body condition and animal body weight gain but also cattle reproductive performance mean age at calving or mean number of calves born in the herd were on average only slightly reduced by drought scenarios it must be considered that the differences in total number of calves in a herd table 3 are the combined result of altered reproductive performance and herders management i e sale of animals under the two climate scenarios as discussed below in addition animals produced more milk under the typical rainfall than the drought scenario 3 4 herd management and herder income fig 11 compares the different emergency selling and spending savings strategies under extended drought conditions illustrating the development of the herd composition in terms of age sex and pregnancy or lactation state we can observe cycles in the number of both pregnant and lactating animals subsumed in one class in the graph in the herd and with a slight lag in the presence of young animals this cyclic behaviour is a consequence of the reduction or delay in reproduction of cows due to the above shown recurrent drought induced fodder stress situations in these scenarios that led to a lack of young animals up to two years of age once previous generations have been sold males or matured females the agent s default emergency selling strategy male and older female animals only fig 11c and i led to more abrupt herd size reductions than not selling weak animals at all fig 11a and g since more animals were sold than would eventually die of weakness before being sold at conventional timing fig a1 in the appendix we also observe that selling all low weight animals full emergency selling led to lower average herd sizes fig 11e and l in earlier cycles and to complete herd breakdown when only 27 ha were accessible fig 11f as table 4 shows in the drought scenario the default emergency selling strategy increased the herder s overall income measured as the accumulated expenditure and final savings of the agent due to a somewhat faster replacement of older female animals and periodically reduced stocking rates reserving half the area for grazing in the dry season increased overall income under drought conditions or in combination with a minimal saving strategy in the same way the agent s minimal savings strategy generated higher overall incomes due to faster replacement of older female animals however it led to a highly variable spending pattern with considerably more months without any non food expenditure compared with a more evenly distributed spending under the limited spending scenario see table 4 and fig b1 in the appendix the minimal savings strategy led to herd breakdown at 27 ha fig 11h k and m cereal shortages were negligible except in those scenarios that showed herd breakdown 4 discussion our working hypotheses were that we can construct an integrated model system that a simulates coupled key dynamics of herd size and composition grassland depletion and recovery and herder livelihoods as emergent endogenous outcomes from process based system knowledge b achieves plausible orders of magnitude and c is not over constrained but shows plausible reactions to external drivers 4 1 plausibility of simulation outcomes given access to land that allows for a herd size characterized as rich and resilient by local herders at typical local stocking rates the herder was able to sustain a corresponding herd size in the long run under economic or climatic pressure at peak herd size a stocking density of about 1 3 tlu ha was reached which is considered the upper carrying capacity under common grazing conditions in the area meshesha et al 2019 at the same time mll could reproduce herd breakdown when extended external pressure such as frequent severe droughts as expected under future climate change conditions was combined with a minimal saving strategy and reduced area access corresponding to herd sizes considered vulnerable by local herders area access could generally reduce by increasing population pressure or conversion of grassland to cropping areas in reality herd recovery is then often supported by gifts from other herders tache and sjaastad 2010 simulated herd size and dynamics under the different scenarios can hence be considered plausible simulated agb under grazing 0 1 4 mg ha varied within expected ranges warth et al 2020 and increased when grazing ceased nutritional quality of available forage was mostly within the upper range of values reported for the area e g cp 60 200 g kg 1 dm ndf 170 750 g kg 1 dm of individual available forage plants abebe et al 2012 and predictions could be improved in the future by better considering plant physiological effects e g age nutrient remobilization as shown in fig 5 pastures reacted sensitive to drought stress and high stocking rates and regenerated when the latter were reduced e g by selling or death of cattle as expected grazing intervals on individual paddocks pixels decreased during stress periods dry seasons droughts high stocking rate fig 6 simulated vegetation performance and feedbacks can thus be considered plausible cattle growth and reproductive performance were mostly in close agreement to literature values for example mean age at first calving was 5 2 years in our simulations under typical rainfall compared to 4 9 years reported by takele gebissa 2014 our simulated mean milk yield per lactation was with 369 kg per cow and lactation lower compared with the 473 kg reported by duguma et al 2012 but it was still within the surveyed range by takele gebissa 2014 on the other hand milk yields predicted by mll were clearly sensitive to drought with an average reduction of 22 per lactation and cow compared to the typical rainfall scenario reflecting the interplay between availability and nutritional quality of forage e g increased proportion of consumed standing litter under drought conditions and consequently the reduced forage intake and use in cows the detailed coverage of biophysical processes and behavioural rules enables mll to capture how agent herd management decisions may have subtle not directly obvious feedbacks selling very weak animals before they die ensures that the herder agent receives at least some income to cover consumption demands but may also slow down or even endanger herd recovery if female animals are sold that might have recovered and then contributed to reproduction during good times when mostly well nourished animals are sold each animal receives a better price and can cover consumption demands for a longer time so animals can be sold at a slower rate this creates an economic feedback which accelerates simulated herd growth in times of favourable climatic conditions and also accelerates herd size decline during times of water stress thus the coupled mll shows good potential to contribute valuable evidence to the current debate on herders mitigation strategies to cope with ongoing and future climate change setting aside grazing land during rainy seasons to create reserves for dry seasons appears to be an effective strategy for more severe droughts in borana dry reserves are often located close to reliable dry season freshwater sources to minimize walking distances they form an integral part of management wario et al 2016 2015 our simulations do currently not consider drinking water access for animals potentially underestimating the effect of dry conditions as well as the benefits of dry reserves close to water sources care has to be taken however when interpreting income effects of agent management strategies such as the minimal savings and emergency selling strategies discussed here that rely on feedbacks of earlier extraction of animals and consequently reduced stocking rates on the nutritional status of the remaining herd our simulations used an artificial exclusive access scenario in which the herder alone is able to reap the benefits of reduced herd sizes in open access situations this is not guaranteed as other herders might not have reduced their herd size thus reducing or even reversing potential benefits this is also the reason why we did not simulate the herder to anticipate and optimize grassland recovery as in an open access situation the agent only reacts to developments with a time lag 4 2 niche of the mll framework added value and necessary amendments the integration of lucia and livsim provides dynamic feedback between vegetation biomass and quality n p k lignin contents animal nutrition quantity and quality of excreta as well as soil fertility status this feedback loop is an achievement compared with models with uni directional information flows as e g in the set up used by descheemaeker et al 2018 variables are updated daily and lucia accounts for position and lateral water matter and nutrient flows in the landscape local accumulation of plant nutrients in the landscape depletion of vegetation biomass and degradation of soils can thus be captured using mll on the other hand degradation of soils by trampling and compaction still need to be included in lucia the capability to account for plant quality in response to seasons and grazing requires specific field data for model calibration which are not frequently measured lignification as an effect of plant aging is not yet included in lucia compared with many ecological models lucia due to its origin from a crop model is relatively detailed regarding plant physiology e g plant nutrition water stress and response to meteorological inputs it also includes detailed hydrological and soil processes at landscape level trophic mechanisms are simulated in more detail in mll than in other coupled plant animal human models e g scheiter et al 2019 scheiter and higgins 2012 allowing to specifically account for grazing effects on water nutrient and carbon cycling in the landscape on the other hand successional dynamics like bush encroachment endogenous changes in abundance or plants of different age on one pixel are not simulated while two different plant types on one pixel can compete for light water and nutrients plant density and species composition cannot change dynamically instead these would need to be introduced as exogenous land cover change defined grazing positions provide the interface to landscape scale soil processes herd movement is represented in mll by a two level decision mechanism daily response to depletion of fodder availability through lucia and tactical monthly decision by mpmas which a coupling of lucia livsim alone does not provide mpmas further provides a strategic level that can capture dynamic land tenure community level seasonal access rules preferred watering locations post harvest use of croplands and transhumance decisions into distant grazing grounds at monthly resolution the daily movement decisions implemented in lucia ensure operational reaction at the relevant time scale of pasture grazing analogous to the separation of decision levels for crop management in troost et al 2022 they may have to be extended to reflect locations of drinking water sources and maximum daily walking distances the available decision mechanism and the dynamic feedback between models allow mll to flexibly capture many different herd management strategies which are characteristic for pastoralists and reacting to land access soil fertility and vegetation dynamics such strategies include exclosures setting aside grassland reserves for dry seasons stimulating resprouting and avoiding moribund plants by grazing or moving herds to stubble fields after crop harvesting and exploitation of spatio temporal niches among others 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the capability of the coupled mpmas lucia livsim mll to realistically represent complex interactions between a herder agent cattle pasture and the soil in savannah landscapes mll produced plausible outputs for plant growth animal performance and herd dynamics under various selling and land access strategies exogenous cattle prices and rainfall scenarios spatio temporal interactions between grazing animals and plant growth nutrient cycling between plant biomass litter soil animal and faeces as well as pasture depletion and regeneration in response to grazing pressure were plausibly captured by the model as were animal nutritional status body weight milk yield and household income in particular the mll approach demonstrated a unique capacity to realistically capture the impact of different herd and household resource management strategies through accounting for the dynamic feedbacks between the coupled models under climate change conditions our study had been conceptualised as a proof of concept under simplified settings with only one herder agent and one herd in order to address current relevant issues and opportunities in east african savannahs e g conversion of larger pasture areas to cropping systems at various levels of intensification mechanisation or limited herd access to grazing grounds near village areas and during periods of transhumance as well as integrated crop livestock and rotational systems to mention but a few mll and its future model scenarios will be adapted to simulate more complex settings this requires additional model evaluation at higher levels of integration arnold et al 2015 voinov and shugart 2013 the coupled models will further be amended to deal with more sophisticated mutualistic behaviour between herders cooperation vs competition particularly on communal lands and herd movement rules in the landscape our coupling mechanism is based on a previous custom made approach marohn et al 2013b that used a wrapper to couple mpmas and lucia with more models being added to the framework standardised open source approaches like the bmi peckham et al 2013 that support multiple languages and os as well as spatial grid representation will become more and more interesting options for future studies future scenarios will include interactions between several herders and herds on the same land integrated crop shrub livestock systems dynamic agent defined change of land use between farming and pastoral systems these improvements will allow analysing impacts of the changing systems on the environment soil organic matter landscape carbon water and nutrient budgets crop
