6720,the uncertainty assessment of the changes in drought characteristics due to climate change has caught the attention of the scientific community this study used gauge based gridded precipitation data obtained from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc to reconstruct historical droughts and downscale future precipitation projected by seven general circulation models gcms of coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 under four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 support vector machine svm and quantile mapping were used for downscaling and gcm bias correction respectively the model performances were assessed based on statistical measures the historical and future projected precipitation data were finally used to characterize the seasonal droughts using standardized precipitation index spi for different crop growing periods the drought severity area frequency saf curves for the historical 1961 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 were developed the uncertainty band of future drought saf curves was estimated using bayesian bootstrap bb at a 95 confidence level as a result svm was successful in downscaling the precipitation of all selected cmip5 gcms the seasonal ensemble of gcms projected an increase in precipitation ranging from 8 to 41 under all scenarios the historical saf curves revealed that for equal drought severity larger areas are affected by droughts having higher return periods future projections of droughts revealed the increase in affected area for lower severity and return period droughts and the decrease for higher severity and return period droughts the uncertainty bands of drought saf curves with higher return periods were found much wider compared to those with lower return periods which indicates more uncertainty in the projection of higher severity and return period droughts keywords seasonal drought severity area frequency cmip5 rcps statistical downscaling arid region 1 introduction drought is likely to become more recurrent and severe in future and can have severe and long lasting impacts on natural and human systems nam et al 2015 rahmat et al 2016 touma et al 2015 droughts can be more acute for semi arid and arid regions forouzani and karami 2010 liu and hwang 2015 the situation can become much worse in the semi arid countries like pakistan where the economy is mainly based on agriculture kazmi et al 2015 miyan 2015 drought is a common phenomenon in pakistan which occurs at least thrice every ten years anjum et al 2012 the country has experienced a number of severe droughts in recent history which were mainly confined to sindh and balochistan provinces of pakistan ashraf and routray 2015 balochistan province covers 44 of the total land of pakistan faced severe droughts in 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1994 and 1998 2002 ahmed et al 2015 the prolonged drought in 1998 2002 reduced crop yields by 60 80 that resulted in severe negative impacts on the economy of the province as well as the whole country sarwar 2008 there is a growing concern in recent years on increasing severity and frequency of droughts in pakistan like in many other parts of asia ahmed et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zahid and rasul 2012 reported a significant increase in heat waves frequency over balochistan which indicates the possibility of more frequent drought in the future therefore it is important to understand the possible changes in future drought characteristics for climate change adaptation and mitigation planning several studies swain and hayhoe 2015 touma et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 wang et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 have been conducted in recent years to project future changes in droughts using coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 general circulation model gcms data however most studies characterized droughts without giving any indication of drought risk during different seasons or cropping periods droughts are found to be significantly damaging when they coincide with cropping seasons mishra and cherkauer 2010 thus it is very important to predict future droughts during cropping seasons to mitigate the impacts in the context of climate change the gcms used for projecting future climate introduce uncertainties in projections therefore it is obvious that drought characterization based on gcm projections contains uncertainties exploring uncertainties and providing reliable information is a major challenge in climate change research kim et al 2015 as the gcm configuration is the main source of uncertainty in climate projections ensembles of gcm projections are used to incorporate uncertainties in impact assessment two main approaches used to assess climate change uncertainties in droughts are perturbed physics ensembles i e projections from different parameterizations of the same model burke and brown 2010 taylor et al 2013 and multi model ensembles burke and brown 2008 dai and zhao 2016 mishra and singh 2009 vidal and wade 2009 the improvements in cmip5 models such as the availability of a large number of projections at higher resolution and better representation of earth system processes have provided greater confidence in climate change projections and opportunity to assess uncertainty using multi model ensemble knutti and sedláček 2013 the drought severity area frequency saf curves henriques and santos 1999 quantitatively relate the values of drought severity areal extent and return period and therefore widely used to represent all characteristics of droughts together loukas and vasiliades 2004 rajsekhar et al 2015 mishra and singh 2009 argued that high uncertainties in the gcm structure and complexities in droughts have made event based drought analysis difficult therefore analysis of future changes in droughts based on saf curves is preferred over the event based drought some studies burke and brown 2010 lee and kim 2013 mishra and singh 2009 considered the uncertainties in future projections of droughts however none of them has assessed the uncertainty within the saf curve this study quantified the uncertainty within the saf curves using bayesian theorem and bootstrap resampling technique efron 1992 rubin 1981 the technique has been recommended to evaluate uncertainty in hydrological or climate models hu et al 2015 the main aim of the present study was to investigate the impacts of climate change on saf curves for the historical and future droughts during four climatic seasons namely early winter november january late winter february april early summer may july and late summer august october and the two major cropping seasons kharif may october and rabi november april in pakistan the gauge based gridded precipitation data provided by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc of the deutscher wetterdienst becker et al 2013 having a resolution of at 0 5 0 5 and seven gcms participating in cmip5 were used for this purpose support vector machine svm was used to downscale coarse resolution gcm precipitation to gpcc scale and quantile mapping qm was used to correct the bias in gcms standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 was used to characterize seasonal droughts the return periods of various severities of droughts were interpolated to derive the saf curves of seasonal droughts for the historical 1961 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area balochistan is situated in the southwestern part of pakistan fig 1 the province is the homeland of around 8 5 million people with a population density of 23 people per km2 gob 2014 the province is the largest region covering an area of 347 000 km2 constituting 44 of the total mass of pakistan more than 85 of the population in the province depends on agriculture for their livelihood ashraf et al 2014 agriculture and livestock sectors play a vital role in the economy and employ about 67 of the labor force hussein 2004 precipitation in the area varies from 30 mm yr in the southwest desert to 397 mm yr in the northeast fig 1 overall the precipitation climatology is divided into 1 early winter november january 2 late winter february april 3 early summer may july and 4 late summer august october ahmed et al 2015 snead 1968 majority of the area belongs to the arid climate followed by hyper arid and semi arid fig 2 a the topography of the study area presented in fig 2b revealed terrain is primarily dominated by mountains the mountains are the eastern extension of the iranian plateau subdivided by moderately high to high mountain ranges running roughly north south and extended to the himalaya system verheijen 1998 highest mountains are located in the northern and central parts of the province the harsh climate and rough terrain of the province have limited the cultivation activities leaving most of the area to be used as rangeland grazing naz mirza et al 2009 the rangeland in the province provides around 90 of feed requirement for livestock shafiq and kakar 2007 any variation in climate severely affects the agriculture and people s livelihood in this region 2 2 datasets the precipitation dataset provided by gpcc was used as reference data in this study the gpcc has produced several products at different spatial resolutions schneider et al 2014 in this study 0 5 spatial resolution full data reanalysis product version 6 from gpcc was used the gpcc dataset is developed using a large number of observations and it is available over a longer time span ahmed et al 2015 spinoni et al 2014 therefore it has been widely used for precipitation downscaling and drought assessments chen et al 2014 mullan et al 2015 shirvani and landman 2015 the monthly precipitation dataset from 130 grid points covering balochistan fig 1 for the period 1961 2010 was considered in this study the monthly precipitation data of seven cmip5 gcms for historical simulations and future projections were selected in this study the selection criteria of the models were the availability of four rcp scenarios and a model from all countries participating in cmip5 the rcps represent four different scenarios of radiative forcing levels namely 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 van vuuren et al 2011 winkler and winiwarter 2015 four selected rcps include a very low forcing level known as mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two medium forcing level known as stabilization scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and one very high forcing level know as very high greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 the descriptions of the selected models are given in table 1 these models are available in different resolutions higher resolutions are generally desirable for assessing regional hydro climate variables while the coarser are preferred over the regions with complex topography and coastlines zahid and iqbal 2015 therefore all selected cmip5 precipitation simulations are re gridded onto a common 2 2 grid to reduce the biases and cover the high variation in topography and coastlines of the study area cmip5 gcms have several ensemble members such as r1i1p1 r2i1p1 r3i1p1 r4i1p1 etc that represent the realization initialization and physics of the models in order to have an unbiased comparison among various models we considered the ensemble r1i1p1 for the historical period data for 1961 2005 and rcps data for analyzing four future rcp scenarios for the period 2010 2099 3 methodology 3 1 procedure the flowchart of the procedure used in this study is shown in fig 3 this study was broadly divided into two parts in the first part monthly precipitations simulated by seven gcms were extracted from ipcc cmip5 data portal the extracted data were regridded remapped to a common grid of 2 2 by using bilinear interpolation approach in climate data operator environment developed by max planck institute for meteorology the simulated precipitations from cmip5 models were considered as a model predictor in the downscaling model sa adi et al 2017 eden et al 2012 reported that simulated precipitation is a very good predictor for the true precipitation and thus can be used as a predictor stepwise regression was used to optimally link the gcm simulated precipitations to gpcc precipitation it allowed the selection of the subset of gcm simulated precipitations that can best predict the gpcc precipitation at a grid point which was then used for downscaling model development the downscaling model was trained for 70 and tested for 30 of gpcc data using svm the quantile mapping was applied to reduce the biases between the gcm outputs and observations the performances of models were assessed using different model evaluation statistics in the second part droughts during various climatic 3 month spi or crop growing seasons 6 month spi were reconstructed by estimating spi at each grid point for the timescale of corresponding seasons spi values were arranged in time series for each season to associate with different areal extents the frequency analysis was performed on drought severities for different areal extents to estimate the return period of associated severity and areal extent for the development of saf curves the methods used in this study are discussed below 3 2 downscaling and projections 3 2 1 support vector machines svm svm can model highly nonlinear relationships and therefore widely used in solving non linear problems acton 2012 asefa et al 2004 dibike et al 2001 khadam and kaluarachchi 2004 in svm based regression the relationship between predictand y with the predictors xi is estimated as follows 1 y f x i w ϕ x i b where w represents weight vector b represents bias ϕ represents a nonlinear transfer function that maps the input vectors xi into a high dimensional feature space the svm solves the nonlinear regression function by optimizing an ε insensitivity loss function 2 1 2 w t w c i 1 n ξ i c i 1 n ξ i the function can be minimized using the following criteria 3 w t ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i y i w t ϕ x i b ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ξi and ξ i denote slack variables which are the distance of the training data set points from the region to an error tolerance ε and c is a constant eq 3 can be solved by the lagrangian multipliers α i α i η η quadratic programing was used for this purpose after optimization it can be written as 4 f x i i 1 n α i α i x i x b this eq 4 is suitable for solving linear regression problems it can be extended to nonlinear regression problem that maps the input vectors into a high dimensional feature space ϕ which in turn linearize the relationship between input and output thus the eq 4 can be written as 5 f x i i 1 n α i α i k x i x b k x i x ϕ x i ϕ x where k x i x is the kernel function the performance of the svm model primarily relies on the optimum selection of model parameters that include kernel type regularization parameter c and epsilon value ε in the present study a k fold cross validation was used to find the optimum values of model parameters 3 2 2 quantile mapping qm developed by panofsky et al 1958 relies on cumulative distributive function the principle is to adjust the distribution of model output with the observed data set gudmundsson et al 2012 formulated qm as 6 p o h p m where po is observed precipitation h is a transfer function and pm is downscaled precipitation the distribution of data set and parameters of the distribution are determined and then the following expression is used for bias correction 7 p o f o 1 f m p m where f o 1 is the quantile function corresponding to observed precipitation and fm is the cumulative distribution function of downscaled precipitation 3 2 3 performance evaluation the performances of the gcms were assessed using different statistics which are mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse index of agreement md and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse to show the efficiency of models as follows 8 mae 1 n i 1 n x obs i x sim i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n x sim i x obs i 2 1 2 10 md 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i j i 1 n x sim i x obs x obs i x obs j 11 nse 1 i 1 n x sim i x obs i 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 where xsim i and xobs i are the ith modeled and observed data and n is the number of observations 3 3 drought analysis 3 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi spi mckee et al 1993 provides a comparison of the precipitation over a specific period with the precipitation totals from the same period for all the recorded years and thus facilitates the temporal analysis of droughts in order to compute spi monthly precipitation data of each gpcc grid point were fitted with normal lognormal gamma and extreme value i distributions the kolmogorov smirnov ks test was conducted to estimate the goodness of fit to a particular distribution the frequency distribution that best fit the data was used to compute the spi value spi gives positive and negative values where positive values define the wet conditions and negative values are used to classify the drought conditions mckee et al 1993 classified spi values as mild drought spi 1 0 moderate drought 1 5 spi 1 0 severe drought 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme drought spi 2 0 spi values were computed at the last month of a season defining the precipitation deficit of the entire season for example to measure droughts in late summer august october a 3 month spi in the month of october was used as it represents the precipitation deficit from august to october a similar procedure was also adopted by ahmed et al 2015 alamgir et al 2015 and mishra and cherkauer 2010 for the calculation of seasonal droughts 3 3 2 development of saf curves a drought is usually considered a regional drought when the affected area reaches a threshold the drought saf curves are often used to represent all the characteristics of regional droughts henriques and santos 1999 the procedure adopted by several studies bonaccorso et al 2015 mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2009 mishra and cherkauer 2010 was used in this study to develop saf curves after calculating spi at each grid point drought severities associated with different areal extents in the percentage of total area were calculated using arcgis for example the 3 month spi at the end of october was used to construct the saf curves of late summer droughts therefore the 3 month spi at the end of october was associated with different areal extent in percentage of total area for different areal thresholds in the present study areal thresholds of 1 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 were used the probability distribution that best fits drought severity series for different areal extents were then determined for this purpose the drought severity for different areal extents were fitted with normal lognormal gamma and extreme value i distributions kolmogorov smirnov ks test was conducted to estimate the goodness of fit to a particular distribution if the ks test statistics are found less than the critical table value the null hypothesis of data following the specified distribution cannot be rejected in this study ks test statistics were found less than the critical table values for all areal extents when the drought severity series were compared with the gamma distribution the p values of ks test obtained during the fitting distribution of the late winter drought severity series for different areal extents are given in table 2 as an example a p value higher than 0 05 indicates the ks test statistic is less than the critical values at p 0 05 and therefore the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at 5 significance level the table shows that the p values were higher than 0 05 for all the cases when fitted with gamma distribution similar results were also observed for other seasons therefore gamma distribution was selected and then its parameters were estimated using maximum goodness of fit estimation method the gamma distribution parameters were used to estimate the return period of associated severity and areal extent the return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were considered for analysis the return period of associated severity and areal extent were finally plotted to prepare the saf curves 3 3 3 uncertainty assessment in drought return periods bayesian statistics was used to estimate the credible interval in the domain of the distribution of model output in contrast to the frequentist confidence interval bayesian interval estimation considers related information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data rather than a large number of repeated samples for a given posterior p m r the confidence interval for m m lo m hi is estimated using bayesian approach as 12 ci m lo m hi p m r d m where ci is the confidence interval m hi and m lo are the upper and lower bounds of confidence interval m is model parameters r is model output the function p m is the set of different probabilities for variable m p m r d m is the inverse probability distribution of r for given m and dm represents normalization scale dm 1 indicates p m is normalized in a scale of 0 1 in this study bootstrap was applied on seven projected models to assess the return period at 2 5 and 97 5 quartiles at 95 confidence interval for a sample size of 1000 the 2 5 and 97 5 quartiles were defined as the lower and upper confidence levels the detailed algorithm for bb can be found in rubin 1981 4 results 4 1 validation of cmip5 models the performances of downscaling models were numerically assessed by comparing the downscaled precipitation with gpcc precipitation for the period 1961 2005 using mae rmse md and nse precipitation was downscaled at each gpcc grid point separately the results obtained from area averaged precipitation average of 130 gpcc grid points against downscaled area averaged precipitation from gcms are shown in fig 4 the mae fig 4a values in all gcms varied in the range of 1 2 while in rmse values were found in the range of 2 2 5 the md and nse fig 4b values were also found high ranging from 0 92 to 0 98 giss e2 h was found the best gcm by showing lowest errors and highest agreement with observed data in term of all statistics 4 2 changes in annual seasonal ensemble precipitation the projected changes in seasonal ensemble precipitation 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 under rcp scenarios are shown in fig 5 it shows an increase in precipitation ranging from 8 to 41 in all seasons rcp8 5 showed the maximum precipitation change especially during period 2070 2099 the differences among periods and scenarios were found small a similar finding was also reported by rashid et al 2015 where differences among rcp scenarios were found small highest increase of about 41 was observed in late summer while the lowest 8 in early summer 4 3 saf curves for historical droughts the drought return periods of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were considered in the analysis the saf curves were plotted for climatic spi 3 and cropping seasons spi 6 on the basis of historical droughts 1961 2010 the saf curve for late winter season is shown in fig 6 as an example fig 6 shows that drought with higher severity and higher return period cover a small portion of the study area for example a 3 0 spi magnitude drought with a return period of 100 years covers an area of about 25 76 while the same magnitude drought with a return period of 50 years can affect an area of about 10 33 on the other hand droughts with lower return periods are less severe for the same areal extent than those of higher return periods for example a 1 0 spi magnitude drought with a return period of 5 years can affect 30 36 of the area while the same magnitude drought with a return period of 10 years can affect 57 09 area the historical droughts with severities of 1 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 for return periods of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were assessed to understand drought characteristics in different seasons the affected areas by each category of droughts were estimated and presented in table 3 the percentage of affected areas in different seasons and severity was found to vary at lower return period and severity i e 5 years and 1 spi early winter drought was found to be the most affected that covers 38 48 while at high return period such as 100 years and 3 spi rabi season was found to be the most affected season when drought can affect 35 17 of the total area in addition the percentage of the area was found to reduce from lower to higher severe droughts for instance in the late winter season at 25 year return period a drought of 1 0 severity can affect 93 40 area and a drought of 1 5 severity can affect 50 34 area while 22 80 8 46 and 0 0 are affected by drought at 2 0 2 5 and 3 spi respectively therefore it can be remarked that on equal drought severity larger areas are affected by drought as drought return period increases on the other hand on equal areal extent drought severity increases as drought return period increases 4 4 uncertainties in projected droughts the results obtained from bb at 95 confidence level of saf curves were plotted to show the uncertainty in drought saf for the future projected periods overall 72 6 seasons 3 periods 4 scenarios 72 figures were prepared the saf curves for late winter season 2010 2039 under rcp2 6 are discussed and shown here as an example fig 7 each return period 5 10 25 50 and 100 years has three curves i e upper middle and lower the upper curve represents the upper bound of 95 confidence interval of saf curve middle one represents the mean and the lower curve represents the lower bounds narrower confidence band means the lower severity compared to droughts having a higher severity the area affected by drought with uncertainty bounds was investigated for all seasons and scenarios 6 seasons 4 scenarios 24 tables the results obtained for late winter season under rcp2 6 scenario are shown in table 4 as an example a gradual increase in affected area can be seen between the bands upper to lower for example a moderate drought of spi 1 at 5 year return period can affect 23 6 30 7 and 41 2 area for upper middle and lower curve respectively the differences were found small between the middle and lower bounds of droughts while a slightly higher difference was seen for the upper confidence bound of drought other seasons and scenarios also showed a similar kind of uncertainty similarly a gradual increase in the affected area can be seen with return periods low to high for example the area under the upper bound of drought starts increasing from 23 6 for 5 year return period to 98 8 for 100 year return period drought 4 5 percent changes in drought area the saf curves were further analyzed to assess the changes in drought characteristics due to climate change the assessments were carried out by comparing the saf curves with uncertainty under projected climate with the saf curves prepared with historical gpcc precipitation the comparison was made for all scenarios and for all seasons the obtained results for mean saf curves under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios are provided in tables 5 8 respectively as examples the tables show the results for three different periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 six seasons early winter late winter early summer later summer rabi and kharif five return periods 5 10 25 50 and 100 years and five drought severities 1 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 the negative values represent reduced the affected area and the positive values represent more affected area by future droughts table 5 for rcp2 6 shows that the percentage of area affected by droughts varies from season to season and for different drought severities most of the cases droughts were found to be reduced while some increases were found in almost all seasons at 5 and 10 year return periods rabi season was found to be the most affected at 10 years return period by moderate drought 1 0 spi during 2040 2069 the 5 year return period droughts 1 spi in this season were also found to increase 5 80 during 2070 2099 in table 6 for rcp4 5 higher negative values can be seen indicating fewer droughts covering less area on the other hand small positive values can be found for lower severities indicating more droughts covering small area the percentages of areas affected by droughts were found to vary from season to season however most of the seasons were found to show negative values for drought severities of 2 0 and above and positive values for drought severities of 1 0 and below early winter was the only season that does not show any increase in drought rabi season was found to show the highest drought increase 9 36 at 1 spi during 2040 2069 the same was also noticed under rcp2 6 where rabi season showed the highest increase at 10 year return period in table 7 for rcp6 0 it can be noted that results are similar to those of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however a few differences can be seen in table 7 similar to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rabi seasons showed the highest increase in drought affected area under rcp6 0 except 50 year return period at 2 spi during 2070 2099 when rabi drought is found to decrease up to 78 74 overall drought was found to be more at low severity 1 spi and return period 5 years and vice versa for example at 1 spi and at 5 year return period drought was projected to increase while decrease at 3 spi and at 100 year return period over the present century under rcp8 5 scenario table 8 moderate droughts 1 spi for the 5 year return period will continuously increase in rabi kharif and late winter seasons these droughts will affect more areas during 2040 2069 where rabi and kharif seasons will be the most affected with the increase by 7 78 and 6 2 respectively it was noticed that droughts in most cases will reduce while in few cases it will increase this increase will be more in the rabi season 14 02 moderate droughts for 10 year return period which is also found under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it was also noticed that most of the zeros or no change were for 2 and above spi extreme droughts at 5 year return period 5 discussions balochistan is predominantly characterized by an arid climate precipitation is the major source of water for agriculture that is critically important for the livelihoods of the majority of the population in the province thus it is very important to understand future changes and variability in precipitation on the eve of climate change this study projected the future precipitation of balochistan pakistan from seven cmip5 gcms for four rcp scenarios using svm several studies wilby and wigley 1997 wilby et al 1998 have been conducted to determine the best downscaling method and reported that different downscaling methods generate radically different future projections for the same gcm predictors in order to avoid different future projections from the same gcm model this study used svm downscaling technique the performance of svm downscaling model was rigorously tested using various robust statistical tests the result obtained from different statistics reflects the high capability of svm in downscaling precipitation at arid region future changes in precipitation of gcms are often expected to yield a greater increase in precipitation under rcp8 5 compared to those in other rcps especially for the 2070s ouyang et al 2015 villarini et al 2015 yin et al 2015 similar results were obtained in the present study the higher increase in precipitation was observed in southeast parts of balochistan during monsoon which indicates that the monsoon will be more intense in future menon et al 2013 also noticed a consistent increase in monsoon precipitation historical saf curves clearly showed that on equal drought severity drought areal extent increases as drought return period increases it was observed that a drought with a severity of 1 0 can affect more than 30 area in all seasons at 5 year return period while the whole study area 100 can be affected if the drought return period increases to 50 years the results also revealed that the affected area of droughts varies from season to season however early winter season was the most affected season the projected saf curves for all seasons indicated that drought with higher severity and high return periods cover a small portion of the study area similar results were also shown in other studies akhtari et al 2008 mishra and singh 2009 mishra and cherkauer 2010 they reported that droughts with higher return period and severity can influence less area and droughts with lower return periods can cover more area the projected results indicate that there will be more droughts in future with low severity and return periods overall high reduction in drought was observed in all scenarios and periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and a small increase for few cases overall the change in affected area would vary from 81 21 to 14 2 reflection of gcm uncertainties in estimated drought return period cannot be ruled out lee and kim 2013 bb used in this study provided a range of values that are helpful to understand the changes that may occur in future drought the range of uncertainty provided basic information for taking proper adaptation measures increased risk of droughts has been projected in many regions due to the increased variability of precipitation taylor et al 2013 temporal analysis of projected precipitation in this study showed an increase in precipitation however the increased precipitation doesn t confirm the reduction of droughts for all severities and return periods the droughts were found more severe with low return periods covering larger areas the similar was also reported in ipcc 2007 where they reported higher intensity and longer duration droughts over larger areas kundzewicz et al 2008 reported that the regions that often experienced drought are highly prone to projected droughts it indicates that areal extents of droughts will increase due to climate change this is partially true for the present study area where drought area was found to increase in some seasons i e early winter rabi and kharif 6 conclusions this study employed spi to characterize seasonal droughts by developing saf curves over balochistan pakistan seven cmip5 gcms precipitation were downscaled using svm method for historical period in order to assess the capability of the downscaling model in reproducing historical precipitation and subsequently used for future projection of precipitation the saf curves were developed based on gpcc historical and downscaled cmip5 gcm precipitation bb was used to estimate the uncertainty in future droughts additionally the historical and projected saf curves were compared to understand the changes in future droughts the main findings of the study are 1 svm model was successfully validated in downscaling cmip5 gcms precipitation 2 all climate models revealed the increased precipitation especially in the last part of the century 2070 2099 under all rcp scenarios this increase in precipitation will be gradual over the period from 2010 to 2099 overall precipitation was projected to increase in different seasons in the range of 8 to 41 over the region by the end of this century 3 the historical saf curves revealed that the higher return period e g 25 50 100 years but less severe spi 2 0 droughts are more in the study area the drought affected areas vary from season to season droughts during rabi season affect larger area as compared with other seasons 4 changes in future drought area revealed that the droughts with low severities spi 1 0 and return periods 10 years will increase in most of the seasons on the other hand affected area by droughts with high severity spi 1 5 and return periods 25 years will be reduced under all climate change scenarios however no consistency in the reduction of less severe droughts was found for different climate change scenarios 5 the uncertainty band of drought saf curves estimated using bb at a 95 confidence level revealed that uncertainty ranges were different for different return periods and seasons overall the saf curves with higher return periods are found to be more uncertain compared to those for lower return periods therefore it can be concluded that the projection of increased extreme droughts in the study area is highly uncertain in the present study possible changes in drought characteristics due to climate change are assessed using seven gcms and spi however more gcms and other drought indices can be used to have greater insight into future drought characteristics in the study area it is expected that the saf curves generated in this study will assist in disaster risk management and mitigation planning acknowledgments this work is supported by the post doctoral

6720,the uncertainty assessment of the changes in drought characteristics due to climate change has caught the attention of the scientific community this study used gauge based gridded precipitation data obtained from global precipitation climatology centre gpcc to reconstruct historical droughts and downscale future precipitation projected by seven general circulation models gcms of coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 under four representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 support vector machine svm and quantile mapping were used for downscaling and gcm bias correction respectively the model performances were assessed based on statistical measures the historical and future projected precipitation data were finally used to characterize the seasonal droughts using standardized precipitation index spi for different crop growing periods the drought severity area frequency saf curves for the historical 1961 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 were developed the uncertainty band of future drought saf curves was estimated using bayesian bootstrap bb at a 95 confidence level as a result svm was successful in downscaling the precipitation of all selected cmip5 gcms the seasonal ensemble of gcms projected an increase in precipitation ranging from 8 to 41 under all scenarios the historical saf curves revealed that for equal drought severity larger areas are affected by droughts having higher return periods future projections of droughts revealed the increase in affected area for lower severity and return period droughts and the decrease for higher severity and return period droughts the uncertainty bands of drought saf curves with higher return periods were found much wider compared to those with lower return periods which indicates more uncertainty in the projection of higher severity and return period droughts keywords seasonal drought severity area frequency cmip5 rcps statistical downscaling arid region 1 introduction drought is likely to become more recurrent and severe in future and can have severe and long lasting impacts on natural and human systems nam et al 2015 rahmat et al 2016 touma et al 2015 droughts can be more acute for semi arid and arid regions forouzani and karami 2010 liu and hwang 2015 the situation can become much worse in the semi arid countries like pakistan where the economy is mainly based on agriculture kazmi et al 2015 miyan 2015 drought is a common phenomenon in pakistan which occurs at least thrice every ten years anjum et al 2012 the country has experienced a number of severe droughts in recent history which were mainly confined to sindh and balochistan provinces of pakistan ashraf and routray 2015 balochistan province covers 44 of the total land of pakistan faced severe droughts in 1967 1969 1971 1973 1975 1994 and 1998 2002 ahmed et al 2015 the prolonged drought in 1998 2002 reduced crop yields by 60 80 that resulted in severe negative impacts on the economy of the province as well as the whole country sarwar 2008 there is a growing concern in recent years on increasing severity and frequency of droughts in pakistan like in many other parts of asia ahmed et al 2015 wang et al 2012 zahid and rasul 2012 reported a significant increase in heat waves frequency over balochistan which indicates the possibility of more frequent drought in the future therefore it is important to understand the possible changes in future drought characteristics for climate change adaptation and mitigation planning several studies swain and hayhoe 2015 touma et al 2015 wang and chen 2014 wang et al 2014 zarch et al 2015 have been conducted in recent years to project future changes in droughts using coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 general circulation model gcms data however most studies characterized droughts without giving any indication of drought risk during different seasons or cropping periods droughts are found to be significantly damaging when they coincide with cropping seasons mishra and cherkauer 2010 thus it is very important to predict future droughts during cropping seasons to mitigate the impacts in the context of climate change the gcms used for projecting future climate introduce uncertainties in projections therefore it is obvious that drought characterization based on gcm projections contains uncertainties exploring uncertainties and providing reliable information is a major challenge in climate change research kim et al 2015 as the gcm configuration is the main source of uncertainty in climate projections ensembles of gcm projections are used to incorporate uncertainties in impact assessment two main approaches used to assess climate change uncertainties in droughts are perturbed physics ensembles i e projections from different parameterizations of the same model burke and brown 2010 taylor et al 2013 and multi model ensembles burke and brown 2008 dai and zhao 2016 mishra and singh 2009 vidal and wade 2009 the improvements in cmip5 models such as the availability of a large number of projections at higher resolution and better representation of earth system processes have provided greater confidence in climate change projections and opportunity to assess uncertainty using multi model ensemble knutti and sedláček 2013 the drought severity area frequency saf curves henriques and santos 1999 quantitatively relate the values of drought severity areal extent and return period and therefore widely used to represent all characteristics of droughts together loukas and vasiliades 2004 rajsekhar et al 2015 mishra and singh 2009 argued that high uncertainties in the gcm structure and complexities in droughts have made event based drought analysis difficult therefore analysis of future changes in droughts based on saf curves is preferred over the event based drought some studies burke and brown 2010 lee and kim 2013 mishra and singh 2009 considered the uncertainties in future projections of droughts however none of them has assessed the uncertainty within the saf curve this study quantified the uncertainty within the saf curves using bayesian theorem and bootstrap resampling technique efron 1992 rubin 1981 the technique has been recommended to evaluate uncertainty in hydrological or climate models hu et al 2015 the main aim of the present study was to investigate the impacts of climate change on saf curves for the historical and future droughts during four climatic seasons namely early winter november january late winter february april early summer may july and late summer august october and the two major cropping seasons kharif may october and rabi november april in pakistan the gauge based gridded precipitation data provided by the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc of the deutscher wetterdienst becker et al 2013 having a resolution of at 0 5 0 5 and seven gcms participating in cmip5 were used for this purpose support vector machine svm was used to downscale coarse resolution gcm precipitation to gpcc scale and quantile mapping qm was used to correct the bias in gcms standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 was used to characterize seasonal droughts the return periods of various severities of droughts were interpolated to derive the saf curves of seasonal droughts for the historical 1961 2010 and three future periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area balochistan is situated in the southwestern part of pakistan fig 1 the province is the homeland of around 8 5 million people with a population density of 23 people per km2 gob 2014 the province is the largest region covering an area of 347 000 km2 constituting 44 of the total mass of pakistan more than 85 of the population in the province depends on agriculture for their livelihood ashraf et al 2014 agriculture and livestock sectors play a vital role in the economy and employ about 67 of the labor force hussein 2004 precipitation in the area varies from 30 mm yr in the southwest desert to 397 mm yr in the northeast fig 1 overall the precipitation climatology is divided into 1 early winter november january 2 late winter february april 3 early summer may july and 4 late summer august october ahmed et al 2015 snead 1968 majority of the area belongs to the arid climate followed by hyper arid and semi arid fig 2 a the topography of the study area presented in fig 2b revealed terrain is primarily dominated by mountains the mountains are the eastern extension of the iranian plateau subdivided by moderately high to high mountain ranges running roughly north south and extended to the himalaya system verheijen 1998 highest mountains are located in the northern and central parts of the province the harsh climate and rough terrain of the province have limited the cultivation activities leaving most of the area to be used as rangeland grazing naz mirza et al 2009 the rangeland in the province provides around 90 of feed requirement for livestock shafiq and kakar 2007 any variation in climate severely affects the agriculture and people s livelihood in this region 2 2 datasets the precipitation dataset provided by gpcc was used as reference data in this study the gpcc has produced several products at different spatial resolutions schneider et al 2014 in this study 0 5 spatial resolution full data reanalysis product version 6 from gpcc was used the gpcc dataset is developed using a large number of observations and it is available over a longer time span ahmed et al 2015 spinoni et al 2014 therefore it has been widely used for precipitation downscaling and drought assessments chen et al 2014 mullan et al 2015 shirvani and landman 2015 the monthly precipitation dataset from 130 grid points covering balochistan fig 1 for the period 1961 2010 was considered in this study the monthly precipitation data of seven cmip5 gcms for historical simulations and future projections were selected in this study the selection criteria of the models were the availability of four rcp scenarios and a model from all countries participating in cmip5 the rcps represent four different scenarios of radiative forcing levels namely 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 w m2 van vuuren et al 2011 winkler and winiwarter 2015 four selected rcps include a very low forcing level known as mitigation scenario rcp2 6 two medium forcing level known as stabilization scenarios rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and one very high forcing level know as very high greenhouse gas emission scenario rcp8 5 the descriptions of the selected models are given in table 1 these models are available in different resolutions higher resolutions are generally desirable for assessing regional hydro climate variables while the coarser are preferred over the regions with complex topography and coastlines zahid and iqbal 2015 therefore all selected cmip5 precipitation simulations are re gridded onto a common 2 2 grid to reduce the biases and cover the high variation in topography and coastlines of the study area cmip5 gcms have several ensemble members such as r1i1p1 r2i1p1 r3i1p1 r4i1p1 etc that represent the realization initialization and physics of the models in order to have an unbiased comparison among various models we considered the ensemble r1i1p1 for the historical period data for 1961 2005 and rcps data for analyzing four future rcp scenarios for the period 2010 2099 3 methodology 3 1 procedure the flowchart of the procedure used in this study is shown in fig 3 this study was broadly divided into two parts in the first part monthly precipitations simulated by seven gcms were extracted from ipcc cmip5 data portal the extracted data were regridded remapped to a common grid of 2 2 by using bilinear interpolation approach in climate data operator environment developed by max planck institute for meteorology the simulated precipitations from cmip5 models were considered as a model predictor in the downscaling model sa adi et al 2017 eden et al 2012 reported that simulated precipitation is a very good predictor for the true precipitation and thus can be used as a predictor stepwise regression was used to optimally link the gcm simulated precipitations to gpcc precipitation it allowed the selection of the subset of gcm simulated precipitations that can best predict the gpcc precipitation at a grid point which was then used for downscaling model development the downscaling model was trained for 70 and tested for 30 of gpcc data using svm the quantile mapping was applied to reduce the biases between the gcm outputs and observations the performances of models were assessed using different model evaluation statistics in the second part droughts during various climatic 3 month spi or crop growing seasons 6 month spi were reconstructed by estimating spi at each grid point for the timescale of corresponding seasons spi values were arranged in time series for each season to associate with different areal extents the frequency analysis was performed on drought severities for different areal extents to estimate the return period of associated severity and areal extent for the development of saf curves the methods used in this study are discussed below 3 2 downscaling and projections 3 2 1 support vector machines svm svm can model highly nonlinear relationships and therefore widely used in solving non linear problems acton 2012 asefa et al 2004 dibike et al 2001 khadam and kaluarachchi 2004 in svm based regression the relationship between predictand y with the predictors xi is estimated as follows 1 y f x i w ϕ x i b where w represents weight vector b represents bias ϕ represents a nonlinear transfer function that maps the input vectors xi into a high dimensional feature space the svm solves the nonlinear regression function by optimizing an ε insensitivity loss function 2 1 2 w t w c i 1 n ξ i c i 1 n ξ i the function can be minimized using the following criteria 3 w t ϕ x i b y i ε ξ i y i w t ϕ x i b ε ξ i ξ i ξ i 0 i 1 2 n where ξi and ξ i denote slack variables which are the distance of the training data set points from the region to an error tolerance ε and c is a constant eq 3 can be solved by the lagrangian multipliers α i α i η η quadratic programing was used for this purpose after optimization it can be written as 4 f x i i 1 n α i α i x i x b this eq 4 is suitable for solving linear regression problems it can be extended to nonlinear regression problem that maps the input vectors into a high dimensional feature space ϕ which in turn linearize the relationship between input and output thus the eq 4 can be written as 5 f x i i 1 n α i α i k x i x b k x i x ϕ x i ϕ x where k x i x is the kernel function the performance of the svm model primarily relies on the optimum selection of model parameters that include kernel type regularization parameter c and epsilon value ε in the present study a k fold cross validation was used to find the optimum values of model parameters 3 2 2 quantile mapping qm developed by panofsky et al 1958 relies on cumulative distributive function the principle is to adjust the distribution of model output with the observed data set gudmundsson et al 2012 formulated qm as 6 p o h p m where po is observed precipitation h is a transfer function and pm is downscaled precipitation the distribution of data set and parameters of the distribution are determined and then the following expression is used for bias correction 7 p o f o 1 f m p m where f o 1 is the quantile function corresponding to observed precipitation and fm is the cumulative distribution function of downscaled precipitation 3 2 3 performance evaluation the performances of the gcms were assessed using different statistics which are mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse index of agreement md and nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse to show the efficiency of models as follows 8 mae 1 n i 1 n x obs i x sim i 9 rmse 1 n i 1 n x sim i x obs i 2 1 2 10 md 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i j i 1 n x sim i x obs x obs i x obs j 11 nse 1 i 1 n x sim i x obs i 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 where xsim i and xobs i are the ith modeled and observed data and n is the number of observations 3 3 drought analysis 3 3 1 standardized precipitation index spi spi mckee et al 1993 provides a comparison of the precipitation over a specific period with the precipitation totals from the same period for all the recorded years and thus facilitates the temporal analysis of droughts in order to compute spi monthly precipitation data of each gpcc grid point were fitted with normal lognormal gamma and extreme value i distributions the kolmogorov smirnov ks test was conducted to estimate the goodness of fit to a particular distribution the frequency distribution that best fit the data was used to compute the spi value spi gives positive and negative values where positive values define the wet conditions and negative values are used to classify the drought conditions mckee et al 1993 classified spi values as mild drought spi 1 0 moderate drought 1 5 spi 1 0 severe drought 2 0 spi 1 5 and extreme drought spi 2 0 spi values were computed at the last month of a season defining the precipitation deficit of the entire season for example to measure droughts in late summer august october a 3 month spi in the month of october was used as it represents the precipitation deficit from august to october a similar procedure was also adopted by ahmed et al 2015 alamgir et al 2015 and mishra and cherkauer 2010 for the calculation of seasonal droughts 3 3 2 development of saf curves a drought is usually considered a regional drought when the affected area reaches a threshold the drought saf curves are often used to represent all the characteristics of regional droughts henriques and santos 1999 the procedure adopted by several studies bonaccorso et al 2015 mishra and desai 2005 mishra and singh 2009 mishra and cherkauer 2010 was used in this study to develop saf curves after calculating spi at each grid point drought severities associated with different areal extents in the percentage of total area were calculated using arcgis for example the 3 month spi at the end of october was used to construct the saf curves of late summer droughts therefore the 3 month spi at the end of october was associated with different areal extent in percentage of total area for different areal thresholds in the present study areal thresholds of 1 2 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 and 100 were used the probability distribution that best fits drought severity series for different areal extents were then determined for this purpose the drought severity for different areal extents were fitted with normal lognormal gamma and extreme value i distributions kolmogorov smirnov ks test was conducted to estimate the goodness of fit to a particular distribution if the ks test statistics are found less than the critical table value the null hypothesis of data following the specified distribution cannot be rejected in this study ks test statistics were found less than the critical table values for all areal extents when the drought severity series were compared with the gamma distribution the p values of ks test obtained during the fitting distribution of the late winter drought severity series for different areal extents are given in table 2 as an example a p value higher than 0 05 indicates the ks test statistic is less than the critical values at p 0 05 and therefore the null hypothesis cannot be rejected at 5 significance level the table shows that the p values were higher than 0 05 for all the cases when fitted with gamma distribution similar results were also observed for other seasons therefore gamma distribution was selected and then its parameters were estimated using maximum goodness of fit estimation method the gamma distribution parameters were used to estimate the return period of associated severity and areal extent the return periods of 2 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were considered for analysis the return period of associated severity and areal extent were finally plotted to prepare the saf curves 3 3 3 uncertainty assessment in drought return periods bayesian statistics was used to estimate the credible interval in the domain of the distribution of model output in contrast to the frequentist confidence interval bayesian interval estimation considers related information from the prior distribution whereas confidence intervals are based only on the data rather than a large number of repeated samples for a given posterior p m r the confidence interval for m m lo m hi is estimated using bayesian approach as 12 ci m lo m hi p m r d m where ci is the confidence interval m hi and m lo are the upper and lower bounds of confidence interval m is model parameters r is model output the function p m is the set of different probabilities for variable m p m r d m is the inverse probability distribution of r for given m and dm represents normalization scale dm 1 indicates p m is normalized in a scale of 0 1 in this study bootstrap was applied on seven projected models to assess the return period at 2 5 and 97 5 quartiles at 95 confidence interval for a sample size of 1000 the 2 5 and 97 5 quartiles were defined as the lower and upper confidence levels the detailed algorithm for bb can be found in rubin 1981 4 results 4 1 validation of cmip5 models the performances of downscaling models were numerically assessed by comparing the downscaled precipitation with gpcc precipitation for the period 1961 2005 using mae rmse md and nse precipitation was downscaled at each gpcc grid point separately the results obtained from area averaged precipitation average of 130 gpcc grid points against downscaled area averaged precipitation from gcms are shown in fig 4 the mae fig 4a values in all gcms varied in the range of 1 2 while in rmse values were found in the range of 2 2 5 the md and nse fig 4b values were also found high ranging from 0 92 to 0 98 giss e2 h was found the best gcm by showing lowest errors and highest agreement with observed data in term of all statistics 4 2 changes in annual seasonal ensemble precipitation the projected changes in seasonal ensemble precipitation 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 under rcp scenarios are shown in fig 5 it shows an increase in precipitation ranging from 8 to 41 in all seasons rcp8 5 showed the maximum precipitation change especially during period 2070 2099 the differences among periods and scenarios were found small a similar finding was also reported by rashid et al 2015 where differences among rcp scenarios were found small highest increase of about 41 was observed in late summer while the lowest 8 in early summer 4 3 saf curves for historical droughts the drought return periods of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were considered in the analysis the saf curves were plotted for climatic spi 3 and cropping seasons spi 6 on the basis of historical droughts 1961 2010 the saf curve for late winter season is shown in fig 6 as an example fig 6 shows that drought with higher severity and higher return period cover a small portion of the study area for example a 3 0 spi magnitude drought with a return period of 100 years covers an area of about 25 76 while the same magnitude drought with a return period of 50 years can affect an area of about 10 33 on the other hand droughts with lower return periods are less severe for the same areal extent than those of higher return periods for example a 1 0 spi magnitude drought with a return period of 5 years can affect 30 36 of the area while the same magnitude drought with a return period of 10 years can affect 57 09 area the historical droughts with severities of 1 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 for return periods of 5 10 25 50 and 100 years were assessed to understand drought characteristics in different seasons the affected areas by each category of droughts were estimated and presented in table 3 the percentage of affected areas in different seasons and severity was found to vary at lower return period and severity i e 5 years and 1 spi early winter drought was found to be the most affected that covers 38 48 while at high return period such as 100 years and 3 spi rabi season was found to be the most affected season when drought can affect 35 17 of the total area in addition the percentage of the area was found to reduce from lower to higher severe droughts for instance in the late winter season at 25 year return period a drought of 1 0 severity can affect 93 40 area and a drought of 1 5 severity can affect 50 34 area while 22 80 8 46 and 0 0 are affected by drought at 2 0 2 5 and 3 spi respectively therefore it can be remarked that on equal drought severity larger areas are affected by drought as drought return period increases on the other hand on equal areal extent drought severity increases as drought return period increases 4 4 uncertainties in projected droughts the results obtained from bb at 95 confidence level of saf curves were plotted to show the uncertainty in drought saf for the future projected periods overall 72 6 seasons 3 periods 4 scenarios 72 figures were prepared the saf curves for late winter season 2010 2039 under rcp2 6 are discussed and shown here as an example fig 7 each return period 5 10 25 50 and 100 years has three curves i e upper middle and lower the upper curve represents the upper bound of 95 confidence interval of saf curve middle one represents the mean and the lower curve represents the lower bounds narrower confidence band means the lower severity compared to droughts having a higher severity the area affected by drought with uncertainty bounds was investigated for all seasons and scenarios 6 seasons 4 scenarios 24 tables the results obtained for late winter season under rcp2 6 scenario are shown in table 4 as an example a gradual increase in affected area can be seen between the bands upper to lower for example a moderate drought of spi 1 at 5 year return period can affect 23 6 30 7 and 41 2 area for upper middle and lower curve respectively the differences were found small between the middle and lower bounds of droughts while a slightly higher difference was seen for the upper confidence bound of drought other seasons and scenarios also showed a similar kind of uncertainty similarly a gradual increase in the affected area can be seen with return periods low to high for example the area under the upper bound of drought starts increasing from 23 6 for 5 year return period to 98 8 for 100 year return period drought 4 5 percent changes in drought area the saf curves were further analyzed to assess the changes in drought characteristics due to climate change the assessments were carried out by comparing the saf curves with uncertainty under projected climate with the saf curves prepared with historical gpcc precipitation the comparison was made for all scenarios and for all seasons the obtained results for mean saf curves under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 scenarios are provided in tables 5 8 respectively as examples the tables show the results for three different periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 six seasons early winter late winter early summer later summer rabi and kharif five return periods 5 10 25 50 and 100 years and five drought severities 1 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 the negative values represent reduced the affected area and the positive values represent more affected area by future droughts table 5 for rcp2 6 shows that the percentage of area affected by droughts varies from season to season and for different drought severities most of the cases droughts were found to be reduced while some increases were found in almost all seasons at 5 and 10 year return periods rabi season was found to be the most affected at 10 years return period by moderate drought 1 0 spi during 2040 2069 the 5 year return period droughts 1 spi in this season were also found to increase 5 80 during 2070 2099 in table 6 for rcp4 5 higher negative values can be seen indicating fewer droughts covering less area on the other hand small positive values can be found for lower severities indicating more droughts covering small area the percentages of areas affected by droughts were found to vary from season to season however most of the seasons were found to show negative values for drought severities of 2 0 and above and positive values for drought severities of 1 0 and below early winter was the only season that does not show any increase in drought rabi season was found to show the highest drought increase 9 36 at 1 spi during 2040 2069 the same was also noticed under rcp2 6 where rabi season showed the highest increase at 10 year return period in table 7 for rcp6 0 it can be noted that results are similar to those of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 scenarios however a few differences can be seen in table 7 similar to rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rabi seasons showed the highest increase in drought affected area under rcp6 0 except 50 year return period at 2 spi during 2070 2099 when rabi drought is found to decrease up to 78 74 overall drought was found to be more at low severity 1 spi and return period 5 years and vice versa for example at 1 spi and at 5 year return period drought was projected to increase while decrease at 3 spi and at 100 year return period over the present century under rcp8 5 scenario table 8 moderate droughts 1 spi for the 5 year return period will continuously increase in rabi kharif and late winter seasons these droughts will affect more areas during 2040 2069 where rabi and kharif seasons will be the most affected with the increase by 7 78 and 6 2 respectively it was noticed that droughts in most cases will reduce while in few cases it will increase this increase will be more in the rabi season 14 02 moderate droughts for 10 year return period which is also found under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios it was also noticed that most of the zeros or no change were for 2 and above spi extreme droughts at 5 year return period 5 discussions balochistan is predominantly characterized by an arid climate precipitation is the major source of water for agriculture that is critically important for the livelihoods of the majority of the population in the province thus it is very important to understand future changes and variability in precipitation on the eve of climate change this study projected the future precipitation of balochistan pakistan from seven cmip5 gcms for four rcp scenarios using svm several studies wilby and wigley 1997 wilby et al 1998 have been conducted to determine the best downscaling method and reported that different downscaling methods generate radically different future projections for the same gcm predictors in order to avoid different future projections from the same gcm model this study used svm downscaling technique the performance of svm downscaling model was rigorously tested using various robust statistical tests the result obtained from different statistics reflects the high capability of svm in downscaling precipitation at arid region future changes in precipitation of gcms are often expected to yield a greater increase in precipitation under rcp8 5 compared to those in other rcps especially for the 2070s ouyang et al 2015 villarini et al 2015 yin et al 2015 similar results were obtained in the present study the higher increase in precipitation was observed in southeast parts of balochistan during monsoon which indicates that the monsoon will be more intense in future menon et al 2013 also noticed a consistent increase in monsoon precipitation historical saf curves clearly showed that on equal drought severity drought areal extent increases as drought return period increases it was observed that a drought with a severity of 1 0 can affect more than 30 area in all seasons at 5 year return period while the whole study area 100 can be affected if the drought return period increases to 50 years the results also revealed that the affected area of droughts varies from season to season however early winter season was the most affected season the projected saf curves for all seasons indicated that drought with higher severity and high return periods cover a small portion of the study area similar results were also shown in other studies akhtari et al 2008 mishra and singh 2009 mishra and cherkauer 2010 they reported that droughts with higher return period and severity can influence less area and droughts with lower return periods can cover more area the projected results indicate that there will be more droughts in future with low severity and return periods overall high reduction in drought was observed in all scenarios and periods 2010 2039 2040 2069 and 2070 2099 and a small increase for few cases overall the change in affected area would vary from 81 21 to 14 2 reflection of gcm uncertainties in estimated drought return period cannot be ruled out lee and kim 2013 bb used in this study provided a range of values that are helpful to understand the changes that may occur in future drought the range of uncertainty provided basic information for taking proper adaptation measures increased risk of droughts has been projected in many regions due to the increased variability of precipitation taylor et al 2013 temporal analysis of projected precipitation in this study showed an increase in precipitation however the increased precipitation doesn t confirm the reduction of droughts for all severities and return periods the droughts were found more severe with low return periods covering larger areas the similar was also reported in ipcc 2007 where they reported higher intensity and longer duration droughts over larger areas kundzewicz et al 2008 reported that the regions that often experienced drought are highly prone to projected droughts it indicates that areal extents of droughts will increase due to climate change this is partially true for the present study area where drought area was found to increase in some seasons i e early winter rabi and kharif 6 conclusions this study employed spi to characterize seasonal droughts by developing saf curves over balochistan pakistan seven cmip5 gcms precipitation were downscaled using svm method for historical period in order to assess the capability of the downscaling model in reproducing historical precipitation and subsequently used for future projection of precipitation the saf curves were developed based on gpcc historical and downscaled cmip5 gcm precipitation bb was used to estimate the uncertainty in future droughts additionally the historical and projected saf curves were compared to understand the changes in future droughts the main findings of the study are 1 svm model was successfully validated in downscaling cmip5 gcms precipitation 2 all climate models revealed the increased precipitation especially in the last part of the century 2070 2099 under all rcp scenarios this increase in precipitation will be gradual over the period from 2010 to 2099 overall precipitation was projected to increase in different seasons in the range of 8 to 41 over the region by the end of this century 3 the historical saf curves revealed that the higher return period e g 25 50 100 years but less severe spi 2 0 droughts are more in the study area the drought affected areas vary from season to season droughts during rabi season affect larger area as compared with other seasons 4 changes in future drought area revealed that the droughts with low severities spi 1 0 and return periods 10 years will increase in most of the seasons on the other hand affected area by droughts with high severity spi 1 5 and return periods 25 years will be reduced under all climate change scenarios however no consistency in the reduction of less severe droughts was found for different climate change scenarios 5 the uncertainty band of drought saf curves estimated using bb at a 95 confidence level revealed that uncertainty ranges were different for different return periods and seasons overall the saf curves with higher return periods are found to be more uncertain compared to those for lower return periods therefore it can be concluded that the projection of increased extreme droughts in the study area is highly uncertain in the present study possible changes in drought characteristics due to climate change are assessed using seven gcms and spi however more gcms and other drought indices can be used to have greater insight into future drought characteristics in the study area it is expected that the saf curves generated in this study will assist in disaster risk management and mitigation planning acknowledgments this work is supported by the post doctoral

6721,evasion of carbon dioxide co2 from lakes is a significant component in the continental carbon balance but most current co2 evasion estimates ignore daily co2 fluctuations to test the hypothesis that partial pressure of co2 pco2 and co2 evasion vary throughout a day due to biological processes driven by solar radiation we conducted in situ pco2 and ambient water measurements over eleven 10 h periods in a subtropical eutrophic shallow lake from november 2017 to may 2018 in situ measurements were performed at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst and co2 evasion rates were estimated based on the field pco2 records strong daily declining trends of pco2 and co2 flux were found throughout the seasons except for one winter day with unusually low temperatures at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst of a day average pco2 were 1131 839 345 and 205 µatm respectively while average co2 fluxes were 80 67 10 and 34 mmol m2 h 1 significant differences were found in average pco2 between any two measured time points in a day while significant reductions in co2 flux were observed between 10 00 and 14 00 cst and between 14 00 and 17 00 cst pco2 and co2 flux dynamics were most likely driven by the air water exchanges during nighttime hours and mainly driven by aquatic metabolism in the daytime these findings suggest possible large uncertainties in the estimation of carbon emitted from trophic lakes highlighting the need for further research on diurnal pco2 fluctuation from different aquatic ecosystems to improve co2 evasion estimation keywords co2 evasion pco2 eutrophication shallow lake subtropical surface water 1 introduction dynamics of carbon dioxide co2 in freshwaters plays an important role in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 many studies have reported supersaturation in freshwater systems including rivers e g richey et al 2002 butman and raymond 2011 ran et al 2015 lakes and reservoirs e g lapierre and del giorgio 2012 raymond et al 2013 sobek tranvik and cole 2005 weyhenmeyer kortelainen sobek muller and rantakari 2012 resulting in co2 evasive fluxes from waters to the atmosphere current estimates of global co2 evasion from rivers and lakes including reservoirs vary both largely from 0 23 to 1 8 pg yr 1 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 and from 0 32 to 0 64 pg c yr 1 aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 1994 2007 holgerson and raymond 2016 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 respectively this large difference challenges the accuracy and methodological approach in the current local and global estimation of co2 fluxes current estimates of co2 evasion are mainly from calculation using estimates of partial pressure of dissolved co2 pco2 derived from low time resolution i e weekly or monthly measurements of water alkalinity ph and temperature however pco2 in aquatic systems can fluctuate both spatially and temporarily raymond et al 1997 hélie et al 2002 ran et al 2017 influenced by respiration and photosynthesis which are regulated by temperature and sunlight availability falkowski and raven 2007 therefore one could expect diurnal fluctuations in biotic processes to significantly affect in stream and in lake carbon dynamics and hence pco2 over the span of a day this could have significant implications on the accuracy of calculating carbon budgets in freshwaters mostly based on low time resolution measurements over large space and time scales liu et al 2016 nowadays the study of co2 evasion variations over the span of a day remains an emerging research frontier some recent studies using the eddy covariance technique huotari et al 2011 liu et al 2016 have started to address this issue but most of them are conducted for boreal lakes vesala et al 2006 huotari et al 2011 a knowledge gap still exists on the uncertainties of current co2 outgassing estimates from lake systems with the consideration of diurnal co2 evasion variations especially for subtropical and tropical regions in this study we monitored daily fluctuations of pco2 and calculated daily co2 evasion in a subtropical shallow lake over 11 days in 3 h intervals from november 2017 to may 2018 the primary goal of this study is to fill a knowledge gap on the daily variability of pco2 and co2 evasion from lake waters the specific objectives of this study to 1 analyze daily variation in pco2 over different seasons in a nutrient rich subtropical shallow lake 2 estimate daily co2 evasion with the field measurements on pco2 and 3 determine environmental factors most influencing any notable daily variation by achieving these objectives we will test the hypothesis that pco2 will significantly decrease over the span of daylight due to a diurnal increase in photosynthesis driven by daily changes in temperature and solar radiation this fluctuation of pco2 would cause a distinct daily cycle of co2 evasion with the highest rate in the early morning and lowest rates in the afternoon 2 method 2 1 site description this study was conducted at university lake latitude 30 24 50 n longitude 91 10 00 w of the louisiana state university lsu in baton rouge

averages ranging from 11 c in january to 28 c in july long term annual precipitation in the area was reported to be about 1477 mm ranging from 159 mm in july to 81 mm in october xu and xu 2016 during the 7 month study period from november 2017 to may 2018 daily average air temperature fluctuated largely from 5 c in january to 29 c in may both air and water temperatures in the january field trip

lake were conducted during november 2017 and may 2018 by the watershed hydrology laboratory louisiana state university to record pco2 and other water quality parameters in 3 hr intervals trips were made only on sunny days to avoid any possible interference of rainfall and or stormwater runoff on pco2 in the lake surface water there was also no precipitation within the last 24 h before each sampling trip in each field trip four measurements were made from a pier p1 close to the lake outflow fig 1 at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst a set of water quality parameters including water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do concentration and saturation were measured using a ysi 556 multi probe meter ysi inc yellow springs oh usa at 30 40 cm below water surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 were measured using a c sense in situ pco2 sensor while fluorescence of chlorophyll a and colored dissolved organic matter cdom were measured with an aquafluor handheld fluorometer both pieces of equipment are manufactured by turner designs in sunnyvale ca usa the c sense operates through the diffusion of gas across a hydrophobic membrane into an isolated headspace and compensates for changes in temperature the amount of absorption of the wavelength is proportional to the concentration of co2 gas in the headspace with a 3 accuracy at the full scale turbidity was measured with a hach 2100p turbidity meter hach company loveland co usa in addition to the in situ measurements water samples were collected during each field trip with a grab sampler at 30 50 cm depth below water surface following the water quality parameter measurements at 7 00 cst from november 2017 to may 2018 to indicate influential processes controlling co2 dynamics

the following equation by jahne et al 1987 3 k t k 600 600 s c c o 2 n where n is the schmidt number exponent which is approximated 0 5 with wind speeds exceeding 3 7 m s 1 and increases to 0 75 when

measurements hastie et al 2018 and may vary with lake size read et al 2012 vachon and prairie 2013 since we applied k 600 in this study for only one lake possible error in co2 estimation with this parameter should be systematic chlorophyll a concentration was calculated through a previously reported strong positive relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and extracted chlorophyll a concentration xu and xu 2015b as given below 5 chl a 0 3944 f l u o 1 0039 where chl a is chlorophyll a concentration in µg l 1 and fluo is chlorophyll a fluorescence in arbitrary fluorescence units afu in addition hourly climatic records were gathered for the study period from a nearby weather station operated by the louisiana state university agricultural center the ben hur research station in baton rouge la n 30 22 46 w 91 10 00 located approximately 5 km southeast of the study site the records included a series of weather parameters among which air temperature wind speed for u 10 and solar radiation were used since u 10 was not measured directly above the lake water surface a certain bias may be present in co2 evasion estimates but the bias should be systematic and therefore should not affect the comparison of co2 evasion estimates between sampling times also we have previously used wind speed measurements from the ben hur station in a dissolved oxygen transfer study for the lake xu and xu 2016 and the modeling was successful all statistical comparisons in this study were conducted using the randomization test edgington and onghena 2007 with the significance level of 0 05 through rstudio 3 results 3 1 pco2 field measurements for the 11 sampling days daily pco2 averaged 630 µatm with the lowest record 99 µatm in april 2018 and the highest record 1018 µatm in march 2018 there was a clear consistent decreasing trend of pco2 from the early morning to the late afternoon fig 3 except for january 4th 2018 when both air and water temperatures were unusually low for the study area i e 3 and 3 c excluding january 4th 2018 average pco2 from other 10 days were 1211 590 875 390 301 218 and 168 143 µatm at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst respectively significant difference in average pco2 was found between any two measured time points in a day table 1 when compared to the average level at 7 00 cst average pco2 at 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst decreased by 28 75 and 86 respectively a consistent exponential relationship was found between pco2 and daylight hours table 2 3 2 co2 evasion estimation corresponding to the daily pco2 change a rapidly decreasing trend in co2 flux with daylight hours was derived for all sampling days except for january 4th 2018 fig 3 during the 7 month study period daily co2 fluxes ranged from 47 mmol m2 h 1 in april 2018 to 90 mmol m2 h 1 in march 2018 with an average flux rate of 26 36 mmol m2 h 1 significant reductions in daily co2 flux were observed between 10 00 and 14 00 cst and between 14 00 and 17 00 cst table 1 when compared to the average level at 7 00 cst average co2 flux rates at 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst decreased by 17 118 and 144 respectively with the strongest declining trend on march 31 2018 fig 3 and table 2 the decline of co2 flux with time can be approached in a linear relation with relatively high regression coefficient table 2 3 3 relationships between pco2 and ambient factors the ambient conditions during the 7 month study period showed a clear seasonal change from fall to summer with an unprecedented cold winter reaching an air temperature of 5 c and a water temperature of 3 c fig 2 the large seasonal fluctuation has caused great variation of other ambient factors recorded at a sampling time table 3 overall from 7 00 to 17 00 cst a declining daily trend was found for average chlorophyll a concentration and cdom fluorescence coincident with the declining trend of pco2 and co2 during the daylight hours other relevant ambient parameters including average ph water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration saturation and solar radiation showed an increasing trend opposite to the daily pco2 and co2 trends fig 3 and table 3 specifically clear opposite daily trends were observed between pco2 and do concentrations on a daily base and a significant negative correlation was found between average daytime trends for pco2 and do concentrations during the study period r 2 0 95 fig 4 negative correlations were found between daily average temperature and pco2 at 17 00 cst and between daily average temperature and pco2 daily declining rates b 1 in the studied lake table 2 and fig 4 statistically significant negative correlations could be seen between pco2 and solar radiation dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation table 4 only on january 4th 2018 daily trends of pco2 and co2 were similar to those of solar radiation and water temperature fig 5 from november 2017 to may 2018 dic concentrations averaged 11 5 2 3 mg l 1 ranging from 8 3 to 17 2 mg l 1 while δ13cdic varied from 9 4 to 1 1 averaging at 4 4 2 5 a majority of water samples showed a δ13cdic value between 6 and 0 and a loose negative relation was found between dic concentration and δ13cdic fig 6 doc concentration and δ13cdoc varied from 10 1 to 17 5 mg l 1 and from 29 3 to 25 8 respectively averaging at 12 2 2 5 mg l 1 and 27 8 1 0 a majority of samples showed a δ13cdoc value below 27 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 source sink interchange of co2 fluxes a recent study on lake water co2 evasion in central louisiana reported that lake waters could function interchangeably as a co2 source and a co2 sink seasonally xu and xu 2018 the findings from this study demonstrate that a eutrophic lake can be also both a co2 source and a co2 sink even over the span of a day which agrees with previous results from eddy covariance flux measurements conducted in other regions liu et al 2016 the studied lake water was often saturated by co2 i e 400 µatm in the morning hours resulting in co2 evasion rates up to nearly 250 mmol m2 h 1 fig 3 on the contrast in the late afternoons pco2 levels in the lake were often unsaturated resulting in co2 invasion from the atmosphere into the lake water as high as 92 mmol m2 h 1 this interchanging role of co2 source sink function in an aquatic system has an important implication in lake carbon budgeting which will be further discussed in the following section the rapid decline in pco2 concentration and co2 outgassing as well as the negative correlation between daytime pco2 and do concentrations found in this study strongly suggest that during the daytime co2 flux is mainly driven by photosynthesis or a photosynthetic and respiratory balance temperature has been observed to cause diurnal variation in pco2 but its direct effect is generally minor when compared to biologically mediated changes nimick et al 2011 similar daily trends of pco2 and do would be expected if temperature was directly driving dissolved gas concentration as they both become less soluble at higher temperatures in this study pco2 and do responded in opposite directions to the changing temperature fig 4 suggesting that the primary driver of dissolved gas concentration has been the result from a photosynthetic and respiratory balance instead temperature appeared to affect pco2 dynamics indirectly through this balance fig 4 that is higher temperature would enhance biological activities leading to greater daytime pco2 decreasing rates and lower pco2 levels in the late afternoons fig 4 the variation of solar radiation in the daytime also played an important role in the notable pco2 daily variation by a direct influence on photosynthesis fig 4 combined with the fact that pco2 and solar radiation showed a significant negative correlation at a seasonal scale table 4 the hypothesis pco2 decline in the daytime is driven by daily changes in solar radiation and temperature can be accepted previous studies reported a δ13c value for atmospheric co2 in the northern hemisphere between 8 25 and 7 25 ciais et al 1995 and a δ13c value for dic in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 between 0 6 and 1 9 mook et al 1974 in our study we found that a majority of water samples collected at 7 00 cst had a δ13cdic value between 6 0 and 0 suggesting that atmospheric exchanges may have played an important role determining pco2 dynamics from sunset to sunrise at the same time the decreasing trend between dic concentration and δ13cdic may likely be an indication that dic from other 13c depleted sources like soil co2 and aquatic respiration could be the superimposed second order phenomenon that affected pco2 dynamics overnight in this subtropical lake 4 2 uncertainty in co2 evasion estimates from lake systems as discussed above the interchanging role of co2 source sink over the span of a day due to pco2 change is driven by several factors primarily daylight and hence the biological processes in lake waters the findings suggest that uncertainty can exist in current co2 evasion estimates from lake systems owing to the daily fluctuation on one hand current estimates of annual co2 evasion are mostly calculated using data collected or derived from low time resolution i e weekly or monthly measurements e g cole et al 2007 in this study starting from 7 00 cst the time frame required to observe significant decreases in pco2 is small and this level of variability could potentially yield an underestimation or overestimation in daily co2 outgassing based on one time measurements on the other hand co2 evasion could be much stronger in the nocturnal period as darkness favors respiration over photosynthesis most studies did not take this into consideration when estimating co2 evasion very few cases have been reported regarding the nocturnal diurnal distinction in co2 efflux for instance from a reservoir study in southern usa liu et al 2016 found that co2 effluxes at night were approximately 70 greater than those during the day from a study conducted in lochaber lake in eastern nova scotia canada spafford and risk 2018 reported that 65 95 of the total co2 release from a day occurred actually during the nocturnal period i e 21 00 to 7 00 atlantic daylight time a recent pilot study by reiman and xu 2018 on diel fluctuation of pco2 in the lower mississippi river found a consistent cycle of riverine pco2 with highest values before sunset and lowest values during peak daylight consequently reiman and xu calculated a 10 25 higher co2 outgassing rate during hours of darkness than daylight hence they postulated that many river co2 emission estimates were likely underestimated because field measurements were normally gathered during daylight hours similar findings revealing the rapid daily changes of pco2 and co2 flux have been reported for other systems from a carbon study on an australian floodplain bass et al 2013 reported that co2 flux increased by a factor of six from a minimum of 0 03 g co2 c m 2 h 1 at 16 00 to a maximum of 0 18 g co2 c m 2 h 1 at 3 45 australian central standard time the average change in flux over time in a diurnal cycle was 5 7 4 2 h 1 bass et al 2013 shao et al 2015 reported a strong diurnal change of co2 flux from 7 34 µmol m 2 s 1 to 12 19 µmol m 2 s 1 in western lake erie in north america in august and september of 2012 and 2013 aurela et al 2015 also observed clear diurnal cycles of co2 flux in a headwater lake during summer warm months from july to september in northwestern finland based on the findings from these and our own studies we argue that large uncertainties exist in co2 evasion estimates from lake systems 4 3 future needs for constraining uncertainties in lake co2 evasion estimation the daily variability in pco2 measured in our study emphases the need for further studies on daily and diurnal variations of co2 fluxes in other geographical regions lakes in cold regions may show no or different daily trends of pco2 and co2 flux due to low nutrient level and or the temperature dependence of metabolism in this study the unusual daily trend of pco2 and co2 flux on january 4th 2018 could be an example for carbon dynamic under low water temperatures in the morning of the day water temperature was below 5 c a temperature that is considered as biologic zero in soil science rabenhorst 2005 at 7 00 cst pco2 in the lake water was close to atmospheric equilibrium with δ13cdic at 1 08 due likely to the inhibited aquatic respiration during the nocturnal period under low air and water temperatures 3 and 3 c it increased rapidly in the daytime with rising solar radiation and temperature to a peak at 14 00 cst fig 5 then the changing ambient conditions during the day may have enhanced aquatic bioactivities shifted the balance between photosynthesis and respiration and resulted in a pco2 decline on the other hand the magnitude of daily co2 fluctuation could vary as a consequence of the differences in metabolic acceleration for lake ecosystems there have been studies e g gardner et al 2011 weber et al 2015 reporting that linear warming would increase metabolic rates exponentially in waters it suggests that with similar trophic states and daily temperature changing rates a tropical low land lake with an initial temperature of 20 c at 7 00 would have a much greater response in ecosystem metabolism through the day when compared with lakes in cold regions with an initial temperature of 5 c at 7 00 it needs to be noted that the vast majority of global lakes are located in cold boreal and arctic regions these lakes typically have a much lower nutrient level when compared to the lakes in warmer regions therefore lakes in cold regions may not show strong daily fluctuation in co2 evasion as found in our study nonetheless incorporating daily co2 dynamics from different geographical regions could eventually constrain the uncertainty in co2 balancing from lake ecosystems this study was conducted at a hyper eutrophic lake whose daily biological processes and hence daily co2 evasion may not reflect those of aquatic systems that are not or less nutrient enriched therefore assessments of lake water co2 evasion under different trophic states would also contribute to more accurate accounting of lake co2 evasion to our knowledge most studies reporting diurnal co2 variations have attributed the major reason to aquatic metabolism for instance bass et al 2013 stated that biological factors are the most significant driver for co2 efflux dynamics proved by the opposite trends of dic and do and the diurnal doc variation shao et al 2015 reported a significant negative correlation between the co2 flux and chlorophyll a concentration on a monthly scale however for daily co2 fluctuations in lakes with oligotrophic conditions results to date have been inconsistent indicating that lakes may or may not have a noticeable diurnal co2 trend for example shao et al 2015 found that in western lake erie the diurnal co2 flux variation appeared lower in months with chlorophyll a concentration 5 µm l 1 or without any noticeable differences over time morin et al 2018 reported that co2 flux did not show any clear diel trend in an oligotrophic lake in northern michigan the united states except for the growing season when some photosynthetic activity was present the net carbon flux from the lake was primarily correlated with wind speed morin et al 2018 in contrast spafford and risk 2018 observed a clearly varying co2 release on the daily scale from lochaber lake in eastern nova scotia another factor that should be given thought to is lake water depth the observed lake in this study is shallow with a water depth of about 1 m at the sampling site and an average depth of 0 9 m for the entire lake xu and xu 2015a diurnal co2 dynamics at a deep lake could be very different from that at a shallow lake due to the availability of light and energy and gas transfer between layers for deep lakes with clear stratifications the diurnal co2 variation in the pelagic zone would be attributed to different processes during periods of stratification and convective mixing eugster et al 2003 primary production would primarily occur at lake surface where light is most available while anaerobic respiration such as methanogenesis would primarily occur in the anoxic benthos of lakes also while lake surface temperatures are strongly affected by direct heat exchange across the air water interface liu et al 2012 water temperature at deep layers is primarily determined by lake mixing behavior as a result metabolic responses to diurnal temperature changes would also heavily depend on water depth due to reduced warming rates at the bottom of lakes relative to the surface kraemer et al 2017 furthermore although traditional estimates of air water gas transfer velocity generally use empirical functions that depend on wind speed alone wanninkhof 1992 recent studies have claimed the importance of the mixed layer water depth to the gas transfer velocity rutgersson and smedman 2010 specifically the transfer velocity is significantly enhanced by a large mixed layer depth and the enhancement increases as the surface cooling increases rutgersson and smedman 2010 it could be an important factor affecting the diurnal cycle of air water co2 fluxes especially for deep lakes it is also worth noting that diurnal co2 exchanges in the littoral zone of a deep lake could be possibly influenced by a form of microstratification lateral variation in substrate composition and carbon availability spafford and risk 2018 which may be similar to a shallow lake however it may also be affected by other pelagic environmental drivers and studies regarding that are scarce 5 conclusions this study monitored pco2 and ambient water conditions in 3 h intervals over eleven 10 h periods from november 2017 to may 2018 in a subtropical eutrophic lake in louisiana usa a rapidly declining trend of pco2 was found from early mornings to late afternoons except for one day where a very unusual cold front occurred pco2 measurements in the lake water were highest at 7 00 cst 1131 619 µatm and lowest at 17 00 cst 205 183 µatm resulting in the greatest co2 evasion rates occurring in the morning hours 80 and 67 mmol m2 h 1 at 7 00 and 10 00 cst and negative evasion in the afternoon hours 10 and 34 mmol m2 h 1 at 14 00 and 17 00 cst the daily co2 source sink interchange of the lake reflects a dynamic of lake ecosystem metabolism and atmospheric exchange solar radiation and water temperature appear to be the most influential environmental factors affecting the dynamics over the span of daylight based on the findings we conclude that large uncertainties exist in the annual co2 evasion estimates from eutrophic lake systems owing to a large pco2 variation during the span of a day and that pco2 concentrations and co2 evasion rates during the night hours in the lake water are very likely much higher than those during the daylight hours to constrain uncertainties in co2 balancing for lake ecosystems further studies are needed on diurnal pco2 and co2 evasion fluctuations

6721,evasion of carbon dioxide co2 from lakes is a significant component in the continental carbon balance but most current co2 evasion estimates ignore daily co2 fluctuations to test the hypothesis that partial pressure of co2 pco2 and co2 evasion vary throughout a day due to biological processes driven by solar radiation we conducted in situ pco2 and ambient water measurements over eleven 10 h periods in a subtropical eutrophic shallow lake from november 2017 to may 2018 in situ measurements were performed at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst and co2 evasion rates were estimated based on the field pco2 records strong daily declining trends of pco2 and co2 flux were found throughout the seasons except for one winter day with unusually low temperatures at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst of a day average pco2 were 1131 839 345 and 205 µatm respectively while average co2 fluxes were 80 67 10 and 34 mmol m2 h 1 significant differences were found in average pco2 between any two measured time points in a day while significant reductions in co2 flux were observed between 10 00 and 14 00 cst and between 14 00 and 17 00 cst pco2 and co2 flux dynamics were most likely driven by the air water exchanges during nighttime hours and mainly driven by aquatic metabolism in the daytime these findings suggest possible large uncertainties in the estimation of carbon emitted from trophic lakes highlighting the need for further research on diurnal pco2 fluctuation from different aquatic ecosystems to improve co2 evasion estimation keywords co2 evasion pco2 eutrophication shallow lake subtropical surface water 1 introduction dynamics of carbon dioxide co2 in freshwaters plays an important role in the global carbon cycle cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 many studies have reported supersaturation in freshwater systems including rivers e g richey et al 2002 butman and raymond 2011 ran et al 2015 lakes and reservoirs e g lapierre and del giorgio 2012 raymond et al 2013 sobek tranvik and cole 2005 weyhenmeyer kortelainen sobek muller and rantakari 2012 resulting in co2 evasive fluxes from waters to the atmosphere current estimates of global co2 evasion from rivers and lakes including reservoirs vary both largely from 0 23 to 1 8 pg yr 1 cole et al 2007 raymond et al 2013 lauerwald et al 2015 and from 0 32 to 0 64 pg c yr 1 aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 1994 2007 holgerson and raymond 2016 raymond et al 2013 tranvik et al 2009 respectively this large difference challenges the accuracy and methodological approach in the current local and global estimation of co2 fluxes current estimates of co2 evasion are mainly from calculation using estimates of partial pressure of dissolved co2 pco2 derived from low time resolution i e weekly or monthly measurements of water alkalinity ph and temperature however pco2 in aquatic systems can fluctuate both spatially and temporarily raymond et al 1997 hélie et al 2002 ran et al 2017 influenced by respiration and photosynthesis which are regulated by temperature and sunlight availability falkowski and raven 2007 therefore one could expect diurnal fluctuations in biotic processes to significantly affect in stream and in lake carbon dynamics and hence pco2 over the span of a day this could have significant implications on the accuracy of calculating carbon budgets in freshwaters mostly based on low time resolution measurements over large space and time scales liu et al 2016 nowadays the study of co2 evasion variations over the span of a day remains an emerging research frontier some recent studies using the eddy covariance technique huotari et al 2011 liu et al 2016 have started to address this issue but most of them are conducted for boreal lakes vesala et al 2006 huotari et al 2011 a knowledge gap still exists on the uncertainties of current co2 outgassing estimates from lake systems with the consideration of diurnal co2 evasion variations especially for subtropical and tropical regions in this study we monitored daily fluctuations of pco2 and calculated daily co2 evasion in a subtropical shallow lake over 11 days in 3 h intervals from november 2017 to may 2018 the primary goal of this study is to fill a knowledge gap on the daily variability of pco2 and co2 evasion from lake waters the specific objectives of this study to 1 analyze daily variation in pco2 over different seasons in a nutrient rich subtropical shallow lake 2 estimate daily co2 evasion with the field measurements on pco2 and 3 determine environmental factors most influencing any notable daily variation by achieving these objectives we will test the hypothesis that pco2 will significantly decrease over the span of daylight due to a diurnal increase in photosynthesis driven by daily changes in temperature and solar radiation this fluctuation of pco2 would cause a distinct daily cycle of co2 evasion with the highest rate in the early morning and lowest rates in the afternoon 2 method 2 1 site description this study was conducted at university lake latitude 30 24 50 n longitude 91 10 00 w of the louisiana state university lsu in baton rouge

lake were conducted during november 2017 and may 2018 by the watershed hydrology laboratory louisiana state university to record pco2 and other water quality parameters in 3 hr intervals trips were made only on sunny days to avoid any possible interference of rainfall and or stormwater runoff on pco2 in the lake surface water there was also no precipitation within the last 24 h before each sampling trip in each field trip four measurements were made from a pier p1 close to the lake outflow fig 1 at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 central standard time of the united states cst a set of water

isolated headspace and compensates for changes in temperature the amount of absorption of the wavelength is proportional to the concentration of co2 gas in the headspace with a 3 accuracy at the full

sampler at 30 50 cm depth below water surface following the water quality parameter measurements at 7 00 cst from november 2017 to may 2018 to indicate influential processes controlling co2 dynamics

the following equation by jahne et al 1987 3 k t k 600 600 s c c o 2 n where n is the schmidt number exponent which is approximated 0 5 with wind speeds exceeding 3 7 m s 1 and increases to 0 75 when

measurements hastie et al 2018 and may vary with lake size read et al 2012 vachon and prairie 2013 since we applied k 600 in this study for only one lake possible error in co2 estimation with this parameter should be systematic chlorophyll a concentration was calculated through a previously reported strong positive relationship between chlorophyll a fluorescence and extracted chlorophyll a concentration xu and xu 2015b as given below 5 chl a 0 3944 f l u o 1 0039 where chl a is chlorophyll a concentration in µg l 1 and fluo is chlorophyll a fluorescence in arbitrary fluorescence units afu in addition hourly climatic records were gathered for the study period from a nearby weather station operated by the louisiana state university agricultural center the ben hur research station in baton rouge la n 30 22 46 w 91 10 00 located approximately 5 km southeast of the study site the records included a series of weather parameters among which air temperature wind speed for u 10 and solar radiation were used since u 10 was not measured directly above the lake water surface a certain bias may be present in co2 evasion estimates but the bias should be systematic and therefore should not affect the comparison of co2 evasion estimates between sampling times also we have previously used wind speed measurements from the ben hur station in a dissolved oxygen transfer study for the lake xu and xu 2016 and the modeling was successful all statistical comparisons in this study were conducted using the randomization test edgington and onghena 2007 with the significance level of 0 05 through rstudio 3 results 3 1 pco2 field measurements for the 11 sampling days daily pco2 averaged 630 µatm with the lowest record 99 µatm in april 2018 and the highest record 1018 µatm in march 2018 there was a clear consistent decreasing trend of pco2 from the early morning to the late afternoon fig 3 except for january 4th 2018 when both air and water temperatures were unusually low for the study area i e 3 and 3 c excluding january 4th 2018 average pco2 from other 10 days were 1211 590 875 390 301 218 and 168 143 µatm at 7 00 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst respectively significant difference in average pco2 was found between any two measured time points in a day table 1 when compared to the average level at 7 00 cst average pco2 at 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst decreased by 28 75 and 86 respectively a consistent exponential relationship was found between pco2 and daylight hours table 2 3 2 co2 evasion estimation corresponding to the daily pco2 change a rapidly decreasing trend in co2 flux with daylight hours was derived for all sampling days except for january 4th 2018 fig 3 during the 7 month study period daily co2 fluxes ranged from 47 mmol m2 h 1 in april 2018 to 90 mmol m2 h 1 in march 2018 with an average flux rate of 26 36 mmol m2 h 1 significant reductions in daily co2 flux were observed between 10 00 and 14 00 cst and between 14 00 and 17 00 cst table 1 when compared to the average level at 7 00 cst average co2 flux rates at 10 00 14 00 and 17 00 cst decreased by 17 118 and 144 respectively with the strongest declining trend on march 31 2018 fig 3 and table 2 the decline of co2 flux with time can be approached in a linear relation with relatively high regression coefficient table 2 3 3 relationships between pco2 and ambient factors the ambient conditions during the 7 month study period showed a clear seasonal change from fall to summer with an unprecedented cold winter reaching an air temperature of 5 c and a water temperature of 3 c fig 2 the large seasonal fluctuation has caused great variation of other ambient factors recorded at a sampling time table 3 overall from 7 00 to 17 00 cst a declining daily trend was found for average chlorophyll a concentration and cdom fluorescence coincident with the declining trend of pco2 and co2 during the daylight hours other relevant ambient parameters including average ph water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration saturation and solar radiation showed an increasing trend opposite to the daily pco2 and co2 trends fig 3 and table 3 specifically clear opposite daily trends were observed between pco2 and do concentrations on a daily base and a significant negative correlation was found between average daytime trends for pco2 and do concentrations during the study period r 2 0 95 fig 4 negative correlations were found between daily average temperature and pco2 at 17 00 cst and between daily average temperature and pco2 daily declining rates b 1 in the studied lake table 2 and fig 4 statistically significant negative correlations could be seen between pco2 and solar radiation dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation table 4 only on january 4th 2018 daily trends of pco2 and co2 were similar to those of solar radiation and water temperature fig 5 from november 2017 to may 2018 dic concentrations averaged 11 5 2 3 mg l 1 ranging from 8 3 to 17 2 mg l 1 while δ13cdic varied from 9 4 to 1 1 averaging at 4 4 2 5 a majority of water samples showed a δ13cdic value between 6 and 0 and a loose negative relation was found between dic concentration and δ13cdic fig 6 doc concentration and δ13cdoc varied from 10 1 to 17 5 mg l 1 and from 29 3 to 25 8 respectively averaging at 12 2 2 5 mg l 1 and 27 8 1 0 a majority of samples showed a δ13cdoc value below 27 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 source sink interchange of co2 fluxes a recent study on lake water co2 evasion in central louisiana reported that lake waters could function interchangeably as a co2 source and a co2 sink seasonally xu and xu 2018 the findings from this study demonstrate that a eutrophic lake can be also both a co2 source and a co2 sink even over the span of a day which agrees with previous results from eddy covariance flux measurements conducted in other regions liu et al 2016 the studied lake water was often saturated by co2 i e 400 µatm in the morning hours resulting in co2 evasion rates up to nearly 250 mmol m2 h 1 fig 3 on the contrast in the late afternoons pco2 levels in the lake were often unsaturated resulting in co2 invasion from the atmosphere into the lake water as high as 92 mmol m2 h 1 this interchanging role of co2 source sink function in an aquatic system has an important implication in lake carbon budgeting which will be further discussed in the following section the rapid decline in pco2 concentration and co2 outgassing as well as the negative correlation between daytime pco2 and do concentrations found in this study strongly suggest that during the daytime co2 flux is mainly driven by photosynthesis or a photosynthetic and respiratory balance temperature has been observed to cause diurnal variation in pco2 but its direct effect is generally minor when compared to biologically mediated changes nimick et al 2011 similar daily trends of pco2 and do would be expected if temperature was directly driving dissolved gas concentration as they both become less soluble at higher temperatures in this study pco2 and do responded in opposite directions to the changing temperature fig 4 suggesting that the primary driver of dissolved gas concentration has been the result from a photosynthetic and respiratory balance instead temperature appeared to affect pco2 dynamics indirectly through this balance fig 4 that is higher temperature would enhance biological activities leading to greater daytime pco2 decreasing rates and lower pco2 levels in the late afternoons fig 4 the variation of solar radiation in the daytime also played an important role in the notable pco2 daily variation by a direct influence on photosynthesis fig 4 combined with the fact that pco2 and solar radiation showed a significant negative correlation at a seasonal scale table 4 the hypothesis pco2 decline in the daytime is driven by daily changes in solar radiation and temperature can be accepted previous studies reported a δ13c value for atmospheric co2 in the northern hemisphere between 8 25 and 7 25 ciais et al 1995 and a δ13c value for dic in equilibrium with atmospheric co2 between 0 6 and 1 9 mook et al 1974 in our study we found that a majority of water samples collected at 7 00 cst had a δ13cdic value between 6 0 and 0 suggesting that atmospheric exchanges may have played an important role determining pco2 dynamics from sunset to sunrise at the same time the decreasing trend between dic concentration and δ13cdic may likely be an indication that dic from other 13c depleted sources like soil co2 and aquatic respiration could be the superimposed second order phenomenon that affected pco2 dynamics overnight in this subtropical lake 4 2 uncertainty in co2 evasion estimates from lake systems as discussed above the interchanging role of co2 source sink over the span of a day due to pco2 change is driven by several factors primarily daylight and hence the biological processes in lake waters the findings suggest that uncertainty can exist in current co2 evasion estimates from lake systems owing to the daily fluctuation on one hand current estimates of annual co2 evasion are mostly calculated using data collected or derived from low time resolution i e weekly or monthly measurements e g cole et al 2007 in this study starting from 7 00 cst the time frame required to observe significant decreases in pco2 is small and this level of variability could potentially yield an underestimation or overestimation in daily co2 outgassing based on one time measurements on the other hand co2 evasion could be much stronger in the nocturnal period as darkness favors respiration over photosynthesis most studies did not take this into consideration when estimating co2 evasion very few cases have been reported regarding the nocturnal diurnal distinction in co2 efflux for instance from a reservoir study in southern usa liu et al 2016 found that co2 effluxes at night were approximately 70 greater than those during the day from a study conducted in lochaber lake in eastern nova scotia canada spafford and risk 2018 reported that 65 95 of the total co2 release from a day occurred actually during the nocturnal period i e 21 00 to 7 00 atlantic daylight time a recent pilot study by reiman and xu 2018 on diel fluctuation of pco2 in the lower mississippi river found a consistent cycle of riverine pco2 with highest values before sunset and lowest values during peak daylight consequently reiman and xu calculated a 10 25 higher co2 outgassing rate during hours of darkness than daylight hence they postulated that many river co2 emission estimates were likely underestimated because field measurements were normally gathered during daylight hours similar findings revealing the rapid daily changes of pco2 and co2 flux have been reported for other systems from a carbon study on an australian floodplain bass et al 2013 reported that co2 flux increased by a factor of six from a minimum of 0 03 g co2 c m 2 h 1 at 16 00 to a maximum of 0 18 g co2 c m 2 h 1 at 3 45 australian central standard time the average change in flux over time in a diurnal cycle was 5 7 4 2 h 1 bass et al 2013 shao et al 2015 reported a strong diurnal change of co2 flux from 7 34 µmol m 2 s 1 to 12 19 µmol m 2 s 1 in western lake erie in north america in august and september of 2012 and 2013 aurela et al 2015 also observed clear diurnal cycles of co2 flux in a headwater lake during summer warm months from july to september in northwestern finland based on the findings from these and our own studies we argue that large uncertainties exist in co2 evasion estimates from lake systems 4 3 future needs for constraining uncertainties in lake co2 evasion estimation the daily variability in pco2 measured in our study emphases the need for further studies on daily and diurnal variations of co2 fluxes in other geographical regions lakes in cold regions may show no or different daily trends of pco2 and co2 flux due to low nutrient level and or the temperature dependence of metabolism in this study the unusual daily trend of pco2 and co2 flux on january 4th 2018 could be an example for carbon dynamic under low water temperatures in the morning of the day water temperature was below 5 c a temperature that is considered as biologic zero in soil science rabenhorst 2005 at 7 00 cst pco2 in the lake water was close to atmospheric equilibrium with δ13cdic at 1 08 due likely to the inhibited aquatic respiration during the nocturnal period under low air and water temperatures 3 and 3 c it increased rapidly in the daytime with rising solar radiation and temperature to a peak at 14 00 cst fig 5 then the changing ambient conditions during the day may have enhanced aquatic bioactivities shifted the balance between photosynthesis and respiration and resulted in a pco2 decline on the other hand the magnitude of daily co2 fluctuation could vary as a consequence of the differences in metabolic acceleration for lake ecosystems there have been studies e g gardner et al 2011 weber et al 2015 reporting that linear warming would increase metabolic rates exponentially in waters it suggests that with similar trophic states and daily temperature changing rates a tropical low land lake with an initial temperature of 20 c at 7 00 would have a much greater response in ecosystem metabolism through the day when compared with lakes in cold regions with an initial temperature of 5 c at 7 00 it needs to be noted that the vast majority of global lakes are located in cold boreal and arctic regions these lakes typically have a much lower nutrient level when compared to the lakes in warmer regions therefore lakes in cold regions may not show strong daily fluctuation in co2 evasion as found in our study nonetheless incorporating daily co2 dynamics from different geographical regions could eventually constrain the uncertainty in co2 balancing from lake ecosystems this study was conducted at a hyper eutrophic lake whose daily biological processes and hence daily co2 evasion may not reflect those of aquatic systems that are not or less nutrient enriched therefore assessments of lake water co2 evasion under different trophic states would also contribute to more accurate accounting of lake co2 evasion to our knowledge most studies reporting diurnal co2 variations have attributed the major reason to aquatic metabolism for instance bass et al 2013 stated that biological factors are the most significant driver for co2 efflux dynamics proved by the opposite trends of dic and do and the diurnal doc variation shao et al 2015 reported a significant negative correlation between the co2 flux and chlorophyll a concentration on a monthly scale however for daily co2 fluctuations in lakes with oligotrophic conditions results to date have been inconsistent indicating that lakes may or may not have a noticeable diurnal co2 trend for example shao et al 2015 found that in western lake erie the diurnal co2 flux variation appeared lower in months with chlorophyll a concentration 5 µm l 1 or without any noticeable differences over time morin et al 2018 reported that co2 flux did not show any clear diel trend in an oligotrophic lake in northern michigan the united states except for the growing season when some photosynthetic activity was present the net carbon flux from the lake was primarily correlated with wind speed morin et al 2018 in contrast spafford and risk 2018 observed a clearly varying co2 release on the daily scale from lochaber lake in eastern nova scotia another factor that should be given thought to is lake water depth the observed lake in this study is shallow with a water depth of about 1 m at the sampling site and an average depth of 0 9 m for the entire lake xu and xu 2015a diurnal co2 dynamics at a deep lake could be very different from that at a shallow lake due to the availability of light and energy and gas transfer between layers for deep lakes with clear stratifications the diurnal co2 variation in the pelagic zone would be attributed to different processes during periods of stratification and convective mixing eugster et al 2003 primary production would primarily occur at lake surface where light is most available while anaerobic respiration such as methanogenesis would primarily occur in the anoxic benthos of lakes also while lake surface temperatures are strongly affected by direct heat exchange across the air water interface liu et al 2012 water temperature at deep layers is primarily determined by lake mixing behavior as a result metabolic responses to diurnal temperature changes would also heavily depend on water depth due to reduced warming rates at the bottom of lakes relative to the surface kraemer et al 2017 furthermore although traditional estimates of air water gas transfer velocity generally use empirical functions that depend on wind speed alone wanninkhof 1992 recent studies have claimed the importance of the mixed layer water depth to the gas transfer velocity rutgersson and smedman 2010 specifically the transfer velocity is significantly enhanced by a large mixed layer depth and the enhancement increases as the surface cooling increases rutgersson and smedman 2010 it could be an important factor affecting the diurnal cycle of air water co2 fluxes especially for deep lakes it is also worth noting that diurnal co2 exchanges in the littoral zone of a deep lake could be possibly influenced by a form of microstratification lateral variation in substrate composition and carbon availability spafford and risk 2018 which may be similar to a shallow lake however it may also be affected by other pelagic environmental drivers and studies regarding that are scarce 5 conclusions this study monitored pco2 and ambient water conditions in 3 h intervals over eleven 10 h periods from november 2017 to may 2018 in a subtropical eutrophic lake in louisiana usa a rapidly declining trend of pco2 was found from early mornings to late afternoons except for one day where a very unusual cold front occurred pco2 measurements in the lake water were highest at 7 00 cst 1131 619 µatm and lowest at 17 00 cst 205 183 µatm resulting in the greatest co2 evasion rates occurring in the morning hours 80 and 67 mmol m2 h 1 at 7 00 and 10 00 cst and negative evasion in the afternoon hours 10 and 34 mmol m2 h 1 at 14 00 and 17 00 cst the daily co2 source sink interchange of the lake reflects a dynamic of lake ecosystem metabolism and atmospheric exchange solar radiation and water temperature appear to be the most influential environmental factors affecting the dynamics over the span of daylight based on the findings we conclude that large uncertainties exist in the annual co2 evasion estimates from eutrophic lake systems owing to a large pco2 variation during the span of a day and that pco2 concentrations and co2 evasion rates during the night hours in the lake water are very likely much higher than those during the daylight hours to constrain uncertainties in co2 balancing for lake ecosystems further studies are needed on diurnal pco2 and co2 evasion fluctuations

6722,a multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotope δ2h δ18o and 3h hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity tools were used to revive a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha region maharashtra india in this study groundwater recharge processes monsoon characteristics climate variables during evaporation in the region were evaluated using environmental isotope techniques additionally electrical resistivity surveys were also conducted to understand the aquifer geometry and weak zones fractures lineament for the sustainable groundwater development significant seasonal variation observed in stable isotopic composition deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation helped to delineate the sources of vapour generating the rains during both the southwest and northeast monsoons a negative correlation between stable isotopic content and amount of precipitation is observed two sources of groundwater recharge namely natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures detention tanks were deduced hydrochemical data also corroborates the above findings environmental isotope data show that the groundwater is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern and its residence time is of the order of a few years modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment helped in estimating the climatic variables such as temperature and humidity during evaporation also the recharge from the detention tanks was quantified based on isotope balance model aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zones were delineated in a part of the study area using electrical resistivity method an integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is found to be effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas keywords environmental isotopes groundwater recharge electrical resistivity survey detention tanks drought vidarbha region 1 introduction groundwater is the only reliable source of freshwater for domestic and irrigational purposes in drought prone areas as surface waters are rarely available due to scanty rainfall and high evaporation rates hence it is crucial not only to delineate the groundwater potential zones in these regions but also to monitor and conserve these precious water resources a thorough understanding of groundwater recharge is a prerequisite for the effective development and management of groundwater in these areas groundwater prospecting and exploration has become a challenging task in india in general and certain drought prone areas in particular due to vagaries in rainfall and complex hydrogeological conditions geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity survey are commonly employed for identifying the groundwater potential zones yadav et al 1997 kumar et al 2007 although they serve the purpose for groundwater development it is highly essential to understand the source of recharge recharge processes and the sustainability of these resources for the continued supply of water throughout the year in this respect isotope techniques are now accepted as a useful tool for understanding the groundwater recharge by direct infiltration munnich 1983 sukhija et al 1996 li et al 2017 source and origin of groundwater shivanna et al 2008 prada et al 2016 joshi et al 2018 groundwater circulation stadler et al 2010 huneau et al 2011 petersen et al 2018 and recharge processes girard et al 1997 yuan et al 2011 tan et al 2017 recharge from rivers stuyfzand 1989 urbka et al 1993 vrzel et al 2018 and lakes mayr et al 2007 weitz and demlie 2014 hajati et al 2018 inter relationship among aquifers carucci et al 2012 mao et al 2018 etc stable isotope ratios of hydrogen 2h 1h and oxygen 18o 16o can be used as natural tracers to understand the various hydrological processes because of their conservative nature characteristic isotopic signatures in various systems and forming an integral part of the water molecule the application of stable isotopes in hydrologic studies is based on the natural variations in the relative abundance of two rare heavy isotopic species of water namely 1h2h1 16o and 1h1h18o with respect to the most common light isotopic species 1h1h16o because of phase change and mixing as the water molecule moves through the hydrologic cycle the stable isotopic change commonly known as fractionation arising during phase change is largely depends on mass difference thus during evaporation lighter isotopes preferentially evaporate resulting in progressively heavier or enriched 2h or 18o isotopes remain in the residual water other factors that influence the fractionation are temperature diffusion and kinetic effects of humidity clark and fritz 1997 hence the fractionation occurring under equilibrium conditions is termed as equilibrium fractionation and that occurring under non equilibrium conditions is called as kinetic fractionation the stable isotopic composition of ground water is generally controlled by the relative contribution from the rainfall rivers and other local surface water bodies rivers usually originate from higher altitudes where precipitation is isotopically depleted compared to the precipitation occurring at the plains altitude effect hence river recharged areas in the plains will have a depleted isotopic composition compared to the groundwater recharged by local precipitation in contrast groundwater recharged by surface water bodies such as lakes ponds detention tanks etc will be isotopically enriched in heavier isotopes due to continuous evaporation of surface water bodies the isotopic difference between the groundwater and other components such as rivers lakes tanks etc can be effectively used to quantify their relative contribution to the local groundwater eg langhoff et al 2006 butler 2007 stable isotopic variations in groundwater can also be successfully used to distinguish local and distant recharge eg williams 1997 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of precipitation and surface water generally show different linear trends in the δ18o δ2h diagram precipitation and other waters that have not subjected to evaporation generally fall on the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 with a slope near to 8 ideally representing equilibrium conditions isotopic fractionations related to differences in the equilibrium vapour pressures of 1h2h16 16o and 1h1h18o the equation for gmwl is given by craig 1961 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 however the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl may slightly vary depending on local conditions such as temperature effects during condensation of atmospheric vapour and air mass history etc waters that have undergone evaporation such as surface waters show systematic enrichment in both 2h and 18o resulting in divergence from the meteoric line along evaporation lines el having slopes of less than 8 often in the range 4 6 isotopic composition of such waters is determined by a combination of temperature dependent equilibrium effects plus transport dependent kinetic effects arising as the different isotopic species pass from the surface water into the overlying atmosphere craig and gordon 1965 the slope of the el is determined by local conditions such as temperature humidity wind speed etc in addition environmental tritium 3h a radioisotope of hydrogen half life 12 32 years can be used to differentiate old groundwater more than 60 years from the recently recharged groundwater and thus help in understanding the groundwater circulation and estimate transit times clark and fritz 1997 tritium is produced naturally in the stratosphere by the interaction of cosmic ray produced neutrons with 14n atoms it is then oxidised into tritiated water hto and transferred into the troposphere by stratosphere to troposphere transport in spring which is significantly more at poles ehhalt et al 2002 it is then removed from the atmosphere by precipitation hence the tritium concentration in precipitation is a function of latitude with higher concentration at higher latitudes clark and fritz 1997 coastal regions have lower tritium content in precipitation compared to continental regions because of the water vapour exchange between the atmosphere and sea surface ansari et al 2018 the natural tritium levels in precipitation are generally very low tritium is also produced as a consequence of man made activities such as thermonuclear tests conducted in the 1950 s which increased the tritium levels many folds in atmosphere in 1960 s and now reached to natural levels at many places because of atmospheric mixing and radioactive decay clark and fritz 1997 the stable isotopic characterization of indian monsoon im precipitation on a regional scale was attempted by collecting the precipitation samples at 18 locations in india by kumar et al 2010 further monsoonal studies were conducted at south india lekshmy et al 2014 resmi et al 2016 warrier et al 2016 central india warrier and babu 2011 and western himalayas jeelani et al 2017a jeelani et al 2018 isotopic data gap still exists in precipitation occurring in western eastern and central part of india in the indian context the groundwater recharge studies using stable isotopes were conducted in various geological conditions viz multi layered aquifers kumar et al 2009a b mukherjee et al 2007 saha et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 carbonate systems kumar et al 2014 jeelani et al 2017b hard rock terrains shivanna et al 2004 saha et al 2013 vidarbha region in maharashtra state india is infamous for the suicide of farmers because of the drought related issues agriculture dominates the region and relies on monsoon for cultivation and bore wells for crop irrigation scanty rainfall declining of water table over extraction etc have resulted in severe water crisis in the recent years the groundwater potentiality of amravati district a part of the vidarbha region is generally poor most of the bore wells drilled in the area is a failure however the foothills of chinchona range anjangaon are potential areas for groundwater development fig 1 because of this farmers are buying small areas of lands construct bore wells and pump water to their agricultural fields located 4 5 km downstream through pipelines these well fields also serve as the main water supply sources for the rural community the bore wells are generally constructed up to an approximate depth of 70 m which supply abundant water for drinking and irrigational purposes due to large scale exploitation the groundwater levels are drastically declining in order to rejuvenate the groundwater potential various rainwater harvesting practices are being implemented several detention tanks are constructed along the natural drainage to impound the rainwater runoff so as to enhance the groundwater recharge unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge on the groundwater recharge and flow conditions in this area the sustenance of the rural community and their livelihood through agricultural activities in this undeveloped water scarce region depend solely on the arrival of monsoon rains and subsequent groundwater exploitation during summer hence the continued supply of water throughout the year in this region demands not only a thorough knowledge of the groundwater recharge processes but also a holistic understanding of the monsoonal characteristics and the demarcation of groundwater potential zones hence an integrated multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotopes hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity survey was adopted to evaluate the groundwater recharge and the groundwater potential zones at anjangaon amravati district maharashtra india the specific objectives of the investigation were i characterising the dual monsoon in the region ii understanding the recharge mechanism to shallow groundwater ii delineating the potential groundwater resources in the area this study is first of its kind in this region as not much hydrological or hydrogeological data exist in this undeveloped hard rock terrain in the vidarbha region of maharashtra india 2 study area the study area lies in the amravati district which is one of the eleven districts of drought prone vidarbha region of maharashtra state fig 1 it is situated in anjangaon which is in the southwestern part of amravati district and lies between 21 9ˈ 14ˈn latitudes and 76 11ˈ 15ˈ e longitudes the total study area is about 50 km2 the major part of the study area comes under the purna river basin the topography shows that the chinchona hills are located on the northern part while plain land with gentle slope prevails in the southern part the maximum altitude of the chinchona peak is about 548 m amsl above mean sea level while the lowest altitude of the area is around 338 m amsl the average altitude of the study area is about 361 m amsl the drainage pattern of the study area shows that it is of dendritic type in general it experiences a warm and dry climate throughout the year except during monsoon the summer april may temperature rises up to over 43 c and the winter temperature dips to around 15 c the area is classified as a semi arid region which receives rainfall mainly from the southwest monsoon june to september with occasional showers from northeast monsoon october to november the average annual rainfall at anjangaon during 1996 2010 period is about 705 mm fig 2 long term trend shows that the rainfall is fairly uniform in the decadal scale except in 2006 and 2007 during which above average rainfall is recorded 2 1 geology and hydrogeology deccan trap basalt belonging to upper cretaceous to lower eocene age occurs in the study area in the foothills of chinchona potential groundwater zones are encountered at deeper levels in the form of fractures and inter flow zones the weathered zone extended up to a depth of about 45 m below which is the fractured basalt the upper weathered and fractured parts form phreatic aquifer and ground water occurs under water table unconfined conditions at deeper levels the ground water occurs under semi confined conditions the dug wells are tapping groundwater mostly from the upper weathered and fractured zones while bore wells and hand pumps are drawing water from the deep fracture zones the dug wells become dry and groundwater levels in bore wells and hand pumps goes down up to 30 m in summer 3 methodology 3 1 water sampling and analytical techniques two sets of water samples one at the end of the monsoon november 2010 and another during the summer period april 2011 were collected from the detention tanks spring stream dug wells bore wells hand pumps in the anjangaon area for environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o and 3h and hydrochemical major ions measurements since anjangaon is an undeveloped and water scarce area hence very limited numbers of wells are available for groundwater sampling moreover in summer most of these wells were found to be dry hence many groundwater samples could not be collected from the same wells that were sampled at the end of the monsoon only one representative groundwater sample was collected from each well field because the wells were located very close to each other surface water samples could not be collected during summer season because they were also found to be dry also monthly integrated precipitation samples were collected from the study area during 2010 for environmental isotope analyses for this purpose precipitation samples were collected from almost all the rain events lighter rains were avoided to prevent the evaporation effect and at the end of the month these samples were transferred to a container mixed well and a representative sample was taken for isotope measurements physical parameters such as temperature electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ using portable conductivity and ph meters respectively the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 for stable isotope 2h and 18o analysis water samples were collected in 40 ml airtight high density polyethylene bottles and measured in the lab by isotope ratio mass spectrometer geo 2020 pdz europa using the gas equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 for δ2h analysis 1 ml of the water sample was equilibrated with hydrogen gas at 50 c with pt catalyst for 1 h and the gas was introduced into the mass spectrometer the δ18o of the sample was measured by equilibrating 1 ml of water with carbon dioxide gas at 50 c for 8 h and the equilibrated gas was introduced into the mass spectrometer the results are reported in δ notation as deviation relative to a standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water and in units of parts per thousand denoted as the δ values are calculated using coplen 1996 2 δ r x r s 1 1000 where r denotes the ratio of heavy to light isotope e g 2 h 1 h or 18 o 16 o and r x and r s are the ratios in the sample and standard respectively the precision of measurement for δ2h is 0 5 and for δ18o is 0 1 3σ about 250 ml of water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles for 3h measurement in the lab the samples were electrolytically enriched at 0 c mixed with a scintillator and counted in an ultra low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 following the standard procedures ansari et al 2017 the 3h values are expressed in tritium unit tu 1 tu of sample has 3 h 1 h ratio equals to 10 18 which corresponds to 0 12 bq l of water the minimum detection limit is 0 5 tu 3σ for hydrochemical analyses water samples collected were filtered using 0 45 µm size membrane filters and stored in polythene bottles which were initially washed with concentrated hno3 a duplicate set was collected and acidified to ph 2 by adding concentrated hno3 for cation analysis alkalinity was measured by titrating 10 ml of water sample with 0 02 n h2so4 methyl orange indicator was used to mark the end point of the reaction alkalinity expressed in milligram caco3 l was multiplied by a factor of 1 22 for converting to milligram hco3 l major ion chemistry anions and cations was measured using ion chromatograph dionex 500 for cationic analysis 25 μl of the acidified sample was injected into a cation exchange column cs 12a where the ions were separated based on their charge to size ratio and were quantified using conductivity detector ed 40 for anionic determination 25 μl of the non acidified sample was injected into an anion exchange column as 11 and measured 3 2 electrical resistivity survey in order to identify the groundwater potential zones an electrical resistivity survey of the geological formation was carried out in an area of 200 m 400 m as shown in fig 1 the technique involves the estimation of resistance of the geological formation by passing electrical current through two current electrodes kept at ab distance apart and measuring the potential difference voltage between two potential electrodes kept at mn distance apart fig 3 in general resistivity ρ ωm is given by 3 ρ r a l where r is the resistance ω a is the area of cross section m2 and l is the length m in geological terms apparent resistivity ρa is given by 4 ρ a k r where k represent the geometry factor which depends on the arrangement of four electrodes k is given by 5 k 2 π 1 ma 1 mb 1 na 1 nb the calculated resistivity value is not the true resistivity of the subsurface but an apparent value which is the resistivity of a homogeneous ground that will give the same resistivity value for the same electrode arrangement the relationship between the apparent resistivity and true resistivity is complex two electrical resistivity methodologies were adopted i resistivity profiling ii vertical electrical sounding ves 4 results and discussion 4 1 environmental isotopes 4 1 1 variations of stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in precipitation the isotopic results of monthly precipitation occurred at anjangaon area for the year 2010 is given in table 1 since the isotope data of precipitation is limited hence to bring confidence in the data interpretation the data is compared with the 4 years 2005 2008 of monthly isotope data generated by warrier and babu 2011 for a nearby inland precipitation station namely hyderabad which is about 500 km southeast of the study area in general the precipitation isotope data of anjangaon area is found to be in agreement with to those of hyderabad the monthly variation of precipitation and its δ18o and δ2h in 2010 in anjangaon area are shown in fig 4 a and b significant seasonal variation is observed in the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation the δ18o of southwest monsoon precipitation june to september varies from 4 8 to 2 while it fall in a narrow range of 8 1 to 7 9 during northeast monsoon october and november the corresponding values of δ2h are 30 to 7 2 and 53 9 to 50 9 respectively the calculated weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values for southwest monsoon is 4 1 and 24 4 respectively while the corresponding values for northeast monsoon is 8 0 and 52 7 the annual weighted mean δ18o and δ2h in precipitation of anjangaon area is 4 6 and 27 7 respectively the isotopic composition of precipitation at a particular location is governed by regional scale processes like the trajectories of the water vapour transport over the continents and the average rainout history of the air masses rozanski et al 1982 therefore the observed seasonal variation in stable isotopic composition of precipitation at anjangaon area indicate distinct source of moisture for precipitation based on the monthly δ2h and δ18o data of precipitation the local meteoric water line lmwl is constructed as the best fit line for precipitation samples fig 5 the equation for the lmwl is given by 6 δ 2 h 7 4 0 2 δ 18 o 6 5 1 1 r 2 0 98 n 6 the slightly lower slope and y intercept of lmwl compared to the gmwl indicate that the falling raindrops had undergone slight secondary evaporation evaporation beneath the cloud base under the condition of lower amount of precipitation and lower humidity lowers the slope of lmwl below 8 the lmwl developed for hyderabad station is given by warrier and babu 2011 7 δ 2 h 7 7 δ 18 o 6 2 r 2 0 95 n 25 the lmwl of anjangaon area is found to be more or less similar to that of hyderabad with slight variation in slope and y intercept owing to the variability in climatic conditions deuterium excess can be used for characterising the origin of water vapour for precipitation deuterium excess d excess is defined by the relation dansgaard 1964 8 d excess δ 2 h 8 xd 18 o low d excess values of precipitation reflect slow evaporation at its source region due to high humidity whereas high values reflect fast evaporation due to low humidity the seasonal variations of δ18o and d excess in precipitation of anjangaon area are illustrated in fig 6 the average d excess values for southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon are 8 5 0 2 and 11 6 1 0 respectively the southwest monsoon rains accounting for 87 of the total annual precipitation of this region is relatively enriched in stable isotopes with a weighted mean δ18o of 4 1 and having average d excess of 8 5 confirms the rainout processes of oceanic moisture source from the arabian sea and the indian ocean comparatively depleted stable isotopic composition of northeast monsoon comprising of only 13 of the total annual precipitation having a weighted mean δ18o of 8 0 and slightly elevated d excess of 11 6 indicate that the northeastern continental monsoon winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal and brings rain in the study area the causative mechanism for the southwest and northeast monsoons in india is the seasonal reversal of temperature and pressure gradients and the associated wind circulation patterns in summer the equatorial maritime air mass originating in the arabian sea and northern indian ocean flows from the southwest direction and brings rain in the southern peninsular india during june to september ghosh et al 1978 in winter the continental air mass originating over central asia flows from northeast direction from the land towards the sea and picks up moisture from the bay of bengal and brings rain in eastern and southern parts of india during october to november menon 1995 dansgaard 1964 found a negative correlation between δ18o and amount of precipitation at various global stations with more negative δ18o resulting from heavy rainfall this is termed as amount effect the relationship of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation with amount of rainfall at anjangaon area is shown in fig 7 a and b although the number of samples are less n 4 a good negative correlation is found between the stable isotopic composition of monthly precipitation and its amount during the southwest monsoon the equation to the best fit line between amount of rainfall and its δ18o for southwest monsoon samples is given by 9 δ 18 o 0 0158 0 0053 p 0 99 0 98 r 2 0 82 n 4 where p is the monthly precipitation in mm the equation to the best fit line between amount of rainfall and its δ2h for southwest monsoon is given by 10 δ 2 h 0 129 0 043 p 0 95 8 03 r 2 0 82 n 4 therefore the average rate of depletion amount effect is estimated to be 1 6 for δ18o and 13 for δ2h per 100 mm of rainfall during the southwest monsoon period dansgaard 1964 reported a similar altitude effect for δ18o in precipitation of wake island usa 4 1 2 tritium in precipitation the tritium concentration in monthly precipitation of anjangaon area is given in table 1 significant seasonality is found in the tritium content of precipitation at anjangaon area with higher values noticed during northeast monsoon precipitation the southwest monsoon rain is characterized by a mean tritium content of 4 1 0 6 tu while the mean tritium content in northeast monsoon precipitation is 7 7 0 6 tu in order to bring confidence in interpretation with limited tritium data the data is compared with those reported in the nearby areas for southwest monsoon precipitation tirumalesh et al 2011 reported a tritium content of 4 0 tu for an inland site buldhana about 130 km southwest of the study area kumar et al 2009a b reported a tritium content of 4 6 tu for another inland site jalgaon about 160 km west of the study area while ansari et al 2018 reported a lower tritium content of 3 1 tu for a coastal site goa about 800 km west of the study area based on 4 years 2005 2008 of monthly tritium data of precipitation at the inland hyderabad station about 500 km southeast of the study area warrier et al 2013 reported a mean tritium value of 3 6 1 0 tu and 4 8 1 4 tu for southwest and northeast monsoons respectively it is seen that the tritium data of precipitation at anjangaon area matches well with those of the nearby areas the seasonal variation of tritium in precipitation confirms the marine and continental source of moisture for precipitation for southwest and northeast monsoon precipitation respectively an average tritium content of about 1 tu is reported for the indian ocean povinec et al 2010 therefore the moisture evaporating from the indian ocean must have lower tritium content ansari et al 2018 since anjangaon is an inland station and because of the exchange with the natural production of tritium in the atmosphere the lower tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 4 1 tu is justified shivanna et al 1998 reported a tritium content of 4 1 5 0 tu for the coastal waters of bay of bengal at puri odisha located in the eastern part of india which is higher than those of indian ocean hence the winds originated from the central asia that pick up moisture from the bay of bengal is expected to have higher tritium content because of its origin from higher latitude and higher tritium content in bay of bengal 4 1 3 isotopic characteristics of surface water and groundwater the detention tanks samples collected at the end of the monsoon november 2010 showed maximum enrichment in stable isotopes with average δ18o and δ2h of 2 6 and 18 2 respectively table 2 the stream samples have an average δ18o and δ2h of 3 5 and 22 4 respectively the δ18o of groundwater samples varies between 4 2 to 2 6 while δ2h varies between 25 7 to 18 0 also these stable isotopic values of groundwater are slightly different from the annual weighted mean values of precipitation δ18o 4 6 δ2h 27 7 but comparatively similar to that of the weighted mean values of southwest monsoon precipitation δ18o 4 1 δ2h 24 4 this shows that the northeast monsoon precipitation is not contributing to the groundwater recharge of this region this is further substantiated by the fact that the amount of northeast monsoon precipitation occurring in this region is relatively low i e only 13 of the annual precipitation the δ18o δ2h relationships in surface water and groundwater from anjangaon area is shown in fig 8 the best fit line bfl for the surface water samples detention tanks and stream samples is given by el1 and the equation is 11 δ 2 h 4 7 δ 18 o 6 r 2 0 98 n 4 it is seen that el1 is deviated to the right from the lmwl and is having a lower slope 4 7 compared to lmwl indicating evaporation effect hence el1 is an evaporation line the groundwater samples dug well tube well and spring samples collected at the end of the monsoon also shows evaporation effect with the bfl el2 the equation to the line el2 is given by 12 δ 2 h 4 8 δ 18 o 6 r 2 0 96 n 5 the best fit line for groundwater samples dug well and tube well samples collected during the summer period april 2011 is represented by el3 13 δ 2 h 4 6 δ 18 o 7 r 2 0 91 n 10 similar slope and y intercept in the bfl of surface water and groundwater indicate that groundwater is either getting recharge from evaporated surface water sources such as detention tanks or subjected to evaporation during recharge from the rain since detention tank water and rain recharged groundwater have the same meteoric origin and same isotopic composition prior to evaporation the slope of the mixing lines between detention tank and rain water and the evaporation line of groundwater surface water would be identical and hence it is difficult to differentiate between these two processes therefore evaporative enrichment of groundwater during recharge and groundwater recharge from detention tanks were evaluated the tritium content of the groundwater samples varies from 3 5 to 4 5 tu which is similar to the mean tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 3h 4 1 0 6 tu but quite different from the mean tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 3h 7 7 0 6 tu it corroborates the inference derived from the stable isotope data that the groundwater in this region is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is minimal the similar values of tritium in groundwater and southwest monsoon precipitation indicate that the groundwater is modern i e recharged from the present day precipitation and the groundwater residence time is less may be of the order of a few years 4 1 4 modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment in surface water groundwater a reyleigh distillation model incorporating both equilibrium and kinetic factors was developed in order to evaluate the evaporative isotopic enrichment of water the isotopic composition of precipitation feeding the detention tank or prior to groundwater recharge is estimated by projecting the bfl el1 el2 and el3 to cut the lmwl at point a fig 8 this δ18o and δ2h values are found to be same as the annual weighted average values in precipitation δ18o 4 6 δ2h 27 7 of anjangaon area temperature during the recharge tk in kelvin is used to compute the vapor to water isotopic enrichment εv w for δ18o and δ2h with equilibrium enrichment factors given by kakiuchi and matsuo 1979 as 14 ε v w 18 o 1000 exp 5 9702 10 6 t k 2 32 801 10 3 t k 52 227 1000 1 15 ε v w 2 h 1000 exp 2 408 10 6 t k 2 64 55 10 3 t k 168 7 1000 1 with the average temperature of recharge of 33 5 c from june to april till the detention tank dry out the calculated vapor water isotopic enrichment factors for δ18o and δ2h are found to be 8 78 and 69 73 respectively during evaporation kinetic effects of humidity also affect the isotopic composition of residual water in addition to the equilibrium fractionation this is due to the diffusion of water molecules across water air boundary layer bl which is a function of humidity h when the humidity decreases the vapor phase near the boundary layer becomes depleted in more diffusive lighter isotopes 1h and 16o thereby enriching the residual water in the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o clark and fritz 1997 the equation for kinetic isotopic enrichment δ ε v bl which is a function of humidity is represented as gonfiantini 1986 16 δ ε v bl 18 o 14 2 h 1 17 δ ε v bl 2 h 12 5 h 1 the total evaporative isotopic enrichment ε v w t is the sum of equilibrium and kinetic enrichment factors stable isotopic composition of water undergoing evaporation is given by rayleigh distillation equation butler 2007 18 δ 18 o exp ln f ε v w t 18 o 1000 δ 18 o o 1000 1000 19 δ 2 h exp ln f ε v w t 2 h 1000 δ 2 h o 1000 1000 where δ 18 o0 and δ 2 h0 are the weighted annual average values of precipitation and f is the fraction of residual water remaining after the evaporation the average humidity at the time of evaporation is estimated by varying the humidity values in the above model eqs 16 19 till the slope of the evaporation line is equal to slope 4 7 of the bfl of surface water and groundwater samples the model estimated average humidity during evaporation and infiltration is about 45 during summer the climate is generally dry in anjangaon area and lower humidity is generally expected hence the predicted humidity of 45 could be the humidity during summer season the modeled δ18o and δ2h for 45 humidity and various residual fractions f are shown in fig 9 comparison of the observed maximum enrichment in stable isotopic values i e the detention tank water with the modelled values indicate that around 12 f 88 water is removed by evaporation and a major component might have been infiltrated this points that infiltration from the detention tank is a major component of groundwater recharge also it is substantiated by the local hard rock geology since the groundwater flow in this area is through weathered and fractured basalt there can be less chance for evaporation prior to infiltration 4 1 5 quantification of recharge from the detention tanks based on a conservative two component isotope δ18o or δ2h mixing model it is possible to quantify the relative contribution from the two end members namely detention tank and the natural precipitation recharge the inherent assumption in the model is that both the end members must have distinct stable isotopic composition and they mix conservatively based on the δ18o model the percentage detention tank water contribution x to the groundwater is calculated as 20 x δ 18 o g δ 18 o p δ 18 o dt δ 18 o p 100 where δ18og δ18op and δ18odt represents the δ18o of groundwater precipitation recharged groundwater and detention tank recharged water respectively for the mixing model calculation δ18odt is taken as the average δ18o of detention tank 2 5 δ18op is taken as the average δ18o of groundwater from wells δ18o 4 1 located away from the influence of detention tank rather than weighted annual average δ18o of precipitation this is due to the fact that slight evaporation of groundwater during recharge is possible as the study area is located in a semi arid region also it is seen that the use of weighted annual average δ18o of precipitation for δ18op will overestimate the recharge contribution from the detention tanks the relationship between the estimated percentage groundwater contribution from the detention tanks and the corresponding electrical conductivity is illustrated in fig 10 most of the groundwater samples fall in a mixing line between the groundwater recharged by precipitation and the detention tank it is seen that in general the electrical conductivity of groundwater decreases as the percentage of detention tank increases also it indicates that the samples with no detention tank contribution should have an electrical conductivity of about 800 μs cm a few groundwater samples have relatively higher electrical conductivity around 1100 μs cm and plot off the line in fig 10 these samples may represent slightly brackish groundwater which might have attained the salt content from the soil the spring and a nearby bore well sample have less electrical conductivity than the groundwater samples because of fast circulation groundwater recharge from precipitation as they are collected just at the end of the monsoon this conclusion is supported by the stable isotope data which plot close to the lmwl near the average isotopic composition of precipitation they also have less contribution from the detention tank analysis of both isotopic evaporative enrichment and mixing models indicates that the mixing of detention tank water with precipitation recharged groundwater is likely the general process responsible for the observed enrichment of stable isotopes in groundwater the percentage recharge contribution from the detention tanks is estimated to be 42 93 depending upon the distance from the tank and prevailing geological conditions therefore the constructed detention tanks are found to be effective in augmenting the groundwater recharge in this drought prone area 4 2 hydrochemistry data on field parameters along with the results of isotope analyses are given in table 2 it is seen that the groundwater temperature varied from 28 3 33 0 c while the average temperature of surface water bodies such as stream and detention pond were 31 8 0 4 c the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater ranged from 600 to 1115 μs cm indicating that the groundwater is fresh the average ec of surface water sources was 398 95 μs cm the groundwater is neutral to slightly alkaline ph varied from 6 8 to 7 7 while the surface water is alkaline ph varied from 7 8 to 8 4 in nature the field parameters in general did not show any seasonal variations the results of the hydrochemical analysis are presented in table 3 from the results it is found that ca2 is the dominant cation with its values ranged from 34 6 to 90 8 mg l at the end of monsoon and from 38 2 to 158 mg l in summer while mg2 ranged from 17 3 to 74 5 mg l post monsoon and from 29 0 to 52 0 mg l summer in the study area with respect to the alkali metals the concentrations of na ranged from 10 5 to 67 7 mg l post monsoon and from 17 1 to 59 8 mg l summer while that of k varied from 0 3 to 2 9 mg l post monsoon and from 0 6 to 13 5 mg l summer hco3 is the dominant anion with concentration of 207 332 mg l and is followed by no3 and cl concentrations that ranged from 0 01 to 211 5 mg l and 4 1 to 95 5 mg l respectively in the post monsoon period whereas in summer the hco3 no3 and cl concentrations are enriched and varied from 245 to 330 mg l 24 1 to 135 mg l and 26 8 to 92 4 mg l respectively so4 2 concentration is in the range of 3 5 92 2 mg l in the post monsoon period and 9 0 to 115 mg l in the summer f concentrations ranged from 0 3 to 1 7 mg l the higher concentration of no3 in groundwater might be resulted from intensive agricultural activity in the study area ansari et al 2015 comparatively high so4 2 observed in groundwater could be due the leaching from the saline alkaline soil present in the study area and not because of the weathering of basalt sulphides das et al 2011 the low so4 2 present in a few samples may be because of the biological reduction furthermore the cation concentrations was in the order of ca2 mg2 na k while that of the anions was hco3 no3 cl so4 2 f regarding the water quality for portability and usability all the various chemical constituents of the groundwater in the study area fall within the who 2006 acceptable limits for drinking water standard except no3 hydrochemical parameters of the water samples collected at the end of the monsoon november 2010 and during the summer period april 2011 are plotted on the piper s trilinear diagram piper 1994 as shown in fig 11 a and b piper s diagram indicates that the dug well samples are ca mg hco3 type while bore well samples are generally ca mg hco3 cl type water which is typical of shallow fresh groundwater system surface water samples are ca mg hco3 type some of the dug wells and tube wells samples fall on a mixing line between detention tank samples and deep tube well samples these samples have similar water type as that of detention tank this could be because of the recharge from the detention tank it was also observed that some of the deep tube well samples are ca mg hco3 cl type which is evolved because of rock water interactions from the environmental isotope and hydrochemical investigation it was found that the detention tank is acting as a recharge source apart from the natural precipitation recharge to the groundwater in this region therefore a geophysical survey was conducted to delineate the aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zone in the study area 4 3 electrical resistivity survey 4 3 1 resistivity profiling resistivity profiling survey was conducted to scan the area and find the lateral heterogeneities in the geological formation so that low resistivity zones such as lineament and fractures can be delineated two profiling were carried out each for a distance of 400 m with 12 stations and interval of about 30 m the profiling was made using a fixed current electrodes separation with ab 2 of 30 m and 15 m the potential electrodes are separated with mn 2 as 5 m and 2 m respectively a fixed current was injected and the potential difference was measured the apparent resistivity was calculated using the eq 4 the distribution of apparent resistivity in the area for ab 2 of 15 m and 30 m are given in figs 12 and 13 respectively low apparent resistivity values of 9 25 ωm and 10 5ωmwere found at station 13 and station 8 respectively for an electrode configuration ab 2 30 m and mn 2 5 m hence vertical electrical sounding was carried out at these two stations to understand the vertical variation of resistivity of the sub surface geological formations 4 3 2 vertical electrical sounding ves two vertical electrical sounding were conducted at station 8 and station 13 using schlumberger configuration for understanding the vertical variation of resistivity and quantitative evaluation of layer parameters the current electrode configuration ab 2 was varied from 1 5 to a maximum of 100 m along the profiles at each location the field obtained apparent resistivity data for various current and electrode spacing were processed and plotted as ab 2 versus apparent resistivity on bi logarithmic scale and interpreted in terms of layer parameters i e thickness and resistivity of individual layers the layer parameters were obtained using ipi2win ver 3 0 1 software resistivity sounding interpretation moscow state university the interpreted result at station 8 indicates four layer case ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρ4 kh type curve fig 14 a reynolds 1997 the upper layer having resistivity 6 01 ωm whose thickness is about 0 9 m the resistivity of second layer increased rapidly up to 41 8 ωm and having thickness of about 4 12 m the resistivity of the third layer decreased to 4 19 ωm which is 4 66 m thick the resistivity of fourth layer increased to 13 9 ωm which is 31 3 m thick the interpreted result at station 13 shows four layer case ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρ4 kh type curve fig 14b the upper layer having resistivity 12 4 ωm indicates the soil cover whose thickness is about 0 9 m the resistivity of second layer increases rapidly up to 71 3 ωm which is attributed to the presence of unsaturated and dry formation having thickness of about 1 11 m the resistivity of the third layer decreased to 4 0 ωm which indicates the presence of water bearing layer whose thickness is about 2 5 m since the thickness of the third layer is less it may not be a potential zone the resistivity of fourth layer increase to 11 1 ωm which indicates the presence of fracture zone with water whose thickness is about 17 9 m based on the interpretation of the sounding data a borehole was drilled at station 13 up to a depth of 45 m to identify the different lithological units and presence of groundwater bearing zones copious water was found in the bore well subsequently four more bore wells were drilled up to 45 m depth in the northeast direction which yielded perennial source of good quality water 5 conclusions in this study application of environmental isotopes hydrochemical and geophysical techniques were used for evaluating the groundwater recharge mechanism and delineate the groundwater potential zones in a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha region maharashtra india additionally monsoonal characteristics were also studied based on isotope data significant seasonal variation was observed in stable isotopic composition deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation owing to distinct source of moisture causing the rains it is seen that during southwest monsoon the moisture was originating from oceanic sources such as the arabian sea and indian ocean whereas continental winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal and brings rain during northeast monsoon a strong negative correlation is found between the stable isotopic composition of monthly precipitation and its amount during the southwest monsoon the average rate of depletion amount effect is estimated to be 1 6 for δ18o and 13 for δ2h per 100 mm of rainfall isotopic data indicates two sources of groundwater recharge namely natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures such as detention tanks constructed for augmenting the groundwater environmental isotope data show that the groundwater in this region is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern i e recharged from the present day precipitation and the groundwater residence time is less may be of the order of a few years to find out the climatic condition prevailed during evaporation isotopic enrichment processes was modelled and climate variable such as temperature and humidity were estimated the model estimated average humidity during evaporation and infiltration is about 45 in this study the recharge from the detention tanks was also quantified based on isotope balance model the percentage recharge contribution from the detention tanks is estimated to be 42 93 depending upon the distance from the tank and prevailing geological conditions therefore the constructed detention tanks are found to be effective in augmenting the groundwater recharge in this drought prone area using electrical resistivity method aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zone were delineated in a part of the study area a weak fracture zone with water having a thickness of about 17 9 m was found and a borehole was drilled at identified location up to a depth of 45 m which provided copious amount of good quality water for the farmers many more bore wells were drilled in this area and thus the drought prone area is transformed into a cultivable land thus the study portrait that an integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas

6722,a multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotope δ2h δ18o and 3h hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity tools were used to revive a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha region maharashtra india in this study groundwater recharge processes monsoon characteristics climate variables during evaporation in the region were evaluated using environmental isotope techniques additionally electrical resistivity surveys were also conducted to understand the aquifer geometry and weak zones fractures lineament for the sustainable groundwater development significant seasonal variation observed in stable isotopic composition deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation helped to delineate the sources of vapour generating the rains during both the southwest and northeast monsoons a negative correlation between stable isotopic content and amount of precipitation is observed two sources of groundwater recharge namely natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures detention tanks were deduced hydrochemical data also corroborates the above findings environmental isotope data show that the groundwater is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern and its residence time is of the order of a few years modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment helped in estimating the climatic variables such as temperature and humidity during evaporation also the recharge from the detention tanks was quantified based on isotope balance model aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zones were delineated in a part of the study area using electrical resistivity method an integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is found to be effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas keywords environmental isotopes groundwater recharge electrical resistivity survey detention tanks drought vidarbha region 1 introduction groundwater is the only reliable source of freshwater for domestic and irrigational purposes in drought prone areas as surface waters are rarely available due to scanty rainfall and high evaporation rates hence it is crucial not only to delineate the groundwater potential zones in these regions but also to monitor and conserve these precious water resources a thorough understanding of groundwater recharge is a prerequisite for the effective development and management of groundwater in these areas groundwater prospecting and exploration has become a challenging task in india in general and certain drought prone areas in particular due to vagaries in rainfall and complex hydrogeological conditions geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity survey are commonly employed for identifying the groundwater potential zones yadav et al 1997 kumar et al 2007 although they serve the purpose for groundwater development it is highly essential to understand the source of recharge recharge processes and the sustainability of these resources for the continued supply of water throughout the year in this respect isotope techniques are now accepted as a useful tool for understanding the groundwater recharge by direct infiltration munnich 1983 sukhija et al 1996 li et al 2017 source and origin of groundwater shivanna et al 2008 prada et al 2016 joshi et al 2018 groundwater circulation stadler et al 2010 huneau et al 2011 petersen et al 2018 and recharge processes girard et al 1997 yuan et al 2011 tan et al 2017 recharge from rivers stuyfzand 1989 urbka et al 1993 vrzel et al 2018 and lakes mayr et al 2007 weitz and demlie 2014 hajati et al 2018 inter relationship among aquifers carucci et al 2012 mao et al 2018 etc stable isotope ratios of hydrogen 2h 1h and oxygen 18o 16o can be used as natural tracers to understand the various hydrological processes because of their conservative nature characteristic isotopic signatures in various systems and forming an integral part of the water molecule the application of stable isotopes in hydrologic studies is based on the natural variations in the relative abundance of two rare heavy isotopic species of water namely 1h2h1 16o and 1h1h18o with respect to the most common light isotopic species 1h1h16o because of phase change and mixing as the water molecule moves through the hydrologic cycle the stable isotopic change commonly known as fractionation arising during phase change is largely depends on mass difference thus during evaporation lighter isotopes preferentially evaporate resulting in progressively heavier or enriched 2h or 18o isotopes remain in the residual water other factors that influence the fractionation are temperature diffusion and kinetic effects of humidity clark and fritz 1997 hence the fractionation occurring under equilibrium conditions is termed as equilibrium fractionation and that occurring under non equilibrium conditions is called as kinetic fractionation the stable isotopic composition of ground water is generally controlled by the relative contribution from the rainfall rivers and other local surface water bodies rivers usually originate from higher altitudes where precipitation is isotopically depleted compared to the precipitation occurring at the plains altitude effect hence river recharged areas in the plains will have a depleted isotopic composition compared to the groundwater recharged by local precipitation in contrast groundwater recharged by surface water bodies such as lakes ponds detention tanks etc will be isotopically enriched in heavier isotopes due to continuous evaporation of surface water bodies the isotopic difference between the groundwater and other components such as rivers lakes tanks etc can be effectively used to quantify their relative contribution to the local groundwater eg langhoff et al 2006 butler 2007 stable isotopic variations in groundwater can also be successfully used to distinguish local and distant recharge eg williams 1997 the hydrogen and oxygen isotope compositions of precipitation and surface water generally show different linear trends in the δ18o δ2h diagram precipitation and other waters that have not subjected to evaporation generally fall on the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 with a slope near to 8 ideally representing equilibrium conditions isotopic fractionations related to differences in the equilibrium vapour pressures of 1h2h16 16o and 1h1h18o the equation for gmwl is given by craig 1961 1 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 however the slope of the local meteoric water line lmwl may slightly vary depending on local conditions such as temperature effects during condensation of atmospheric vapour and air mass history etc waters that have undergone evaporation such as surface waters show systematic enrichment in both 2h and 18o resulting in divergence from the meteoric line along evaporation lines el having slopes of less than 8 often in the range 4 6 isotopic composition of such waters is determined by a combination of temperature dependent equilibrium effects plus transport dependent kinetic effects arising as the different isotopic species pass from the surface water into the overlying atmosphere craig and gordon 1965 the slope of the el is determined by local conditions such as temperature humidity wind speed etc in addition environmental tritium 3h a radioisotope of hydrogen half life 12 32 years can be used to differentiate old groundwater more than 60 years from the recently recharged groundwater and thus help in understanding the groundwater circulation and estimate transit times clark and fritz 1997 tritium is produced naturally in the stratosphere by the interaction of cosmic ray produced neutrons with 14n atoms it is then oxidised into tritiated water hto and transferred into the troposphere by stratosphere to troposphere transport in spring which is significantly more at poles ehhalt et al 2002 it is then removed from the atmosphere by precipitation hence the tritium concentration in precipitation is a function of latitude with higher concentration at higher latitudes clark and fritz 1997 coastal regions have lower tritium content in precipitation compared to continental regions because of the water vapour exchange between the atmosphere and sea surface ansari et al 2018 the natural tritium levels in precipitation are generally very low tritium is also produced as a consequence of man made activities such as thermonuclear tests conducted in the 1950 s which increased the tritium levels many folds in atmosphere in 1960 s and now reached to natural levels at many places because of atmospheric mixing and radioactive decay clark and fritz 1997 the stable isotopic characterization of indian monsoon im precipitation on a regional scale was attempted by collecting the precipitation samples at 18 locations in india by kumar et al 2010 further monsoonal studies were conducted at south india lekshmy et al 2014 resmi et al 2016 warrier et al 2016 central india warrier and babu 2011 and western himalayas jeelani et al 2017a jeelani et al 2018 isotopic data gap still exists in precipitation occurring in western eastern and central part of india in the indian context the groundwater recharge studies using stable isotopes were conducted in various geological conditions viz multi layered aquifers kumar et al 2009a b mukherjee et al 2007 saha et al 2011 joshi et al 2018 carbonate systems kumar et al 2014 jeelani et al 2017b hard rock terrains shivanna et al 2004 saha et al 2013 vidarbha region in maharashtra state india is infamous for the suicide of farmers because of the drought related issues agriculture dominates the region and relies on monsoon for cultivation and bore wells for crop irrigation scanty rainfall declining of water table over extraction etc have resulted in severe water crisis in the recent years the groundwater potentiality of amravati district a part of the vidarbha region is generally poor most of the bore wells drilled in the area is a failure however the foothills of chinchona range anjangaon are potential areas for groundwater development fig 1 because of this farmers are buying small areas of lands construct bore wells and pump water to their agricultural fields located 4 5 km downstream through pipelines these well fields also serve as the main water supply sources for the rural community the bore wells are generally constructed up to an approximate depth of 70 m which supply abundant water for drinking and irrigational purposes due to large scale exploitation the groundwater levels are drastically declining in order to rejuvenate the groundwater potential various rainwater harvesting practices are being implemented several detention tanks are constructed along the natural drainage to impound the rainwater runoff so as to enhance the groundwater recharge unfortunately there is a lack of knowledge on the groundwater recharge and flow conditions in this area the sustenance of the rural community and their livelihood through agricultural activities in this undeveloped water scarce region depend solely on the arrival of monsoon rains and subsequent groundwater exploitation during summer hence the continued supply of water throughout the year in this region demands not only a thorough knowledge of the groundwater recharge processes but also a holistic understanding of the monsoonal characteristics and the demarcation of groundwater potential zones hence an integrated multidisciplinary approach including environmental isotopes hydrochemistry and electrical resistivity survey was adopted to evaluate the groundwater recharge and the groundwater potential zones at anjangaon amravati district maharashtra india the specific objectives of the investigation were i characterising the dual monsoon in the region ii understanding the recharge mechanism to shallow groundwater ii delineating the potential groundwater resources in the area this study is first of its kind in this region as not much hydrological or hydrogeological data exist in this undeveloped hard rock terrain in the vidarbha region of maharashtra india 2 study area the study area lies in the amravati district which is one of the eleven districts of drought prone vidarbha region of maharashtra state fig 1 it is situated in anjangaon which is in the southwestern part of amravati district and lies between 21 9ˈ 14ˈn latitudes and 76 11ˈ 15ˈ e longitudes the total study area is about 50 km2 the major part of the study area comes under the purna river basin the topography shows that the chinchona hills are located on the northern part while plain land with gentle slope prevails in the southern part the maximum altitude of the chinchona peak is about 548 m amsl above mean sea level while the lowest altitude of the area is around 338 m amsl the average altitude of the study area is about 361 m amsl the drainage pattern of the study area shows that it is of dendritic type in general it experiences a warm and dry climate throughout the year except during monsoon the summer april may temperature rises up to over 43 c and the winter temperature dips to around 15 c the area is classified as a semi arid region which receives rainfall mainly from the southwest monsoon june to september with occasional showers from northeast monsoon october to november the average annual rainfall at anjangaon during 1996 2010 period is about 705 mm fig 2 long term trend shows that the rainfall is fairly uniform in the decadal scale except in 2006 and 2007 during which above average rainfall is recorded 2 1 geology and hydrogeology deccan trap basalt belonging to upper cretaceous to lower eocene age occurs in the study area in the foothills of chinchona potential groundwater zones are encountered at deeper levels in the form of fractures and inter flow zones the weathered zone extended up to a depth of about 45 m below which is the fractured basalt the upper weathered and fractured parts form phreatic aquifer and ground water occurs under water table unconfined conditions at deeper levels the ground water occurs under semi confined conditions the dug wells are tapping groundwater mostly from the upper weathered and fractured zones while bore wells and hand pumps are drawing water from the deep fracture zones the dug wells become dry and groundwater levels in bore wells and hand pumps goes down up to 30 m in summer 3 methodology 3 1 water sampling and analytical techniques two sets of water samples one at the end of the monsoon november 2010 and another during the summer period april 2011 were collected from the detention tanks spring stream dug wells bore wells hand pumps in the anjangaon area for environmental isotopes δ2h δ18o and 3h and hydrochemical major ions measurements since anjangaon is an undeveloped and water scarce area hence very limited numbers of wells are available for groundwater sampling moreover in summer most of these wells were found to be dry hence many groundwater samples could not be collected from the same wells that were sampled at the end of the monsoon only one representative groundwater sample was collected from each well field because the wells were located very close to each other surface water samples could not be collected during summer season because they were also found to be dry also monthly integrated precipitation samples were collected from the study area during 2010 for environmental isotope analyses for this purpose precipitation samples were collected from almost all the rain events lighter rains were avoided to prevent the evaporation effect and at the end of the month these samples were transferred to a container mixed well and a representative sample was taken for isotope measurements physical parameters such as temperature electrical conductivity and ph were measured in situ using portable conductivity and ph meters respectively the sampling locations are shown in fig 1 for stable isotope 2h and 18o analysis water samples were collected in 40 ml airtight high density polyethylene bottles and measured in the lab by isotope ratio mass spectrometer geo 2020 pdz europa using the gas equilibration method epstein and mayeda 1953 for δ2h analysis 1 ml of the water sample was equilibrated with hydrogen gas at 50 c with pt catalyst for 1 h and the gas was introduced into the mass spectrometer the δ18o of the sample was measured by equilibrating 1 ml of water with carbon dioxide gas at 50 c for 8 h and the equilibrated gas was introduced into the mass spectrometer the results are reported in δ notation as deviation relative to a standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water and in units of parts per thousand denoted as the δ values are calculated using coplen 1996 2 δ r x r s 1 1000 where r denotes the ratio of heavy to light isotope e g 2 h 1 h or 18 o 16 o and r x and r s are the ratios in the sample and standard respectively the precision of measurement for δ2h is 0 5 and for δ18o is 0 1 3σ about 250 ml of water samples were collected in high density polyethylene bottles for 3h measurement in the lab the samples were electrolytically enriched at 0 c mixed with a scintillator and counted in an ultra low background liquid scintillation counter quantulus 1220 following the standard procedures ansari et al 2017 the 3h values are expressed in tritium unit tu 1 tu of sample has 3 h 1 h ratio equals to 10 18 which corresponds to 0 12 bq l of water the minimum detection limit is 0 5 tu 3σ for hydrochemical analyses water samples collected were filtered using 0 45 µm size membrane filters and stored in polythene bottles which were initially washed with concentrated hno3 a duplicate set was collected and acidified to ph 2 by adding concentrated hno3 for cation analysis alkalinity was measured by titrating 10 ml of water sample with 0 02 n h2so4 methyl orange indicator was used to mark the end point of the reaction alkalinity expressed in milligram caco3 l was multiplied by a factor of 1 22 for converting to milligram hco3 l major ion chemistry anions and cations was measured using ion chromatograph dionex 500 for cationic analysis 25 μl of the acidified sample was injected into a cation exchange column cs 12a where the ions were separated based on their charge to size ratio and were quantified using conductivity detector ed 40 for anionic determination 25 μl of the non acidified sample was injected into an anion exchange column as 11 and measured 3 2 electrical resistivity survey in order to identify the groundwater potential zones an electrical resistivity survey of the geological formation was carried out in an area of 200 m 400 m as shown in fig 1 the technique involves the estimation of resistance of the geological formation by passing electrical current through two current electrodes kept at ab distance apart and measuring the potential difference voltage between two potential electrodes kept at mn distance apart fig 3 in general resistivity ρ ωm is given by 3 ρ r a l where r is the resistance ω a is the area of cross section m2 and l is the length m in geological terms apparent resistivity ρa is given by 4 ρ a k r where k represent the geometry factor which depends on the arrangement of four electrodes k is given by 5 k 2 π 1 ma 1 mb 1 na 1 nb the calculated resistivity value is not the true resistivity of the subsurface but an apparent value which is the resistivity of a homogeneous ground that will give the same resistivity value for the same electrode arrangement the relationship between the apparent resistivity and true resistivity is complex two electrical resistivity methodologies were adopted i resistivity profiling ii vertical electrical sounding ves 4 results and discussion 4 1 environmental isotopes 4 1 1 variations of stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in precipitation the isotopic results of monthly precipitation occurred at anjangaon area for the year 2010 is given in table 1 since the isotope data of precipitation is limited hence to bring confidence in the data interpretation the data is compared with the 4 years 2005 2008 of monthly isotope data generated by warrier and babu 2011 for a nearby inland precipitation station namely hyderabad which is about 500 km southeast of the study area in general the precipitation isotope data of anjangaon area is found to be in agreement with to those of hyderabad the monthly variation of precipitation and its δ18o and δ2h in 2010 in anjangaon area are shown in fig 4 a and b significant seasonal variation is observed in the δ18o and δ2h values of precipitation the δ18o of southwest monsoon precipitation june to september varies from 4 8 to 2 while it fall in a narrow range of 8 1 to 7 9 during northeast monsoon october and november the corresponding values of δ2h are 30 to 7 2 and 53 9 to 50 9 respectively the calculated weighted mean δ18o and δ2h values for southwest monsoon is 4 1 and 24 4 respectively while the corresponding values for northeast monsoon is 8 0 and 52 7 the annual weighted mean δ18o and δ2h in precipitation of anjangaon area is 4 6 and 27 7 respectively the isotopic composition of precipitation at a particular location is governed by regional scale processes like the trajectories of the water vapour transport over the continents and the average rainout history of the air masses rozanski et al 1982 therefore the observed seasonal variation in stable isotopic composition of precipitation at anjangaon area indicate distinct source of moisture for precipitation based on the monthly δ2h and δ18o data of precipitation the local meteoric water line lmwl is constructed as the best fit line for precipitation samples fig 5 the equation for the lmwl is given by 6 δ 2 h 7 4 0 2 δ 18 o 6 5 1 1 r 2 0 98 n 6 the slightly lower slope and y intercept of lmwl compared to the gmwl indicate that the falling raindrops had undergone slight secondary evaporation evaporation beneath the cloud base under the condition of lower amount of precipitation and lower humidity lowers the slope of lmwl below 8 the lmwl developed for hyderabad station is given by warrier and babu 2011 7 δ 2 h 7 7 δ 18 o 6 2 r 2 0 95 n 25 the lmwl of anjangaon area is found to be more or less similar to that of hyderabad with slight variation in slope and y intercept owing to the variability in climatic conditions deuterium excess can be used for characterising the origin of water vapour for precipitation deuterium excess d excess is defined by the relation dansgaard 1964 8 d excess δ 2 h 8 xd 18 o low d excess values of precipitation reflect slow evaporation at its source region due to high humidity whereas high values reflect fast evaporation due to low humidity the seasonal variations of δ18o and d excess in precipitation of anjangaon area are illustrated in fig 6 the average d excess values for southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon are 8 5 0 2 and 11 6 1 0 respectively the southwest monsoon rains accounting for 87 of the total annual precipitation of this region is relatively enriched in stable isotopes with a weighted mean δ18o of 4 1 and having average d excess of 8 5 confirms the rainout processes of oceanic moisture source from the arabian sea and the indian ocean comparatively depleted stable isotopic composition of northeast monsoon comprising of only 13 of the total annual precipitation having a weighted mean δ18o of 8 0 and slightly elevated d excess of 11 6 indicate that the northeastern continental monsoon winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal and brings rain in the study area the causative mechanism for the southwest and northeast monsoons in india is the seasonal reversal of temperature and pressure gradients and the associated wind circulation patterns in summer the equatorial maritime air mass originating in the arabian sea and northern indian ocean flows from the southwest direction and brings rain in the southern peninsular india during june to september ghosh et al 1978 in winter the continental air mass originating over central asia flows from northeast direction from the land towards the sea and picks up moisture from the bay of bengal and brings rain in eastern and southern parts of india during october to november menon 1995 dansgaard 1964 found a negative correlation between δ18o and amount of precipitation at various global stations with more negative δ18o resulting from heavy rainfall this is termed as amount effect the relationship of δ18o and δ2h in precipitation with amount of rainfall at anjangaon area is shown in fig 7 a and b although the number of samples are less n 4 a good negative correlation is found between the stable isotopic composition of monthly precipitation and its amount during the southwest monsoon the equation to the best fit line between amount of rainfall and its δ18o for southwest monsoon samples is given by 9 δ 18 o 0 0158 0 0053 p 0 99 0 98 r 2 0 82 n 4 where p is the monthly precipitation in mm the equation to the best fit line between amount of rainfall and its δ2h for southwest monsoon is given by 10 δ 2 h 0 129 0 043 p 0 95 8 03 r 2 0 82 n 4 therefore the average rate of depletion amount effect is estimated to be 1 6 for δ18o and 13 for δ2h per 100 mm of rainfall during the southwest monsoon period dansgaard 1964 reported a similar altitude effect for δ18o in precipitation of wake island usa 4 1 2 tritium in precipitation the tritium concentration in monthly precipitation of anjangaon area is given in table 1 significant seasonality is found in the tritium content of precipitation at anjangaon area with higher values noticed during northeast monsoon precipitation the southwest monsoon rain is characterized by a mean tritium content of 4 1 0 6 tu while the mean tritium content in northeast monsoon precipitation is 7 7 0 6 tu in order to bring confidence in interpretation with limited tritium data the data is compared with those reported in the nearby areas for southwest monsoon precipitation tirumalesh et al 2011 reported a tritium content of 4 0 tu for an inland site buldhana about 130 km southwest of the study area kumar et al 2009a b reported a tritium content of 4 6 tu for another inland site jalgaon about 160 km west of the study area while ansari et al 2018 reported a lower tritium content of 3 1 tu for a coastal site goa about 800 km west of the study area based on 4 years 2005 2008 of monthly tritium data of precipitation at the inland hyderabad station about 500 km southeast of the study area warrier et al 2013 reported a mean tritium value of 3 6 1 0 tu and 4 8 1 4 tu for southwest and northeast monsoons respectively it is seen that the tritium data of precipitation at anjangaon area matches well with those of the nearby areas the seasonal variation of tritium in precipitation confirms the marine and continental source of moisture for precipitation for southwest and northeast monsoon precipitation respectively an average tritium content of about 1 tu is reported for the indian ocean povinec et al 2010 therefore the moisture evaporating from the indian ocean must have lower tritium content ansari et al 2018 since anjangaon is an inland station and because of the exchange with the natural production of tritium in the atmosphere the lower tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 4 1 tu is justified shivanna et al 1998 reported a tritium content of 4 1 5 0 tu for the coastal waters of bay of bengal at puri odisha located in the eastern part of india which is higher than those of indian ocean hence the winds originated from the central asia that pick up moisture from the bay of bengal is expected to have higher tritium content because of its origin from higher latitude and higher tritium content in bay of bengal 4 1 3 isotopic characteristics of surface water and groundwater the detention tanks samples collected at the end of the monsoon november 2010 showed maximum enrichment in stable isotopes with average δ18o and δ2h of 2 6 and 18 2 respectively table 2 the stream samples have an average δ18o and δ2h of 3 5 and 22 4 respectively the δ18o of groundwater samples varies between 4 2 to 2 6 while δ2h varies between 25 7 to 18 0 also these stable isotopic values of groundwater are slightly different from the annual weighted mean values of precipitation δ18o 4 6 δ2h 27 7 but comparatively similar to that of the weighted mean values of southwest monsoon precipitation δ18o 4 1 δ2h 24 4 this shows that the northeast monsoon precipitation is not contributing to the groundwater recharge of this region this is further substantiated by the fact that the amount of northeast monsoon precipitation occurring in this region is relatively low i e only 13 of the annual precipitation the δ18o δ2h relationships in surface water and groundwater from anjangaon area is shown in fig 8 the best fit line bfl for the surface water samples detention tanks and stream samples is given by el1 and the equation is 11 δ 2 h 4 7 δ 18 o 6 r 2 0 98 n 4 it is seen that el1 is deviated to the right from the lmwl and is having a lower slope 4 7 compared to lmwl indicating evaporation effect hence el1 is an evaporation line the groundwater samples dug well tube well and spring samples collected at the end of the monsoon also shows evaporation effect with the bfl el2 the equation to the line el2 is given by 12 δ 2 h 4 8 δ 18 o 6 r 2 0 96 n 5 the best fit line for groundwater samples dug well and tube well samples collected during the summer period april 2011 is represented by el3 13 δ 2 h 4 6 δ 18 o 7 r 2 0 91 n 10 similar slope and y intercept in the bfl of surface water and groundwater indicate that groundwater is either getting recharge from evaporated surface water sources such as detention tanks or subjected to evaporation during recharge from the rain since detention tank water and rain recharged groundwater have the same meteoric origin and same isotopic composition prior to evaporation the slope of the mixing lines between detention tank and rain water and the evaporation line of groundwater surface water would be identical and hence it is difficult to differentiate between these two processes therefore evaporative enrichment of groundwater during recharge and groundwater recharge from detention tanks were evaluated the tritium content of the groundwater samples varies from 3 5 to 4 5 tu which is similar to the mean tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 3h 4 1 0 6 tu but quite different from the mean tritium content of southwest monsoon precipitation 3h 7 7 0 6 tu it corroborates the inference derived from the stable isotope data that the groundwater in this region is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is minimal the similar values of tritium in groundwater and southwest monsoon precipitation indicate that the groundwater is modern i e recharged from the present day precipitation and the groundwater residence time is less may be of the order of a few years 4 1 4 modelling of evaporative isotopic enrichment in surface water groundwater a reyleigh distillation model incorporating both equilibrium and kinetic factors was developed in order to evaluate the evaporative isotopic enrichment of water the isotopic composition of precipitation feeding the detention tank or prior to groundwater recharge is estimated by projecting the bfl el1 el2 and el3 to cut the lmwl at point a fig 8 this δ18o and δ2h values are found to be same as the annual weighted average values in precipitation δ18o 4 6 δ2h 27 7 of anjangaon area temperature during the recharge tk in kelvin is used to compute the vapor to water isotopic enrichment εv w for δ18o and δ2h with equilibrium enrichment factors given by kakiuchi and matsuo 1979 as 14 ε v w 18 o 1000 exp 5 9702 10 6 t k 2 32 801 10 3 t k 52 227 1000 1 15 ε v w 2 h 1000 exp 2 408 10 6 t k 2 64 55 10 3 t k 168 7 1000 1 with the average temperature of recharge of 33 5 c from june to april till the detention tank dry out the calculated vapor water isotopic enrichment factors for δ18o and δ2h are found to be 8 78 and 69 73 respectively during evaporation kinetic effects of humidity also affect the isotopic composition of residual water in addition to the equilibrium fractionation this is due to the diffusion of water molecules across water air boundary layer bl which is a function of humidity h when the humidity decreases the vapor phase near the boundary layer becomes depleted in more diffusive lighter isotopes 1h and 16o thereby enriching the residual water in the heavy isotopes 2h and 18o clark and fritz 1997 the equation for kinetic isotopic enrichment δ ε v bl which is a function of humidity is represented as gonfiantini 1986 16 δ ε v bl 18 o 14 2 h 1 17 δ ε v bl 2 h 12 5 h 1 the total evaporative isotopic enrichment ε v w t is the sum of equilibrium and kinetic enrichment factors stable isotopic composition of water undergoing evaporation is given by rayleigh distillation equation butler 2007 18 δ 18 o exp ln f ε v w t 18 o 1000 δ 18 o o 1000 1000 19 δ 2 h exp ln f ε v w t 2 h 1000 δ 2 h o 1000 1000 where δ 18 o0 and δ 2 h0 are the weighted annual average values of precipitation and f is the fraction of residual water remaining after the evaporation the average humidity at the time of evaporation is estimated by varying the humidity values in the above model eqs 16 19 till the slope of the evaporation line is equal to slope 4 7 of the bfl of surface water and groundwater samples the model estimated average humidity during evaporation and infiltration is about 45 during summer the climate is generally dry in anjangaon area and lower humidity is generally expected hence the predicted humidity of 45 could be the humidity during summer season the modeled δ18o and δ2h for 45 humidity and various residual fractions f are shown in fig 9 comparison of the observed maximum enrichment in stable isotopic values i e the detention tank water with the modelled values indicate that around 12 f 88 water is removed by evaporation and a major component might have been infiltrated this points that infiltration from the detention tank is a major component of groundwater recharge also it is substantiated by the local hard rock geology since the groundwater flow in this area is through weathered and fractured basalt there can be less chance for evaporation prior to infiltration 4 1 5 quantification of recharge from the detention tanks based on a conservative two component isotope δ18o or δ2h mixing model it is possible to quantify the relative contribution from the two end members namely detention tank and the natural precipitation recharge the inherent assumption in the model is that both the end members must have distinct stable isotopic composition and they mix conservatively based on the δ18o model the percentage detention tank water contribution x to the groundwater is calculated as 20 x δ 18 o g δ 18 o p δ 18 o dt δ 18 o p 100 where δ18og δ18op and δ18odt represents the δ18o of groundwater precipitation recharged groundwater and detention tank recharged water respectively for the mixing model calculation δ18odt is taken as the average δ18o of detention tank 2 5 δ18op is taken as the average δ18o of groundwater from wells δ18o 4 1 located away from the influence of detention tank rather than weighted annual average δ18o of precipitation this is due to the fact that slight evaporation of groundwater during recharge is possible as the study area is located in a semi arid region also it is seen that the use of weighted annual average δ18o of precipitation for δ18op will overestimate the recharge contribution from the detention tanks the relationship between the estimated percentage groundwater contribution from the detention tanks and the corresponding electrical conductivity is illustrated in fig 10 most of the groundwater samples fall in a mixing line between the groundwater recharged by precipitation and the detention tank it is seen that in general the electrical conductivity of groundwater decreases as the percentage of detention tank increases also it indicates that the samples with no detention tank contribution should have an electrical conductivity of about 800 μs cm a few groundwater samples have relatively higher electrical conductivity around 1100 μs cm and plot off the line in fig 10 these samples may represent slightly brackish groundwater which might have attained the salt content from the soil the spring and a nearby bore well sample have less electrical conductivity than the groundwater samples because of fast circulation groundwater recharge from precipitation as they are collected just at the end of the monsoon this conclusion is supported by the stable isotope data which plot close to the lmwl near the average isotopic composition of precipitation they also have less contribution from the detention tank analysis of both isotopic evaporative enrichment and mixing models indicates that the mixing of detention tank water with precipitation recharged groundwater is likely the general process responsible for the observed enrichment of stable isotopes in groundwater the percentage recharge contribution from the detention tanks is estimated to be 42 93 depending upon the distance from the tank and prevailing geological conditions therefore the constructed detention tanks are found to be effective in augmenting the groundwater recharge in this drought prone area 4 2 hydrochemistry data on field parameters along with the results of isotope analyses are given in table 2 it is seen that the groundwater temperature varied from 28 3 33 0 c while the average temperature of surface water bodies such as stream and detention pond were 31 8 0 4 c the electrical conductivity ec of groundwater ranged from 600 to 1115 μs cm indicating that the groundwater is fresh the average ec of surface water sources was 398 95 μs cm the groundwater is neutral to slightly alkaline ph varied from 6 8 to 7 7 while the surface water is alkaline ph varied from 7 8 to 8 4 in nature the field parameters in general did not show any seasonal variations the results of the hydrochemical analysis are presented in table 3 from the results it is found that ca2 is the dominant cation with its values ranged from 34 6 to 90 8 mg l at the end of monsoon and from 38 2 to 158 mg l in summer while mg2 ranged from 17 3 to 74 5 mg l post monsoon and from 29 0 to 52 0 mg l summer in the study area with respect to the alkali metals the concentrations of na ranged from 10 5 to 67 7 mg l post monsoon and from 17 1 to 59 8 mg l summer while that of k varied from 0 3 to 2 9 mg l post monsoon and from 0 6 to 13 5 mg l summer hco3 is the dominant anion with concentration of 207 332 mg l and is followed by no3 and cl concentrations that ranged from 0 01 to 211 5 mg l and 4 1 to 95 5 mg l respectively in the post monsoon period whereas in summer the hco3 no3 and cl concentrations are enriched and varied from 245 to 330 mg l 24 1 to 135 mg l and 26 8 to 92 4 mg l respectively so4 2 concentration is in the range of 3 5 92 2 mg l in the post monsoon period and 9 0 to 115 mg l in the summer f concentrations ranged from 0 3 to 1 7 mg l the higher concentration of no3 in groundwater might be resulted from intensive agricultural activity in the study area ansari et al 2015 comparatively high so4 2 observed in groundwater could be due the leaching from the saline alkaline soil present in the study area and not because of the weathering of basalt sulphides das et al 2011 the low so4 2 present in a few samples may be because of the biological reduction furthermore the cation concentrations was in the order of ca2 mg2 na k while that of the anions was hco3 no3 cl so4 2 f regarding the water quality for portability and usability all the various chemical constituents of the groundwater in the study area fall within the who 2006 acceptable limits for drinking water standard except no3 hydrochemical parameters of the water samples collected at the end of the monsoon november 2010 and during the summer period april 2011 are plotted on the piper s trilinear diagram piper 1994 as shown in fig 11 a and b piper s diagram indicates that the dug well samples are ca mg hco3 type while bore well samples are generally ca mg hco3 cl type water which is typical of shallow fresh groundwater system surface water samples are ca mg hco3 type some of the dug wells and tube wells samples fall on a mixing line between detention tank samples and deep tube well samples these samples have similar water type as that of detention tank this could be because of the recharge from the detention tank it was also observed that some of the deep tube well samples are ca mg hco3 cl type which is evolved because of rock water interactions from the environmental isotope and hydrochemical investigation it was found that the detention tank is acting as a recharge source apart from the natural precipitation recharge to the groundwater in this region therefore a geophysical survey was conducted to delineate the aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zone in the study area 4 3 electrical resistivity survey 4 3 1 resistivity profiling resistivity profiling survey was conducted to scan the area and find the lateral heterogeneities in the geological formation so that low resistivity zones such as lineament and fractures can be delineated two profiling were carried out each for a distance of 400 m with 12 stations and interval of about 30 m the profiling was made using a fixed current electrodes separation with ab 2 of 30 m and 15 m the potential electrodes are separated with mn 2 as 5 m and 2 m respectively a fixed current was injected and the potential difference was measured the apparent resistivity was calculated using the eq 4 the distribution of apparent resistivity in the area for ab 2 of 15 m and 30 m are given in figs 12 and 13 respectively low apparent resistivity values of 9 25 ωm and 10 5ωmwere found at station 13 and station 8 respectively for an electrode configuration ab 2 30 m and mn 2 5 m hence vertical electrical sounding was carried out at these two stations to understand the vertical variation of resistivity of the sub surface geological formations 4 3 2 vertical electrical sounding ves two vertical electrical sounding were conducted at station 8 and station 13 using schlumberger configuration for understanding the vertical variation of resistivity and quantitative evaluation of layer parameters the current electrode configuration ab 2 was varied from 1 5 to a maximum of 100 m along the profiles at each location the field obtained apparent resistivity data for various current and electrode spacing were processed and plotted as ab 2 versus apparent resistivity on bi logarithmic scale and interpreted in terms of layer parameters i e thickness and resistivity of individual layers the layer parameters were obtained using ipi2win ver 3 0 1 software resistivity sounding interpretation moscow state university the interpreted result at station 8 indicates four layer case ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρ4 kh type curve fig 14 a reynolds 1997 the upper layer having resistivity 6 01 ωm whose thickness is about 0 9 m the resistivity of second layer increased rapidly up to 41 8 ωm and having thickness of about 4 12 m the resistivity of the third layer decreased to 4 19 ωm which is 4 66 m thick the resistivity of fourth layer increased to 13 9 ωm which is 31 3 m thick the interpreted result at station 13 shows four layer case ρ1 ρ2 ρ3 ρ4 kh type curve fig 14b the upper layer having resistivity 12 4 ωm indicates the soil cover whose thickness is about 0 9 m the resistivity of second layer increases rapidly up to 71 3 ωm which is attributed to the presence of unsaturated and dry formation having thickness of about 1 11 m the resistivity of the third layer decreased to 4 0 ωm which indicates the presence of water bearing layer whose thickness is about 2 5 m since the thickness of the third layer is less it may not be a potential zone the resistivity of fourth layer increase to 11 1 ωm which indicates the presence of fracture zone with water whose thickness is about 17 9 m based on the interpretation of the sounding data a borehole was drilled at station 13 up to a depth of 45 m to identify the different lithological units and presence of groundwater bearing zones copious water was found in the bore well subsequently four more bore wells were drilled up to 45 m depth in the northeast direction which yielded perennial source of good quality water 5 conclusions in this study application of environmental isotopes hydrochemical and geophysical techniques were used for evaluating the groundwater recharge mechanism and delineate the groundwater potential zones in a part of the drought prone areas of vidarbha region maharashtra india additionally monsoonal characteristics were also studied based on isotope data significant seasonal variation was observed in stable isotopic composition deuterium excess and tritium in precipitation owing to distinct source of moisture causing the rains it is seen that during southwest monsoon the moisture was originating from oceanic sources such as the arabian sea and indian ocean whereas continental winds pick up moisture from bay of bengal and brings rain during northeast monsoon a strong negative correlation is found between the stable isotopic composition of monthly precipitation and its amount during the southwest monsoon the average rate of depletion amount effect is estimated to be 1 6 for δ18o and 13 for δ2h per 100 mm of rainfall isotopic data indicates two sources of groundwater recharge namely natural recharge from precipitation and contribution from artificial recharge structures such as detention tanks constructed for augmenting the groundwater environmental isotope data show that the groundwater in this region is predominantly recharged from the southwest monsoon and the contribution from the northeast monsoon is insignificant tritium data indicate that the groundwater is modern i e recharged from the present day precipitation and the groundwater residence time is less may be of the order of a few years to find out the climatic condition prevailed during evaporation isotopic enrichment processes was modelled and climate variable such as temperature and humidity were estimated the model estimated average humidity during evaporation and infiltration is about 45 in this study the recharge from the detention tanks was also quantified based on isotope balance model the percentage recharge contribution from the detention tanks is estimated to be 42 93 depending upon the distance from the tank and prevailing geological conditions therefore the constructed detention tanks are found to be effective in augmenting the groundwater recharge in this drought prone area using electrical resistivity method aquifer geometry and groundwater potential zone were delineated in a part of the study area a weak fracture zone with water having a thickness of about 17 9 m was found and a borehole was drilled at identified location up to a depth of 45 m which provided copious amount of good quality water for the farmers many more bore wells were drilled in this area and thus the drought prone area is transformed into a cultivable land thus the study portrait that an integrated approach of multidisciplinary techniques is effective in assessing the recharge processes and groundwater potentiality in drought prone areas

6723,with concerns about future catastrophic disasters elevated co2 concentration eco2 global warming and vegetation changes have received much attention globally in recent years studies have suggested controlling climate change should be based on regional impacts however regional quantitative assessments of respective and combination influences of co2 temperature and vegetation variations on water resources remain limited to address this issue a comprehensive framework is developed this framework integrates a dynamic vegetation simulation approach a biosphere hydrological model and a variance based sensitivity analysis approach which enables identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations a medium sized river basin in northeast china is used to illustrate the application based on different co2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions validation using modis products shows the proposed approach can simulate leaf area index lai changes well results show sum of the influences of lai and temperature variations on transpiration are more than 1 6 times higher than physiological effects of eco2 in growing seasons which implies more water could be transpired than conserved with eco2 global warming and lai changes results also show runoff increases with eco2 and decreases with increasing temperatures but lai changes play a dominate role in runoff decrease in hot summer therefore considering lai changes is of utmost importance in projections of future water resources and severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if lai changes are neglected this research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of eco2 global warming and lai changes on regional water security and sustainability keywords co2 warming vegetation changes runoff water resources 1 introduction it has been reported that global average temperature is rising with elevated co2 concentration hansen et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 with co2 concentration and temperature variations global vegetation changes have also been reported in some regions piao et al 2007 hansen et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 these changes have caused worries that they could result in catastrophic disasters for example severe droughts and water scarcity seager et al 2007 dai 2013 fischer et al 2013 jaeger et al 2014 hu et al 2015 irvine et al 2017 baker et al 2018 to ameliorate the negative influences of the changes in co2 concentration temperature and vegetation seneviratne et al 2016 suggested that co2 emissions should be limited based on regional climate change impacts because regional impacts are more directly related to individual interests and global average temperature targets may fail to represent the urgency of controlling climate change similarly many recent studies also suggested that climate change limitation should be based on its impacts on regional scales e g matthews et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2018 greve et al 2018 therefore regional studies of the influences of elevated co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation dynamics on water resources are imperative and essential temperature co2 and vegetation changes could influence water cycle in a very complex way increasing co2 concentration could warm the earth and variations in co2 concentration and or temperature then may lead to changes in vegetation at the leaf level higher co2 concentration may lead to decrease in leaf stomatal conductance and therefore reduce transpiration rate field et al 1995 skinner et al 2018 at the canopy level co2 may increase leaf area index lai piao et al 2007 donohue et al 2013 2017 zhu et al 2016 and boost canopy transpiration and vegetation water use in soil pu and dickinson 2012 swann et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 trancoso et al 2017 many studies have investigated the impacts of co2 concentration temperature and or vegetation changes on water resources on global or continental scales e g labat et al 2004 gedney et al 2006 betts et al 2007 piao et al 2007 concluded mean climate and its variability contribute to global runoff increase gerten et al 2008 confirmed the research by piao et al 2007 and suggested that quantifying relative contributions of each individual contributors such as co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes to runoff variations are important and need to be carried out many recent studies have endeavoured to quantify the influences of co2 concentration temperature and or vegetation changes on a river basin scale for example the studies by cheng et al 2014 in australia tao et al 2014 in the mississippi river basin and tesemma et al 2015 in the murray darling river basin nevertheless these studies on river basins did not separate the relative and combination influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on water resources variations consequently studies that quantify the respective and combination influences remain limited on river basin scales to quantify the influences on river basin scales a comprehensive model is required in which vegetation changes photosynthesis conductance variations and biosphere hydrological processes can be simulated simultaneously sensitivity analysis is a useful approach to attribute changes to various influential factors wilby and harris 2006 steinschneider et al 2012 wu et al 2012a b bosshard et al 2013 in recent years several studies have been carried out to investigate impacts of individual influential factors and their combinations on model simulation results based on advanced sensitivity analysis approaches for example qi et al 2016a investigated impacts of precipitation data and hydrological models on runoff simulation uncertainty qi et al 2016c studied impacts of probability distribution functions distribution function parameters and flood data on design flood selections in these studies an advanced variance based sensitivity analysis approach anova bosshard et al 2013 was used because it allows for identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations and provides a more complete understanding of the influential factors in a modelling chain the overall objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive framework to quantify the respective and combination influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation changes on water resources on a river basin scale for this objective a regional dynamic vegetation simulation approach is developed and incorporated into the web dhm model v web dhm first and then the comprehensive framework is proposed by integrating v web dhm and anova described in section 2 to illustrate the application of the developed framework a medium sized river basin in northeast china is used introduced in section 3 and the water resources variations on a multi year mean monthly scale are investigated based on simulated vegetation changes and different co2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions presented in section 4 in this illustrative application the vegetation dynamics changes will refer to lai changes and co2 influences will refer to the physiological effects of co2 concentration hereafter this research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes on regional water resources and therefore on regional water security and water sustainability provided in sections 5 and 6 2 the methods the developed framework includes three components i set up climate change scenarios e g co2 concentration and temperature ii under these climate conditions calculate vegetation changes and simulate land surface fluxes and hydrological variables using v web dhm and iii quantify the individual and combination influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on simulated results using anova fig 1 shows the diagrammatic representation of the developed framework the details are introduced in the following sub sections 2 1 structure of v web dhm fig 2 shows overall structure of v web dhm fig 2 a d represents the structure of web dhm fig 2 e shows vegetation dynamics which are results of many environmental resources such as precipitation solar radiation temperature co2 humidity and wind speed in fig 2 d canopy conductance g c is simulated by combining a leaf stomatal conductance model developed by ball 1988 and a photosynthesis model developed by collatz et al 1991 1992 i e the ball berry model 1 g c m a c c s r h p b lai where m and b are coefficients sellers et al 1996a rh represents relative humidity c s represents co2 partial pressure pa p represents atmospheric pressure pa a c represents a canopy photosynthetic rate the photosynthetic rate is calculated as the minimum of three limiting rates for c3 species they are efficiency of photosynthetic enzyme system incident radiation absorbed by green canopy and the capacity of leaf to utilize or export the products of photosynthesis for c4 species they are rubisco limitation light limitation and pep carboxylase limitation collatz et al 1992 sellers et al 1996a the canopy conductance rate is then used to estimate canopy transpiration rate e ct 2 e ct e t c e a 1 g c 2 r b ρ c p γ 1 w c where e t c represents saturated vapour pressure pa when canopy temperatures equal t c e a represents vapour pressure pa ρ and c p are density and specific heat of air γ represents the psychrometric constant w c represents canopy wetted area based on eqs 1 and 2 it can be seen that the canopy transpiration and stomatal conductance are influenced by many environmental variables such as lai co2 concentration relative humidity and temperature more details about the calculations of g c and e ct can be found in the research by sellers et al 1996a land use types are defined based on biomes and are the same to the classifications in the simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 randall et al 1996 sellers et al 1996b the different responses of biomes to co2 concentration changes are represented by biome dependent parameters through lookup tables the lookup tables used in this study are the same to the studies by sellers et al 1996b and randall et al 1996 more detailed descriptions about web dhm can be found in the studies by wang et al 2009 qi et al 2015 2018a 2 2 lai simulation approach lai refers to one sided leaf areas per unit ground lai represents mass accumulation in plant leaves and is a result of vegetation growth influenced by availability of water light temperature co2 and humidity etc yang et al 2016 donohue et al 2017 lai can be simulated based on these environmental resources for example jamieson et al 1998 developed an approach to simulate lai based on an exponential function and temperature similarly koetz et al 2005 and setiyono et al 2008 developed approaches based on an exponential function and temperature as well in addition cao et al 2015 and su et al 2015 proposed a lai simulation approach based on an exponential distribution using accumulated growing degree days tesemma et al 2015 developed a method based on precipitation potential evapotranspiration and an exponential function in these prior studies temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were considered to simulate lai however lai has different responses to climate in different regions zhu et al 2016 thus it is necessary to develop a simple and general approach to simulate lai dynamics different from previous research in this study a lai simulation approach is developed based on sib2 biome types and corresponding biome dependent morphological properties in sib2 lookup tables please refer to the study by randall et al 1996 for the biome types on a global scale in this new approach all environmental resources i e precipitation temperature solar radiation long wave radiation humidity co2 etc that strongly related to lai variations can be taken into consideration the developed lai simulation approach is as below 3 lai x n 2 lai max 1 exp x n 1 x 1 v 1 x 2 v 2 x n 1 v n 1 x n v n where lai represents simulated values laimax represents the maximum lai values of each sib2 vegetation type and is obtained from sib2 database v 1 v 2 v n 1 v n represent environmental variables influencing vegetation growth such as precipitation temperature light co2 and humidity x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n represent influences of each environmental resource on lai x n 1 represents the states without environmental resource influence x n 2 represents changes of local maximum lai values relative to the maximum lai values in sib2 database exp represents an exponential function in practical application x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n x n 1 x n 2 should be quantified based on experience experiments and or calibrations in the last few decades the quick development of remote sensing techniques provides a great number of datasets about vegetation dynamics which enable very detailed reliable and quantitative analyses of spatial and temporal variations of lai thus the parameters in eq 3 can be derived from these remote sensing data sets one approach is to calibrate with an objective function using auto calibration algorithms such as the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 the shuffled complex evolution approach duan et al 1993 qi et al 2016b and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb and gupta 2006 qi et al 2018c 2 3 anova ensemble simulation results can be obtained using v web dhm with different co2 concentration air temperature rises and vegetation conditions as inputs total ensemble width m is the variance of simulated land surface and hydrological variables to relate m to influential sources the superscripts j k and l in m j k l are used to represent temperature scenario j co2 concentration scenario k and vegetation scenario l anova can underestimate variance when a small sample size is utilized bosshard et al 2013 to reduce the bias effects on variance contribution quantification a subsampling method proposed by bosshard et al 2013 is used in this study this subsampling method randomly selects two samples from the largest sample set assume to be h without replacement and generates a new sample set to be used for anova with this subsampling the superscript j in m j k l is replaced with g h i which is a 2 c 2 h matrix as follows 4 g 1 2 1 3 1 h 2 3 2 4 h 3 h 2 h 3 h 1 h 3 h h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 h total sum of squares sst can be divided into sums of squares of individual and combination effects 5 sst ssa ssb ssc ssi where ssa represents influence of co2 concentration changes ssb represents influence of temperature changes ssc represents influence of vegetation changes ssi represents influence of their combinations the terms can be estimated as follows ssi is computed as the residual bosshard et al 2013 6 sst i

relative influences of changes of temperature co2 concentration vegetation and their combinations the higher the values the larger the influences as shown in eqs 11 14 the subsampling approach is necessary because it guarantees that every influential factor has the same denominator i which ensures inter comparisons among the influences are not affected by their different sampling numbers the influence quantification using anova takes all sources together and does not repeat anova for each influential factor the combination effect represents influence from simultaneous variations of all the three factors and reflects the influence of nonlinearity or interactions in addition observed runoff values or simulated variables using observed data are used to calculate the variance see bosshard et al 2013 in which the used anova approach is developed therefore differences in the mean values of the three groups have no influence on the contribution quantification bosshard et al 2013 3 study region data materials and criteria for evaluation 3 1 the biliu river basin as one of the most populated areas in china northeast china plays an important role in food production for supporting the livelihood of the population this region frequently suffers from droughts which pose a threat to regional sustainable development thus this study is conducted in a river basin the biliu river basin 2814 km2 fig 3 in northeast china in addition the biliu river basin plays a very important role in water supply to nearby big cities such as the dalian city which has a population of 6 69 million and the cities suffered from serious water shortages in recent years the dalian city government invested 660 million to tackle the water resources problem since 2008 therefore studies in the biliu river basin on the water resources under climate change are both economically environmentally and socially important 3 2 observation based data the data used in this study were collected from eleven rain gauges one hydrology station and three meteorological gauges from march 2000 to december 2010 other data are also utilized including digital elevation model dem rabus et al 2003 fig 4 a usgs landuse types sellers et al 1996a fig 4b mod15a2 one km eight day lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar products myneni et al 1997 there are six landuse types with broadleaf and needleleaf trees short vegetation c4 grassland and agriculture c3 grassland being the main types fig 4b hourly precipitation data are obtained by downscaling daily observations using a stochastic method wang et al 2011 hourly air temperatures are calculated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures based on the temp model parton and logan 1981 the estimated temperatures are further evaluated using daily average temperatures in addition a lapse rate of 6 5 k km is used to consider elevation differences between model cells and meteorological gauges downward solar radiation data are estimated from sunshine duration temperatures and humidity using a hybrid model yang et al 2006 downward long wave radiation is from the global land data assimilation systems gldas because there is no observation air pressure data are estimated according to elevation yang et al 2006 this study region is the same as in the study by qi et al 2015 and more detailed descriptions about the data used their processing and model parameter calibrations including calibration approaches and calibrated values can be found in the study by qi et al 2015 3 3 scenario datasets fig 5 shows scenario settings for influence quantifications combinations of the co2 concentration scenarios temperature rise scenarios and vegetation scenarios four co2 concentration scenarios and six temperature rise scenarios are included considering the computational burden of v web dhm two hours to finish one year simulation in a personal computer with four inter core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors the as normal vegetation scenario means the modis lai and fpar data are used and therefore the influences of leaf area changes when temperature and co2 concentration increase are not considered the dynamic vegetation scenario means simulated lai and fpar under the assumed temperature and co2 concentration scenarios are utilized and therefore the impacts of leaf area changes are considered stern 2006 suggested that there are chances that global average temperature rise reaches 2 k when co2 concentration is 550 ppm and that the temperature rise depends on general circulation models hansen et al 2012 found that global temperature changes unevenly there are some regions warming slower than the global average temperature rise many studies show future temperature rise under certain co2 concentration is uncertain because of large uncertainty of general circulation models fischer et al 2013 kharin et al 2013 chiyuan et al 2014 shiogama et al 2016 in addition many studies have suggested that solar radiation management approaches could effectively reflect sunlight back to space therefore temperature variations could be subjectively controlled under certain co2 concentration pongratz et al 2012 curry et al 2014 crook et al 2015 thus in this study quantifying influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes are based on an assumption that different temperature rise values could happen under certain co2 concentration these scenario settings are similar to the hypothetical sensitivity scenario methods used in previous studies e g rehana and mujumdar 2011 wu et al 2012a b walling et al 2017 although the assumptions may be subjective it enables to explore various potential consequences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes and therefore can provide an enhanced understanding of their impacts on water resources in addition it is assumed that temperatures in every month rise the same values therefore differences in temperature rises in every month are not considered similar assumptions have been implemented in previous research ramirez and finnerty 1996 streck 2005 arias et al 2014 on the basis of the above scenario settings the parameters of anova can be obtained for example h k and l in eqs 6 10 equals six four and two respectively g in eq 4 is a 2 c 2 6 2 15 matrix i in eqs 11 14 equals 15 3 4 assessment criteria for simulation four evaluation criteria were used for uncertainty assessment spearman s rank coefficient of determination rh2 pearson s linear coefficient of

using observed data xsi represents simulation x s represents average of simulation i represents time n represents the total number of data points a perfect fit should have rh2 r2 and nse values of one the lower the rb values the higher the accuracy these criteria have commonly been used e g ebert et al 2007 wang et al 2011 qi et al 2016d 2018b and therefore they were used in this study 4 results 4 1 vegetation dynamic simulation fig 6 shows scatter plots of basin average modis lai and climatic variables including downward shortwave radiation downward long wave radiation relative humidity air temperature and rainfall because the three sib2 vegetation types i e broadleaf and needleleaf trees short vegetation c4 grassland and agriculture c3 grassland account for over 98 of the biliu river basin plots for these three vegetation types are shown because local observed co2 concentration is not available global monthly average values were used it can be seen that downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature show strong relationships with lai variations whereas shortwave radiation rainfall and co2 spread out in the scatter plots because the relationships between lai and climatic variables are non linear the correlations are analyzed using the spearman s rank coefficient of determination which assesses how well the relationships can be described using monotonic functions rh2 values are shown in supplementary information table s1 the results show the rh2 values of downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature are higher than others thus downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature are considered in eq 3 in this study the dds algorithm is used to calibrate the coefficients in eq 3 because dds shows very good performance compared with others tolson et al 2008a b 2009 r2 is used as the objective function in calibrations with an evaluation number of the objective function values up to 10 000 the calibrations were repeated 10 times and 10 random seeds were used the higher the r2 values the better the calibration the coefficient values with the best r2 value are selected because three environmental resources are selected to simulate lai n in eq 3 equals three and therefore five parameters in eq 3 need to be calibrated the lower and upper bounds of the five parameters are included in supplementary information section s1 and supplementary information table s2 the modis lai data from 2000 to 2005 are used in the calibrations and data from 2006 to 2010 are used in validations the equations to simulate lai after calibrations are shown in eqs 19 21 19 lai broad needle leaf trees 7 5454 1 exp 30 4909 1 5995 10 5 r lw 7 1938 10 3 rh 9 7239 10 2 t air 20 lai short vegetation c4 grassland 8 1445 1 exp 29 99 2 9988 10 5 r lw 6 4994 10 3 r h 9 7443 10 2 t air 21 lai agriculture c 3 grassland 7 1615 1 exp 30 4929 1 3997 10 5 r lw 8 6683 10 3 rh 9 6078 10 2 t air where r lw represents downward long wave radiation rh represents relative humidity t air represents air temperature on the basis of eqs 19 21 it can be seen that t air is the main constrains of lai increase t air has higher coefficient values than rh and r lw the results are consistent with previous studies for example nemani et al 2003 and yao et al 2018 also identified temperature as the main limit of vegetation growth in the study region of this paper therefore the approach used in calculating coefficient values is acceptable and the calibrated parameter values are appropriate 4 2 validations of vegetation dynamic simulation fig 7 shows the nse and rb values they represent the differences between simulated lai and modis 8 day lai the nse values are above 0 67 0 84 and 0 92 on daily monthly and mean monthly scales respectively the absolute values of rb are less than 14 therefore the simulated lai values replicate modis lai well comparison between simulated lai and modis lai in time series plots are shown in supplementary information figs s1 and s2 in addition to lai fpar data is also needed in v web dhm the fpar calculation procedures can be found in supplementary information section s2 fig 8 shows spatial distribution comparison of mean monthly lai and fpar for major growing seasons from april to october fig s8 shows multi year mean monthly differences lai and fpar have the largest values in july and august for the modis data similarly simulated lai and fpar also show higher values in july and august regarding spatial distributions simulated lai and fpar values can replicate observed distributions of modis data larger values in northern mountainous regions and smaller in southern plains in a few high low elevations fig s8 the differences between modis and simulated data become higher these uncertainties may result from input data uncertainty of v web dhm such as homogeneous lapse rate of temperatures 6 5 k km and downward long wave radiation of gldas in addition the calibrated coefficients of lai and fpar simulation equations may contribute to the uncertainty overall the simulations agree well with modis observations 4 3 validations of water and energy flux simulations fig 9 a c and e show simulated runoff results using modis lai and fpar observed relative humidity and gldas downward long wave radiation on a daily scale simulated runoff using observed data agrees well with observed runoff the overall nse and rb are 0 68 and 9 the nse and rb values are up to 0 88 and 9 on a monthly scale fig 9c similarly simulation shows very good performance on a multi year mean monthly scale with nse values being 0 89 fig 9e fig 9b d and f show simulated runoff using simulated lai fpar relative humidity and downward long wave radiation on a daily scale the simulated runoff replicates observed values well with nse and rb being 0 69 and 11 respectively fig 9b on monthly and multi year mean monthly scales the nse values are up to 0 85 fig 9d and f the nse values of v web dhm simulations on daily and monthly scales are a little better than web dhm simulations which may be because web dhm uses 8 day modis data and v web dhm uses simulated daily scale lai and fpar data overall these results indicate that v web dhm can effectively simulate hydrological processes in the biliu river basin fig 10 shows temporal variations and spatial distributions of fluxes simulated by web dhm and v web dhm and fig s9 in the supplementary information shows multi year mean differences results of v web dhm minus results of web dhm average values for four time periods are shown four flux data are compared including land surface temperatures fig 10a and c et fig 10b and d surface soil wetness fig 10e and g and root zone wetness fig 10f and h temporal variations and spatial distributions of lsts agree well similarly temporal variations and spatial distributions of et surface zone wetness and root zone wetness also agree well overall but with exceptions in several high low elevations fig s9 here these exceptions may also be due to uncertainties in input data and calibrated coefficients of lai and fpar simulation equations overall the simulations of web dhm and v web dhm agree relatively well 4 4 impact quantification after evaluations with observed runoff water fluxes energy fluxes modis lsts lai and fpar v web dhm demonstrates its good performance in representing water energy and vegetation dynamic processes in the biliu river basin thus v web dhm is used in this section to investigate the respective and combination impacts of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes on water resources it should be noted that the quantified impacts here do not necessarily represent the model errors but represent the variations of hydrological variables and land surface fluxes from present model simulations based on observed data fig 11 shows mean monthly contributions of co2 concentration changes temperature variations and leaf area changes to the variations of basin average variables the bandwidth represents overall variations generated from the 4 6 2 scenarios shown in fig 5 it can be seen that changes in co2 concentration temperature and leaf area have considerable influences on simulated variables generating large bandwidth for canopy transpiration in july leaf area changes have larger impacts than in other months account for 41 31 and the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes account for 37 14 are lower than influence of leaf area changes in may june and august the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes have larger impacts than others the temperature in july is higher than other months which may result in leaf area changes have higher impact on canopy transpiration than the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes the influence of temperature changes on canopy transpiration is larger in may june july and august than other months this may be because temperature provides essential conditions to keep the enzyme working when chlorophyll is increasing in these months in september and october the chlorophyll in leaves is reducing and therefore the influence of temperature changes decreases in the beginning of the growing season april lai is smaller compared with other months as shown in fig 8 and therefore the effects of the co2 concentration and temperature changes are smaller than other months whereas it may be due to decrease in chlorophyll in september and october the higher influence of leaf area changes than co2 concentration and temperature changes in april and september may result from higher lai compared with the as normal scenario moreover it can be seen that the combinations of increasing co2 concentration global warming and leaf area changes have little influence on runoff soil wetness stomatal conductance and net primary productivity regarding the average influence from april to october on canopy transpiration the sum of the average influences of leaf area changes and temperature variations is 59 27 which is more than 1 6 times higher than the average influence of co2 36 97 similar to the canopy transpiration the sum of the average influences of leaf area and temperature variations is higher than co2 for surface zone wetness root zone wetness and net primary productivity of c4 plants for other variables the leaf area changes and increasing co2 concentration have considerable influence implying that it is necessary to consider changes in co2 concentration and leaf area in hydrological simulation under climate change fig 12 a and b shows simulated runoff of the dynamic vegetation scenario fig 12 c shows mean monthly contributions of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes to runoff variations fig 12 a shows runoff is decreasing overall which may result from increasing et fig 12 b shows the influence on runoff in august the runoff is increasing with increasing co2 concentration and decreasing with increasing temperature this is because the increased et caused by temperature rises is higher than decreased et caused by increasing co2 concentration and therefore et is increasing overall fig 12 c shows leaf area changes are the dominator of runoff changes in august which may be because the total influence of leaf area variations on et surface zone wetness and root zone wetness are higher than influences of co2 concentration and temperature changes as shown in table 1 in fig 11 leaf area changes have the largest impacts on canopy transpiration and et in july this difference between figs 11 and 12 c may be because leaf area changes have higher impact on surface zone wetness in august than in july as shown in fig 11 surface zone wetness represents water storage in soil and therefore its changes can lead to runoff variations fig 12 shows the combinations have little influence on the runoff variations which is similar to fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies sawada et al 2014 integrated a vegetation module into web dhm and used it in drought analysis however the impacts of elevated co2 concentration rising temperature and vegetation dynamics on water resources were not quantified in the study by sawada et al 2014 in our study the individual and combination impacts of them are explicitly quantified using a framework integrating v web dhm and anova it is necessary to quantify their relative influences because it can provide very useful information on main influential factors and therefore measures can be taken to avoid negative influence by controlling the main factors at the same time the quantification can also provide insight into the importance of considering some influential factors in hydrological simulation and drought analysis under climate change such as vegetation dynamics which are frequently neglected in basin scale hydrological model simulations previous studies have investigated the influences of temperature co2 concentration and or vegetation changes on runoff labat et al 2004 gedney et al 2006 leipprand and gerten 2006 piao et al 2007 gerten et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 tao et al 2014 tesemma et al 2015 however few studies have been carried out to quantify the relative influences of them and their combination influences on a river basin scale this could be because there is a lack of a comprehensive framework that can simulate and quantify vegetation dynamics photosynthesis conductance changes biosphere hydrological processes and relative influences of them on a river basin scale however in this paper a distributed biosphere hydrological model with a dynamic vegetation module is developed and a comprehensive framework combining the developed model and a sensitivity analysis approach is proposed this framework facilitates the simulation and quantification of the individual and combination effects on a river basin scale using the framework we found the sum of the influences of leaf area and temperature changes on canopy transpiration is more than 1 6 times higher than influence of co2 concentration changes in main growing seasons this result implies transpired water with global warming and lai variations could be more than conserved water due to suppressed transpiration by elevated co2 concentration few studies have reported similar results in this region gedney et al 2006 found the individual effects of climate aerosol concentration co2 concentration and land use type changes on runoff can be combined linearly to represent their total influence which implies their combination influence is little lemordant et al 2018 found radiative and physiological effects of co2 concentration changes on evaporative fraction can be combined linearly different from the studies by gedney et al 2006 in which lai changes were not explicitly considered and lemordant et al 2018 our study found the combination influence of temperature co2 concentration and leaf area changes is little compared with their individual effects which has rarely been explicitly and quantitatively reported according to the best of the authors knowledge this finding could provide useful information to the current limited pool of knowledge regarding the influence of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation changes on water resources on a river basin scale we found increasing co2 concentration can increase runoff and increasing temperature decreases runoff in the studied region this founding is different from the research by piao et al 2007 in which it is found increasing co2 concentration can reduce runoff when considering co2 fertilization effects the difference may be because the study by piao et al 2007 utilized globally average runoff and co2 fertilization effects are not significant in our study implying that co2 effects are different in different regions lemordant et al 2016 suggested that elevated co2 concentration could increase soil moisture and betts et al 2007 suggested that increased soil moisture could increase runoff dai 2013 suggested increasing temperature can increase drought severity swann et al 2016 suggested that increasing temperature reduces water resources availability and the severity of drought is reduced when considering the influence of elevated co2 concentration these studies appear to support our results nevertheless our study was carried out in an important medium sized river basin which is challenging for the approaches used in the previous studies because of the coarse resolutions of earth system models esm and global circulation models they used jasechko et al 2013 showed transpiration from vegetation is the largest water flux on earth s continents and accounts for 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration lemordant et al 2018 found water resources availability will be strongly modified by vegetation physiological effects in response to elevated co2 concentration and influence of precipitation changes on drought is lower than previous expectation lian et al 2018 found that the vegetation responses to climate change is more important to water resources availability projections than previously thought most basin scale hydrological models currently do not consider transpiration in vegetation leaf therefore water resources availability projections could be problematic when using them in our study we considered the influence of vegetation changes on runoff by developing the vegetation simulation module and found leaf area changes have the largest influence on runoff as shown in fig 12c our results are consistent with the previous studies nevertheless we also show the differences of the leaf area changes influences in different months which are not investigated in the previous studies 5 2 comments on the developed framework lai variations depend on availability of environmental resources and influence of resources is different in various regions jolly et al 2005 orlandi et al 2013 hwang et al 2014 reich et al 2014 wang erlandsson et al 2014 for example donohue et al 2013 suggested that water could be a main resource influencing vegetation growth in warm and arid regions yang et al 2016 suggested that radiation and nutrients are main resources influencing vegetation growth in warm and humid regions yao et al 2018 studied climate influence on gross primary productivity variations in china and also identified temperature as a main influential factor in the study region in our paper which seems to support our study as shown in eqs 1 and 2 rh can influence canopy conductance and transpiration which are related to vegetation growth and therefore rh is considered in lai simulations in eqs 19 21 hesketh and warrington 1989 also suggested that humidity could influence seedling emergence and leaf area expansion and therefore can influence lai moreover the study region has a temperate monsoon marine climate and growing seasons are mainly controlled by temperature nemani et al 2003 thus the three climatic variables chosen in this study are acceptable for lai simulation there are several approaches that simulate lai based on daily scale hydro climatic data for example growing degree days approaches simulate lai based on daily temperatures miller et al 2001 koetz et al 2005 setiyono et al 2008 cao et al 2015 growing season index gsl approaches utilize daily scale photoperiod vapor pressure and minimum temperatures to model lai jolly et al 2005 savoy and mackay 2015 a variant of the gsl approach implements day length daily scale minimum temperatures and soil moisture wang erlandsson et al 2014 in these prior studies the hydro climatic variables used have similar monthly fluctuations with lai therefore it is acceptable to simulate lai based on climatic variables that have similar monthly variations as lai lai dynamics can be modelled using a few methods for example approaches on the basis of exponential distributions considering temperature relative humidity etc cao et al 2015 tesemma et al 2015 approaches allocating carbon resources to leaves stems and roots cox 2001 sitch et al 2003 clark et al 2011 the overall objective of this research is to simulate changes in river runoff although an exponential function is used in this study to estimate lai without explicitly considering carbon allocations the runoff simulation results are acceptable recall the results in fig 9 in addition validations using modis lai shows the simulated lai replicates observation well recall the results in the section 4 2 therefore the lai simulation approach in this study is acceptable regarding co2 influence on lai eq 3 is a general form and can consider co2 impacts on lai however fertilization effects of co2 are changing in different regions and studies have shown the fertilization effects may not exist in some regions e g yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 duursma et al 2016 in our case study region there are two reasons that we do not consider the fertilization effects i fertilization effects of co2 are not considerable in our study region as shown in a quantitative research by zhu et al 2016 ii the study by nemani et al 2003 and yao et al 2018 revealed temperature is a main driver of vegetation variations in our study region when studies are carried out in regions with co2 fertilization there are two approaches to incorporate co2 fertilization into eq 3 i considering co2 as an influential factor in the denominator of eq 3 ii considering co2 influence on laimax in the numerator of eq 3 as pointed out by donohue et al 2013 that co2 fertilization effects could influence maximum vegetation coverage because co2 fertilization effects on lai are still at the forefront of research more studies are encouraged in the future to incorporate this influence into eq 3 the overall objective of this study is to investigate changes in water resources the lai simulation approach was calibrated using modis lai from 2000 to 2005 and validated from 2006 to 2010 based on modis lai both the calibration and validation results show acceptable performance with nse and absolute values of rb being over 0 73 and less than 14 recall the results in fig 7 in addition the validations using observed runoff show the model can simulate runoff well using simulated lai therefore it is assumed that the model is appropriate to predict changes in runoff similar assumption has also been utilized in previous studies e g miller et al 2001 koetz et al 2005 setiyono et al 2008 cao et al 2015 su et al 2015 tesemma et al 2015 in this study r2 is utilized to represent differences between simulated lai and modis lai the higher the r2 values the better the calibrated parameters therefore the calibration is to maximize r2 although only r2 is used the calibrated parameters show good performance in replicating modis lai the limited length of meteorological data used 2000 2010 may influence the analysis in this study however the v web dhm model is applicable even when study data changes although empirical functions are established to estimate fpar from lai in this study other approaches simulating fpar based on lai are applicable as well for example the beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 bondeau et al 2007 in our study region human abstracts water mainly from the biliu reservoir which could not influence the reservoir inflow therefore influence of human water abstractions was not considered 5 3 limitations in this study possible changes in vegetation height and diameter were not considered water vapour in the atmosphere may change when vegetation varies which may increase cloud and then may raise solar radiation reflection by cloud these changes were not considered other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide were not considered with changes in temperature and co2 concentration plant rooting depth may increase which allows plant to access soil moisture at deeper layers especially during dry spells in this study we used prescribed rooting depth in sib2 and therefore the changes in rooting depth when co2 and temperature changes were not considered as interactions between eco2 climate water cycle and rooting depth are still at the forefront of research as shown in a recent debate between fan et al 2017 and pierret and lacombe 2018 more studies are encouraged in the future to consider the influence of rooting depth other influential factors were not considered such as vapour pressure willett et al 2008 fatichi et al 2015 wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 schymanski and or 2016 and net radiation changes i e dimming and brightening wild et al 2005 mercado et al 2009 wild 2009 vegetation influences on co2 concentration global warming and precipitation were not considered to consider these effects more complex esms should be used which is very difficult at present in a medium sized river basin because of coarse resolutions of esms without considering these effects the total variance may be underestimated future research is encouraged when fine resolution esm data is available in this study it is assumed that precipitation is enough to sustain vegetation growth in different co2 concentration and temperature rise scenarios because the objective of this research is to quantify the influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on water resources precipitation may change under the different scenarios and the changes were not considered in this study future studies are encouraged to consider precipitation changes using fine resolution precipitation simulation of esms air temperature lapse rates may vary within a year and also relate to vapour pressure and wind speed mcvicar et al 2007 a lapse rate of 6 5 k km was used in this study which may contribute to the uncertainty in simulated results future research is encouraged to utilize more sophisticated data when detailed lapse rates are available 6 conclusions increasing co2 concentration global warming and vegetation changes have profound influence on regional water resources however quantitative assessments of their respective and combination influences on river basin scales remain few especially in northeast china a better understanding of the complex influence can help develop measures to ameliorate regional water resources challenges this study presents an important progress in quantifying the influences of the three key driving forces of water resource changes the major contributions are summarized as follows based on this study first a dynamic vegetation simulation approach is developed and incorporated into web dhm therefore the influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations vegetation changes and their combinations on water resources can be simulated second a comprehensive framework is proposed by integrating v web dhm and a variance based sensitivity analysis approach this new framework enables quantification of the influences of changes in co2 concentration temperature vegetation and their combinations using values between zero and one revealing the relative importance of them third we find sum of the influences of lai and temperature variations on canopy transpiration is larger than physiological effects of co2 this finding implies transpired water could be more than conserved water with elevated co2 concentration global warming and leaf area changes therefore considering changes in temperature and lai are of importance in projections of future water resources fourth we also find lai dynamics play a dominate role in runoff decreases in hot summer this result implies that water resources availability could be overestimated in summer if lai changes are neglected therefore severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if lai changes are not taken into considerations in the future the proposed approaches could be applied in other sizes types of studies e g all china to investigate influences of

6723,with concerns about future catastrophic disasters elevated co2 concentration eco2 global warming and vegetation changes have received much attention globally in recent years studies have suggested controlling climate change should be based on regional impacts however regional quantitative assessments of respective and combination influences of co2 temperature and vegetation variations on water resources remain limited to address this issue a comprehensive framework is developed this framework integrates a dynamic vegetation simulation approach a biosphere hydrological model and a variance based sensitivity analysis approach which enables identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations a medium sized river basin in northeast china is used to illustrate the application based on different co2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions validation using modis products shows the proposed approach can simulate leaf area index lai changes well results show sum of the influences of lai and temperature variations on transpiration are more than 1 6 times higher than physiological effects of eco2 in growing seasons which implies more water could be transpired than conserved with eco2 global warming and lai changes results also show runoff increases with eco2 and decreases with increasing temperatures but lai changes play a dominate role in runoff decrease in hot summer therefore considering lai changes is of utmost importance in projections of future water resources and severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if lai changes are neglected this research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of eco2 global warming and lai changes on regional water security and sustainability keywords co2 warming vegetation changes runoff water resources 1 introduction it has been reported that global average temperature is rising with elevated co2 concentration hansen et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 with co2 concentration and temperature variations global vegetation changes have also been reported in some regions piao et al 2007 hansen et al 2013 zhu et al 2016 these changes have caused worries that they could result in catastrophic disasters for example severe droughts and water scarcity seager et al 2007 dai 2013 fischer et al 2013 jaeger et al 2014 hu et al 2015 irvine et al 2017 baker et al 2018 to ameliorate the negative influences of the changes in co2 concentration temperature and vegetation seneviratne et al 2016 suggested that co2 emissions should be limited based on regional climate change impacts because regional impacts are more directly related to individual interests and global average temperature targets may fail to represent the urgency of controlling climate change similarly many recent studies also suggested that climate change limitation should be based on its impacts on regional scales e g matthews et al 2017 seneviratne et al 2018 greve et al 2018 therefore regional studies of the influences of elevated co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation dynamics on water resources are imperative and essential temperature co2 and vegetation changes could influence water cycle in a very complex way increasing co2 concentration could warm the earth and variations in co2 concentration and or temperature then may lead to changes in vegetation at the leaf level higher co2 concentration may lead to decrease in leaf stomatal conductance and therefore reduce transpiration rate field et al 1995 skinner et al 2018 at the canopy level co2 may increase leaf area index lai piao et al 2007 donohue et al 2013 2017 zhu et al 2016 and boost canopy transpiration and vegetation water use in soil pu and dickinson 2012 swann et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 trancoso et al 2017 many studies have investigated the impacts of co2 concentration temperature and or vegetation changes on water resources on global or continental scales e g labat et al 2004 gedney et al 2006 betts et al 2007 piao et al 2007 concluded mean climate and its variability contribute to global runoff increase gerten et al 2008 confirmed the research by piao et al 2007 and suggested that quantifying relative contributions of each individual contributors such as co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes to runoff variations are important and need to be carried out many recent studies have endeavoured to quantify the influences of co2 concentration temperature and or vegetation changes on a river basin scale for example the studies by cheng et al 2014 in australia tao et al 2014 in the mississippi river basin and tesemma et al 2015 in the murray darling river basin nevertheless these studies on river basins did not separate the relative and combination influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on water resources variations consequently studies that quantify the respective and combination influences remain limited on river basin scales to quantify the influences on river basin scales a comprehensive model is required in which vegetation changes photosynthesis conductance variations and biosphere hydrological processes can be simulated simultaneously sensitivity analysis is a useful approach to attribute changes to various influential factors wilby and harris 2006 steinschneider et al 2012 wu et al 2012a b bosshard et al 2013 in recent years several studies have been carried out to investigate impacts of individual influential factors and their combinations on model simulation results based on advanced sensitivity analysis approaches for example qi et al 2016a investigated impacts of precipitation data and hydrological models on runoff simulation uncertainty qi et al 2016c studied impacts of probability distribution functions distribution function parameters and flood data on design flood selections in these studies an advanced variance based sensitivity analysis approach anova bosshard et al 2013 was used because it allows for identification of predominant influential factors including their combinations and provides a more complete understanding of the influential factors in a modelling chain the overall objective of this study is to develop a comprehensive framework to quantify the respective and combination influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation changes on water resources on a river basin scale for this objective a regional dynamic vegetation simulation approach is developed and incorporated into the web dhm model v web dhm first and then the comprehensive framework is proposed by integrating v web dhm and anova described in section 2 to illustrate the application of the developed framework a medium sized river basin in northeast china is used introduced in section 3 and the water resources variations on a multi year mean monthly scale are investigated based on simulated vegetation changes and different co2 concentration and temperature rise assumptions presented in section 4 in this illustrative application the vegetation dynamics changes will refer to lai changes and co2 influences will refer to the physiological effects of co2 concentration hereafter this research is useful in gaining insights into the complicated impacts of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes on regional water resources and therefore on regional water security and water sustainability provided in sections 5 and 6 2 the methods the developed framework includes three components i set up climate change scenarios e g co2 concentration and temperature ii under these climate conditions calculate vegetation changes and simulate land surface fluxes and hydrological variables using v web dhm and iii quantify the individual and combination influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on simulated results using anova fig 1 shows the diagrammatic representation of the developed framework the details are introduced in the following sub sections 2 1 structure of v web dhm fig 2 shows overall structure of v web dhm fig 2 a d represents the structure of web dhm fig 2 e shows vegetation dynamics which are results of many environmental resources such as precipitation solar radiation temperature co2 humidity and wind speed in fig 2 d canopy conductance g c is simulated by combining a leaf stomatal conductance model developed by ball 1988 and a photosynthesis model developed by collatz et al 1991 1992 i e the ball berry model 1 g c m a c c s r h p b lai where m and b are coefficients sellers et al 1996a rh represents relative humidity c s represents co2 partial pressure pa p represents atmospheric pressure pa a c represents a canopy photosynthetic rate the photosynthetic rate is calculated as the minimum of three limiting rates for c3 species they are efficiency of photosynthetic enzyme system incident radiation absorbed by green canopy and the capacity of leaf to utilize or export the products of photosynthesis for c4 species they are rubisco limitation light limitation and pep carboxylase limitation collatz et al 1992 sellers et al 1996a the canopy conductance rate is then used to estimate canopy transpiration rate e ct 2 e ct e t c e a 1 g c 2 r b ρ c p γ 1 w c where e t c represents saturated vapour pressure pa when canopy temperatures equal t c e a represents vapour pressure pa ρ and c p are density and specific heat of air γ represents the psychrometric constant w c represents canopy wetted area based on eqs 1 and 2 it can be seen that the canopy transpiration and stomatal conductance are influenced by many environmental variables such as lai co2 concentration relative humidity and temperature more details about the calculations of g c and e ct can be found in the research by sellers et al 1996a land use types are defined based on biomes and are the same to the classifications in the simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 randall et al 1996 sellers et al 1996b the different responses of biomes to co2 concentration changes are represented by biome dependent parameters through lookup tables the lookup tables used in this study are the same to the studies by sellers et al 1996b and randall et al 1996 more detailed descriptions about web dhm can be found in the studies by wang et al 2009 qi et al 2015 2018a 2 2 lai simulation approach lai refers to one sided leaf areas per unit ground lai represents mass accumulation in plant leaves and is a result of vegetation growth influenced by availability of water light temperature co2 and humidity etc yang et al 2016 donohue et al 2017 lai can be simulated based on these environmental resources for example jamieson et al 1998 developed an approach to simulate lai based on an exponential function and temperature similarly koetz et al 2005 and setiyono et al 2008 developed approaches based on an exponential function and temperature as well in addition cao et al 2015 and su et al 2015 proposed a lai simulation approach based on an exponential distribution using accumulated growing degree days tesemma et al 2015 developed a method based on precipitation potential evapotranspiration and an exponential function in these prior studies temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration were considered to simulate lai however lai has different responses to climate in different regions zhu et al 2016 thus it is necessary to develop a simple and general approach to simulate lai dynamics different from previous research in this study a lai simulation approach is developed based on sib2 biome types and corresponding biome dependent morphological properties in sib2 lookup tables please refer to the study by randall et al 1996 for the biome types on a global scale in this new approach all environmental resources i e precipitation temperature solar radiation long wave radiation humidity co2 etc that strongly related to lai variations can be taken into consideration the developed lai simulation approach is as below 3 lai x n 2 lai max 1 exp x n 1 x 1 v 1 x 2 v 2 x n 1 v n 1 x n v n where lai represents simulated values laimax represents the maximum lai values of each sib2 vegetation type and is obtained from sib2 database v 1 v 2 v n 1 v n represent environmental variables influencing vegetation growth such as precipitation temperature light co2 and humidity x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n represent influences of each environmental resource on lai x n 1 represents the states without environmental resource influence x n 2 represents changes of local maximum lai values relative to the maximum lai values in sib2 database exp represents an exponential function in practical application x 1 x 2 x n 1 x n x n 1 x n 2 should be quantified based on experience experiments and or calibrations in the last few decades the quick development of remote sensing techniques provides a great number of datasets about vegetation dynamics which enable very detailed reliable and quantitative analyses of spatial and temporal variations of lai thus the parameters in eq 3 can be derived from these remote sensing data sets one approach is to calibrate with an objective function using auto calibration algorithms such as the dynamically dimensioned search dds algorithm tolson and shoemaker 2007 the shuffled complex evolution approach duan et al 1993 qi et al 2016b and the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii deb and gupta 2006 qi et al 2018c 2 3 anova ensemble simulation results can be obtained using v web dhm with different co2 concentration air temperature rises and vegetation conditions as inputs total ensemble width m is the variance of simulated land surface and hydrological variables to relate m to influential sources the superscripts j k and l in m j k l are used to represent temperature scenario j co2 concentration scenario k and vegetation scenario l anova can underestimate variance when a small sample size is utilized bosshard et al 2013 to reduce the bias effects on variance contribution quantification a subsampling method proposed by bosshard et al 2013 is used in this study this subsampling method randomly selects two samples from the largest sample set assume to be h without replacement and generates a new sample set to be used for anova with this subsampling the superscript j in m j k l is replaced with g h i which is a 2 c 2 h matrix as follows 4 g 1 2 1 3 1 h 2 3 2 4 h 3 h 2 h 3 h 1 h 3 h h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 h total sum of squares sst can be divided into sums of squares of individual and combination effects 5 sst ssa ssb ssc ssi where ssa represents influence of co2 concentration changes ssb represents influence of temperature changes ssc represents influence of vegetation changes ssi represents influence of their combinations the terms can be estimated as follows ssi is computed as the residual bosshard et al 2013 6 sst i h 1 h k 1 k l 1 l m g h i k l m g i 2 7 ssa i k l h 1 h m g h i m g i 2 8 ssb i h l k 1 k m g i k m g i 2 9 ssc i h k l 1 l m g i l m g i 2 10 ssi i h 1 h k 1 k l 1 l m g h i k l m g h i m g i k m g i l 2 m g i 2 where symbol indicates average values over a particular index h k and l are scenario sampling numbers of air temperature co2 concentration and vegetation conditions the individual influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes and their combination influence can be calculated as follows 11 η temperature 2 1 i i 1 i ssa i sst i 12 η co 2 2 1 i i 1 i ssb i sst i 13 η vegetation 2 1 i i 1 i ssc i sst i 14 η combination 2 1 i i 1 i ssi i sst i where η temperature 2 η co 2 2 η vegetation 2 and η combination 2 have values between 0 and 1 and represent the relative influences of changes of temperature co2 concentration vegetation and their combinations the higher the values the larger the influences as shown in eqs 11 14 the subsampling approach is necessary because it guarantees that every influential factor has the same denominator i which ensures inter comparisons among the influences are not affected by their different sampling numbers the influence quantification using anova takes all sources together and does not repeat anova for each influential factor the combination effect represents influence from simultaneous variations of all the three factors and reflects the influence of nonlinearity or interactions in addition observed runoff values or simulated variables using observed data are used to calculate the variance see bosshard et al 2013 in which the used anova approach is developed therefore differences in the mean values of the three groups have no influence on the contribution quantification bosshard et al 2013 3 study region data materials and criteria for evaluation 3 1 the biliu river basin as one of the most populated areas in china northeast china plays an important role in food production for supporting the livelihood of the population this region frequently suffers from droughts which pose a threat to regional sustainable development thus this study is conducted in a river basin the biliu river basin 2814 km2 fig 3 in northeast china in addition the biliu river basin plays a very important role in water supply to nearby big cities such as the dalian city which has a population of 6 69 million and the cities suffered from serious water shortages in recent years the dalian city government invested 660 million to tackle the water resources problem since 2008 therefore studies in the biliu river basin on the water resources under climate change are both economically environmentally and socially important 3 2 observation based data the data used in this study were collected from eleven rain gauges one hydrology station and three meteorological gauges from march 2000 to december 2010 other data are also utilized including digital elevation model dem rabus et al 2003 fig 4 a usgs landuse types sellers et al 1996a fig 4b mod15a2 one km eight day lai and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation fpar products myneni et al 1997 there are six landuse types with broadleaf and needleleaf trees short vegetation c4 grassland and agriculture c3 grassland being the main types fig 4b hourly precipitation data are obtained by downscaling daily observations using a stochastic method wang et al 2011 hourly air temperatures are calculated using daily maximum and minimum temperatures based on the temp model parton and logan 1981 the estimated temperatures are further evaluated using daily average temperatures in addition a lapse rate of 6 5 k km is used to consider elevation differences between model cells and meteorological gauges downward solar radiation data are estimated from sunshine duration temperatures and humidity using a hybrid model yang et al 2006 downward long wave radiation is from the global land data assimilation systems gldas because there is no observation air pressure data are estimated according to elevation yang et al 2006 this study region is the same as in the study by qi et al 2015 and more detailed descriptions about the data used their processing and model parameter calibrations including calibration approaches and calibrated values can be found in the study by qi et al 2015 3 3 scenario datasets fig 5 shows scenario settings for influence quantifications combinations of the co2 concentration scenarios temperature rise scenarios and vegetation scenarios four co2 concentration scenarios and six temperature rise scenarios are included considering the computational burden of v web dhm two hours to finish one year simulation in a personal computer with four inter core i7 6700 3 40 ghz processors the as normal vegetation scenario means the modis lai and fpar data are used and therefore the influences of leaf area changes when temperature and co2 concentration increase are not considered the dynamic vegetation scenario means simulated lai and fpar under the assumed temperature and co2 concentration scenarios are utilized and therefore the impacts of leaf area changes are considered stern 2006 suggested that there are chances that global average temperature rise reaches 2 k when co2 concentration is 550 ppm and that the temperature rise depends on general circulation models hansen et al 2012 found that global temperature changes unevenly there are some regions warming slower than the global average temperature rise many studies show future temperature rise under certain co2 concentration is uncertain because of large uncertainty of general circulation models fischer et al 2013 kharin et al 2013 chiyuan et al 2014 shiogama et al 2016 in addition many studies have suggested that solar radiation management approaches could effectively reflect sunlight back to space therefore temperature variations could be subjectively controlled under certain co2 concentration pongratz et al 2012 curry et al 2014 crook et al 2015 thus in this study quantifying influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes are based on an assumption that different temperature rise values could happen under certain co2 concentration these scenario settings are similar to the hypothetical sensitivity scenario methods used in previous studies e g rehana and mujumdar 2011 wu et al 2012a b walling et al 2017 although the assumptions may be subjective it enables to explore various potential consequences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes and therefore can provide an enhanced understanding of their impacts on water resources in addition it is assumed that temperatures in every month rise the same values therefore differences in temperature rises in every month are not considered similar assumptions have been implemented in previous research ramirez and finnerty 1996 streck 2005 arias et al 2014 on the basis of the above scenario settings the parameters of anova can be obtained for example h k and l in eqs 6 10 equals six four and two respectively g in eq 4 is a 2 c 2 6 2 15 matrix i in eqs 11 14 equals 15 3 4 assessment criteria for simulation four evaluation criteria were used for uncertainty assessment spearman s rank coefficient of determination rh2 pearson s linear coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and relative bias rb 15 rh 2 1 6 d i 2 n n 2 1 2 d i r a n k x oi r a n k x si 16 r 2 i 1 n x oi x o x si x s 2 i 1 n x oi x o 2 i 1 n x si x s 2 17 nse 1 i 1 n x si x oi 2 i 1 n x oi x o 2 18 rb i 1 n x si i 1 n x oi i 1 n x oi 100 where xoi represents observation or simulation using observed data x o represents average of observation or simulation using observed data xsi represents simulation x s represents average of simulation i represents time n represents the total number of data points a perfect fit should have rh2 r2 and nse values of one the lower the rb values the higher the accuracy these criteria have commonly been used e g ebert et al 2007 wang et al 2011 qi et al 2016d 2018b and therefore they were used in this study 4 results 4 1 vegetation dynamic simulation fig 6 shows scatter plots of basin average modis lai and climatic variables including downward shortwave radiation downward long wave radiation relative humidity air temperature and rainfall because the three sib2 vegetation types i e broadleaf and needleleaf trees short vegetation c4 grassland and agriculture c3 grassland account for over 98 of the biliu river basin plots for these three vegetation types are shown because local observed co2 concentration is not available global monthly average values were used it can be seen that downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature show strong relationships with lai variations whereas shortwave radiation rainfall and co2 spread out in the scatter plots because the relationships between lai and climatic variables are non linear the correlations are analyzed using the spearman s rank coefficient of determination which assesses how well the relationships can be described using monotonic functions rh2 values are shown in supplementary information table s1 the results show the rh2 values of downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature are higher than others thus downward long wave radiation relative humidity and air temperature are considered in eq 3 in this study the dds algorithm is used to calibrate the coefficients in eq 3 because dds shows very good performance compared with others tolson et al 2008a b 2009 r2 is used as the objective function in calibrations with an evaluation number of the objective function values up to 10 000 the calibrations were repeated 10 times and 10 random seeds were used the higher the r2 values the better the calibration the coefficient values with the best r2 value are selected because three environmental resources are selected to simulate lai n in eq 3 equals three and therefore five parameters in eq 3 need to be calibrated the lower and upper bounds of the five parameters are included in supplementary information section s1 and supplementary information table s2 the modis lai data from 2000 to 2005 are used in the calibrations and data from 2006 to 2010 are used in validations the equations to simulate lai after calibrations are shown in eqs 19 21 19 lai broad needle leaf trees 7 5454 1 exp 30 4909 1 5995 10 5 r lw 7 1938 10 3 rh 9 7239 10 2 t air 20 lai short vegetation c4 grassland 8 1445 1 exp 29 99 2 9988 10 5 r lw 6 4994 10 3 r h 9 7443 10 2 t air 21 lai agriculture c 3 grassland 7 1615 1 exp 30 4929 1 3997 10 5 r lw 8 6683 10 3 rh 9 6078 10 2 t air where r lw represents downward long wave radiation rh represents relative humidity t air represents air temperature on the basis of eqs 19 21 it can be seen that t air is the main constrains of lai increase t air has higher coefficient values than rh and r lw the results are consistent with previous studies for example nemani et al 2003 and yao et al 2018 also identified temperature as the main limit of vegetation growth in the study region of this paper therefore the approach used in calculating coefficient values is acceptable and the calibrated parameter values are appropriate 4 2 validations of vegetation dynamic simulation fig 7 shows the nse and rb values they represent the differences between simulated lai and modis 8 day lai the nse values are above 0 67 0 84 and 0 92 on daily monthly and mean monthly scales respectively the absolute values of rb are less than 14 therefore the simulated lai values replicate modis lai well comparison between simulated lai and modis lai in time series plots are shown in supplementary information figs s1 and s2 in addition to lai fpar data is also needed in v web dhm the fpar calculation procedures can be found in supplementary information section s2 fig 8 shows spatial distribution comparison of mean monthly lai and fpar for major growing seasons from april to october fig s8 shows multi year mean monthly differences lai and fpar have the largest values in july and august for the modis data similarly simulated lai and fpar also show higher values in july and august regarding spatial distributions simulated lai and fpar values can replicate observed distributions of modis data larger values in northern mountainous regions and smaller in southern plains in a few high low elevations fig s8 the differences between modis and simulated data become higher these uncertainties may result from input data uncertainty of v web dhm such as homogeneous lapse rate of temperatures 6 5 k km and downward long wave radiation of gldas in addition the calibrated coefficients of lai and fpar simulation equations may contribute to the uncertainty overall the simulations agree well with modis observations 4 3 validations of water and energy flux simulations fig 9 a c and e show simulated runoff results using modis lai and fpar observed relative humidity and gldas downward long wave radiation on a daily scale simulated runoff using observed data agrees well with observed runoff the overall nse and rb are 0 68 and 9 the nse and rb values are up to 0 88 and 9 on a monthly scale fig 9c similarly simulation shows very good performance on a multi year mean monthly scale with nse values being 0 89 fig 9e fig 9b d and f show simulated runoff using simulated lai fpar relative humidity and downward long wave radiation on a daily scale the simulated runoff replicates observed values well with nse and rb being 0 69 and 11 respectively fig 9b on monthly and multi year mean monthly scales the nse values are up to 0 85 fig 9d and f the nse values of v web dhm simulations on daily and monthly scales are a little better than web dhm simulations which may be because web dhm uses 8 day modis data and v web dhm uses simulated daily scale lai and fpar data overall these results indicate that v web dhm can effectively simulate hydrological processes in the biliu river basin fig 10 shows temporal variations and spatial distributions of fluxes simulated by web dhm and v web dhm and fig s9 in the supplementary information shows multi year mean differences results of v web dhm minus results of web dhm average values for four time periods are shown four flux data are compared including land surface temperatures fig 10a and c et fig 10b and d surface soil wetness fig 10e and g and root zone wetness fig 10f and h temporal variations and spatial distributions of lsts agree well similarly temporal variations and spatial distributions of et surface zone wetness and root zone wetness also agree well overall but with exceptions in several high low elevations fig s9 here these exceptions may also be due to uncertainties in input data and calibrated coefficients of lai and fpar simulation equations overall the simulations of web dhm and v web dhm agree relatively well 4 4 impact quantification after evaluations with observed runoff water fluxes energy fluxes modis lsts lai and fpar v web dhm demonstrates its good performance in representing water energy and vegetation dynamic processes in the biliu river basin thus v web dhm is used in this section to investigate the respective and combination impacts of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes on water resources it should be noted that the quantified impacts here do not necessarily represent the model errors but represent the variations of hydrological variables and land surface fluxes from present model simulations based on observed data fig 11 shows mean monthly contributions of co2 concentration changes temperature variations and leaf area changes to the variations of basin average variables the bandwidth represents overall variations generated from the 4 6 2 scenarios shown in fig 5 it can be seen that changes in co2 concentration temperature and leaf area have considerable influences on simulated variables generating large bandwidth for canopy transpiration in july leaf area changes have larger impacts than in other months account for 41 31 and the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes account for 37 14 are lower than influence of leaf area changes in may june and august the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes have larger impacts than others the temperature in july is higher than other months which may result in leaf area changes have higher impact on canopy transpiration than the physiological effects of co2 concentration changes the influence of temperature changes on canopy transpiration is larger in may june july and august than other months this may be because temperature provides essential conditions to keep the enzyme working when chlorophyll is increasing in these months in september and october the chlorophyll in leaves is reducing and therefore the influence of temperature changes decreases in the beginning of the growing season april lai is smaller compared with other months as shown in fig 8 and therefore the effects of the co2 concentration and temperature changes are smaller than other months whereas it may be due to decrease in chlorophyll in september and october the higher influence of leaf area changes than co2 concentration and temperature changes in april and september may result from higher lai compared with the as normal scenario moreover it can be seen that the combinations of increasing co2 concentration global warming and leaf area changes have little influence on runoff soil wetness stomatal conductance and net primary productivity regarding the average influence from april to october on canopy transpiration the sum of the average influences of leaf area changes and temperature variations is 59 27 which is more than 1 6 times higher than the average influence of co2 36 97 similar to the canopy transpiration the sum of the average influences of leaf area and temperature variations is higher than co2 for surface zone wetness root zone wetness and net primary productivity of c4 plants for other variables the leaf area changes and increasing co2 concentration have considerable influence implying that it is necessary to consider changes in co2 concentration and leaf area in hydrological simulation under climate change fig 12 a and b shows simulated runoff of the dynamic vegetation scenario fig 12 c shows mean monthly contributions of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and leaf area changes to runoff variations fig 12 a shows runoff is decreasing overall which may result from increasing et fig 12 b shows the influence on runoff in august the runoff is increasing with increasing co2 concentration and decreasing with increasing temperature this is because the increased et caused by temperature rises is higher than decreased et caused by increasing co2 concentration and therefore et is increasing overall fig 12 c shows leaf area changes are the dominator of runoff changes in august which may be because the total influence of leaf area variations on et surface zone wetness and root zone wetness are higher than influences of co2 concentration and temperature changes as shown in table 1 in fig 11 leaf area changes have the largest impacts on canopy transpiration and et in july this difference between figs 11 and 12 c may be because leaf area changes have higher impact on surface zone wetness in august than in july as shown in fig 11 surface zone wetness represents water storage in soil and therefore its changes can lead to runoff variations fig 12 shows the combinations have little influence on the runoff variations which is similar to fig 11 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies sawada et al 2014 integrated a vegetation module into web dhm and used it in drought analysis however the impacts of elevated co2 concentration rising temperature and vegetation dynamics on water resources were not quantified in the study by sawada et al 2014 in our study the individual and combination impacts of them are explicitly quantified using a framework integrating v web dhm and anova it is necessary to quantify their relative influences because it can provide very useful information on main influential factors and therefore measures can be taken to avoid negative influence by controlling the main factors at the same time the quantification can also provide insight into the importance of considering some influential factors in hydrological simulation and drought analysis under climate change such as vegetation dynamics which are frequently neglected in basin scale hydrological model simulations previous studies have investigated the influences of temperature co2 concentration and or vegetation changes on runoff labat et al 2004 gedney et al 2006 leipprand and gerten 2006 piao et al 2007 gerten et al 2008 cheng et al 2014 tao et al 2014 tesemma et al 2015 however few studies have been carried out to quantify the relative influences of them and their combination influences on a river basin scale this could be because there is a lack of a comprehensive framework that can simulate and quantify vegetation dynamics photosynthesis conductance changes biosphere hydrological processes and relative influences of them on a river basin scale however in this paper a distributed biosphere hydrological model with a dynamic vegetation module is developed and a comprehensive framework combining the developed model and a sensitivity analysis approach is proposed this framework facilitates the simulation and quantification of the individual and combination effects on a river basin scale using the framework we found the sum of the influences of leaf area and temperature changes on canopy transpiration is more than 1 6 times higher than influence of co2 concentration changes in main growing seasons this result implies transpired water with global warming and lai variations could be more than conserved water due to suppressed transpiration by elevated co2 concentration few studies have reported similar results in this region gedney et al 2006 found the individual effects of climate aerosol concentration co2 concentration and land use type changes on runoff can be combined linearly to represent their total influence which implies their combination influence is little lemordant et al 2018 found radiative and physiological effects of co2 concentration changes on evaporative fraction can be combined linearly different from the studies by gedney et al 2006 in which lai changes were not explicitly considered and lemordant et al 2018 our study found the combination influence of temperature co2 concentration and leaf area changes is little compared with their individual effects which has rarely been explicitly and quantitatively reported according to the best of the authors knowledge this finding could provide useful information to the current limited pool of knowledge regarding the influence of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations and vegetation changes on water resources on a river basin scale we found increasing co2 concentration can increase runoff and increasing temperature decreases runoff in the studied region this founding is different from the research by piao et al 2007 in which it is found increasing co2 concentration can reduce runoff when considering co2 fertilization effects the difference may be because the study by piao et al 2007 utilized globally average runoff and co2 fertilization effects are not significant in our study implying that co2 effects are different in different regions lemordant et al 2016 suggested that elevated co2 concentration could increase soil moisture and betts et al 2007 suggested that increased soil moisture could increase runoff dai 2013 suggested increasing temperature can increase drought severity swann et al 2016 suggested that increasing temperature reduces water resources availability and the severity of drought is reduced when considering the influence of elevated co2 concentration these studies appear to support our results nevertheless our study was carried out in an important medium sized river basin which is challenging for the approaches used in the previous studies because of the coarse resolutions of earth system models esm and global circulation models they used jasechko et al 2013 showed transpiration from vegetation is the largest water flux on earth s continents and accounts for 80 90 of terrestrial evapotranspiration lemordant et al 2018 found water resources availability will be strongly modified by vegetation physiological effects in response to elevated co2 concentration and influence of precipitation changes on drought is lower than previous expectation lian et al 2018 found that the vegetation responses to climate change is more important to water resources availability projections than previously thought most basin scale hydrological models currently do not consider transpiration in vegetation leaf therefore water resources availability projections could be problematic when using them in our study we considered the influence of vegetation changes on runoff by developing the vegetation simulation module and found leaf area changes have the largest influence on runoff as shown in fig 12c our results are consistent with the previous studies nevertheless we also show the differences of the leaf area changes influences in different months which are not investigated in the previous studies 5 2 comments on the developed framework lai variations depend on availability of environmental resources and influence of resources is different in various regions jolly et al 2005 orlandi et al 2013 hwang et al 2014 reich et al 2014 wang erlandsson et al 2014 for example donohue et al 2013 suggested that water could be a main resource influencing vegetation growth in warm and arid regions yang et al 2016 suggested that radiation and nutrients are main resources influencing vegetation growth in warm and humid regions yao et al 2018 studied climate influence on gross primary productivity variations in china and also identified temperature as a main influential factor in the study region in our paper which seems to support our study as shown in eqs 1 and 2 rh can influence canopy conductance and transpiration which are related to vegetation growth and therefore rh is considered in lai simulations in eqs 19 21 hesketh and warrington 1989 also suggested that humidity could influence seedling emergence and leaf area expansion and therefore can influence lai moreover the study region has a temperate monsoon marine climate and growing seasons are mainly controlled by temperature nemani et al 2003 thus the three climatic variables chosen in this study are acceptable for lai simulation there are several approaches that simulate lai based on daily scale hydro climatic data for example growing degree days approaches simulate lai based on daily temperatures miller et al 2001 koetz et al 2005 setiyono et al 2008 cao et al 2015 growing season index gsl approaches utilize daily scale photoperiod vapor pressure and minimum temperatures to model lai jolly et al 2005 savoy and mackay 2015 a variant of the gsl approach implements day length daily scale minimum temperatures and soil moisture wang erlandsson et al 2014 in these prior studies the hydro climatic variables used have similar monthly fluctuations with lai therefore it is acceptable to simulate lai based on climatic variables that have similar monthly variations as lai lai dynamics can be modelled using a few methods for example approaches on the basis of exponential distributions considering temperature relative humidity etc cao et al 2015 tesemma et al 2015 approaches allocating carbon resources to leaves stems and roots cox 2001 sitch et al 2003 clark et al 2011 the overall objective of this research is to simulate changes in river runoff although an exponential function is used in this study to estimate lai without explicitly considering carbon allocations the runoff simulation results are acceptable recall the results in fig 9 in addition validations using modis lai shows the simulated lai replicates observation well recall the results in the section 4 2 therefore the lai simulation approach in this study is acceptable regarding co2 influence on lai eq 3 is a general form and can consider co2 impacts on lai however fertilization effects of co2 are changing in different regions and studies have shown the fertilization effects may not exist in some regions e g yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 duursma et al 2016 in our case study region there are two reasons that we do not consider the fertilization effects i fertilization effects of co2 are not considerable in our study region as shown in a quantitative research by zhu et al 2016 ii the study by nemani et al 2003 and yao et al 2018 revealed temperature is a main driver of vegetation variations in our study region when studies are carried out in regions with co2 fertilization there are two approaches to incorporate co2 fertilization into eq 3 i considering co2 as an influential factor in the denominator of eq 3 ii considering co2 influence on laimax in the numerator of eq 3 as pointed out by donohue et al 2013 that co2 fertilization effects could influence maximum vegetation coverage because co2 fertilization effects on lai are still at the forefront of research more studies are encouraged in the future to incorporate this influence into eq 3 the overall objective of this study is to investigate changes in water resources the lai simulation approach was calibrated using modis lai from 2000 to 2005 and validated from 2006 to 2010 based on modis lai both the calibration and validation results show acceptable performance with nse and absolute values of rb being over 0 73 and less than 14 recall the results in fig 7 in addition the validations using observed runoff show the model can simulate runoff well using simulated lai therefore it is assumed that the model is appropriate to predict changes in runoff similar assumption has also been utilized in previous studies e g miller et al 2001 koetz et al 2005 setiyono et al 2008 cao et al 2015 su et al 2015 tesemma et al 2015 in this study r2 is utilized to represent differences between simulated lai and modis lai the higher the r2 values the better the calibrated parameters therefore the calibration is to maximize r2 although only r2 is used the calibrated parameters show good performance in replicating modis lai the limited length of meteorological data used 2000 2010 may influence the analysis in this study however the v web dhm model is applicable even when study data changes although empirical functions are established to estimate fpar from lai in this study other approaches simulating fpar based on lai are applicable as well for example the beer s law monsi and saeki 1953 bondeau et al 2007 in our study region human abstracts water mainly from the biliu reservoir which could not influence the reservoir inflow therefore influence of human water abstractions was not considered 5 3 limitations in this study possible changes in vegetation height and diameter were not considered water vapour in the atmosphere may change when vegetation varies which may increase cloud and then may raise solar radiation reflection by cloud these changes were not considered other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide were not considered with changes in temperature and co2 concentration plant rooting depth may increase which allows plant to access soil moisture at deeper layers especially during dry spells in this study we used prescribed rooting depth in sib2 and therefore the changes in rooting depth when co2 and temperature changes were not considered as interactions between eco2 climate water cycle and rooting depth are still at the forefront of research as shown in a recent debate between fan et al 2017 and pierret and lacombe 2018 more studies are encouraged in the future to consider the influence of rooting depth other influential factors were not considered such as vapour pressure willett et al 2008 fatichi et al 2015 wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 schymanski and or 2016 and net radiation changes i e dimming and brightening wild et al 2005 mercado et al 2009 wild 2009 vegetation influences on co2 concentration global warming and precipitation were not considered to consider these effects more complex esms should be used which is very difficult at present in a medium sized river basin because of coarse resolutions of esms without considering these effects the total variance may be underestimated future research is encouraged when fine resolution esm data is available in this study it is assumed that precipitation is enough to sustain vegetation growth in different co2 concentration and temperature rise scenarios because the objective of this research is to quantify the influences of co2 concentration temperature and vegetation changes on water resources precipitation may change under the different scenarios and the changes were not considered in this study future studies are encouraged to consider precipitation changes using fine resolution precipitation simulation of esms air temperature lapse rates may vary within a year and also relate to vapour pressure and wind speed mcvicar et al 2007 a lapse rate of 6 5 k km was used in this study which may contribute to the uncertainty in simulated results future research is encouraged to utilize more sophisticated data when detailed lapse rates are available 6 conclusions increasing co2 concentration global warming and vegetation changes have profound influence on regional water resources however quantitative assessments of their respective and combination influences on river basin scales remain few especially in northeast china a better understanding of the complex influence can help develop measures to ameliorate regional water resources challenges this study presents an important progress in quantifying the influences of the three key driving forces of water resource changes the major contributions are summarized as follows based on this study first a dynamic vegetation simulation approach is developed and incorporated into web dhm therefore the influences of increasing co2 concentration temperature variations vegetation changes and their combinations on water resources can be simulated second a comprehensive framework is proposed by integrating v web dhm and a variance based sensitivity analysis approach this new framework enables quantification of the influences of changes in co2 concentration temperature vegetation and their combinations using values between zero and one revealing the relative importance of them third we find sum of the influences of lai and temperature variations on canopy transpiration is larger than physiological effects of co2 this finding implies transpired water could be more than conserved water with elevated co2 concentration global warming and leaf area changes therefore considering changes in temperature and lai are of importance in projections of future water resources fourth we also find lai dynamics play a dominate role in runoff decreases in hot summer this result implies that water resources availability could be overestimated in summer if lai changes are neglected therefore severity of future water shortage could be underestimated if lai changes are not taken into considerations in the future the proposed approaches could be applied in other sizes types of studies e g all china to investigate influences of

6724,in response to the severe water crisis in iran the iranian government has changed its approach to the management of the country s water resources in different sectors from supply side to demand side management an approach that relies on reducing water demand in this regard due to the high consumption of water in the agricultural sector switching from rice cultivation that requires large amounts of water to less water intensive crops were considered a priority for the country and the government banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation policy it is however very difficult for a government or any other power to enforce such a measure as it must be voluntarily accepted by end users i e farmers to be successful therefore the success of this policy largely depends on what the public think of such measures as such it is crucial for policymakers to know how farmers think and behave in terms of these policies the aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about farmers intention toward changing the rice cropping system to achieve our goal we used a social psychological theory known as the theory of interpersonal behavior a sample of 250 rice growers in southwest iran was selected structural equation modeling showed that farmers intention to change from rice cultivation to another crop is determined by personal norms beliefs about their role and emotional considerations keywords water crisis demand management rice producer agriculture extension iran 1 introduction globally water shortage is a key factor threatening sustainable social and economic development particularly in arid regions jiang 2009 adams 2014 david and ploeger 2014 iran is situated in one of the world s most water scarce regions and frequently experiences severe droughts due to population growth urbanization industrialization expanding agriculture and climate change zobeidi et al 2016 sefati et al 2019 the country currently faces an unprecedented water crisis madani 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2013a b this crisis has negative impacts on almost all sectors and has incurred massive costs in both human and socio economic terms in this regard formal reports state that due to drought and a decline in precipitation in the winter of 2017 the water levels in many dams are low for example the water levels currently stand at about 50 in zayanderud dam in isfahan province 25 in doroodzan dam in fars province and 25 in dosti dam in khorasan province asriran 2018 also see gerivani et al 2011 nabavi et al 2018 furthermore the head of the environmental organization has argued that if water continues to be consumed at the current rate the eastern and southeastern parts of the country will run dry in less than 25 years asriran 2018 also see sharifikia 2013 and 12 of the 31 provinces in iran will face their water table underground in the next 50 years the new york times in reference to the role of water crises in political and social unrest across the world wrote that in nigeria syria somalia and now iran the various crises associated with water scarcity have led to social unrest mass migration and even war entekhab 2018 see also abbaspour et al 2012 garousi et al 2013 yazdanpanah et al 2011 as such the sustainable management of water has become a major concern for the public researchers and practitioners in iran hadizadeh et al 2018 in response to this challenge the government changed its approach to the management of water resources in different sectors from supply side to demand side management which relies on reducing water demand brooks 2006 jeffrey and gearey 2006 in this regard the head of the environmental organization has pointed out that water demand management is no longer a choice but rather an inevitable requirement entekhab 2018 see also yaghobi et al 2018 agriculture which is the biggest consumer of water in iran accounting for around 90 of water usage is the most important target for this new approach globally different policies advocating the use of both monetary and non monetary alternatives such as water constraints water saving technologies and behavior and water conservation are being introduced at the micro level farmers households to implement the demand management approach due to different benefits associated with water conservation the iranian government relies heavily on water conservation initiatives in their demand management approaches yazdanpanah et al 2015b valizadeh et al 2018 in this regard the iranian minister of energy announced at the world water summit that the government had initiated a project aiming to increase water conservation the objectives of the project are clear stating that the consumption of water per capita should be reduced by 21 billion cubic meters according to this plan the water consumption in the agricultural sector should be cut from 90 billion cubic meters to 55 billion while drinking water will be reduced from 8 billion to 6 billion cubic meters entekhab 2018 water conservation as a demand side policy consists of different initiatives such as the cultivation of more tolerant or less water dependent crops new irrigation technology and so on for more detail see yazdanpanah et al 2015b 2014a b in this regard the head of the environmental organization entekhab 2018 believes that due to the low price of water in iran see also yazdanpanah et al 2015a c agricultural production in iran has moved towards the production of the least expensive and highly water dependent crops and of course these crops also account for the largest share of exports according to him preliminary studies show that there is a possibility of a 32 decrease in the country s water footprint including virtual water in the medium term which could relieve iran s water stress to some extent in 2015 for example about 833 000 tons of watermelons were exported from iran research has shown that every kilogram of watermelon accounts for 400 l of virtual water this means that in 2015 3332 billion liters of virtual water was exported from a country that is vulnerable to water shortages entekhab 2018 see also faramarzi et al 2010 in light of this switching from rice cultivation which requires high water consumption hadizadeh et al 2018 allahyari et al 2016 to less water intensive crops across the entire country except in the northern provinces was considered an important target priority the government consequently banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation measure researchers have frequently argued that the success of such initiatives are completely dependent on acceptance and implementation on the micro level farmers jorgensen et al 2009 hurlimann et al 2009 they also emphasize that such acceptance will occur only if consumers understand the extent of the problem in other words such measures banning the cultivation of rice cannot be enforced by any government sector or any other power without voluntary acceptance by end users hassell and cary 2007 argue that water saving behaviors rely heavily on motivating individuals to voluntarily make choices informed by appropriate policy and pricing signals infrastructure and information as well as increased awareness it is also argued that changes in behavior are more likely to become embedded in social norms if it happens voluntarily over a period of time ayer 1997 therefore the success of this policy largely depends on the public s opinion of such initiatives in terms of how efficient and desirable they are as such it is crucial for policy makers to understand how farmers think and behave with regard to these initiatives therefore the main aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about the factors that influence farmers intention toward changing from the rice cropping system to cultivating other crops although previous research has been done regarding iranian farmers attitudes and behavior in terms of water conservation to the authors knowledge no research has yet been conducted in iran on farmers attitudes toward changing the cropping system to conserve water we expect that the results of this study will provide an important cognition base for designing robust policy initiatives that will significantly decrease rice cultivation among iranian farmers to achieve our goal we used a social psychological theory the theory of interpersonal behavior tib from triandis 1977 1980 we used this theory based on its advantages in studying human behavior bamberg and schmidt 2003 noted that tib have a clear operationalization of variables and demonstrate the causal relationship between variables that determine behavior in other words the models act as frameworks to explore and conceptualize individual behavior jackson 2005 as rice cultivation is a routine automatic and habitual behavior for our population of farmers the tib was considered a useful tool see bamberg and schmidt 2003 furthermore researchers hassell and cary 2007 have argued that tib is an appropriate tool for investigating pro environmental behavior that can also be used as a theoretical base to empirically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the constituent factors in various situations in addition to the above tib also has a wider scope due to its consideration of moral cultural and social factors which are not taken into account in other models gagnon et al 2003 to the best of our knowledge tib has not previously been applied to the study of water conservation by farmers it has however been developed in the domain of environmental actions bamberg and schmidt 2003 as such beside the first main goal of this study we would like to test the application and efficacy of tib in terms of the intention of farmers in a non western developing country to change their crop cultivation practices as a second goal of this study 2 theory of interpersonal behavior the tib was developed thirty years ago by a social psychologist harry triandis it was developed as an integrated model of interpersonal behavior to explain the intention and actual performance of a specific behavior jackson 2005 to estimate behavior tib assumed that both internal and external factors should be integrated hassell and cary 2007 to achieve this the tib included both expectancy value and normative belief constructs bamberg and schmidt 2003 and assumed that behaviors are neither fully cognitive nor fully spontaneous while also being neither self determining nor social rather these behaviors are influenced by a person s moral convictions while the impact thereof is moderated by emotional considerations and cognitive constraints hassell and cary 2007 according to triandis 1980 behavior is determined in three dimensions intention facilitating conditions and habit in other words displaying a specific behavior results from an amalgamation of intent ingrained responses and the limitations and conditions in which the person acts therefore tib proposes that habit is an important factor in acting out a behavior which implies that if a person has previous experience with a specific behavior consciousness will decrease when that behavior is enacted bamberg and schmidt 2003 in turn intention is jointly determined by social normative and affective factors along with rational deliberations hassell and cary 2007 in this regard bamberg and schmidt 2003 has argued that apart from expectancy value beliefs which triandis labeled cognition an affective measure of attitude that is different from expectancy value and social factors can determine individual intention social factors in itself include a range of variables such as those set out in the normative belief construct of the theory of planned behavior tpb but also comprises personal norms a person s convictions about how suited a particular behavior is to their perceived social role agreements between individuals and how a person characterizes themselves jackson 2005 believed that tib could eliminate some of the critique expressed against the rational choice theory triandis in turn argued that tib was introduced as an alternative framework to the tpb and that it could overcome the weaknesses of the tpb moody and siponen 2013 for the purpose of this study factor determinants of intention were adapted from the bamberg and schmidt study 2003 with some modifications fig 1 due to past study with application of tib boots and treloar 2000 found that habit was an important predictor of intention in our study we assumed that habit directly influences intention while in the model habits are conceptualized as direct antecedents of behaviour as such in this study habit is a new intention predictor in sum based on the tib variables thirteen hypotheses are presented in fig 1 3 method 3 1 participants our study is a cross sectional survey that utilized locations in the shushtar district of the khuzestan province in iran as the study site the population of interest consisted of farmers who cultivate rice in this district the study sample consisted of 250 farmers who were selected through multistage stratified random sampling a questionnaire was compiled by the authors in order to collect data through face to face interviews with farmers in november 2017 the rice growers were contacted telephonically and invited to participate in the survey we arranged times and places for interviews with farmers or met them on their farms to conduct the interviews farmers selected to participate in the survey were given the right to refuse or to decline from answering questions that they felt uncomfortable with new participants were chosen to replace those that did not want to participate 46 of the farmers that were initially chosen declined to participate in the interview process respondents were not compensated for their participation the interviews lasted between 30 and 45 min each as far as socioeconomic variables are concerned the descriptive analysis revealed that all rice growers were males the rice growers included in our sample were aged between 20 and 80 years and had a mean age of 43 23 years s d 11 81 regarding their educational level the majority of respondents 75 30 had no formal education followed by 71 who had graduated from high school 28 4 50 with a middle school education 20 41 that finished primary education 16 4 and 13 5 2 who had a university degree it is important to note here that in iran there are five main levels of education the primary level lasts 5 years the middle level 3 years and high school lasts 4 years thus 12 years in total while additional years are needed to obtain a college degree the farmers agricultural experience was distributed across a 2 to 60 year range with a mean duration of 17 10 years sd 11 38 the average number of years of farming experience in rice cultivation was about 12 years sd 10 17 with a range from 1 to 60 years the distance of the participants farms to the agricultural service center was between 1 and 35 km with a mean distance of 10 86 km sd 7 22 around 42 of the respondents in our sample had a second job in addition to farming 110 farmers 44 confirmed that they have access to finance and credit to do their jobs while the remaining 140 56 had no access to finance and credit 3 2 data collection techniques the data were collected through face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire which was compiled after an in depth literature review process the questions covered the tib constructs including personal norms behavioral beliefs normative beliefs control beliefs affect role belief habit and intention the first author who was familiar with both the district and the farmers conducted the interviews she directly posed the questions to the farmers and filled out the questionnaire based on their responses the questionnaire contained statements similar to those used in past studies bamberg and schmidt 2003 moody and siponen 2013 gagnon et al 2003 to measure tib variables we developed scales consisting of multiple items the farmers were asked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the items using a 5 point likert scale from very low 1 to very high 5 table 1 shows some examples of the items contained in the questionnaire we used a panel of experts from different related disciplines to ensure the validity of the questionnaire the cronbach alpha reliability coefficients for all scales indicated a reliability of good to excellent generally 0 67 to 0 91 which was obtained through a pilot study fieldwork that included 30 rice growers from sosangerd county in khuzestan province table 1 the questionnaire used in the study was in persian farsi and all items in table 1 has been translated from the original language all questionnaire data were initially input into spss spss software was used to produce descriptive statistics and their frequency for all variables finally we applied a sem analysis through amos 20 to determine which variables can be used to predict farmers intention 4 results 4 1 relationship between variables to investigate the relationship between tib constructs we used a pearson correlation test the results showed a significant relationship between intention to change from rice cultivation and other variables including habit negative personal norms control beliefs normative beliefs role beliefs and affect however the behavioral belief was not significantly correlated with intention table 2 4 2 drivers of intention to change from rice cultivation to other crops 4 2 1 main analysis two different versions of the tib with and without habit as determinant of farmers intention to switch from rice cultivation to other crops were tested structural equation modelling sem using amos 20 was used to test the relationship between variables a sem can combine the strength of multiple regression and confirmatory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis cfa the first component of sem was used for the measurement model to estimate how observed items are related to each of the latent variables the construct validity of the research instrument was assessed via cfa in performing the cfa all constructs and reflective indicators were depicted and composed as a measurement model in which all constructs were allowed to correlate with each other generally speaking the process of validation comprised several steps as described here the measurement model should demonstrate goodness of fit for the empirical data and meet the requirements of the certain indices for example chi square normalised by degrees of freedom λ df should be less than five bentler 1989 adjusted goodness of fit index agfi should be larger than 0 8 goodness of fit index gfi normed fit index nfi and comparative fit index cfi should all exceed 0 9 and root mean square error rmsea should be less than 0 10 henry and stone 1994 the fit of the model depicted in fig 2 is rather good χ2 df 2 43 gfi 0 736 cfi 0 773 rmsea 0 076 in our tib model the gfi and cfi which is lower than recommended 0 90 but within range in sum the indices indicated that the model which is a representation of the tib can be accepted from an empirical point of view for more details see hu and bentler 1999 however the revise tib resulted in a substantial drop in the fit statistics suggesting an adequate model fit for the empirical data section 4 2 3 the second component of sem is called the structural model and uses the techniques of multiple regression with causal assumptions specified by the researchers in particular it estimates the relationship between the latent variables of personal norms behavioral beliefs normative beliefs control beliefs role beliefs affect habit and intention 4 2 2 the original tib the first model without habit as a determinant of farmers intention accounted for 17 of variance in farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops fig 2 personal norms β 0 35 is the strongest predictor of intentions followed by role beliefs β 0 26 the sem result revealed that other paths to intention behavioral beliefs control beliefs normative beliefs and affective considerations were also not significant as far as indirect effects are concerned sem revealed that habit has an indirect effect β 0 25 on intention through role beliefs and personal norms sem also revealed that habit could account for 60 of variance in personal norms 39 of variance in behavioral beliefs 31 of variance in control beliefs 79 of variance in normative beliefs 42 of variance in role beliefs and 39 of variance in affective considerations using the same model bamberg and schmidt 2003 found that behavioral beliefs control beliefs and role beliefs could predict 51 of intent to drive a car similar to our results they found that habit has a strong effect on all six intention predictors 4 2 3 the revised tib the second model accounted for 50 of variance in intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops fig 3 personal norms β 0 60 is the strongest predictor of intentions followed by role beliefs β 0 44 and affect β 0 40 the sem result revealed that other paths to intention behavioral beliefs control beliefs and normative beliefs were also not significant sem also revealed that habit accounted for 52 of variance in personal norms 39 of variance in behavioral beliefs 61 of variance in control beliefs 52 of variance in normative beliefs 33 of variance in role beliefs and 40 of variance in affect the fit of the model depicted in fig 3 is rather good χ2 df 2 31 gfi 0 889 cfi 0 897 rmsea 0 072 the results of the study hypotheses based on the theory constructs are presented in table 3 5 discussion this study applied a well established but often overlooked social psychological model the theory of interpersonal behavior tib to investigate farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops the study has two main goals 1 to understand the factors that can predict the intention of farmers to switch from rice to less water dependent crops and 2 to test the application and efficacy of tib in terms of the intention of farmers in a non western developing country to change their crop cultivation practices as far as the first goal of the study is concerned the structural equation model sem we applied showed that in the absence of a path from habit to intention original model personal norms and role beliefs can determine about 17 variance in the farmers intention however in the presence of a path from habit to intention revised tib version personal norms affective considerations and role beliefs can jointly predict nearly 50 variance in intention in sum the sem revealed that in contrast to boots and treloar 2000 habit was not a predictor of farmers intention however in the presence of a path from habit to intention the explanatory power of the tib significantly increases from 17 to 50 thus a revised tib including these new paths emerged taken together the revised tib sufficiently calculated the farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops explaining 50 of the variation in the farmers intention in other words the results of our study suggest that the original tib is not a suitable model while the revised tib framework is an effective tool for investigating intention toward changing rice cultivation in our sample moreover our findings revealed that the new added path from habit to intention is an efficient way of improving the predictive power of tib this conclusion is based on armitage and conner s meta analysis 2001 which revealed that the mean prediction power of intention applying the theory of planned behavior tpb and the theory of reasoned action was about 39 it is also based on other research conducted in the water conservation domain in iran for example in their study rahimi et al 2017 found that tpb can predict 43 of the variance in farmers intention to conserve water furthermore yazdanpanah et al 2015a c found that social cognitive theory can predict 46 of intention in a sample of farmers in another study rahimi et al 2016 were able to predict 79 of the variance in farmers intention by applying the norm activation theory our finding illustrated that the revised tib framework is a useful framework for our research question an interesting finding of this research concerns the affect variable while affect did not have any significant effect on intention in the original model it has a significant impact on intention in the revised model in terms of the second goal of our study the results of our structural equation modelling revealed that personal norm is an important predictor of intention personal norms refer to an individual s beliefs regarding what is good or bad şimşekoğlu and lajunen 2008 while moral norms are the rules or values that a person has internalized and applies to their daily life through a set of self administered rewards or punishments arvola et al 2008 this result can be interpreted as follows due to the low cost of agricultural water and the fact that water use is subsidized in iran yazdanpanah et al 2014a changing the crop cultivation pattern to conserve more water constitutes a behavior that is more moral than rational in other words for farmers although the cultivation of rice on their farms has more economic benefits due to the water crisis they feel an obligation to conserve water by switching from rice to less water dependent crops this finding is supported by different studies molin 2005 cass et al 2010 our findings suggest that the more a farmer perceives his activities as a moral obligation to save water the greater his intention will be to engage in a high level of water conservation behavior from a policy implication perspective our study provides an explanation for applying a moral component in changing crop pattern policy therefore in the domain of changing crop patterns it will probably be useful to consider positive self rewarding feelings in order to motivate farmers to change rice cultivation it is important to note that islam as the dominant religion in iran and before it zoroastrianism have a special focus on the stewardship of nature particularly water in other words both religions have a clear massage regarding the protection stewardship and conservation of water and emphasizes that they are moral issues see balalii et al 2009 as such the protection and preservation of water resources is a self rewarding issue for muslims based on this argument muslims may potentially feel some responsibility to protect and save water in everyday life which implies that focusing on moral norms when attempting to change the rice cultivation policy has considerable potential for changing this cropping pattern therefore policies that try to reduce rice cultivation among farmers could consider that water saving by moving away from rice cultivation could be an important part of the farmers religious beliefs and expectations in this way encouraging farmers through formal and informal religious leaders is probably an easy and inexpensive way to create a positive moral obligation for changing rice cultivation among farmers in this study role beliefs also appear to be a

6724,in response to the severe water crisis in iran the iranian government has changed its approach to the management of the country s water resources in different sectors from supply side to demand side management an approach that relies on reducing water demand in this regard due to the high consumption of water in the agricultural sector switching from rice cultivation that requires large amounts of water to less water intensive crops were considered a priority for the country and the government banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation policy it is however very difficult for a government or any other power to enforce such a measure as it must be voluntarily accepted by end users i e farmers to be successful therefore the success of this policy largely depends on what the public think of such measures as such it is crucial for policymakers to know how farmers think and behave in terms of these policies the aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about farmers intention toward changing the rice cropping system to achieve our goal we used a social psychological theory known as the theory of interpersonal behavior a sample of 250 rice growers in southwest iran was selected structural equation modeling showed that farmers intention to change from rice cultivation to another crop is determined by personal norms beliefs about their role and emotional considerations keywords water crisis demand management rice producer agriculture extension iran 1 introduction globally water shortage is a key factor threatening sustainable social and economic development particularly in arid regions jiang 2009 adams 2014 david and ploeger 2014 iran is situated in one of the world s most water scarce regions and frequently experiences severe droughts due to population growth urbanization industrialization expanding agriculture and climate change zobeidi et al 2016 sefati et al 2019 the country currently faces an unprecedented water crisis madani 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2013a b this crisis has negative impacts on almost all sectors and has incurred massive costs in both human and socio economic terms in this regard formal reports state that due to drought and a decline in precipitation in the winter of 2017 the water levels in many dams are low for example the water levels currently stand at about 50 in zayanderud dam in isfahan province 25 in doroodzan dam in fars province and 25 in dosti dam in khorasan province asriran 2018 also see gerivani et al 2011 nabavi et al 2018 furthermore the head of the environmental organization has argued that if water continues to be consumed at the current rate the eastern and southeastern parts of the country will run dry in less than 25 years asriran 2018 also see sharifikia 2013 and 12 of the 31 provinces in iran will face their water table underground in the next 50 years the new york times in reference to the role of water crises in political and social unrest across the world wrote that in nigeria syria somalia and now iran the various crises associated with water scarcity have led to social unrest mass migration and even war entekhab 2018 see also abbaspour et al 2012 garousi et al 2013 yazdanpanah et al 2011 as such the sustainable management of water has become a major concern for the public researchers and practitioners in iran hadizadeh et al 2018 in response to this challenge the government changed its approach to the management of water resources in different sectors from supply side to demand side management which relies on reducing water demand brooks 2006 jeffrey and gearey 2006 in this regard the head of the environmental organization has pointed out that water demand management is no longer a choice but rather an inevitable requirement entekhab 2018 see also yaghobi et al 2018 agriculture which is the biggest consumer of water in iran accounting for around 90 of water usage is the most important target for this new approach globally different policies advocating the use of both monetary and non monetary alternatives such as water constraints water saving technologies and behavior and water conservation are being introduced at the micro level farmers households to implement the demand management approach due to different benefits associated with water conservation the iranian government relies heavily on water conservation initiatives in their demand management approaches yazdanpanah et al 2015b valizadeh et al 2018 in this regard the iranian minister of energy announced at the world water summit that the government had initiated a project aiming to increase water conservation the objectives of the project are clear stating that the consumption of water per capita should be reduced by 21 billion cubic meters according to this plan the water consumption in the agricultural sector should be cut from 90 billion cubic meters to 55 billion while drinking water will be reduced from 8 billion to 6 billion cubic meters entekhab 2018 water conservation as a demand side policy consists of different initiatives such as the cultivation of more tolerant or less water dependent crops new irrigation technology and so on for more detail see yazdanpanah et al 2015b 2014a b in this regard the head of the environmental organization entekhab 2018 believes that due to the low price of water in iran see also yazdanpanah et al 2015a c agricultural production in iran has moved towards the production of the least expensive and highly water dependent crops and of course these crops also account for the largest share of exports according to him preliminary studies show that there is a possibility of a 32 decrease in the country s water footprint including virtual water in the medium term which could relieve iran s water stress to some extent in 2015 for example about 833 000 tons of watermelons were exported from iran research has shown that every kilogram of watermelon accounts for 400 l of virtual water this means that in 2015 3332 billion liters of virtual water was exported from a country that is vulnerable to water shortages entekhab 2018 see also faramarzi et al 2010 in light of this switching from rice cultivation which requires high water consumption hadizadeh et al 2018 allahyari et al 2016 to less water intensive crops across the entire country except in the northern provinces was considered an important target priority the government consequently banned the cultivation of rice as a water conservation measure researchers have frequently argued that the success of such initiatives are completely dependent on acceptance and implementation on the micro level farmers jorgensen et al 2009 hurlimann et al 2009 they also emphasize that such acceptance will occur only if consumers understand the extent of the problem in other words such measures banning the cultivation of rice cannot be enforced by any government sector or any other power without voluntary acceptance by end users hassell and cary 2007 argue that water saving behaviors rely heavily on motivating individuals to voluntarily make choices informed by appropriate policy and pricing signals infrastructure and information as well as increased awareness it is also argued that changes in behavior are more likely to become embedded in social norms if it happens voluntarily over a period of time ayer 1997 therefore the success of this policy largely depends on the public s opinion of such initiatives in terms of how efficient and desirable they are as such it is crucial for policy makers to understand how farmers think and behave with regard to these initiatives therefore the main aim of this research is to accrue empirical evidence about the factors that influence farmers intention toward changing from the rice cropping system to cultivating other crops although previous research has been done regarding iranian farmers attitudes and behavior in terms of water conservation to the authors knowledge no research has yet been conducted in iran on farmers attitudes toward changing the cropping system to conserve water we expect that the results of this study will provide an important cognition base for designing robust policy initiatives that will significantly decrease rice cultivation among iranian farmers to achieve our goal we used a social psychological theory the theory of interpersonal behavior tib from triandis 1977 1980 we used this theory based on its advantages in studying human behavior bamberg and schmidt 2003 noted that tib have a clear operationalization of variables and demonstrate the causal relationship between variables that determine behavior in other words the models act as frameworks to explore and conceptualize individual behavior jackson 2005 as rice cultivation is a routine automatic and habitual behavior for our population of farmers the tib was considered a useful tool see bamberg and schmidt 2003 furthermore researchers hassell and cary 2007 have argued that tib is an appropriate tool for investigating pro environmental behavior that can also be used as a theoretical base to empirically analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the constituent factors in various situations in addition to the above tib also has a wider scope due to its consideration of moral cultural and social factors which are not taken into account in other models gagnon et al 2003 to the best of our knowledge tib has not previously been applied to the study of water conservation by farmers it has however been developed in the domain of environmental actions bamberg and schmidt 2003 as such beside the first main goal of this study we would like to test the application and efficacy of tib in terms of the intention of farmers in a non western developing country to change their crop cultivation practices as a second goal of this study 2 theory of interpersonal behavior the tib was developed thirty years ago by a social psychologist harry triandis it was developed as an integrated model of interpersonal behavior to explain the intention and actual performance of a specific behavior jackson 2005 to estimate behavior tib assumed that both internal and external factors should be integrated hassell and cary 2007 to achieve this the tib included both expectancy value and normative belief constructs bamberg and schmidt 2003 and assumed that behaviors are neither fully cognitive nor fully spontaneous while also being neither self determining nor social rather these behaviors are influenced by a person s moral convictions while the impact thereof is moderated by emotional considerations and cognitive constraints hassell and cary 2007 according to triandis 1980 behavior is determined in three dimensions intention facilitating conditions and habit in other words displaying a specific behavior results from an amalgamation of intent ingrained responses and the limitations and conditions in which the person acts therefore tib proposes that habit is an important factor in acting out a behavior which implies that if a person has previous experience with a specific behavior consciousness will decrease when that behavior is enacted bamberg and schmidt 2003 in turn intention is jointly determined by social normative and affective factors along with rational deliberations hassell and cary 2007 in this regard bamberg and schmidt 2003 has argued that apart from expectancy value beliefs which triandis labeled cognition an affective measure of attitude that is different from expectancy value and social factors can determine individual intention social factors in itself include a range of variables such as those set out in the normative belief construct of the theory of planned behavior tpb but also comprises personal norms a person s convictions about how suited a particular behavior is to their perceived social role agreements between individuals and how a person characterizes themselves jackson 2005 believed that tib could eliminate some of the critique expressed against the rational choice theory triandis in turn argued that tib was introduced as an alternative framework to the tpb and that it could overcome the weaknesses of the tpb moody and siponen 2013 for the purpose of this study factor determinants of intention were adapted from the bamberg and schmidt study 2003 with some modifications fig 1 due to past study with application of tib boots and treloar 2000 found that habit was an important predictor of intention in our study we assumed that habit directly influences intention while in the model habits are conceptualized as direct antecedents of behaviour as such in this study habit is a new intention predictor in sum based on the tib variables thirteen hypotheses are presented in fig 1 3 method 3 1 participants our study is a cross sectional survey that utilized locations in the shushtar district of the khuzestan province in iran as the study site the population of interest consisted of farmers who cultivate rice in this district the study sample consisted of 250 farmers who were selected through multistage stratified random sampling a questionnaire was compiled by the authors in order to collect data through face to face interviews with farmers in november 2017 the rice growers were contacted telephonically and invited to participate in the survey we arranged times and places for interviews with farmers or met them on their farms to conduct the interviews farmers selected to participate in the survey were given the right to refuse or to decline from answering questions that they felt uncomfortable with new participants were chosen to replace those that did not want to participate 46 of the farmers that were initially chosen declined to participate in the interview process respondents were not compensated for their participation the interviews lasted between 30 and 45 min each as far as socioeconomic variables are concerned the descriptive analysis revealed that all rice growers were males the rice growers included in our sample were aged between 20 and 80 years and had a mean age of 43 23 years s d 11 81 regarding their educational level the majority of respondents 75 30 had no formal education followed by 71 who had graduated from high school 28 4 50 with a middle school education 20 41 that finished primary education 16 4 and 13 5 2 who had a university degree it is important to note here that in iran there are five main levels of education the primary level lasts 5 years the middle level 3 years and high school lasts 4 years thus 12 years in total while additional years are needed to obtain a college degree the farmers agricultural experience was distributed across a 2 to 60 year range with a mean duration of 17 10 years sd 11 38 the average number of years of farming experience in rice cultivation was about 12 years sd 10 17 with a range from 1 to 60 years the distance of the participants farms to the agricultural service center was between 1 and 35 km with a mean distance of 10 86 km sd 7 22 around 42 of the respondents in our sample had a second job in addition to farming 110 farmers 44 confirmed that they have access to finance and credit to do their jobs while the remaining 140 56 had no access to finance and credit 3 2 data collection techniques the data were collected through face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire which was compiled after an in depth literature review process the questions covered the tib constructs including personal norms behavioral beliefs normative beliefs control beliefs affect role belief habit and intention the first author who was familiar with both the district and the farmers conducted the interviews she directly posed the questions to the farmers and filled out the questionnaire based on their responses the questionnaire contained statements similar to those used in past studies bamberg and schmidt 2003 moody and siponen 2013 gagnon et al 2003 to measure tib variables we developed scales consisting of multiple items the farmers were asked about the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with the items using a 5 point likert scale from very low 1 to very high 5 table 1 shows some examples of the items contained in the questionnaire we used a panel of experts from different related disciplines to ensure the validity of the questionnaire the cronbach alpha reliability coefficients for all scales indicated a reliability of good to excellent generally 0 67 to 0 91 which was obtained through a pilot study fieldwork that included 30 rice growers from sosangerd county in khuzestan province table 1 the questionnaire used in the study was in persian farsi and all items in table 1 has been translated from the original language all questionnaire data were initially input into spss spss software was used to produce descriptive statistics and their frequency for all variables finally we applied a sem analysis through amos 20 to determine which variables can be used to predict farmers intention 4 results 4 1 relationship between variables to investigate the relationship between tib constructs we used a pearson correlation test the results showed a significant relationship between intention to change from rice cultivation and other variables including habit negative personal norms control beliefs normative beliefs role beliefs and affect however the behavioral belief was not significantly correlated with intention table 2 4 2 drivers of intention to change from rice cultivation to other crops 4 2 1 main analysis two different versions of the tib with and without habit as determinant of farmers intention to switch from rice cultivation to other crops were tested structural equation modelling sem using amos 20 was used to test the relationship between variables a sem can combine the strength of multiple regression and confirmatory factor analysis confirmatory factor analysis cfa the first component of sem was used for the measurement model to estimate how observed items are related to each of the latent variables the construct validity of the research instrument was assessed via cfa in performing the cfa all constructs and reflective indicators were depicted and composed as a measurement model in which all constructs were allowed to correlate with each other generally speaking the process of validation comprised several steps as described here the measurement model should demonstrate goodness of fit for the empirical data and meet the requirements of the certain indices for example chi square normalised by degrees of freedom λ df should be less than five bentler 1989 adjusted goodness of fit index agfi should be larger than 0 8 goodness of fit index gfi normed fit index nfi and comparative fit index cfi should all exceed 0 9 and root mean square error rmsea should be less than 0 10 henry and stone 1994 the fit of the model depicted in fig 2 is rather good χ2 df 2 43 gfi 0 736 cfi 0 773 rmsea 0 076 in our tib model the gfi and cfi which is lower than recommended 0 90 but within range in sum the indices indicated that the model which is a representation of the tib can be accepted from an empirical point of view for more details see hu and bentler 1999 however the revise tib resulted in a substantial drop in the fit statistics suggesting an adequate model fit for the empirical data section 4 2 3 the second component of sem is called the structural model and uses the techniques of multiple regression with causal assumptions specified by the researchers in particular it estimates the relationship between the latent variables of personal norms behavioral beliefs normative beliefs control beliefs role beliefs affect habit and intention 4 2 2 the original tib the first model without habit as a determinant of farmers intention accounted for 17 of variance in farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops fig 2 personal norms β 0 35 is the strongest predictor of intentions followed by role beliefs β 0 26 the sem result revealed that other paths to intention behavioral beliefs control beliefs normative beliefs and affective considerations were also not significant as far as indirect effects are concerned sem revealed that habit has an indirect effect β 0 25 on intention through role beliefs and personal norms sem also revealed that habit could account for 60 of variance in personal norms 39 of variance in behavioral beliefs 31 of variance in control beliefs 79 of variance in normative beliefs 42 of variance in role beliefs and 39 of variance in affective considerations using the same model bamberg and schmidt 2003 found that behavioral beliefs control beliefs and role beliefs could predict 51 of intent to drive a car similar to our results they found that habit has a strong effect on all six intention predictors 4 2 3 the revised tib the second model accounted for 50 of variance in intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops fig 3 personal norms β 0 60 is the strongest predictor of intentions followed by role beliefs β 0 44 and affect β 0 40 the sem result revealed that other paths to intention behavioral beliefs control beliefs and normative beliefs were also not significant sem also revealed that habit accounted for 52 of variance in personal norms 39 of variance in behavioral beliefs 61 of variance in control beliefs 52 of variance in normative beliefs 33 of variance in role beliefs and 40 of variance in affect the fit of the model depicted in fig 3 is rather good χ2 df 2 31 gfi 0 889 cfi 0 897 rmsea 0 072 the results of the study hypotheses based on the theory constructs are presented in table 3 5 discussion this study applied a well established but often overlooked social psychological model the theory of interpersonal behavior tib to investigate farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops the study has two main goals 1 to understand the factors that can predict the intention of farmers to switch from rice to less water dependent crops and 2 to test the application and efficacy of tib in terms of the intention of farmers in a non western developing country to change their crop cultivation practices as far as the first goal of the study is concerned the structural equation model sem we applied showed that in the absence of a path from habit to intention original model personal norms and role beliefs can determine about 17 variance in the farmers intention however in the presence of a path from habit to intention revised tib version personal norms affective considerations and role beliefs can jointly predict nearly 50 variance in intention in sum the sem revealed that in contrast to boots and treloar 2000 habit was not a predictor of farmers intention however in the presence of a path from habit to intention the explanatory power of the tib significantly increases from 17 to 50 thus a revised tib including these new paths emerged taken together the revised tib sufficiently calculated the farmers intention to switch from rice to less water dependent crops explaining 50 of the variation in the farmers intention in other words the results of our study suggest that the original tib is not a suitable model while the revised tib framework is an effective tool for investigating intention toward changing rice cultivation in our sample moreover our findings revealed that the new added path from habit to intention is an efficient way of improving the predictive power of tib this conclusion is based on armitage and conner s meta analysis 2001 which revealed that the mean prediction power of intention applying the theory of planned behavior tpb and the theory of reasoned action was about 39 it is also based on other research conducted in the water conservation domain in iran for example in their study rahimi et al 2017 found that tpb can predict 43 of the variance in farmers intention to conserve water furthermore yazdanpanah et al 2015a c found that social cognitive theory can predict 46 of intention in a sample of farmers in another study rahimi et al 2016 were able to predict 79 of the variance in farmers intention by applying the norm activation theory our finding illustrated that the revised tib framework is a useful framework for our research question an interesting finding of this research concerns the affect variable while affect did not have any significant effect on intention in the original model it has a significant impact on intention in the revised model in terms of the second goal of our study the results of our structural equation modelling revealed that personal norm is an important predictor of intention personal norms refer to an individual s beliefs regarding what is good or bad şimşekoğlu and lajunen 2008 while moral norms are the rules or values that a person has internalized and applies to their daily life through a set of self administered rewards or punishments arvola et al 2008 this result can be interpreted as follows due to the low cost of agricultural water and the fact that water use is subsidized in iran yazdanpanah et al 2014a changing the crop cultivation pattern to conserve more water constitutes a behavior that is more moral than rational in other words for farmers although the cultivation of rice on their farms has more economic benefits due to the water crisis they feel an obligation to conserve water by switching from rice to less water dependent crops this finding is supported by different studies molin 2005 cass et al 2010 our findings suggest that the more a farmer perceives his activities as a moral obligation to save water the greater his intention will be to engage in a high level of water conservation behavior from a policy implication perspective our study provides an explanation for applying a moral component in changing crop pattern policy therefore in the domain of changing crop patterns it will probably be useful to consider positive self rewarding feelings in order to motivate farmers to change rice cultivation it is important to note that islam as the dominant religion in iran and before it zoroastrianism have a special focus on the stewardship of nature particularly water in other words both religions have a clear massage regarding the protection stewardship and conservation of water and emphasizes that they are moral issues see balalii et al 2009 as such the protection and preservation of water resources is a self rewarding issue for muslims based on this argument muslims may potentially feel some responsibility to protect and save water in everyday life which implies that focusing on moral norms when attempting to change the rice cultivation policy has considerable potential for changing this cropping pattern therefore policies that try to reduce rice cultivation among farmers could consider that water saving by moving away from rice cultivation could be an important part of the farmers religious beliefs and expectations in this way encouraging farmers through formal and informal religious leaders is probably an easy and inexpensive way to create a positive moral obligation for changing rice cultivation among farmers in this study role beliefs also appear to be a determinant of farmers intention this means that the more farmers perceive themselves as water savers the greater their intention will be to switch from rice to less water dependent crops a body of studies in various domains have confirmed the relationship between role beliefs and intention yazdanpanah et al 2014a b yazdanpanah et al 2015a c yazdanpanah and forouzani 2015 whitmarsh and o neill 2010 our results demonstrate that to reduce rice cultivation among farmers motivating them to accept the role of being a water conservator will probably be an effective strategy some studies foltz 2002 balalii et al 2009 have noted that in iran similar to religious influences different cultural practices represent a consideration and tendency to protect respect and conserve water probably due to the country s arid and semi arid climate this suggests that water conserving behaviors are probably commonplace and ingrained in iranian citizens particularly farmers as such the protection of water resources has been seen as a duty by iranian society throughout history the more this role is accepted by people the higher their self belief will be and accordingly the better their intention regarding water conservation therefore society s expectations of individuals determine their intentions regarding specific issues our finding confirmed the finding of kantola et al 1983 cited in lam 1999 who found that an individual s willingness to conserve water significantly correlated with messages emphasizing a citizen s duty as such policy strategies that intend to reduce rice cultivation could consider that deciding to change rice cultivation is very important to one s role beliefs moreover policies that are designed to reduce rice cultivation could encourage farmers to embrace the role of water saver targeting the role beliefs of farmers probably presents an opportunity to change their cropping pattern furthermore communities should communicate the message of improving one s role beliefs by becoming a water saver to its members especially farmers who have a greater engagement with water and regard water conservation as a social and business duty in line with our findings on morality the duties of being a water saver in combination with the individual moral obligation to feel a religious duty in terms of water conservation activities would probably have the effect of making water conservation a very salient aspect of one s own role beliefs when taken together with the religious aspect highlighting these commitments and duties among the current generation could motivate them to accept a water saver role this is because iranian people particularly farmers are extremely proud of both their persian ancestry and their connections to islam affect is another predictor of farmers intention a body of literature onwezen 2015 bamberg et al 2007 onwezen et al 2013 han 2014 illustrated that emotion can lead to pro environmental intentions because individuals

s motivation to behave in a pro environmental way our result regarding emotion revealed that affects could be used in extension programs campaigns and interventions that aim to influence intention formation to change away from rice cultivation however for a more accurate view on this investigating the role of emotions in the context of conservation behavior is an important future research area

environmental behavior furthermore our results from an environmental psychology perspective contribute to the body of literature from a non western developing country acknowledgments we would like to
