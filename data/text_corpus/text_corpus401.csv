2005,rainfall erosivity is a crucial indicator of soil erosion that affects sediment management and agricultural security understanding the decadal change of rainfall erosivity during rainy season rers when soil erosion occurs most frequently is critical for environmental management and agricultural planning under climate change however whether rers in mainland china has experienced decadal change and how it responds to large scale climate indicators is unclear here the decadal changes of rers over mainland china and its underlying causes according to climate factors are investigated the multi scale moving t test was used to determine the rainy season and the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis was applied to divide mainland china into sub regions three abruption detection methods were used to determine the decadal variation of rers results show that 1 rers in china experienced different decadal change characteristics in different sub regions in the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers the decadal change of rers occurred around 2003 while rers showed a prominent increasing trend over northeastern and northern china after 2008 2 significant negative positive trend of rers over the yangtze river basin the source of three rivers after 2003 was related to enhanced monsoon and anomalous divergence convergence modulated by pacific decadal oscillation pdo by contrast the prominent increasing trend after 2008 over northeastern and northern china was correlated to the northern china cold vortex and atlantic and indian ocean warming 3 the non stationary characteristic between sea surface temperature sst and rers was reflected by the cross wavelet transform the influence of pdo over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers was shown as long term 8 13 years or short term 2 6 years resonant periods in contrast the effect of sst over the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean is mainly presented as short term resonant periods these results suggest that the decadal change of rers is closely related to the changes in sst and particular atmospheric circulation and understanding these oceanic and atmospheric dynamics is helpful for agricultural security and environmental management under rers changes keywords rainfall erosivity pdo decadal change atmospheric circulation sea surface temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion a global eco environmental problem has been the primary threat to agricultural security and river ecosystem sustainability sediment transportation caused by soil erosion could reduce the reservoir s lifetime contributing to the loss of reservoir storage jebari et al 2012 panagos et al 2015 rainfall erosivity is the potential capability of rainfall to affect soil erosion which reflects the limitation of zonal climatic conditions angulo martínez and beguería 2009 bezak et al 2021 nearing et al 2017 rainfall erosivity also influences soil erosion displacement processes for example sheet and rill erosion gullying and landslides beguería et al 2018 ferro et al 2020 reliable rainfall erosivity assessment is vital for environmental protection and sediment management lee and heo 2011 numerous investigations on the temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity have been carried out worldwide such as in italy padulano et al 2021 petroselli et al 2021 europe bezak et al 2021 switzerland lee et al 2022 brazil wp dos santos et al 2022 kenya watene et al 2021 turkey kilic and gunal 2021 and elsewhere in china soil erosion is one of the most severe environmental problems and the total eroded areas are approximately 3 million km2 equal to about 32 of mainland china in china rainfall erosivity varies substantially in time and space but previous research ignored rainfall erosivity during the rainy season rers the rainy season is when soil erosion occurs most severely and significantly impacts the environment moreover many works evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall erosivity in mainland china e g chen et al 2020 qin et al 2016 without considering the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall erosivity as an important factor on the national scale hence it is necessary to determine homogeneous regions based on the variability of rers in china at the continental scale to explore the driving factors of the change in rers large scale atmospheric circulation patterns which contribute to the temporal and spatial characteristics of rainfall are considered hu et al 2021 peatman et al 2021 yu et al 2021 previous studies have utilized statistical analysis to investigate the response of rainfall erosivity in china to climatic indicators for example jia et al 2022 and zhang et al 2022 discussed the influences of enso on rainfall erosivity in the loess plateau they found that enso was negatively related to rainfall erosivity on different time scales zhang et al 2021 analyzed the mechanism behind spatial temporal trends of rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin they reported that north atlantic oscillation shows a high correlation with rainfall erosivity it can be pointed out that previous studies mainly focus on the teleconnection between large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and rainfall erosivity at the regional scale it is unclear whether rers experienced abrupt changes and how it responds to climatic indicators on the national scale this research mainly focuses on detecting the decadal change points of rainfall erosivity during the rainy season and exploring sub regions in china sensitive to decadal change figuring out when how and where soil erosion changes in china could be more helpful for soil and water conservation and agricultural planning as compared to precipitation related climatic studies this paper will explore the characteristics of rers in mainland china nationally the homogeneous regions will be determined based on the spatial variability of rers the decadal change points of rers will be further investigated we will also explore the possible relationship between rers monsoon and sea surface temperature sst this study is of vital importance for helping environmental management under climate change the paper is organized as below section 2 describes the study area and the data used in this study followed by the methodology in section 3 results and discussion regarding spatiotemporal patterns of rers and their relationship to atmospheric circulation and sst are presented in section 4 the paper is concluded with a summary of the findings in section 5 2 study area and data mainland china 3 31 00 n 53 33 n a n d 73 29 59 79 e 135 2 30 e located in the middle latitude in eastern asia has an area of 9 6 million km2 most regions of china are controlled by monsoon climate and mountain plateau climate it leads to evident variation of precipitation spatially and temporally which aggravates soil erosion at the continental scale daily rainfall data in mainland china was obtained from the daily dataset of surface climate data in china v3 0 on the china meteorological data sharing service system http www nmic cn the dataset has 824 meteorological stations containing daily observation data such as precipitation winds evaporation and relative humidity all data were observed by automatic meteorological stations data quality was controlled based on the following six steps before being published by the china meteorological science data center 1 checking climatic limit values or allowable values 2 checking extreme values 3 checking internal consistency between fixed time value daily average value and daily extreme value 4 checking time consistency 5 checking space consistency 6 manual verification and correction daily rainfall data from 1960 to 2020 at 570 meteorological stations in mainland china were chosen in this study which is fewer than the meteorological stations shown in the dataset the screening conditions for the selected stations are 1 daily precipitation data at each station is deleted if the missing data is more than 5 per year 2 selected stations should have more than 48 years of daily data noaa extended reconstructed sst data were used to consider teleconnection between rers and sst huang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 in addition the national centers for environmental prediction national centers for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data were used to investigate circulation patterns kalnay et al 1996 3 methodology in this study the multi scale moving t test section 3 1 was used to determine onsets and retreats of rainy season the xie model xie et al 2016 was established to calculate rainfall erosivity section 3 2 moreover three abruption detection methods were applied to analyze abrupt changes in rers in individual sub regions section 3 3 the cross wavelet analysis was applied to explain further the relationship between rers and sea surface temperature section 3 4 3 1 determination of onset and retreat of rainy season the multi scale moving t test method was used to determine the onset and retreat of the rainy season it is a data originated objective method that does not require an ad hoc threshold many researchers have proved the rationality of the multi scale moving t test method in determining the rainy season wang et al 2016 the formula is 1 t n i x i 2 x i 1 n 1 2 s i 2 2 s i 1 2 1 2 where x i 1 x i 2 s i 1 2 and s i 2 2 defined as 2 x i 1 j i n i 1 x j n s i 1 2 j i n i 1 x j x i 1 2 n 1 3 x i 2 j i i n 1 x j n s i 2 2 j i i n 1 x j x i 2 2 n 1 4 t r n i t n i t 0 01 n and xi is daily precipitation for julian day i in one station within one year the sample size n is the length of the subsample n 30 31 182 or 183 x i 1 and x i 2 are averaged precipitation with the sample size n before and after julian day i respectively t r n i is the normalization of t n i by the 0 01 test value which is equal to the results of the mann kendall test at the 0 05 significance level the t r n i value is the threshold to detect abruption points the maximum value of t r n i was defined as the onset of rainy season where rainfall increases most obviously likewise a minimum t r n i value corresponds to the retreat of the rainy season 3 2 rainfall erosivity model various models using different rainfall data for calculating rainfall erosivity have been put forward due to the limited rainfall data zhang et al 2021 compared several models i e xie et al 2016 yu and rosewell 1996 zhang et al 2002 in estimating rainfall erosivity over mainland china they reported that the xie model xie et al 2016 is more accurate for calculating rainfall erosivity in mainland china due to its simple formula which could also reduce computing time as a consequence the xie model was used in this research to estimate rainfall erosivity the equation of which is as follows 5 r i α j 1 k p d β where r i is the rainfall erosivity of the i th half month during the rainy season mj m m hm 2 h 1 j 1 2 k refers to the number of days in the i th half month hm 2 refers to the hectare p d is the daily precipitation in the xie model the precipitation threshold is defined as 10 mm instead of 12 mm to avoid the underestimation of rainfall erosivity the parameter α was set to 0 3937 in the warm season may to september and 0 3101 from october to april and β was set to 1 7265 xie et al 2016 3 3 change point analysis three methods including the lepage test yonetani 1992 moving t test and yamamoto test yamamoto et al 1986 are used to detect the change points of the inter annual variation of rers over sub regions in china the moving t test mtt is widely used to detect change points in the hydrologic field which is not introduced in detail in this research equations about the lepage test and yamamoto test are presented as follows let x 1 and x 2 be sub sequence of inter annual rers with size n 1 and n 2 before and after the abruption year respectively where n 1 n 2 9 in this research a the lepage test the lepage test is a distribution free two sample test the equation of which is as follows 6 hk w e w 2 v w a e a 2 v a the test statistic hk of the lepage test is a sum of the squares of the standardized wilcoxon s ansariy bradley s statistics the most obvious difference is judged where the hk value is maximum each term of hk can be expressed as 7 w i 1 2 n i u i 8 e w 1 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 1 9 v w 1 12 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 10 a i 1 n i u i i n 1 2 n 2 n i 1 u i it is assumed that u i 1 0 if the i the most minor observation in a combined sample of size 2 n n 1 n 2 belongs to x 1 x 2 b the yamamoto test the yamamoto test determines the abruption point based on the signal to noise ratio r sn which can be calculated as follows 11 r sn x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 where x 1 x 2 and s 1 s 2 refer to the mean value and standard deviation of x 1 x 2 if the change point of inter annual variation of rers detected by the three methods is n this indicates that an inter annual variation occurred around the year n 1 n for instance if n equals 1990 the inter annual variation occurred in 1989 1990 3 4 the cross wavelet analysis the cross wavelet analysis xwt is an analytical technique combining cross spectrum analysis and continuous wavelet transform cwt the xwt can discover the variation of two time series data in both time and frequency domains through a standard power spectrum and phase structure maraun and kurths 2004 the morlet wavelet function is as follows 12 ψ t π 1 4 e j ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ψ t is resonant period t is time and ω 0 is the dimensionless frequency before xwt the time series of rers and sea surface temperature are transformed by cwt which is calculated as follows 13 w n x s θ s i 1 n x i ψ i n θ s where w n x s is the transformation coefficient θ is a time step s is a scale factor and n is the length of a time series the xwt is applied to detect the response characteristics of rers to climatic indicators whose formula is following grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 14 w n xy s w n x s w n y s where w n xy s is the cross wavelet spectrum of two time series x and y and w n y s denotes a complex conjugation of w n y s 4 results and discussion 4 1 decadal variations of rers in order to better detect the decadal characteristics of rers in china several sub regions in mainland china were chosen based on the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis reof of the standardized rers during 1961 2020 fig 1 these sub regions are generally recognized as physiographical zoning of china the first 9 reofs account for 34 3 of the total variance based on the anomalous center of each reof six subregions were selected northeastern china nec 42 54 n 121 136 e fig 1a the yellow river basin yr 32 5 42 n 102 113 e fig 1b the yangtze river basin yzr 27 32 5 n 103 118 e fig 1c northern china nc 32 5 42 n 113 128

the origin of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang river variance contributions of reof are more dispersed than eof s so the variances are not large high loadings are concentrated on a small area for reof which can be used to divide spatiotemporally consistent regions the k means cluster analysis was also applied to classify spatially coherent and temporally consistent regions over china not shown mainland china is divided into four sub regions by the k means cluster analysis each sub region includes several generally recognized physiographical zones of china water and environmental management are under the jurisdiction of the basin or region authorities therefore a smaller area divided by reof which contains only one physiographical zone in china could provide more helpful information for water resources management and agricultural planning rainfall erosivity is calculated by the xie model and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 2 in general rers decreases from southeast to northwest and northeast among sub regions rers in the source of three rivers ranging from 0 to 100 mj m m hm 2 h 1 is smaller compared to other regions of china rers in the yellow river basin and northeastern china increased from the north 0 100 mj m m hm 2 h 1 to south 100 300 mj m m hm 2 h 1 northern china showed median values of rers compared to other sub regions 100 400 mj m m hm 2 h 1 spatial differences were relatively large over the yangtze river basin with values in the range of 300 and 600 mj m m hm 2 h 1 which increased from the upper reach to the lower reach in general rers increased from north to south over southern china with the highest values compared to other sub regions 500 1000 mj m m hm 2 h 1 the spatial patterns of rers correlated to the difference in water vapor transportation during the rainy season between eastern and western china huang and chen 2010 the strengthened monsoon circulation during the rainy season could bring sufficient water vapor to eastern and southern china which contributes to larger rers cao et al 2018 comparatively northwestern china is mainly influenced by the tibetan plateau therefore the monsoon circulation during the rainy season cannot reach there instead water vapor transportation relies on the mid latitude westerlies far less than summer monsoon circulation transportation consequently rers over northern and western china is much less than that over southern and eastern china fig 3 a 3c present the rainfall stations where rers experienced a decadal variation after the late 1990s and the corresponding abruption year is detected by the lepage fig 3a mtt fig 3b and yamamoto fig 3c test the abruption change points which occurred most frequently in each sub region are summarized in fig 3d all abrupt change points are statistically significant at the 0 05 level the abruption points detected by the three methods are somewhat different due to their intrinsic differences it can be seen from fig 3 that most abrupt change points of rers over southern china are not significant at the 0 05 level therefore the area averaged rers over southern china is regarded as no abrupt change in addition there is also no strong evidence for region averaged abruption years over the yellow river basin because different region averaged change points were detected by the three methods rers over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers experienced a decadal variation firstly which occurred mainly during 2002 2006 fig 3a c following the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers northern china underwent a shift change of phase during 2005 2008 where the decadal variation occurred most frequently in 2008 fig 3d finally the decadal variation of rers over northeastern china is the latest occurring mainly during 2007 2010 fig 3a c it can be pointed out from fig 3d that decadal variation occurred most frequently in 2009 over northeastern china in summary the decadal change in southern china occurred earlier than in northern china specifically the decadal change of region averaged rers occurred in 2003 over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers then over northern china and northeastern china in 2008 2009 consequently 2003 and 2008 were chosen as representative years for the two decadal variations over mainland china to compare and analyze their essential characteristics fig 4 shows the inter annual and decadal changes in rers for sub regions in china during 1960 2020 it can be pointed out that rers over six sub regions presents pronounced variability in the 1960s rers over nec nc and str experienced a decadal decrease but a decadal increase was shown over sc in the 1970s the decadal trends of rers over nec str and sc were similar to that in the 1960s however rers over nc experienced an obviously increasing trend in the 1970s in the 1980s rers over nec nc and yzr presented prominent increasing decreasing variation in the 1990s rers over yr str and yzr increased significantly with rers in other sub regions fluctuating in the 2000s rers over nec nc str and sc have increasing trends for the decadal variation after the 2000s only rers over nec kept its increasing trend the decadal variation could present the overall variability of rers over sub regions a more detailed variability analysis should be based on the station analysis shown in fig 5 to better distinguish the characteristics of the two decadal changes the anomalies of rers for decadal change around 2003 were computed using the mean value for 2004 2012 minus that for 1995 2003 similarly the anomalies around 2008 were calculated by the mean from 2009 to 2017 minus 2000 2008 the anomalies using the 7 yr mean and 11 yr mean for each period were also calculated not shown and the results changed slightly fig 5 presents rers anomalies in mainland china it can be pointed out that rers anomalies are mainly located over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin for decadal variation around 2003 the region averaged rers decreased by 144 288 mj m m hm 2 h 1 over the yangtze river basin and increased approximately by 144 mj m m hm 2 h 1 over the source of three rivers for decadal variation around 2008 rers anomalies were mainly concentrated in northern china and northeastern china the positive anomalies for the majority of northern china and northeastern china are larger than 144 mj m m hm 2 h 1 in summary rers anomalies mainly occurred over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin around 2003 with increasing and decreasing trends respectively for decadal variation around 2008 anomalies were mainly located in northern china and northeastern china with an increasing trend for the majority the decadal variation of rers in mainland china is correlated to atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature changes which were investigated in the next section 4 2 relationship between rers and atmospheric circulation and sst 4 2 1 links between rers and atmospheric circulation fig 6 presents wind anomalies during the rainy season around china for the decadal change around 2003 and 2008 at 850 and 700 hpa levels fig 7 shows the water vapor flux and its divergence fields during the rainy season corresponding to the decal changes it can be pointed out from fig 6a b that the monsoon strengthened over the yangtze river basin from 2003 to 2012 as compared to 1993 2002 strengthened monsoon enhanced anomalous divergence over the yangtze river basin fig 7a 7b therefore rers over the yangtze river basin decreased in addition moisture is transported northward and westward under the influence of the strengthened monsoon the source of three rivers is mainly located in the monsoon border zone where anomalous convergence occurs stronger water vapor convergence after 2003 could bring more rainfall over the source of three rivers and contribute to severer rers for the decadal change around 2008 there was a cyclonic anomaly over northern china it can be pointed out from fig 6c 6d that the cyclonic anomaly strengthened over northern china after 2008 which is favorable for water vapor transport from the south to the north over east asia in addition the anomalous divergence enhanced after 2008 fig 7c 7d it is consistent with increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china after 2008 in summary increasing decreasing rers over the source of three rivers the yangtze river basin around 2003 is correlated to enhanced monsoon and anomalous convergence divergence enhanced circulation over northeastern china is responsible for increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china 4 2 2 links between rers and sst fig 8 presents sst anomalies corresponding to the decadal change of rers over china around 2003 and 2008 shaded areas indicate that the anomalies are statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level it can be pointed out from fig 8a that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers are correlated to the phase shift of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo to a negative phase compared with sst anomalies for decadal change around 2003 the negative phase of pdo weakened significantly and the indian and atlantic oceans experienced pronounced warming around 2008 fig 8b fig 8 shows that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers northern china and northeastern china that occurred around 2003 2008 were related to pdo sst in indian and atlantic oceans to further explore the relationship between climate indicators and rers anomalies the cross wavelet transform xwt was applied in this study fig 9 in these diagrams the variation of the power spectrum was presented as the colored stripes and the resonant period shown by a thick black contour passed was significant at the 0 05 level the relative phase relationship is presented as arrows where is the in phase arrow and represents the variation of climatic indicator and rers is synchronous positive correlation is an anti phase arrow donating both of two factors is a negative correlation indicates the variation of rers lags behind that of the climatic indicator with one fourth of the resonant period and represents the variation of rers is ahead of the large climate index with one fourth of the resonant period grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2021 two significant resonant periods were found between rers over the yangtze river basin and pdo fig 9a during 1990 2003 rers over the yangtze river basin and pdo have a 7 12 years resonant period meanwhile a 3 5 years resonant period was identified during 1994 2003 in terms of the transformation of phase arrows it can be pointed out that these two periods were pointing in the opposite direction that is 270 within 7 12 years whereas 90 within 3 5 years it suggested that the variation of rers within 7 12 years varied faster than pdo with one fourth of the resonant period while the change of rers lagged behind that of pdo within 3 5 years similar to fig 9a short term and long term periods were also found between pdo and rers over the source of three rivers str there are three significant resonant periods two short term periods of 1 2 years and 2 6 years occurred in 1997 2002 and 1989 1999 respectively there was also one long term period 8 13 years from 1988 to 2009 it should be pointed out that these periods were in different directions that is 90 within 1 2 years 0 within 2 6 years and 180 within 8 13 years this founding suggested that short term pdo was ahead of or negatively related to rers over str while the variation of long term pdo changed synchronously with rers over str from 1988 to 2009 it can be pointed out from fig 8b that sst over the indian ocean 50 e 100 e 60 s 0 s and atlantic 50 w 10 e 60 s 40 s contributed to the decadal change of rers over northern china and northeastern china consequently sst anomalies over these two regions were calculated to explore their relationship to rers over nec and nc unlike fig 9a b only short term periods were found between sst over the indian ocean and rers in northeastern china fig 9c there are two short term periods with 1 2 years and 2 4 years occurring in 2010 2015 and 1988 2001 respectively it should notice that the variation of rers over northeastern china lagged behind that of sst over the indian ocean for 1 2 years while rers varied synchronously with sst for 2 4 years similar to fig 9c short term periods were found between sst over the indian ocean and rers in northern china which were concentrated in 1 6 years and their power spectrums were approximately 2 0 these short term periods were pointing in the opposite direction that is 90 in 1998 2003 whereas 270 in 1966 1971 and 1984 1991 this founding suggested that rers in northern china lagged behind sst with 2 6 years while varying faster than sst with one fourth of the resonant period there was one resonant period between rers over northeastern china and atlantic sst 50 w 10 e 60 s 40 s that appeared in 1987 1999 which is significant at the 0 05 level fig 9e during this period the phase angles pointed straight down indicating the response of rers lagged behind the variation of sst over the atlantic ocean for 2 5 years similar to fig 9e one resonant period occurred from 1984 to 1994 over northern china and atlantic sst was presented by xwt the upward pointing arrows reflected that the rers in northern china was ahead of sst over the atlantic ocean by the one fourth period in summary the variation of rers over sub regions in mainland china could be related to different sst indicators the influence of pdo over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers can be shown as long term or short term periods which is non stationary in contrast the effect of sst over the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean is mainly presented as short term resonant periods the phase structure of xwt showed the part of similarity between rers and sst 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 the difference and connection between rainfall and rainfall erosivity it can be pointed out that the formula to calculate rainfall erosivity eq 5 only have one variable daily rainfall so the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation affect the heterogeneity of rainfall erosivity qin et al 2016 previous researchers have also demonstrated that precipitation and rainfall erosivity are correlated capolongo et al 2008 mello et al 2013 xu et al 2021 however their difference mainly lies in the parameters α β calculating rainfall erosivity these two parameters refer to the kinetic energy of precipitation which could reflect the erosion of rainfall to the soil therefore rainfall erosivity considers not only the amount of rainfall but also the damage ability of precipitation to the soil 4 3 2 physical mechanism over the teleconnection between climatic fluctuations and the regional rainfall erosivity variability climate anomalies could affect the amount and intensity of rainfall by atmospheric circulation and cause soil erosion rainstorms and their corresponding erosivity are highly sensitive to climatic oscillations xu et al 2019 strengthened monsoon after 2003 could contribute to enhanced anomalous divergence fig 6a b fig 7a b which is responsible for the variability of rers over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers hari et al 2020 reported that the intertropical convergence zone has strengthened and propagated northward since 2002 which could explain the enhanced monsoon after 2002 found in this research further research has demonstrated that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers are correlated to the phase shift of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo to a negative phase fig 8a liu et al 2021 reported that the influences of the east asian monsoon on rainfall over the yangtze river basin are modulated by pdo an anomalous anti cyclone in the low level over the western north pacific during the rainy season could enhance southerlies over the coast of east asia it could contribute to a stronger east asian summer monsoon modulated by pdo chen et al 2013 it is consistent with our research strengthened cyclonic anomaly and anomalous divergence after 2008 fig 6c d fig 7c d are responsible for increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china occurred after 2008 fig 5b the cutoff low manifesting as a closed cyclonic circulation in the upper and middle troposphere xie and bueh 2015 could contribute to northern china cold vortex nccv nccv is the main factor influencing climate conditions during the rainy season in northeastern china and northern china which often contributes to low temperatures and more precipitation cong et al 2021 xue et al 2022 further research has demonstrated that rers anomalies over northeastern china and northern china are related to indian and atlantic warming fig 8b on the interannual time scale the atmospheric circulation anomalies during the rainy season over the north atlantic could excite stationary rossby waves in eurasia by modulating the position of the north atlantic storm track and affecting rainfall over the tibetan plateau bothe et al 2010 moreover the maintenance of the block over the sea of okhotsk which is in phase with stationary rossby waves over the tibetan plateau could favor the maintenance of nccv circulation wang et al 2011 han et al 2018 reported that the influences of indian ocean warming are positively related to precipitation in northeastern china which is consistent with our research 4 3 3 limitations and uncertainties of the research this research focuses on rainfall erosivity to reflect soil erosion soil erosion is affected by rainfall erosivity slope length slope steepness and soil properties among these factors slope length slope steepness and soil properties cannot change dramatically in a short time but may also have significant variations in the decadal time scale for example decreasing vegetation coverage has been found in some sub regions in china liu et al 2020 these elements were not considered in this research due to the limitation of accessible data although soil erosion is mainly driven by changes in rainfall erosivity further research including more soil information such as vegetation coverage changes could be more helpful for soil erosion monitoring 5 conclusions this study investigated the decadal changes of rers in mainland china and their underlying causes it was found that rers decreased from southeast to northwest and northeast six sub regions were selected based on the reof analysis of the standardized rers from 1961 to 2020 northeastern china the yellow river basin the yangtze river basin northern china southern china and the source of three rivers rainfall erosivity during rainy season in china experienced different decadal variation characteristics in different sub regions in the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers the decadal variation of rers occurred around 2003 while rers showed a prominent increasing trend over northeastern and northern china after 2008 the decadal changes of rers mainly occurred over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin around 2003 with increasing and decreasing trends respectively pdo is a primary driver for the decadal change of the east asian monsoon which could affect rainfall over the yangtze river basin increasing decreasing rers over the source of three rivers the yangtze river basin around 2003 is related to enhanced monsoon and anomalous convergence divergence a further connection between rers and pdo was explored by the cross wavelet analysis xwt the non stationary feature between pdo and rers on the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers can be presented as long term or short term periods for decadal change around 2008 anomalies were mainly concentrated in northern and northeastern china with an increasing trend atlantic and indian ocean warming could excite rossby waves in eurasia and favor the maintenance of the block over the sea of okhotsk contributing to the maintenance of nccv circulation more nccv caused by enhanced circulation over northeastern china is responsible for increasing rers

2005,rainfall erosivity is a crucial indicator of soil erosion that affects sediment management and agricultural security understanding the decadal change of rainfall erosivity during rainy season rers when soil erosion occurs most frequently is critical for environmental management and agricultural planning under climate change however whether rers in mainland china has experienced decadal change and how it responds to large scale climate indicators is unclear here the decadal changes of rers over mainland china and its underlying causes according to climate factors are investigated the multi scale moving t test was used to determine the rainy season and the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis was applied to divide mainland china into sub regions three abruption detection methods were used to determine the decadal variation of rers results show that 1 rers in china experienced different decadal change characteristics in different sub regions in the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers the decadal change of rers occurred around 2003 while rers showed a prominent increasing trend over northeastern and northern china after 2008 2 significant negative positive trend of rers over the yangtze river basin the source of three rivers after 2003 was related to enhanced monsoon and anomalous divergence convergence modulated by pacific decadal oscillation pdo by contrast the prominent increasing trend after 2008 over northeastern and northern china was correlated to the northern china cold vortex and atlantic and indian ocean warming 3 the non stationary characteristic between sea surface temperature sst and rers was reflected by the cross wavelet transform the influence of pdo over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers was shown as long term 8 13 years or short term 2 6 years resonant periods in contrast the effect of sst over the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean is mainly presented as short term resonant periods these results suggest that the decadal change of rers is closely related to the changes in sst and particular atmospheric circulation and understanding these oceanic and atmospheric dynamics is helpful for agricultural security and environmental management under rers changes keywords rainfall erosivity pdo decadal change atmospheric circulation sea surface temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil erosion a global eco environmental problem has been the primary threat to agricultural security and river ecosystem sustainability sediment transportation caused by soil erosion could reduce the reservoir s lifetime contributing to the loss of reservoir storage jebari et al 2012 panagos et al 2015 rainfall erosivity is the potential capability of rainfall to affect soil erosion which reflects the limitation of zonal climatic conditions angulo martínez and beguería 2009 bezak et al 2021 nearing et al 2017 rainfall erosivity also influences soil erosion displacement processes for example sheet and rill erosion gullying and landslides beguería et al 2018 ferro et al 2020 reliable rainfall erosivity assessment is vital for environmental protection and sediment management lee and heo 2011 numerous investigations on the temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity have been carried out worldwide such as in italy padulano et al 2021 petroselli et al 2021 europe bezak et al 2021 switzerland lee et al 2022 brazil wp dos santos et al 2022 kenya watene et al 2021 turkey kilic and gunal 2021 and elsewhere in china soil erosion is one of the most severe environmental problems and the total eroded areas are approximately 3 million km2 equal to about 32 of mainland china in china rainfall erosivity varies substantially in time and space but previous research ignored rainfall erosivity during the rainy season rers the rainy season is when soil erosion occurs most severely and significantly impacts the environment moreover many works evaluated the spatiotemporal variations in rainfall erosivity in mainland china e g chen et al 2020 qin et al 2016 without considering the spatial heterogeneity of rainfall erosivity as an important factor on the national scale hence it is necessary to determine homogeneous regions based on the variability of rers in china at the continental scale to explore the driving factors of the change in rers large scale atmospheric circulation patterns which contribute to the temporal and spatial characteristics of rainfall are considered hu et al 2021 peatman et al 2021 yu et al 2021 previous studies have utilized statistical analysis to investigate the response of rainfall erosivity in china to climatic indicators for example jia et al 2022 and zhang et al 2022 discussed the influences of enso on rainfall erosivity in the loess plateau they found that enso was negatively related to rainfall erosivity on different time scales zhang et al 2021 analyzed the mechanism behind spatial temporal trends of rainfall erosivity in the wei river basin they reported that north atlantic oscillation shows a high correlation with rainfall erosivity it can be pointed out that previous studies mainly focus on the teleconnection between large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and rainfall erosivity at the regional scale it is unclear whether rers experienced abrupt changes and how it responds to climatic indicators on the national scale this research mainly focuses on detecting the decadal change points of rainfall erosivity during the rainy season and exploring sub regions in china sensitive to decadal change figuring out when how and where soil erosion changes in china could be more helpful for soil and water conservation and agricultural planning as compared to precipitation related climatic studies this paper will explore the characteristics of rers in mainland china nationally the homogeneous regions will be determined based on the spatial variability of rers the decadal change points of rers will be further investigated we will also explore the possible relationship between rers monsoon and sea surface temperature sst this study is of vital importance for helping environmental management under climate change the paper is organized as below section 2 describes the study area and the data used in this study followed by the methodology in section 3 results and discussion regarding spatiotemporal patterns of rers and their relationship to atmospheric circulation and sst are presented in section 4 the paper is concluded with a summary of the findings in section 5 2 study area and data mainland china 3 31 00 n 53 33 n a n d 73 29 59 79 e 135 2 30 e located in the middle latitude in eastern asia has an area of 9 6 million km2 most regions of china are controlled by monsoon climate and mountain plateau climate it leads to evident variation of precipitation spatially and temporally which aggravates soil erosion at the continental scale daily rainfall data in mainland china was obtained from the daily dataset of surface climate data in china v3 0 on the china meteorological data sharing service system http www nmic cn the dataset has 824 meteorological stations containing daily observation data such as precipitation winds evaporation and relative humidity all data were observed by automatic meteorological stations data quality was controlled based on the following six steps before being published by the china meteorological science data center 1 checking climatic limit values or allowable values 2 checking extreme values 3 checking internal consistency between fixed time value daily average value and daily extreme value 4 checking time consistency 5 checking space consistency 6 manual verification and correction daily rainfall data from 1960 to 2020 at 570 meteorological stations in mainland china were chosen in this study which is fewer than the meteorological stations shown in the dataset the screening conditions for the selected stations are 1 daily precipitation data at each station is deleted if the missing data is more than 5 per year 2 selected stations should have more than 48 years of daily data noaa extended reconstructed sst data were used to consider teleconnection between rers and sst huang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 liu et al 2015 in addition the national centers for environmental prediction national centers for atmospheric research ncep ncar reanalysis data were used to investigate circulation patterns kalnay et al 1996 3 methodology in this study the multi scale moving t test section 3 1 was used to determine onsets and retreats of rainy season the xie model xie et al 2016 was established to calculate rainfall erosivity section 3 2 moreover three abruption detection methods were applied to analyze abrupt changes in rers in individual sub regions section 3 3 the cross wavelet analysis was applied to explain further the relationship between rers and sea surface temperature section 3 4 3 1 determination of onset and retreat of rainy season the multi scale moving t test method was used to determine the onset and retreat of the rainy season it is a data originated objective method that does not require an ad hoc threshold many researchers have proved the rationality of the multi scale moving t test method in determining the rainy season wang et al 2016 the formula is 1 t n i x i 2 x i 1 n 1 2 s i 2 2 s i 1 2 1 2 where x i 1 x i 2 s i 1 2 and s i 2 2 defined as 2 x i 1 j i n i 1 x j n s i 1 2 j i n i 1 x j x i 1 2 n 1 3 x i 2 j i i n 1 x j n s i 2 2 j i i n 1 x j x i 2 2 n 1 4 t r n i t n i t 0 01 n and xi is daily precipitation for julian day i in one station within one year the sample size n is the length of the subsample n 30 31 182 or 183 x i 1 and x i 2 are averaged precipitation with the sample size n before and after julian day i respectively t r n i is the normalization of t n i by the 0 01 test value which is equal to the results of the mann kendall test at the 0 05 significance level the t r n i value is the threshold to detect abruption points the maximum value of t r n i was defined as the onset of rainy season where rainfall increases most obviously likewise a minimum t r n i value corresponds to the retreat of the rainy season 3 2 rainfall erosivity model various models using different rainfall data for calculating rainfall erosivity have been put forward due to the limited rainfall data zhang et al 2021 compared several models i e xie et al 2016 yu and rosewell 1996 zhang et al 2002 in estimating rainfall erosivity over mainland china they reported that the xie model xie et al 2016 is more accurate for calculating rainfall erosivity in mainland china due to its simple formula which could also reduce computing time as a consequence the xie model was used in this research to estimate rainfall erosivity the equation of which is as follows 5 r i α j 1 k p d β where r i is the rainfall erosivity of the i th half month during the rainy season mj m m hm 2 h 1 j 1 2 k refers to the number of days in the i th half month hm 2 refers to the hectare p d is the daily precipitation in the xie model the precipitation threshold is defined as 10 mm instead of 12 mm to avoid the underestimation of rainfall erosivity the parameter α was set to 0 3937 in the warm season may to september and 0 3101 from october to april and β was set to 1 7265 xie et al 2016 3 3 change point analysis three methods including the lepage test yonetani 1992 moving t test and yamamoto test yamamoto et al 1986 are used to detect the change points of the inter annual variation of rers over sub regions in china the moving t test mtt is widely used to detect change points in the hydrologic field which is not introduced in detail in this research equations about the lepage test and yamamoto test are presented as follows let x 1 and x 2 be sub sequence of inter annual rers with size n 1 and n 2 before and after the abruption year respectively where n 1 n 2 9 in this research a the lepage test the lepage test is a distribution free two sample test the equation of which is as follows 6 hk w e w 2 v w a e a 2 v a the test statistic hk of the lepage test is a sum of the squares of the standardized wilcoxon s ansariy bradley s statistics the most obvious difference is judged where the hk value is maximum each term of hk can be expressed as 7 w i 1 2 n i u i 8 e w 1 2 n 1 n 1 n 2 1 9 v w 1 12 n 1 n 2 n 1 n 2 1 10 a i 1 n i u i i n 1 2 n 2 n i 1 u i it is assumed that u i 1 0 if the i the most minor observation in a combined sample of size 2 n n 1 n 2 belongs to x 1 x 2 b the yamamoto test the yamamoto test determines the abruption point based on the signal to noise ratio r sn which can be calculated as follows 11 r sn x 1 x 2 s 1 s 2 where x 1 x 2 and s 1 s 2 refer to the mean value and standard deviation of x 1 x 2 if the change point of inter annual variation of rers detected by the three methods is n this indicates that an inter annual variation occurred around the year n 1 n for instance if n equals 1990 the inter annual variation occurred in 1989 1990 3 4 the cross wavelet analysis the cross wavelet analysis xwt is an analytical technique combining cross spectrum analysis and continuous wavelet transform cwt the xwt can discover the variation of two time series data in both time and frequency domains through a standard power spectrum and phase structure maraun and kurths 2004 the morlet wavelet function is as follows 12 ψ t π 1 4 e j ω 0 t e t 2 2 where ψ t is resonant period t is time and ω 0 is the dimensionless frequency before xwt the time series of rers and sea surface temperature are transformed by cwt which is calculated as follows 13 w n x s θ s i 1 n x i ψ i n θ s where w n x s is the transformation coefficient θ is a time step s is a scale factor and n is the length of a time series the xwt is applied to detect the response characteristics of rers to climatic indicators whose formula is following grinsted et al 2004 torrence and compo 1998 14 w n xy s w n x s w n y s where w n xy s is the cross wavelet spectrum of two time series x and y and w n y s denotes a complex conjugation of w n y s 4 results and discussion 4 1 decadal variations of rers in order to better detect the decadal characteristics of rers in china several sub regions in mainland china were chosen based on the rotated empirical orthogonal function analysis reof of the standardized rers during 1961 2020 fig 1 these sub regions are generally recognized as physiographical zoning of china the first 9 reofs account for 34 3 of the total variance based on the anomalous center of each reof six subregions were selected northeastern china nec 42 54 n 121 136 e fig 1a the yellow river basin yr 32 5 42 n 102 113 e fig 1b the yangtze river basin yzr 27 32 5 n 103 118 e fig 1c northern china nc 32 5 42 n 113 128

the origin of the yangtze river yellow river and lancang river variance contributions of reof are more dispersed than eof s so the variances are not large high loadings are concentrated on a small area for reof which can be used to divide spatiotemporally consistent regions the k means cluster analysis was also applied to classify spatially coherent and temporally consistent regions over china not shown mainland china is divided into four sub regions by the k means cluster analysis each sub region includes several generally recognized physiographical zones of china water and environmental management are under the jurisdiction of the basin or region authorities therefore a smaller area divided by reof which contains only one physiographical zone in china could provide more helpful information for water resources management and agricultural planning rainfall erosivity is calculated by the xie model and its spatial distribution is shown in fig 2 in general rers decreases from southeast to northwest and northeast among sub regions rers in the source of three rivers ranging from 0 to 100 mj m m hm 2 h 1 is smaller compared to other regions of china rers in the yellow river basin and northeastern china increased from the north 0 100 mj m m hm 2 h 1 to south 100 300 mj m m hm 2 h 1 northern china showed median values of rers compared to other sub regions 100 400 mj m m hm 2 h 1 spatial differences were relatively large over the yangtze river basin with values in the range of 300 and 600 mj m m hm 2 h 1 which increased from the upper reach to the lower reach in general rers increased from north to south over southern china with the highest values compared to other sub regions 500 1000 mj m m hm 2 h 1 the spatial patterns of rers correlated to the difference in water vapor transportation during the rainy season between eastern and western china huang and chen 2010 the strengthened monsoon circulation during the rainy season could bring sufficient water vapor to eastern and southern china which contributes to larger rers cao et al 2018 comparatively northwestern china is mainly influenced by the tibetan plateau therefore the monsoon circulation during the rainy season cannot reach there instead water vapor transportation relies on the mid latitude westerlies far less than summer monsoon circulation transportation consequently rers over northern and western china is much less than that over southern and eastern china fig 3 a 3c present the rainfall stations where rers experienced a decadal variation after the late 1990s and the corresponding abruption year is detected by the lepage fig 3a mtt fig 3b and yamamoto fig 3c test the abruption change points which occurred most frequently in each sub region are summarized in fig 3d all abrupt change points are statistically significant at the 0 05 level the abruption points detected by the three methods are somewhat different due to their intrinsic differences it can be seen from fig 3 that most abrupt change points of rers over southern china are not significant at the 0 05 level therefore the area averaged rers over southern china is regarded as no abrupt change in addition there is also no strong evidence for region averaged abruption years over the yellow river basin because different region averaged change points were detected by the three methods rers over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers experienced a decadal variation firstly which occurred mainly during 2002 2006 fig 3a c following the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers northern china underwent a shift change of phase during 2005 2008 where the decadal variation occurred most frequently in 2008 fig 3d finally the decadal variation of rers over northeastern china is the latest occurring mainly during 2007 2010 fig 3a c it can be pointed out from fig 3d that decadal variation occurred most frequently in 2009 over northeastern china in summary the decadal change in southern china occurred earlier than in northern china specifically the decadal change of region averaged rers occurred in 2003 over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers then over northern china and northeastern china in 2008 2009 consequently 2003 and 2008 were chosen as representative years for the two decadal variations over mainland china to compare and analyze their essential characteristics fig 4 shows the inter annual and decadal changes in rers for sub regions in china during 1960 2020 it can be pointed out that rers over six sub regions presents pronounced variability in the 1960s rers over nec nc and str experienced a decadal decrease but a decadal increase was shown over sc in the 1970s the decadal trends of rers over nec str and sc were similar to that in the 1960s however rers over nc experienced an obviously increasing trend in the 1970s in the 1980s rers over nec nc and yzr presented prominent increasing decreasing variation in the 1990s rers over yr str and yzr increased significantly with rers in other sub regions fluctuating in the 2000s rers over nec nc str and sc have increasing trends for the decadal variation after the 2000s only rers over nec kept its increasing trend the decadal variation could present the overall variability of rers over sub regions a more detailed variability analysis should be based on the station analysis shown in fig 5 to better distinguish the characteristics of the two decadal changes the anomalies of rers for decadal change around 2003 were computed using the mean value for 2004 2012 minus that for 1995 2003 similarly the anomalies around 2008 were calculated by the mean from 2009 to 2017 minus 2000 2008 the anomalies using the 7 yr mean and 11 yr mean for each period were also calculated not shown and the results changed slightly fig 5 presents rers anomalies in mainland china it can be pointed out that rers anomalies are mainly located over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin for decadal variation around 2003 the region averaged rers decreased by 144 288 mj m m hm 2 h 1 over the yangtze river basin and increased approximately by 144 mj m m hm 2 h 1 over the source of three rivers for decadal variation around 2008 rers anomalies were mainly concentrated in northern china and northeastern china the positive anomalies for the majority of northern china and northeastern china are larger than 144 mj m m hm 2 h 1 in summary rers anomalies mainly occurred over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin around 2003 with increasing and decreasing trends respectively for decadal variation around 2008 anomalies were mainly located in northern china and northeastern china with an increasing trend for the majority the decadal variation of rers in mainland china is correlated to atmospheric circulation and sea surface temperature changes which were investigated in the next section 4 2 relationship between rers and atmospheric circulation and sst 4 2 1 links between rers and atmospheric circulation fig 6 presents wind anomalies during the rainy season around china for the decadal change around 2003 and 2008 at 850 and 700 hpa levels fig 7 shows the water vapor flux and its divergence fields during the rainy season corresponding to the decal changes it can be pointed out from fig 6a b that the monsoon strengthened over the yangtze river basin from 2003 to 2012 as compared to 1993 2002 strengthened monsoon enhanced anomalous divergence over the yangtze river basin fig 7a 7b therefore rers over the yangtze river basin decreased in addition moisture is transported northward and westward under the influence of the strengthened monsoon the source of three rivers is mainly located in the monsoon border zone where anomalous convergence occurs stronger water vapor convergence after 2003 could bring more rainfall over the source of three rivers and contribute to severer rers for the decadal change around 2008 there was a cyclonic anomaly over northern china it can be pointed out from fig 6c 6d that the cyclonic anomaly strengthened over northern china after 2008 which is favorable for water vapor transport from the south to the north over east asia in addition the anomalous divergence enhanced after 2008 fig 7c 7d it is consistent with increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china after 2008 in summary increasing decreasing rers over the source of three rivers the yangtze river basin around 2003 is correlated to enhanced monsoon and anomalous convergence divergence enhanced circulation over northeastern china is responsible for increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china 4 2 2 links between rers and sst fig 8 presents sst anomalies corresponding to the decadal change of rers over china around 2003 and 2008 shaded areas indicate that the anomalies are statistically significant at the 0 05 significance level it can be pointed out from fig 8a that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers are correlated to the phase shift of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo to a negative phase compared with sst anomalies for decadal change around 2003 the negative phase of pdo weakened significantly and the indian and atlantic oceans experienced pronounced warming around 2008 fig 8b fig 8 shows that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers northern china and northeastern china that occurred around 2003 2008 were related to pdo sst in indian and atlantic oceans to further explore the relationship between climate indicators and rers anomalies the cross wavelet transform xwt was applied in this study fig 9 in these diagrams the variation of the power spectrum was presented as the colored stripes and the resonant period shown by a thick black contour passed was significant at the 0 05 level the relative phase relationship is presented as arrows where is the in phase arrow and represents the variation of climatic indicator and rers is synchronous positive correlation is an anti phase arrow donating both of two factors is a negative correlation indicates the variation of rers lags behind that of the climatic indicator with one fourth of the resonant period and represents the variation of rers is ahead of the large climate index with one fourth of the resonant period grinsted et al 2004 liu et al 2018 xu et al 2021 two significant resonant periods were found between rers over the yangtze river basin and pdo fig 9a during 1990 2003 rers over the yangtze river basin and pdo have a 7 12 years resonant period meanwhile a 3 5 years resonant period was identified during 1994 2003 in terms of the transformation of phase arrows it can be pointed out that these two periods were pointing in the opposite direction that is 270 within 7 12 years whereas 90 within 3 5 years it suggested that the variation of rers within 7 12 years varied faster than pdo with one fourth of the resonant period while the change of rers lagged behind that of pdo within 3 5 years similar to fig 9a short term and long term periods were also found between pdo and rers over the source of three rivers str there are three significant resonant periods two short term periods of 1 2 years and 2 6 years occurred in 1997 2002 and 1989 1999 respectively there was also one long term period 8 13 years from 1988 to 2009 it should be pointed out that these periods were in different directions that is 90 within 1 2 years 0 within 2 6 years and 180 within 8 13 years this founding suggested that short term pdo was ahead of or negatively related to rers over str while the variation of long term pdo changed synchronously with rers over str from 1988 to 2009 it can be pointed out from fig 8b that sst over the indian ocean 50 e 100 e 60 s 0 s and atlantic 50 w 10 e 60 s 40 s contributed to the decadal change of rers over northern china and northeastern china consequently sst anomalies over these two regions were calculated to explore their relationship to rers over nec and nc unlike fig 9a b only short term periods were found between sst over the indian ocean and rers in northeastern china fig 9c there are two short term periods with 1 2 years and 2 4 years occurring in 2010 2015 and 1988 2001 respectively it should notice that the variation of rers over northeastern china lagged behind that of sst over the indian ocean for 1 2 years while rers varied synchronously with sst for 2 4 years similar to fig 9c short term periods were found between sst over the indian ocean and rers in northern china which were concentrated in 1 6 years and their power spectrums were approximately 2 0 these short term periods were pointing in the opposite direction that is 90 in 1998 2003 whereas 270 in 1966 1971 and 1984 1991 this founding suggested that rers in northern china lagged behind sst with 2 6 years while varying faster than sst with one fourth of the resonant period there was one resonant period between rers over northeastern china and atlantic sst 50 w 10 e 60 s 40 s that appeared in 1987 1999 which is significant at the 0 05 level fig 9e during this period the phase angles pointed straight down indicating the response of rers lagged behind the variation of sst over the atlantic ocean for 2 5 years similar to fig 9e one resonant period occurred from 1984 to 1994 over northern china and atlantic sst was presented by xwt the upward pointing arrows reflected that the rers in northern china was ahead of sst over the atlantic ocean by the one fourth period in summary the variation of rers over sub regions in mainland china could be related to different sst indicators the influence of pdo over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers can be shown as long term or short term periods which is non stationary in contrast the effect of sst over the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean is mainly presented as short term resonant periods the phase structure of xwt showed the part of similarity between rers and sst 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 the difference and connection between rainfall and rainfall erosivity it can be pointed out that the formula to calculate rainfall erosivity eq 5 only have one variable daily rainfall so the spatiotemporal patterns of precipitation affect the heterogeneity of rainfall erosivity qin et al 2016 previous researchers have also demonstrated that precipitation and rainfall erosivity are correlated capolongo et al 2008 mello et al 2013 xu et al 2021 however their difference mainly lies in the parameters α β calculating rainfall erosivity these two parameters refer to the kinetic energy of precipitation which could reflect the erosion of rainfall to the soil therefore rainfall erosivity considers not only the amount of rainfall but also the damage ability of precipitation to the soil 4 3 2 physical mechanism over the teleconnection between climatic fluctuations and the regional rainfall erosivity variability climate anomalies could affect the amount and intensity of rainfall by atmospheric circulation and cause soil erosion rainstorms and their corresponding erosivity are highly sensitive to climatic oscillations xu et al 2019 strengthened monsoon after 2003 could contribute to enhanced anomalous divergence fig 6a b fig 7a b which is responsible for the variability of rers over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers hari et al 2020 reported that the intertropical convergence zone has strengthened and propagated northward since 2002 which could explain the enhanced monsoon after 2002 found in this research further research has demonstrated that rers anomalies over the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers are correlated to the phase shift of the pacific decadal oscillation pdo to a negative phase fig 8a liu et al 2021 reported that the influences of the east asian monsoon on rainfall over the yangtze river basin are modulated by pdo an anomalous anti cyclone in the low level over the western north pacific during the rainy season could enhance southerlies over the coast of east asia it could contribute to a stronger east asian summer monsoon modulated by pdo chen et al 2013 it is consistent with our research strengthened cyclonic anomaly and anomalous divergence after 2008 fig 6c d fig 7c d are responsible for increasing rers over northeastern china and northern china occurred after 2008 fig 5b the cutoff low manifesting as a closed cyclonic circulation in the upper and middle troposphere xie and bueh 2015 could contribute to northern china cold vortex nccv nccv is the main factor influencing climate conditions during the rainy season in northeastern china and northern china which often contributes to low temperatures and more precipitation cong et al 2021 xue et al 2022 further research has demonstrated that rers anomalies over northeastern china and northern china are related to indian and atlantic warming fig 8b on the interannual time scale the atmospheric circulation anomalies during the rainy season over the north atlantic could excite stationary rossby waves in eurasia by modulating the position of the north atlantic storm track and affecting rainfall over the tibetan plateau bothe et al 2010 moreover the maintenance of the block over the sea of okhotsk which is in phase with stationary rossby waves over the tibetan plateau could favor the maintenance of nccv circulation wang et al 2011 han et al 2018 reported that the influences of indian ocean warming are positively related to precipitation in northeastern china which is consistent with our research 4 3 3 limitations and uncertainties of the research this research focuses on rainfall erosivity to reflect soil erosion soil erosion is affected by rainfall erosivity slope length slope steepness and soil properties among these factors slope length slope steepness and soil properties cannot change dramatically in a short time but may also have significant variations in the decadal time scale for example decreasing vegetation coverage has been found in some sub regions in china liu et al 2020 these elements were not considered in this research due to the limitation of accessible data although soil erosion is mainly driven by changes in rainfall erosivity further research including more soil information such as vegetation coverage changes could be more helpful for soil erosion monitoring 5 conclusions this study investigated the decadal changes of rers in mainland china and their underlying causes it was found that rers decreased from southeast to northwest and northeast six sub regions were selected based on the reof analysis of the standardized rers from 1961 to 2020 northeastern china the yellow river basin the yangtze river basin northern china southern china and the source of three rivers rainfall erosivity during rainy season in china experienced different decadal variation characteristics in different sub regions in the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers the decadal variation of rers occurred around 2003 while rers showed a prominent increasing trend over northeastern and northern china after 2008 the decadal changes of rers mainly occurred over the source of three rivers and the yangtze river basin around 2003 with increasing and decreasing trends respectively pdo is a primary driver for the decadal change of the east asian monsoon which could affect rainfall over the yangtze river basin increasing decreasing rers over the source of three rivers the yangtze river basin around 2003 is related to enhanced monsoon and anomalous convergence divergence a further connection between rers and pdo was explored by the cross wavelet analysis xwt the non stationary feature between pdo and rers on the yangtze river basin and the source of three rivers can be presented as long term or short term periods for decadal change around 2008 anomalies were mainly concentrated in northern and northeastern china with an increasing trend atlantic and indian ocean warming could excite rossby waves in eurasia and favor the maintenance of the block over the sea of okhotsk contributing to the maintenance of nccv circulation more nccv caused by enhanced circulation over northeastern china is responsible for increasing rers over northern china and northeastern china these results improve our understanding of the decadal changes in rers and suggest that adaptive measures should be taken to cope with these decadal changes the effect of sst over the indian ocean and the atlantic ocean is mainly presented as short term resonant periods the phase structure of xwt showed the part of similarity between rers over northern and northeastern china and sst over the indian and atlantic oceans credit authorship contribution statement qing cao conceptualization writing original draft writing review editing xing yuan

2006,given the greater spatial and temporal variability in precipitation and the absence of rain gauges at mountainous regions it is challenging to accurately estimate precipitation consequently impeding the predictive capability of hydrological models here we developed a nonlinear precipitation correction method in the swat soil and water assessment tool model to correct gridded remote sensing or reanalysis precipitation data for better distributed hydrological modeling the precipitation correction module is featured by a multiplicative exponential equation with two parameters a multiplicative coefficient pcp coe and an exponent pcp exp we proposed three configurations to determine pcp coe and pcp exp i e curve fitting between gridded and gauge precipitation data pairs configuration c1 or using gridded precipitation from multi grids within an elevation range of the gauge configuration c2 and the calibration of the swat model against observed streamflow configuration c3 we applied the proposed method to a typical poorly gauged alpine inland basin the xiangride river basin of northwest china with only one rain gauge and streamflow station results show that configuration c1 outperformed c2 and c3 by significantly improving streamflow modeling in both model calibration and validation particularly when the gpm global precipitation measurement precipitation datasets were used we also argue that configuration c3 is promising in ungauged basins with only streamflow available since this configuration does not require gauge precipitation this study puts forward a feasible method to derive more accurate spatiotemporal precipitation estimate based on gridded precipitation products hence improving distributed hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins keywords precipitation correction distributed hydrological modeling precipitation products hydrology backward poorly gauged basins data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation plays a crucial role in earth s water cycle and is essential to drive hydrological and ecological models khatakho et al 2021 syed et al 2004 verma et al 2012 accurate and reliable precipitation in space and time would greatly promote studies on regional hydrology ecology and climatology rain gauges are the traditional way to obtain precipitation data however rain gauge networks in mountainous basins are sparse and clustered in valleys or populated areas with the limitation of accessibility and maintenance costs verdin et al 2015 the sparse rain gauges cannot capture the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation bringing large uncertainty to the estimate of mean areal precipitation in basins and hydrological simulations henn et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to obtain precise precipitation estimates for improving hydrological modeling in alpine mountainous basins satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products such as the trmm tropical rainfall measuring huffman et al 2007 and its successor gpm global precipitation measurement hou et al 2014 mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2019 ncep cfsr national centers for environmental precipitation climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 and cmads china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng and wang 2017 can provide high resolution precipitation and other meteorological data regardless of terrain conditions and have become important data sources for poorly gauged and ungauged basins ajaaj et al 2019 lv et al 2022 the retrieval algorithm data sources and spatiotemporal resolution of gridded i e satellite and reanalysis precipitation products are constantly updated however these gridded precipitation data are still subject to some systematic errors and these errors vary under different climatic and topographical conditions li et al 2013 tang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to evaluate the applicability of different gridded precipitation products and to correct the biased data the evaluation was generally conducted through distributed hydrological modeling at basin scales numerous studies applied different hydrological models driven by various precipitation products indicating that gridded precipitation products have great potential in hydrological simulations particularly for poorly gauged or ungauged basins le et al 2020 ma et al 2019 musie et al 2019 pang et al 2020 tuo et al 2016 but they were generally inferior to the result of rain gauges duan et al 2019 khatakho et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 accumulating studies aimed to evaluate and analyze the suitability of different gridded precipitation products at global or regional scales beck et al 2017 dembele et al 2020 saemian et al 2021 but few studies have tried to correct the biases in these datasets such correction is mainly based on dense gauge networks in previous studies guo et al 2015 sharma et al 2020 whereas precipitation estimate in poorly gauged or ungauged basins is facing great challenges due to limited gauge based observations available some researchers corrected gridded precipitation data using regression model to integrate location factors longitude and latitude and terrain factors e g elevation slope aspect roughness etc chatzithomas et al 2015 lu et al 2018 however owing to the complex terrain and various weather systems orographic precipitation gives rise to a nonlinear interaction between elevation and precipitation houze jr 2012 the comprehensive consideration of multiple factors can only explain 70 variation of precipitation in some regions barros 2013 the rainfall runoff process can reflect how precipitation affects the hydrologic process in which runoff has been widely measured with relatively lower uncertainties herrnegger et al 2015 therefore the precipitation information can be derived or corrected by the runoff observations at the basin scales and several studies have carried out this beck et al 2020 kirchner 2009 luce et al 2013 valery et al 2009 wortmann et al 2018 as for a closed watershed the runoff at the outlet is equal to the mean precipitation minus evapotranspiration and the change in water storage for a certain time period therefore gridded precipitation data can be validated from the runoff observations which is known as doing hydrology backward kirchner 2009 kirchner 2009 conceptualized the catchment as a single storage element and inferred precipitation using a first order dynamical system the results showed that the runoff inferred precipitation was more reliable than the sparse gauge data on this basis krier et al 2012 tested this approach in the 24 subbasins of the alzette watershed in luxembourg with a dense rain gauges network it was found that the overall average correlation coefficient between inferred and observed precipitation data was above 0 80 furthermore there have been numerous studies on inferring or correcting precipitation data from observed runoff at both regional krier et al 2012 luce et al 2013 weingartner et al 2007 and global adam et al 2006 beck et al 2020 scale besides the hydrological models use precipitation as crucial input data and are calibrated with the observed runoff data thus we can correct the precipitation data by inversing modeling herrnegger et al 2018 the selection and calculation of the correction parameters play a key role in precipitation estimation based on hydrological model some studies applied the precipitation multiplier parameter and defined the inferred precipitation as the multiplication of gauge based data and precipitation multiplier henn et al 2015 vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2008 proposed the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream method to calculate the precipitation multiplier whereas henn et al 2016 2018 2015 combined the bayesian total error analysis batea with hydrologic model to estimate the parameters and infer the long term basin mean precipitation however these approaches required huge computing capability and still depended on rain gauges there are two commonly used bias correction model to explain the statistical relationship between true and target precipitation value which are the addition linear correction model and the multiplicative nonlinear correction model lafon et al 2013 tian et al 2013 compared these two models using daily precipitation information and found the multiplicative model performed better in prediction skill alemohammad et al 2015 investigated the joint probability density functions pdf of pairs data from different model and found better spread of pdfs calculated by the multiplicative model to date few studies combined the multiplicative correction model with hydrological model to correct precipitation data at basin scales moreover only a few studies presented the correction based on gridded precipitation products especially in poorly gauged or ungauged basins beck et al 2020 wortmann et al 2018 wortmann et al 2018 corrected the aphrodite grid precipitation data by calibrating the hydrological model to observed runoff to obtain more precise precipitation data on spatial the result showed that the modified hydrological modeling was able to inform precipitation correction in data scarce regions with the increasingly finer spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation products it is yet to be explored the capability of multiple gridded precipitation products in ungauged basins in addition a more reliable and simpler precipitation correction method based on hydrological model is promising in this study building on our previous work lv et al 2022 we attempted to develop a nonlinear precipitation correction method in the widely used swat model the improved swat model was used to evaluate and correct multiple gridded precipitation products cmads trmm gpm and mswep based on limited available observations of precipitation and streamflow in a poorly gauged inland basin in northwest china the proposed precipitation correction method could also be applied to other gridded precipitation datasets hydrological models and river basins 2 methods 2 1 study area and data analysis 2 1 1 study area and gridded precipitation datasets in this study the xiangride river basin xrb was defined as the area controlled by the qianwaebo hydrological station fig 1 which has a total drainage area of 9878 km2 it is located in the southeast qaidam basin of northwest china and surrounded by high mountains the study area belongs to a typical arid area of plateau continental climate alpine and windy with a long cold season and huge temperature difference the mean annual precipitation is approximately 284 mm 52 of which occurs from june to august xerophytic vegetation widely grows in this region zhu et al 2013 we selected one reanalysis and three satellite precipitation products including cmads v1 1 trmm 3b42 v7 gpm imerg v6 and mswep v2 table 1 daily precipitation data spanning from 2008 to 2016 were obtained for this study 2 1 2 geographical data and runoff measurement we collected elevation data land use and cover and soil maps to build swat model the digital elevation model dem with 90 m resolution was acquired from the geospatial data cloud platform https www gscloud cn the land use and cover were collected from the land cover dataset at qilian mountain area from 1985 to 2019 v2 0 national tibetan plateau data center junjun et al 2020 we selected the land cover map in 2010 while the soil data was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd https westdc westgis ac cn the observed runoff data at the qianwaebo hydrological station were collected from the hydrological department in qinghai province china the runoff measurement data include the monthly records from 1956 to 2016 however we only used observed runoff from 2008 to 2016 to match the gridded precipitation data available in this study 2 1 3 break point analysis of hydro climatic series we found a break point in 2012 for the observed runoff series while the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated by cmads trmm gpm and mswep products did not have significant changes details of methods and results of the break point analysis can be found in lv et al 2022 according to the runoff change point the whole study period was partitioned into two periods i e period 1 2008 2012 and period 2 2013 2016 we calibrated the precipitation correction model against the observations in period 1 and validated it in period 2 2 2 improved swat model with a precipitation correction module we developed a precipitation correction module in the swat model where the precipitation amount is adjusted by a multiplicative exponential equation 1 pcpnew p c p c o e p c p o l d p c p e x p where pcpnew denotes the corrected precipitation amount mm d 1 pcpold is the original precipitation amount mm d 1 pcp coe and pcp exp table 2 ranging from 0 to 4 are the multiplicative coefficient and exponent respectively the precipitation correction parameters i e pcp coe and pcp exp are determined from three configurations fig 2 i configuration c1 we first extract the grid precipitation data of each product at the location of the only available rain gauge i e the qianwaebo hydrological station and fit each product with gauge precipitation data using eq 1 giving the values of the two precipitation correction parameters we then calibrate hydrologic parameters using the auto calibration tool of swatopt wang et al 2018 ii configuration c2 we first extract the average precipitation data of all grid points at 3481 500 m for each product in which 3481 m is the elevation of the qianwaebo hydrological station the precipitation correction parameters are then derived by curve fitting of the product gauge precipitation data pairs using eq 1 followed by the calibration of hydrologic parameters using swatopt iii configuration c3 we directly calibrate precipitation correction parameters through the swatopt to eliminate the interactions between these two precipitation correction parameters and the hydrologic parameters we calibrate model parameters table 2 in two steps the first is to calibrate 14 hydrologic parameters the second step is to calibrate the two precipitation correction parameters by fixing those hydrologic parameters we will check if the model performance could be improved by correcting the precipitation data from different configurations each gridded dataset under three configurations went through a one year warming up 2008 followed by 4 year calibration period 1 2009 2012 and 4 year validation period 2 2013 2016 2 3 swat modeling swat model setup for the study area has been described in details in our previous research lv et al 2022 briefly the geographic data dem land use and soil types described in section 2 1 2 were used to delineate subbasins and hrus precipitation data from four products cmads trmm gpm and mswep were employed while all other meteorological data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed came from the cmads product we calibrated swat model by using the aforementioned procedure in section 2 2 in this study we used the coefficient of determination r2 eq 2 and percent bias pbias eq 3 to evaluate the precipitation correction and model performance wang et al 2022 as for the simulated monthly streamflow when r2 0 50 and pbias 25 the model performance is reliable moriasi et al 2007 2 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 pbias i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 where r 2 denotes the coefficient of determination which is identical to the nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias is the percent bias n is the number of observed data x i and y i are the target or simulated data and observed data respectively and y is the mean value of observed data 2 4 correction analysis there is only one rain gauge available in the study area above the qianwaebo station to provide insights into the validity of the precipitation correction procedure in this poorly gauged basin we extend the correction method to the larger domain i e the qaidam basin with more rain gauges fig 3 we select five stations the xiangride keer chahanwusu dulan and xiariha station which are close to our study area we test the biases between gridded datasets and observed precipitation in each station and analyze the viability of correcting the biases in gridded precipitation datasets for more accurate hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins all of the rain gauges data are obtained from the hydrological department in qinghai province china which has a data accuracy of 0 1 mm and is recorded by a weighting rain gauge 3 results 3 1 precipitation correction 3 1 1 calibration of the precipitation correction model via configuration c1 and c2 we fitted the precipitation correction model eq 1 using grid precipitation data of the four datasets against the only available gauge data at the qianwaebo station to determine the two precipitation correction parameters pcp coe and pcp exp as described in methods two strategies that is c1 and c2 were applied to extract the grid precipitation data our results show that the extracted gridded precipitation data were much higher than the gauge data fig s4 prior to correction the mean monthly precipitation amounts of the four datasets cmads trmm gpm and mswep were 1 4 2 times greater than that of the gauge data as per configuration c1 or c2 with the multiplicative exponential correction method the corrected mean precipitation at the qianwaebo station during the calibration period period 1 became consistent with the observed value i e the ratios were significantly reduced to be 0 83 1 04 we found nearly no difference in curve fitting performance between the two configurations c1 and c2 pertaining to the three satellite precipitation datasets r2 0 58 0 76 fig 4 however the reanalysis cmads dataset exhibited higher performance with configuration c2 r2 0 58 than with c1 r2 0 49 fig 4 as for precipitation calibration via configuration c1 during period 1 the agreement between corrected precipitation and observed data at the qianwaebo station was significantly improved r2 0 49 0 76 pbias 4 compared to the uncorrected data r2 0 1 pbias 30 78 for the three datasets cmads gpm and mswep the r2 for trmm was also increased from 0 47 without correction to 0 74 with correction fig 5 a d similar good results were found for the precipitation calibration via configuration c2 fig s5a d noting that for precipitation correction via configuration c2 the corrected r2 in fig s5a d could be different from that in fig 4e h this is because fig 4e h shows the relationship between multi grid average precipitation and the gauge data whereas fig s5a d only compares the corrected precipitation with observations at the grid where the qianwaebo station is located 3 1 2 validation of the precipitation correction model via configuration c1 and c2 the validation of the precipitation correction model by using data from period 2 2013 2016 further confirmed the efficacy of the approach take configuration c1 as an example the r2 values for cmads and trmm were increased from 0 44 and 0 62 to 0 81 and 0 90 respectively and the r2 values for gpm and mswep were drastically improved from negative to 0 78 fig 5e h our results indicate that under configuration c1 trmm had the highest r2 values before and after precipitation correction among the four datasets while mswep had the most significant improvement after correction followed by gpm satisfactory validation performance was also evident for configuration c2 fig s5e h 3 1 3 precipitation correction via configuration c3 the precipitation correction parameters in configuration c3 were calibrated by fitting the swat simulated streamflow against the observed streamflow data at the qianwaebo station to this end the precipitation was not directly calibrated by the observed precipitation when comparing the corrected precipitation with the observed values at the qianwaebo station we found significant improvement of precipitation estimate for cmads and gpm as indicated by greatly enhanced r2 and much lower pbias fig s6a c e g however no improvement was achieved for either trmm or mswep fig s6b d f h 3 2 parameters in the precipitation correction model as described in section 2 2 we derived the two precipitation correction parameters pcp coe and pcp exp through curve fitting between gridded and gauge data configuration c1 and c2 or swat model calibration against observed streamflow configuration c3 the curve fitting results via c1 and c2 show that the two parameters ranged between 0 40 and 3 86 thus we set the range of pcp coe and pcp exp as 0 4 in swat model calibration we also applied the uq cofi uncertainty quantification by critical objected function index method wang et al 2022 to quantify the parametric uncertainty in terms of parameter pcp coe configuration c1 produced higher parameter values than c2 for the four datasets while the highest pcp coe was 3 86 for the gpm dataset followed by cmads 2 34 mswep 1 34 and trmm 0 71 this order was also true for c2 fig 6 a table s1 as for configuration c3 the parametric distribution had no significant difference between mswep and cmads or trmm fig 6a similar to the c1 and c2 configurations configuration c3 generated significantly higher pcp coe for gpm than the other three datasets when the parametric uncertainty in configuration c3 was considered the value range of pcp coe from c3 could generally contain the parameter values derived via c1 and c2 for these precipitation datasets except gpm fig 6a we found that pcp exp held smaller value ranges than pcp coe with closer optimal values between c1 and c2 for the four datasets fig 6b table s1 contrary to pcp coe configuration c2 had higher pcp exp values than configuration c1 while the highest was found for trmm 1 15 followed by cmads 0 86 mswep 0 80 and gpm 0 60 fig 6b table s1 the differences in the distribution of pcp exp among the four datasets were similar to pcp coe in addition the optimal pcp exp values via c1 and c2 situated between or close to the interquartile range of the c3 derived values for all datasets fig 6b 3 3 simulated streamflow under the three configurations besides the evaluation of the precipitation correction method we conducted swat modeling to compare simulated with observed monthly streamflow at the outlet of the study area i e the qianwaebo station the precipitation correction parameters from the three configurations underwent 4 year 2009 2012 calibration and 4 year 2013 2016 validation with regard to streamflow without precipitation correction the performance r2 for the four datasets decreased in the order mswep trmm gpm 0 5 cmads in period 1 calibration and cmads trmm mswep gpm 0 5 in period 2 validation fig 7 table s2 in addition the percent biases pbias were within 11 for all datasets no matter whether the precipitation data were corrected or not table s2 results show an incremental r2 of streamflow modeling with precipitation correction compared to the uncorrected data for cmads trmm and gpm where gpm had the most significant improvement r2 0 58 0 75 with correction vs 0 51 0 53 without correction in both model calibration and validation fig 7a c fig s7 figure s7 presents the boxplots between observed and simulated streamflow to better show the difference the three configurations exhibited comparable performance when cmads and trmm datasets were used configuration c1 and c2 achieved higher r2 for streamflow simulations than c3 when gpm was used we also found that the corrected gpm from configuration c1 achieved the highest agreement with the observed streamflow in both calibration r2 0 75 and validation r2 0 68 however mswep showed a significantly lower r2 during the validation period 2013 2016 under configuration c1and c2 than c3 fig 7d fig s7 3 4 correction analysis 3 4 1 spatial patterns and the mean monthly precipitation the above evaluation of the precipitation correction at the qianwaebo station and the hydrological simulations indicate that configuration c1 performed overall better than c2 and c3 fig 7 therefore we present the spatial patterns and mean monthly precipitation from four gridded datasets corrected through configuration c1 corrected datasets exhibited much lower mean annual precipitation map values than the original data fig 8 the original map values from 2009 to 2016 for four datasets decreased in the order of mswep trmm cmads gpm which was 371 mm yr 1 348 mm yr 1 277 mm yr 1 and 267 mm yr 1 respectively after correction the order became trmm 240 mm yr 1 mswep 140 mm yr 1 cmads 104 mm yr 1 gpm 84 mm yr 1 indicating the largest diminishment occurred in the corrected mswep followed by gpm cmads and trmm the absolute values of difference between uncorrected and corrected precipitation δ m a p ranged from 86 to 326 mm yr 1 the results also show that there is a strongly positive relationship correlation coefficient r 0 9 between δ m a p and the uncorrected precipitation amount therefore the corrected data had a lower difference of map values among subbasins than the original data moreover four products depict diverse precipitation spatial patterns at subbasins scale though the spatial patterns of map 2009 2016 of the four gridded datasets did not change before and after correction fig 8 owing to the same parameters being applied to correct precipitation at all subbasins the spatial pattern of corrected precipitation still follows the pattern of the original gridded dataset since we don t have additional information to adjust the spatial pattern at the gauge location we found that the difference between gridded data and gauge values before correction ranges 19 139 mm 32 149 mm 18 150 mm and 127 219 mm respectively for cmads trmm gpm and mswep fig s8 however the precipitation correction approach helps narrow down the absolute difference to 3 69 mm 2 57 mm 0 78 mm and 11 68 mm for the four gridded datasets fig s8 the smaller difference indicates a more accurate estimate of the precipitation by the gridded datasets in other words all corrected gridded data yield similar precipitation values and are closer to the gauge precipitation under configuration c1 fig s8 the precipitation over the study area mainly occurred in june to september with the lowest precipitation in december to february and highest precipitation in july fig 9 gpm showed the highest precipitation in august and october whereas mswep or trmm had the highest precipitation in the rest months fig 9a in comparison with the original data the difference among four corrected data became smaller fig 9b the corrected trmm and mswep had lower mean monthly precipitation in each month where trmm decreased approximately by 30 in each month and mswep decreased by 10 48 fig 9c with regard to the corrected cmads data the monthly precipitation increased by about 120 and 150 in december and january 10 70 in november and february to april and decreased by 15 36 in the rest months regarding the corrected gpm data there were far 300 increase in december january and february about 76 186 increase in march april and november and 13 48 decrease in the rest months fig 9c 3 4 2 model testing in the qaidam basin the above results for the qiamwaebo catchment show that configuration c1 outperformed c2 and c3 by significantly improving streamflow modeling in both model calibration and validation particularly when the gpm precipitation datasets were used however when we tested this correction procedure into the larger qaidam basin domain with more rain gauges we found the r2 and pbias values between gpm and gauge data at the qianwaebo station were significantly distinct from those of the other stations fig 10 the performance of gpm at the qianwaebo station exhibited a negative r2 value 0 53 and a much higher pbias 53 compared with the average r2 of 0 78 and pbias within 24 at the other five hydrological stations fig 10 this means that gpm data have larger biases at the qianwaebo station than the other stations when we combine the only available gauge data to correct the biased gridded precipitation data metrics improvements are found for hydrological modeling at the qianwaebo station fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation correction by the multiplicative exponential function the multiplicative exponential correction model as adopted herein is more in line with the relationship between estimated and true precipitation than additive model alemohammad et al 2015 previous studies suggested the additive model was unable to separate random and systematic errors well and lacked the ability of reliable predictions as the additive model could give a precipitation value in a place where it was no rain owing to the random error however the multiplicative exponential model performed better in these aspects lafon et al 2013 tian et al 2013 chen et al 2022 the xiangride river basin has some of highlands are above the snowlines we have collected the average annual precipitation and snowmelt data from the results of swat modeling driven by four gridded datasets cmads trmm gpm and mswep we found the partitioning of runoff between direct precipitation response and snowmelt is around 75 84 and 16 25 respectively the results were similar to a previous study wang et al 2021 indicating the contribution of precipitation and snowmelt including ice melting was 83 and 17 respectively in the yellow river headwater area our results pertaining to a poorly gauged arid basin with high altitude demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplicative exponential function to correct the remote sensing and reanalysis precipitation datasets there is only one rain gauge installed in the study area thus we adopted the observed precipitation from this gauge to acquire the optimal correction parameters by a simple curve fitting approach which formed configuration c1 using gridded precipitation from the grid containing the gauge and c2 using mean gridded precipitation from multiple grids within a 500 m elevation range of the gauge these two configurations generally performed better than configuration c3 calibration via hydrological modeling especially when gpm dataset was used fig 7 we found that c1 had more stable improvement and it was easier to implement because the two correction parameters were directly obtained via curve fitting between available observations and the gridded precipitation in the grid cell containing the rain gauge these four corrected datasets yield similar values of both the mean annual precipitation fig 9 and the point precipitation at the grid where the qianwanebo station is located fig s8 therefore we would recommend configuration c1 in poorly gauged basins our results indicate that configuration c2 with gridded data from multiple grid cells does not necessarily outperform c1 this may be due to uncertainty is introduced when information from multiple grid cells is used however our results do not rule out the advantages of configuration c2 than c1 in other watersheds which demands further testing it is far more challenging to obtain observed data within this mountainous inland basin but we expect to develop a multi objective model calibration strategy that integrates observed runoff data with remote sensed evapotranspiration or soil moisture datasets in future study the precipitation correction parameters in c3 are determined by calibrating model against observed streamflow via a two step model calibration procedure we also conducted the joint calibration procedure and listed the optimal precipitation correction parameters table s1 we compared the performance of simulated streamflow across various calibration procedures fig s1 the optimal parameters vary slightly between the two step and joint procedure for cmads mswep and trmm whereas the parameters from joint calibration of gpm was closer to configuration c1 in summary the two step calibration procedure generated comparable parameter values and even better modeling performance than the joint calibration procedure probably due to that the joint calibration added complexity to model parameterization 4 2 streamflow informed precipitation correction streamflow observations integrate the comprehensive hydrological response to climate variation and anthropogenic activities in the whole watershed yet lacking explicit spatial heterogeneity information about the hydrologic processes dembélé et al 2020 although gridded precipitation datasets are subject to some systematic errors and uncertainties they do provide unique and related spatial patterns for distributed hydrological modeling becker et al 2019 our research particularly configuration c3 takes advantages of the spatial information embedded in multiple gridded precipitation datasets and correct precipitation by calibrating the swat model against observed streamflow our results also imply that the swat modeling performance in turn could be improved by correcting the gridded precipitation datasets our study demonstrates that precipitation correction via calibrating hydrological model against observed streamflow was a feasible way in poorly gauged and ungauged basins herrnegger et al 2018 ma et al 2021 although configuration c3 is not always superior to c1 and c2 the post evaluation against gauge precipitation indicated extraordinarily improvement in gpm and cmads datasets when c3 was used fig s6 in addition the implementation of c3 does not require gauge precipitation by contrast the precipitation correction parameters in c3 are determined by calibrating model against observed streamflow via a two step model calibration procedure therefore we argue that applying configuration c3 in ungauged basins with only streamflow available at the outlet is promising with regard to the four gridded datasets even though the corrected trmm under configuration c1 and c2 achieved the best performance of precipitation at the gauge station fig 5 its simulated streamflow was inferior to the corrected gpm fig 7 table s2 nevertheless gpm had significant improvement on the accuracy of both precipitation and streamflow simulations here we further collect the available data from hydrological stations in the qaidam basin to test the precipitation correction method fig 3 however we found the poor r2 and pbias values between gpm and gauge data at the qianwaebo station compared with the other stations fig 10 numerous previous studies pradhan et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 anjum et al 2019 have reported that gpm showed substantial bias at relatively higher elevations and over complex topographies among these available hydrological stations the qianwaebo station has the highest elevation fig 10 therefore we combine the only available gauge precipitation and streamflow data at the qianwaebo station to correct the biased gridded precipitation data through hydrological modeling the process based models e g the swat model driven by high quality gridded datasets can better represent the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological variables streamflow contains much more comprehensive information than sparse gauges only one rain gauge has limited representation of the actual climatic conditions across the watershed furthermore different gridded precipitation datasets have various spatial error characteristics and these precipitation errors would propagate in the process of hydrologic simulations which brings great uncertainties chen et al 2013 tang et al 2019 we believe that gpm provides the most reliable spatial pattern in the study area fig 8 thus the correction method efficiently improved its accuracy and hydrological modeling in the study area we found that the r2 values was 0 5 for the two periods except cmads in period 1 table s2 we believe that the true precipitation value in period 2 was lower than that in period 1 and cmads significantly underestimated the precipitation in period 1 with relatively low anthropogenic impact lv et al 2022 resulting in unsatisfying performance of hydrological simulation moreover the two parameters in the precipitation correction model derived in this study underwent swat model calibration and validation further verifying the reliability and predictability of our precipitation correction method in improving both precipitation estimate and streamflow modeling 5 conclusion here we developed a precipitation correction method in the swat model to correct precipitation input data and to evaluate its efficacy in streamflow modeling the proposed method was applied to correct four gridded precipitation datasets and calibrate the swat model in a typical poorly gauged alpine inland basin the xiangride river basin of northwest china with only one rain gauge and streamflow station three configurations were developed to obtain the optimal precipitation correction parameters i e curve fitting between gridded and gauge precipitation data pairs at the gauge location c1 or using gridded precipitation from multi grids within an elevation range of the gauge c2 and the calibration of the swat model against streamflow c3 results show that c1 significantly improved the hydrological modeling performance followed by configuration c2 the corrected gpm using configuration c1 achieved the highest agreement with the observation in hydrological modeling we also contend that configuration c3 is promising in ungauged basins with only streamflow available at the outlet since the implementation of configuration c3 does not require gauge precipitation we acknowledge that there is only one rain gauge and streamflow station available for model calibration and validation which may raise the concern on the reliability and robustness of the proposed method however we argue that this is also the merit of this study as we are attempting to provide a feasible strategy to correct the biases in remote sensing and reanalysis precipitation datasets for more accurate hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins 6 data available statement the data described in this article are openly

2006,given the greater spatial and temporal variability in precipitation and the absence of rain gauges at mountainous regions it is challenging to accurately estimate precipitation consequently impeding the predictive capability of hydrological models here we developed a nonlinear precipitation correction method in the swat soil and water assessment tool model to correct gridded remote sensing or reanalysis precipitation data for better distributed hydrological modeling the precipitation correction module is featured by a multiplicative exponential equation with two parameters a multiplicative coefficient pcp coe and an exponent pcp exp we proposed three configurations to determine pcp coe and pcp exp i e curve fitting between gridded and gauge precipitation data pairs configuration c1 or using gridded precipitation from multi grids within an elevation range of the gauge configuration c2 and the calibration of the swat model against observed streamflow configuration c3 we applied the proposed method to a typical poorly gauged alpine inland basin the xiangride river basin of northwest china with only one rain gauge and streamflow station results show that configuration c1 outperformed c2 and c3 by significantly improving streamflow modeling in both model calibration and validation particularly when the gpm global precipitation measurement precipitation datasets were used we also argue that configuration c3 is promising in ungauged basins with only streamflow available since this configuration does not require gauge precipitation this study puts forward a feasible method to derive more accurate spatiotemporal precipitation estimate based on gridded precipitation products hence improving distributed hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins keywords precipitation correction distributed hydrological modeling precipitation products hydrology backward poorly gauged basins data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction precipitation plays a crucial role in earth s water cycle and is essential to drive hydrological and ecological models khatakho et al 2021 syed et al 2004 verma et al 2012 accurate and reliable precipitation in space and time would greatly promote studies on regional hydrology ecology and climatology rain gauges are the traditional way to obtain precipitation data however rain gauge networks in mountainous basins are sparse and clustered in valleys or populated areas with the limitation of accessibility and maintenance costs verdin et al 2015 the sparse rain gauges cannot capture the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation bringing large uncertainty to the estimate of mean areal precipitation in basins and hydrological simulations henn et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 therefore it is of great theoretical and practical significance to obtain precise precipitation estimates for improving hydrological modeling in alpine mountainous basins satellite based and reanalysis precipitation products such as the trmm tropical rainfall measuring huffman et al 2007 and its successor gpm global precipitation measurement hou et al 2014 mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation beck et al 2019 ncep cfsr national centers for environmental precipitation climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 and cmads china meteorological assimilation driving datasets for the swat model meng and wang 2017 can provide high resolution precipitation and other meteorological data regardless of terrain conditions and have become important data sources for poorly gauged and ungauged basins ajaaj et al 2019 lv et al 2022 the retrieval algorithm data sources and spatiotemporal resolution of gridded i e satellite and reanalysis precipitation products are constantly updated however these gridded precipitation data are still subject to some systematic errors and these errors vary under different climatic and topographical conditions li et al 2013 tang et al 2019 therefore it is essential to evaluate the applicability of different gridded precipitation products and to correct the biased data the evaluation was generally conducted through distributed hydrological modeling at basin scales numerous studies applied different hydrological models driven by various precipitation products indicating that gridded precipitation products have great potential in hydrological simulations particularly for poorly gauged or ungauged basins le et al 2020 ma et al 2019 musie et al 2019 pang et al 2020 tuo et al 2016 but they were generally inferior to the result of rain gauges duan et al 2019 khatakho et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 accumulating studies aimed to evaluate and analyze the suitability of different gridded precipitation products at global or regional scales beck et al 2017 dembele et al 2020 saemian et al 2021 but few studies have tried to correct the biases in these datasets such correction is mainly based on dense gauge networks in previous studies guo et al 2015 sharma et al 2020 whereas precipitation estimate in poorly gauged or ungauged basins is facing great challenges due to limited gauge based observations available some researchers corrected gridded precipitation data using regression model to integrate location factors longitude and latitude and terrain factors e g elevation slope aspect roughness etc chatzithomas et al 2015 lu et al 2018 however owing to the complex terrain and various weather systems orographic precipitation gives rise to a nonlinear interaction between elevation and precipitation houze jr 2012 the comprehensive consideration of multiple factors can only explain 70 variation of precipitation in some regions barros 2013 the rainfall runoff process can reflect how precipitation affects the hydrologic process in which runoff has been widely measured with relatively lower uncertainties herrnegger et al 2015 therefore the precipitation information can be derived or corrected by the runoff observations at the basin scales and several studies have carried out this beck et al 2020 kirchner 2009 luce et al 2013 valery et al 2009 wortmann et al 2018 as for a closed watershed the runoff at the outlet is equal to the mean precipitation minus evapotranspiration and the change in water storage for a certain time period therefore gridded precipitation data can be validated from the runoff observations which is known as doing hydrology backward kirchner 2009 kirchner 2009 conceptualized the catchment as a single storage element and inferred precipitation using a first order dynamical system the results showed that the runoff inferred precipitation was more reliable than the sparse gauge data on this basis krier et al 2012 tested this approach in the 24 subbasins of the alzette watershed in luxembourg with a dense rain gauges network it was found that the overall average correlation coefficient between inferred and observed precipitation data was above 0 80 furthermore there have been numerous studies on inferring or correcting precipitation data from observed runoff at both regional krier et al 2012 luce et al 2013 weingartner et al 2007 and global adam et al 2006 beck et al 2020 scale besides the hydrological models use precipitation as crucial input data and are calibrated with the observed runoff data thus we can correct the precipitation data by inversing modeling herrnegger et al 2018 the selection and calculation of the correction parameters play a key role in precipitation estimation based on hydrological model some studies applied the precipitation multiplier parameter and defined the inferred precipitation as the multiplication of gauge based data and precipitation multiplier henn et al 2015 vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2008 proposed the differential evolution adaptive metropolis dream method to calculate the precipitation multiplier whereas henn et al 2016 2018 2015 combined the bayesian total error analysis batea with hydrologic model to estimate the parameters and infer the long term basin mean precipitation however these approaches required huge computing capability and still depended on rain gauges there are two commonly used bias correction model to explain the statistical relationship between true and target precipitation value which are the addition linear correction model and the multiplicative nonlinear correction model lafon et al 2013 tian et al 2013 compared these two models using daily precipitation information and found the multiplicative model performed better in prediction skill alemohammad et al 2015 investigated the joint probability density functions pdf of pairs data from different model and found better spread of pdfs calculated by the multiplicative model to date few studies combined the multiplicative correction model with hydrological model to correct precipitation data at basin scales moreover only a few studies presented the correction based on gridded precipitation products especially in poorly gauged or ungauged basins beck et al 2020 wortmann et al 2018 wortmann et al 2018 corrected the aphrodite grid precipitation data by calibrating the hydrological model to observed runoff to obtain more precise precipitation data on spatial the result showed that the modified hydrological modeling was able to inform precipitation correction in data scarce regions with the increasingly finer spatiotemporal resolution of precipitation products it is yet to be explored the capability of multiple gridded precipitation products in ungauged basins in addition a more reliable and simpler precipitation correction method based on hydrological model is promising in this study building on our previous work lv et al 2022 we attempted to develop a nonlinear precipitation correction method in the widely used swat model the improved swat model was used to evaluate and correct multiple gridded precipitation products cmads trmm gpm and mswep based on limited available observations of precipitation and streamflow in a poorly gauged inland basin in northwest china the proposed precipitation correction method could also be applied to other gridded precipitation datasets hydrological models and river basins 2 methods 2 1 study area and data analysis 2 1 1 study area and gridded precipitation datasets in this study the xiangride river basin xrb was defined as the area controlled by the qianwaebo hydrological station fig 1 which has a total drainage area of 9878 km2 it is located in the southeast qaidam basin of northwest china and surrounded by high mountains the study area belongs to a typical arid area of plateau continental climate alpine and windy with a long cold season and huge temperature difference the mean annual precipitation is approximately 284 mm 52 of which occurs from june to august xerophytic vegetation widely grows in this region zhu et al 2013 we selected one reanalysis and three satellite precipitation products including cmads v1 1 trmm 3b42 v7 gpm imerg v6 and mswep v2 table 1 daily precipitation data spanning from 2008 to 2016 were obtained for this study 2 1 2 geographical data and runoff measurement we collected elevation data land use and cover and soil maps to build swat model the digital elevation model dem with 90 m resolution was acquired from the geospatial data cloud platform https www gscloud cn the land use and cover were collected from the land cover dataset at qilian mountain area from 1985 to 2019 v2 0 national tibetan plateau data center junjun et al 2020 we selected the land cover map in 2010 while the soil data was acquired from the harmonized world soil database hwsd https westdc westgis ac cn the observed runoff data at the qianwaebo hydrological station were collected from the hydrological department in qinghai province china the runoff measurement data include the monthly records from 1956 to 2016 however we only used observed runoff from 2008 to 2016 to match the gridded precipitation data available in this study 2 1 3 break point analysis of hydro climatic series we found a break point in 2012 for the observed runoff series while the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration calculated by cmads trmm gpm and mswep products did not have significant changes details of methods and results of the break point analysis can be found in lv et al 2022 according to the runoff change point the whole study period was partitioned into two periods i e period 1 2008 2012 and period 2 2013 2016 we calibrated the precipitation correction model against the observations in period 1 and validated it in period 2 2 2 improved swat model with a precipitation correction module we developed a precipitation correction module in the swat model where the precipitation amount is adjusted by a multiplicative exponential equation 1 pcpnew p c p c o e p c p o l d p c p e x p where pcpnew denotes the corrected precipitation amount mm d 1 pcpold is the original precipitation amount mm d 1 pcp coe and pcp exp table 2 ranging from 0 to 4 are the multiplicative coefficient and exponent respectively the precipitation correction parameters i e pcp coe and pcp exp are determined from three configurations fig 2 i configuration c1 we first extract the grid precipitation data of each product at the location of the only available rain gauge i e the qianwaebo hydrological station and fit each product with gauge precipitation data using eq 1 giving the values of the two precipitation correction parameters we then calibrate hydrologic parameters using the auto calibration tool of swatopt wang et al 2018 ii configuration c2 we first extract the average precipitation data of all grid points at 3481 500 m for each product in which 3481 m is the elevation of the qianwaebo hydrological station the precipitation correction parameters are then derived by curve fitting of the product gauge precipitation data pairs using eq 1 followed by the calibration of hydrologic parameters using swatopt iii configuration c3 we directly calibrate precipitation correction parameters through the swatopt to eliminate the interactions between these two precipitation correction parameters and the hydrologic parameters we calibrate model parameters table 2 in two steps the first is to calibrate 14 hydrologic parameters the second step is to calibrate the two precipitation correction parameters by fixing those hydrologic parameters we will check if the model performance could be improved by correcting the precipitation data from different configurations each gridded dataset under three configurations went through a one year warming up 2008 followed by 4 year calibration period 1 2009 2012 and 4 year validation period 2 2013 2016 2 3 swat modeling swat model setup for the study area has been described in details in our previous research lv et al 2022 briefly the geographic data dem land use and soil types described in section 2 1 2 were used to delineate subbasins and hrus precipitation data from four products cmads trmm gpm and mswep were employed while all other meteorological data air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed came from the cmads product we calibrated swat model by using the aforementioned procedure in section 2 2 in this study we used the coefficient of determination r2 eq 2 and percent bias pbias eq 3 to evaluate the precipitation correction and model performance wang et al 2022 as for the simulated monthly streamflow when r2 0 50 and pbias 25 the model performance is reliable moriasi et al 2007 2 r 2 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 3 pbias i 1 n x i y i i 1 n y i 100 where r 2 denotes the coefficient of determination which is identical to the nash sutcliffe efficiency pbias is the percent bias n is the number of observed data x i and y i are the target or simulated data and observed data respectively and y is the mean value of observed data 2 4 correction analysis there is only one rain gauge available in the study area above the qianwaebo station to provide insights into the validity of the precipitation correction procedure in this poorly gauged basin we extend the correction method to the larger domain i e the qaidam basin with more rain gauges fig 3 we select five stations the xiangride keer chahanwusu dulan and xiariha station which are close to our study area we test the biases between gridded datasets and observed precipitation in each station and analyze the viability of correcting the biases in gridded precipitation datasets for more accurate hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins all of the rain gauges data are obtained from the hydrological department in qinghai province china which has a data accuracy of 0 1 mm and is recorded by a weighting rain gauge 3 results 3 1 precipitation correction 3 1 1 calibration of the precipitation correction model via configuration c1 and c2 we fitted the precipitation correction model eq 1 using grid precipitation data of the four datasets against the only available gauge data at the qianwaebo station to determine the two precipitation correction parameters pcp coe and pcp exp as described in methods two strategies that is c1 and c2 were applied to extract the grid precipitation data our results show that the extracted gridded precipitation data were much higher than the gauge data fig s4 prior to correction the mean monthly precipitation amounts of the four datasets cmads trmm gpm and mswep were 1 4 2 times greater than that of the gauge data as per configuration c1 or c2 with the multiplicative exponential correction method the corrected mean precipitation at the qianwaebo station during the calibration period period 1 became consistent with the observed value i e the ratios were significantly reduced to be 0 83 1 04 we found nearly no difference in curve fitting performance between the two configurations c1 and c2 pertaining to the three satellite precipitation datasets r2 0 58 0 76 fig 4 however the reanalysis cmads dataset exhibited higher performance with configuration c2 r2 0 58 than with c1 r2 0 49 fig 4 as for precipitation calibration via configuration c1 during period 1 the agreement between corrected precipitation and observed data at the qianwaebo station was significantly improved r2 0 49 0 76 pbias 4 compared to the uncorrected data r2 0 1 pbias 30 78 for the three datasets cmads gpm and mswep the r2 for trmm was also increased from 0 47 without correction to 0 74 with correction fig 5 a d similar good results were found for the precipitation calibration via configuration c2 fig s5a d noting that for precipitation correction via configuration c2 the corrected r2 in fig s5a d could be different from that in fig 4e h this is because fig 4e h shows the relationship between multi grid average precipitation and the gauge data whereas fig s5a d only compares the corrected precipitation with observations at the grid where the qianwaebo station is located 3 1 2 validation of the precipitation correction model via configuration c1 and c2 the validation of the precipitation correction model by using data from period 2 2013 2016 further confirmed the efficacy of the approach take configuration c1 as an example the r2 values for cmads and trmm were increased from 0 44 and 0 62 to 0 81 and 0 90 respectively and the r2 values for gpm and mswep were drastically improved from negative to 0 78 fig 5e h our results indicate that under configuration c1 trmm had the highest r2 values before and after precipitation correction among the four datasets while mswep had the most significant improvement after correction followed by gpm satisfactory validation performance was also evident for configuration c2 fig s5e h 3 1 3 precipitation correction via configuration c3 the precipitation correction parameters in configuration c3 were calibrated by fitting the swat simulated streamflow against the observed streamflow data at the qianwaebo station to this end the precipitation was not directly calibrated by the observed precipitation when comparing the corrected precipitation with the observed values at the qianwaebo station we found significant improvement of precipitation estimate for cmads and gpm as indicated by greatly enhanced r2 and much lower pbias fig s6a c e g however no improvement was achieved for either trmm or mswep fig s6b d f h 3 2 parameters in the precipitation correction model as described in section 2 2 we derived the two precipitation correction parameters pcp coe and pcp exp through curve fitting between gridded and gauge data configuration c1 and c2 or swat model calibration against observed streamflow configuration c3 the curve fitting results via c1 and c2 show that the two parameters ranged between 0 40 and 3 86 thus we set the range of pcp coe and pcp exp as 0 4 in swat model calibration we also applied the uq cofi uncertainty quantification by critical objected function index method wang et al 2022 to quantify the parametric uncertainty in terms of parameter pcp coe configuration c1 produced higher parameter values than c2 for the four datasets while the highest pcp coe was 3 86 for the gpm dataset followed by cmads 2 34 mswep 1 34 and trmm 0 71 this order was also true for c2 fig 6 a table s1 as for configuration c3 the parametric distribution had no significant difference between mswep and cmads or trmm fig 6a similar to the c1 and c2 configurations configuration c3 generated significantly higher pcp coe for gpm than the other three datasets when the parametric uncertainty in configuration c3 was considered the value range of pcp coe from c3 could generally contain the parameter values derived via c1 and c2 for these precipitation datasets except gpm fig 6a we found that pcp exp held smaller value ranges than pcp coe with closer optimal values between c1 and c2 for the four datasets fig 6b table s1 contrary to pcp coe configuration c2 had higher pcp exp values than configuration c1 while the highest was found for trmm 1 15 followed by cmads 0 86 mswep 0 80 and gpm 0 60 fig 6b table s1 the differences in the distribution of pcp exp among the four datasets were similar to pcp coe in addition the optimal pcp exp values via c1 and c2 situated between or close to the interquartile range of the c3 derived values for all datasets fig 6b 3 3 simulated streamflow under the three configurations besides the evaluation of the precipitation correction method we conducted swat modeling to compare simulated with observed monthly streamflow at the outlet of the study area i e the qianwaebo station the precipitation correction parameters from the three configurations underwent 4 year 2009 2012 calibration and 4 year 2013 2016 validation with regard to streamflow without precipitation correction the performance r2 for the four datasets decreased in the order mswep trmm gpm 0 5 cmads in period 1 calibration and cmads trmm mswep gpm 0 5 in period 2 validation fig 7 table s2 in addition the percent biases pbias were within 11 for all datasets no matter whether the precipitation data were corrected or not table s2 results show an incremental r2 of streamflow modeling with precipitation correction compared to the uncorrected data for cmads trmm and gpm where gpm had the most significant improvement r2 0 58 0 75 with correction vs 0 51 0 53 without correction in both model calibration and validation fig 7a c fig s7 figure s7 presents the boxplots between observed and simulated streamflow to better show the difference the three configurations exhibited comparable performance when cmads and trmm datasets were used configuration c1 and c2 achieved higher r2 for streamflow simulations than c3 when gpm was used we also found that the corrected gpm from configuration c1 achieved the highest agreement with the observed streamflow in both calibration r2 0 75 and validation r2 0 68 however mswep showed a significantly lower r2 during the validation period 2013 2016 under configuration c1and c2 than c3 fig 7d fig s7 3 4 correction analysis 3 4 1 spatial patterns and the mean monthly precipitation the above evaluation of the precipitation correction at the qianwaebo station and the hydrological simulations indicate that configuration c1 performed overall better than c2 and c3 fig 7 therefore we present the spatial patterns and mean monthly precipitation from four gridded datasets corrected through configuration c1 corrected datasets exhibited much lower mean annual precipitation map values than the original data fig 8 the original map values from 2009 to 2016 for four datasets decreased in the order of mswep trmm cmads gpm which was 371 mm yr 1 348 mm yr 1 277 mm yr 1 and 267 mm yr 1 respectively after correction the order became trmm 240 mm yr 1 mswep 140 mm yr 1 cmads 104 mm yr 1 gpm 84 mm yr 1 indicating the largest diminishment occurred in the corrected mswep followed by gpm cmads and trmm the absolute values of difference between uncorrected and corrected precipitation δ m a p ranged from 86 to 326 mm yr 1 the results also show that there is a strongly positive relationship correlation coefficient r 0 9 between δ m a p and the uncorrected precipitation amount therefore the corrected data had a lower difference of map values among subbasins than the original data moreover four products depict diverse precipitation spatial patterns at subbasins scale though the spatial patterns of map 2009 2016 of the four gridded datasets did not change before and after correction fig 8 owing to the same parameters being applied to correct precipitation at all subbasins the spatial pattern of corrected precipitation still follows the pattern of the original gridded dataset since we don t have additional information to adjust the spatial pattern at the gauge location we found that the difference between gridded data and gauge values before correction ranges 19 139 mm 32 149 mm 18 150 mm and 127 219 mm respectively for cmads trmm gpm and mswep fig s8 however the precipitation correction approach helps narrow down the absolute difference to 3 69 mm 2 57 mm 0 78 mm and 11 68 mm for the four gridded datasets fig s8 the smaller difference indicates a more accurate estimate of the precipitation by the gridded datasets in other words all corrected gridded data yield similar precipitation values and are closer to the gauge precipitation under configuration c1 fig s8 the precipitation over the study area mainly occurred in june to september with the lowest precipitation in december to february and highest precipitation in july fig 9 gpm showed the highest precipitation in august and october whereas mswep or trmm had the highest precipitation in the rest months fig 9a in comparison with the original data the difference among four corrected data became smaller fig 9b the corrected trmm and mswep had lower mean monthly precipitation in each month where trmm decreased approximately by 30 in each month and mswep decreased by 10 48 fig 9c with regard to the corrected cmads data the monthly precipitation increased by about 120 and 150 in december and january 10 70 in november and february to april and decreased by 15 36 in the rest months regarding the corrected gpm data there were far 300 increase in december january and february about 76 186 increase in march april and november and 13 48 decrease in the rest months fig 9c 3 4 2 model testing in the qaidam basin the above results for the qiamwaebo catchment show that configuration c1 outperformed c2 and c3 by significantly improving streamflow modeling in both model calibration and validation particularly when the gpm precipitation datasets were used however when we tested this correction procedure into the larger qaidam basin domain with more rain gauges we found the r2 and pbias values between gpm and gauge data at the qianwaebo station were significantly distinct from those of the other stations fig 10 the performance of gpm at the qianwaebo station exhibited a negative r2 value 0 53 and a much higher pbias 53 compared with the average r2 of 0 78 and pbias within 24 at the other five hydrological stations fig 10 this means that gpm data have larger biases at the qianwaebo station than the other stations when we combine the only available gauge data to correct the biased gridded precipitation data metrics improvements are found for hydrological modeling at the qianwaebo station fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 precipitation correction by the multiplicative exponential function the multiplicative exponential correction model as adopted herein is more in line with the relationship between estimated and true precipitation than additive model alemohammad et al 2015 previous studies suggested the additive model was unable to separate random and systematic errors well and lacked the ability of reliable predictions as the additive model could give a precipitation value in a place where it was no rain owing to the random error however the multiplicative exponential model performed better in these aspects lafon et al 2013 tian et al 2013 chen et al 2022 the xiangride river basin has some of highlands are above the snowlines we have collected the average annual precipitation and snowmelt data from the results of swat modeling driven by four gridded datasets cmads trmm gpm and mswep we found the partitioning of runoff between direct precipitation response and snowmelt is around 75 84 and 16 25 respectively the results were similar to a previous study wang et al 2021 indicating the contribution of precipitation and snowmelt including ice melting was 83 and 17 respectively in the yellow river headwater area our results pertaining to a poorly gauged arid basin with high altitude demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplicative exponential function to correct the remote sensing and reanalysis precipitation datasets there is only one rain gauge installed in the study area thus we adopted the observed precipitation from this gauge to acquire the optimal correction parameters by a simple curve fitting approach which formed configuration c1 using gridded precipitation from the grid containing the gauge and c2 using mean gridded precipitation from multiple grids within a 500 m elevation range of the gauge these two configurations generally performed better than configuration c3 calibration via hydrological modeling especially when gpm dataset was used fig 7 we found that c1 had more stable improvement and it was easier to implement because the two correction parameters were directly obtained via curve fitting between available observations and the gridded precipitation in the grid cell containing the rain gauge these four corrected datasets yield similar values of both the mean annual precipitation fig 9 and the point precipitation at the grid where the qianwanebo station is located fig s8 therefore we would recommend configuration c1 in poorly gauged basins our results indicate that configuration c2 with gridded data from multiple grid cells does not necessarily outperform c1 this may be due to uncertainty is introduced when information from multiple grid cells is used however our results do not rule out the advantages of configuration c2 than c1 in other watersheds which demands further testing it is far more challenging to obtain observed data within this mountainous inland basin but we expect to develop a multi objective model calibration strategy that integrates observed runoff data with remote sensed evapotranspiration or soil moisture datasets in future study the precipitation correction parameters in c3 are determined by calibrating model against observed streamflow via a two step model calibration procedure we also conducted the joint calibration procedure and listed the optimal precipitation correction parameters table s1 we compared the performance of simulated streamflow across various calibration procedures fig s1 the optimal parameters vary slightly between the two step and joint procedure for cmads mswep and trmm whereas the parameters from joint calibration of gpm was closer to configuration c1 in summary the two step calibration procedure generated comparable parameter values and even better modeling performance than the joint calibration procedure probably due to that the joint calibration added complexity to model parameterization 4 2 streamflow informed precipitation correction streamflow observations integrate the comprehensive hydrological response to climate variation and anthropogenic activities in the whole watershed yet lacking explicit spatial heterogeneity information about the hydrologic processes dembélé et al 2020 although gridded precipitation datasets are subject to some systematic errors and uncertainties they do provide unique and related spatial patterns for distributed hydrological modeling becker et al 2019 our research particularly configuration c3 takes advantages of the spatial information embedded in multiple gridded precipitation datasets and correct precipitation by calibrating the swat model against observed streamflow our results also imply that the swat modeling performance in turn could be improved by correcting the gridded precipitation datasets our study demonstrates that precipitation correction via calibrating hydrological model against observed streamflow was a feasible way in poorly gauged and ungauged basins herrnegger et al 2018 ma et al 2021 although configuration c3 is not always superior to c1 and c2 the post evaluation against gauge precipitation indicated extraordinarily improvement in gpm and cmads datasets when c3 was used fig s6 in addition the implementation of c3 does not require gauge precipitation by contrast the precipitation correction parameters in c3 are determined by calibrating model against observed streamflow via a two step model calibration procedure therefore we argue that applying configuration c3 in ungauged basins with only streamflow available at the outlet is promising with regard to the four gridded datasets even though the corrected trmm under configuration c1 and c2 achieved the best performance of precipitation at the gauge station fig 5 its simulated streamflow was inferior to the corrected gpm fig 7 table s2 nevertheless gpm had significant improvement on the accuracy of both precipitation and streamflow simulations here we further collect the available data from hydrological stations in the qaidam basin to test the precipitation correction method fig 3 however we found the poor r2 and pbias values between gpm and gauge data at the qianwaebo station compared with the other stations fig 10 numerous previous studies pradhan et al 2022 zhu et al 2021 anjum et al 2019 have reported that gpm showed substantial bias at relatively higher elevations and over complex topographies among these available hydrological stations the qianwaebo station has the highest elevation fig 10 therefore we combine the only available gauge precipitation and streamflow data at the qianwaebo station to correct the biased gridded precipitation data through hydrological modeling the process based models e g the swat model driven by high quality gridded datasets can better represent the spatiotemporal variability of hydrological variables streamflow contains much more comprehensive information than sparse gauges only one rain gauge has limited representation of the actual climatic conditions across the watershed furthermore different gridded precipitation datasets have various spatial error characteristics and these precipitation errors would propagate in the process of hydrologic simulations which brings great uncertainties chen et al 2013 tang et al 2019 we believe that gpm provides the most reliable spatial pattern in the study area fig 8 thus the correction method efficiently improved its accuracy and hydrological modeling in the study area we found that the r2 values was 0 5 for the two periods except cmads in period 1 table s2 we believe that the true precipitation value in period 2 was lower than that in period 1 and cmads significantly underestimated the precipitation in period 1 with relatively low anthropogenic impact lv et al 2022 resulting in unsatisfying performance of hydrological simulation moreover the two parameters in the precipitation correction model derived in this study underwent swat model calibration and validation further verifying the reliability and predictability of our precipitation correction method in improving both precipitation estimate and streamflow modeling 5 conclusion here we developed a precipitation correction method in the swat model to correct precipitation input data and to evaluate its efficacy in streamflow modeling the proposed method was applied to correct four gridded precipitation datasets and calibrate the swat model in a typical poorly gauged alpine inland basin the xiangride river basin of northwest china with only one rain gauge and streamflow station three configurations were developed to obtain the optimal precipitation correction parameters i e curve fitting between gridded and gauge precipitation data pairs at the gauge location c1 or using gridded precipitation from multi grids within an elevation range of the gauge c2 and the calibration of the swat model against streamflow c3 results show that c1 significantly improved the hydrological modeling performance followed by configuration c2 the corrected gpm using configuration c1 achieved the highest agreement with the observation in hydrological modeling we also contend that configuration c3 is promising in ungauged basins with only streamflow available at the outlet since the implementation of configuration c3 does not require gauge precipitation we acknowledge that there is only one rain gauge and streamflow station available for model calibration and validation which may raise the concern on the reliability and robustness of the proposed method however we argue that this is also the merit of this study as we are attempting to provide a feasible strategy to correct the biases in remote sensing and reanalysis precipitation datasets for more accurate hydrological modeling in poorly gauged and ungauged basins 6 data available statement the data described in this article are openly

2007,concentrated recharge processes can define water quantity and quality in karst aquifer systems hydrological and hydrochemical dynamics at qinglongkou qlk spring and two sinkholes were synchronously monitored to elucidate solute migration processes under concentrated recharge conditions the results show that the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of the sinkholes and karst spring have corresponding impulse responses after rainfall events the components of the leachate including ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 in qlk spring decrease due to dilution during the periods of concentrated recharge but their fluxes increase by 4 to 271 compared to the sinkholes input owing to the continuous water rock interactions most chemical indicators are diluted along the hydrograph peaks but the pollutants including nitrogen and phosphorus are aggregated to higher values after rainstorms both at sinkholes and spring outlet with total inorganic nitrogen and po4 3 concentrations up to 11 34 mg l and 1 16 mg l during heavy rainfall events the nutrients from agricultural activities are easily dissolved into overland flow and nitrification mainly controls the nitrogen conversion in karst aquifer system pollutant fluxes of karst spring are lower than that of sinkholes due to solute storage and pollutant concentrations are 2 3 times higher than their natural background values in spring outlet after rainstorms accumulation and storage of pollutants are problems that cannot be underestimated for the clean utilization of karst water resources and the prevention control and repair of karst groundwater pollution which pose severe threats to the karst water quality keywords karst spring sinkhole pollutant accumulation conversion storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst water shortage both in quantity and quality caused by complex karst hydrogeological structure and highly vulnerability of karst groundwater are seriously threatening the development and utilization of water resources and ecological security in karst areas goldscheider et al 2020 liu et al 2022 on the one hand hydrochemical processes and variations in karst areas are more dynamic than in non karst areas due to the marked heterogeneity in the aquifers chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a b for example the xiangxi river basin in southern china has a sensitive hydrological response and significant dynamic changes in spring discharge luo et al 2016b aubach spring and sägebach spring in the northern alps show a high correlation and a simultaneous response to the rainfall event of all recorded water quality parameters frank et al 2022 furthermore karst aquifers are more sensitive to the external environment and their water quality changes are often characterized by natural factors e g precipitation runoff and human activities e g agriculture urbanization tourism jarvie et al 2014 li et al 2020 lv et al 2020 farming activities are usually concentrated in and around karst depressions which can produce large amounts of pollutants mellander et al 2013 radcliff et al 2021 richa et al 2022 in the process of karst water recharge various water sources from the surface carry pollutants from karst depressions into the aquifer system through sinkholes and dolines ghasemizadeh et al 2012 luo et al 2016a yang et al 2020 it is typical to have runoff carrying various solutes through karst conduits and fissures and discharging from springs wang et al 2022 for example nitrogen and phosphorus two of the essential nutrients are most used pollutants in intensive agricultural activities in karst areas liang et al 2022 mellander et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 nitrogen and phosphorus are the primary nutrients in eutrophication monteagudo et al 2012 and the primary pollutants in some karst areas occupied by agricultural activities yang et al 2020 due to the intense karstification of carbonate rocks nitrogen phosphorus potassium and similar nutrients on the surface can easily be transported into karst aquifer system through the sinkholes peterson et al 2002 resulting in karst groundwater pollution understanding the behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus in karst aquifers is imperative for effective groundwater quality management cao et al 2022 opsahl et al 2017 ren et al 2022 studies on hydrological processes have been conducted on concentrated recharge in karst aquifers shokri et al 2022 toran et al 2019 vesper and white 2004 hydrogeochemical methods for testing water quality and sources are widely used in karst areas including isotopic and hydrogeochemical techniques chen et al 2020 luo et al 2022 meanwhile high resolution hydrochemical sampling is a commonly used method in recent years to reveal hydrochemical dynamics and transport mechanisms during rainfall events winston and criss 2004 yang et al 2020 yue et al 2020 in addition mass flux can be used to evaluate the solute migration in karst aquifer system wang et al 2020 zou et al 2018 however it is rare to combine analysis of hydrological and hydrogeochemical processes both at sinkholes and karst spring outlet under concentrated recharge conditions remarkably little attention has been paid to the mechanism of pollutant accumulation and migration in the overland flow before draining into sinkholes and its conversion mechanism in karst aquifer during the underground flooding periods in fact this process directly determines the volume of recharge water quality and controls the general karst groundwater environment notably most groundwater contamination comes from concentrated recharge carrying pollutants in addition understanding the hydrochemical characteristics of karst water input at sinkholes and output at spring outlet is the best approach to determining and establishing the solute migration mechanism in karst aquifers in this work we combine high resolution hydrochemical data isotopes and hydrological calculations to characterize the pollutant sources as well as the chemical transformations and transitions between sinkholes and karst springs after concentrated recharge events the solute migration process from sinkholes to spring outlets is discussed by calculating and comparing the mass fluxes this study aims to 1 present the temporal pattern of hydrochemical components in sinkholes and karst spring 2 identify the dominant source of leaching and pollution components and 3 quantitatively assess the solute migration process from sinkholes to karst spring outlet the results of this study will provide new insights and deeper understanding of solute transport in karst aquifer systems in southern china and support our understanding of the interaction between karst hydrological processes and the surrounding environment to effectively forecast groundwater pollution after rainstorms which may also offer scientific basis for local groundwater resources protection and management 2 study area 2 1 general descriptions the qinglongkou qlk spring is located in zhenzi town xingshan county yichang city hubei province china fig 1 a the study area is in a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone with distinct seasons and abundant rainfall the average annual precipitation is 900 to 1200 mm mainly concentrated from april to september according to the field investigation and analysis of remote sensing images the local karst depressions are important agricultural bases in this mountainous area where tobacco leaves and alpine vegetables are generally cultivated qlk spring is located in the typical karst trough valley area which is one of the vital karst landform types in south china karst depressions and sinkholes are well developed in this area with varied elevations ranging from 1300 to 1700 m driving the recharge area for qlk spring that emerges at 1190 m a s l fig 1 2 2 geology the age of the geological strata in the study area is from sinian to silurian the stratum dips northwest with a relatively gentle angle the lithologies are dominated by thick carbonate and subordinate clastic units with good continuity fig 1c d the loushanguan formation and the qinjiamiao formation in the cambrian age are widespread carbonate units also ordovician strata are dominated by bioclastic limestone with partially thin mud layers thick mudstone and shale units of the silurian and lower cambrian ages constitute the primary clastic rocks in this area luo et al 2016b 2 3 hydrogeology the study area presents a multi layer karst aquifer system structure with the surface water and groundwater frequently converted dolomite and limestone of the cambrian age constitute the primary karst aquifer in the area mudstone and shale of the lower cambrian form the impermeable basement of the karst aquifer system of the cambrian which makes qlk discharge by contact descent spring fig 1c d similarly the zhaidong zd spring is formed by contact decline due to the impermeable basement of clayey dolomite in the first section of the qinjiamiao formation middle cambrian є2q zd is a seasonal spring that breaks down in the dry season because of its small recharge area the prototype karst depression in the north is a recharge area of qlk spring it is easy to produce concentrated confluence in karst depressions in the rainy season even karst waterlogging under heavy rainfall the canyon area of southern erosion is the discharge area qlk spring is a concentrated discharge outlet becoming the source of the gaolan river an eastern tributary of the xiangxi river basin there is no runoff in sinkhole a sha during the dry period runoff formed after rainfall recharges into the karst aquifer through sha and the groundwater finally discharges through qlk spring after flowing through a surface ditch water from zd recharges to the underlying karst aquifer through sinkhole b shb and finally discharges at qlk spring outlet fig 1b c d the flow rate of qlk spring varies from tens of liters per second to several cubic meters per second previous studies have identified the connectivity and distribution of two karst conduits between sha and shb with qlk spring through artificial tracer tests and geophysical exploration luo et al 2016a qlk system is a good field test site with a clear entrance and exit of conduit and a simple hydrogeological structure to study hydrochemical migration processes 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrological and meteorological data hydrological and meteorological data from the study area were collected to establish the relationship between rainfall and the flow rate of sinkholes and karst spring meteorological data were collected from gujiatang rainfall station gjt and zhangguandian rainfall station zgd in the recharge area of qlk spring gjt is a rain gauge metone rg3 m established from october 2021 with a monitoring frequency of 30 min and an accuracy of 0 2 mm the online data with long series in zgd was collected from hubei hydrology and water resources center with a monitoring frequency of 1 h and an accuracy of 0 5 mm the catchment range of sha is the trough valley along zgd on the west side of qlk system with a catchment area of 4 km2 the catchment range of shb is the north south trough valley on the north side with a catchment area of 0 9 km2 zgd is located in the main catchment area of sha while gjt is located in the main catchment area of shb the water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec of karst water were continuously monitored at qlk sha and shb using automatic field equipment model 3001 ltc levelogger solinst canada ltd these measurements were recorded in 15 min steps from june 18 to july 6 2022 the discharge flow has a polynomial relation to the water level of the reservoir for qlk spring outlet and flow rates can be calculated by the relationships between water level and flow rate eq 1 1 q 0 611 h 2 32 636 h where q is the discharge flow rate of qlk spring l s h is the water level of the reservoir in qlk spring outlet cm similar relationships can be found for the two sinkholes the relationship at sha is eq 2 and eq 3 for shb 2 q a 0 058 h a 2 5 887 h a 3 q b 0 13 0 h b 2 6 310 h b where q a and q b are the recharge flow rate of sha and shb respectively l s h a and h b are the water levels of the surface ditches connected to sha and shb respectively cm 3 2 hydrogeochemical sampling and analysis chemical and deuterium oxygen isotope data from water samples were used to study the temporal dynamics of water quality in sinkholes and karst springs from june 18 to july 6 2022 water samples of qlk sha shb and rainfall were collected the samples of qlk were collected by automatic water quality sampler grasp fc 9624 and the rain and sinkhole samples were collected manually the water samples at the sinkholes were collected through a self made sampling bucket at the same position where the hydrological monitoring probe was set and the collected water samples were tested for in situ indicators and pretreated in the field water samples are collected under different hydrological conditions with the time interval varying from half an hour during the rising and falling limb of events to two hours during baseflow some of these samples are selected for laboratory testing based on changes in conductivity 1 liter of each water sample was tested for electrical conductivity ec ph eh and dissolved oxygen using hach hq40d equipment the hco3 concentrations were measured by hydrochloric acid titration after sampling in the field the n no2 n nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were measured by hach dr3900 in the field with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l 0 01 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the water samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter membrane to measure anions cations and stable deuterium oxygen isotope in which the cationic water samples were acidified with nitric acid to ph 2 hydrogeochemical and deuterium oxygen isotopes were analyzed at the geological survey laboratory china university of geosciences wuhan the stable isotopes were analyzed using an lgr iwa 45ep device and the results were reported as δ18o and δd values representing per mil deviations from the vsmow standard analytical precision is 0 08 and 0 3 respectively anions were analyzed using an ics 2100 instrument with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l analyses of metal elements were carried out with a thermo fisher icap6300 instrument with an accuracy of about 0 001 mg l all samples underwent ionic balance analysis providing results better than 5 of the amount present saturation indices of the main minerals calcite dolomite gypsum celestite and strontium were calculated using phreeqc software to illustrate hydrogeochemical processes and water rock interactions in groundwater the total inorganic nitrogen tin cl method was used to determine the impact of human activities on water quality in the study area 3 3 identification of solute migration process the weighted mean values of solute at each sampling position were calculated to quantify and compare the hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of rainfall sinkholes and spring according to the law of mass conservation the weighted mean values of solute can be calculated by solving the following equations for rainfall the equation is 4 0 t c p t p t d t c p m 0 t p t d t for sinkholes the equation is 5 0 t c in t q in t d t c in m 0 t q in t d t for spring the equation is 6 0 t c out t q out t d t c out m 0 t q out t q bf d t c bf 0 t q bf d t where c p t c i n t c o u t t are the measured hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of rainfall sinkholes and spring respectively mg l or c p m c i n m c o u t m are the weighted mean values of solute of rainfall sinkholes and spring respectively mg l or c b f is hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of baseflow in spring which is identified by baseflow splitting p t is precipitation mm q i n t is the recharge rate l s q o u t t is the discharge rate l s q b f is the rate of baseflow the weighted mean values of the solute from sha and shb are mixed with quantifying the weighted mean values of the solute from conduits input by the following equation 7 c c v a v b c a v a c b v b where c c is the weighted mean values of solute of conduits input mg l or c a c b are the weighted mean values of solute of sha and shb respectively mg l or v a v b is the total recharge flow volume of sha and shb respectively l the ratios of qlk pulse increment and conduits input mix of sha and shb were calculated to compare the weighted mean values of solute in conduits input with spring output and identify the migration process in karst aquifer by the following equation 8 r c out m c c 100 where r is the ratio of spring output to conduits input c o u t m and c c are the weighted mean values of spring output and conduits input respectively mg l or the changes in the ratio were calculated to make the results more intuitive by the following equation 9 r c r 100 where r c is the variation between r and 1 if r c 0 this would imply that the solute increase during the underground migration if r c 0 it means that the solute has not changed during the underground migration if r c 0 this would imply that the solute decrease during the underground migration the calculation and analysis results of the solute migration process identification methods will be discussed in part 4 4 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical responses after rainfall events 4 1 1 overland flow at sinkholes sinkholes are the main channels for karst springs to receive concentrated recharge and the recharge water significantly defines the quantity and quality of the springs in the qlk system two sinkholes sha and shb located in karst depressions serve as the recharge points the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of the two sinkholes were observed after rainfall events generally the overland flow is generated at the sinkholes after rainfall events with volumes larger than 10 mm providing an effective recharge to qlk spring however the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of sha and shb are different due to the uneven spatial distribution of precipitation and human activities in mountainous areas fig 2 significant overland flow was produced in sha during the rainfall event on june 27 2022 with a rainfall amount of 67 mm after the rainfall event the flow rate of sha increased in half an hour peaked in six hours and finally receded rapidly n and p concentrations are found to be high values when the overland flow is generated then gradually decrease over time na k and cl concentrations are also high at first and decrease during peak flow but they increase again at the end of the overland flow in contrast ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 concentrations are low at first and then increase steadily fig 2 the underlying hydrological process and response of shb are similar to sha at the beginning of the overland flow the difference is that the flow process of shb is longer due to the recharge from zd which drives the second peak flow however during light rain events the hydrochemical process of shb is similar to sha as observed during the 11 mm shower on june 19 nevertheless during heavier rainstorms as observed on june 23 and 27 with 20 mm and 56 mm respectively the concentrations of all hydrochemical components in shb are higher at the beginning in the overland flow subsequently n and p concentrations decrease sharply and eventually stay at low values similar to the performance in sha in addition the concentrations of other chemical components are lower at the peak flow rate due to dilution fig 2 the values of all ions are extremely low in the rainfall but they increase significantly during the overland flow process from rainfall to sinkholes table 1 meanwhile the pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus accumulated with the overland flow generation contaminate the groundwater system the response processes of the various chemical components are not the same because of the different sources and geological formations which will be discussed in subsequent sections 4 1 2 discharge at qlk spring outlet the hydrological processes of the qlk spring after rainfall events exhibit a pulse like response from the concentrated recharge of sinkholes overall the flow rises fast and recedes slowly the peak discharge flows occur around 5 to 13 h after a storm reaching only single digit cubic meters per second nevertheless the baseflow flow of the qlk spring is usually in the tens of liters per second during the dry periods the spring discharge is mainly composed of groundwater stored in karst fissures the quantity and quality of which are essentially constant the hydrochemistry of qlk spring varies significantly with the rapid flow fluctuation after the rainfall fig 3 due to the recharge by new water with different hydrochemical information from the baseflow after the rainfall events ca2 mg2 sr2 so4 2 and hco3 concentrations of qlk spring decrease rapidly through dilution from new water and then gradually increase as discharge rate declines exhibited by pulse like responses na k and cl concentrations are high at the beginning of the hydrograph response diluted at the peak discharge rate and finally gradually return to pre rainfall levels during small rainfall events as on june 19 and 23 n and p concentrations of qlk spring did not fluctuate significantly despite the flow rate light increase during heavy rainfall events as on june 27 july 1 and 3 n and p concentrations increase at the beginning of the hydrograph response and then gradually decrease exhibiting positive pulse like responses it is worth noting that throughout the monitoring process n and p concentrations of qlk spring did not return to the levels before the rainstorm on june 27 in addition the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 in the qlk spring were observed to be higher than in sinkholes indicating they increase significantly during the underground runoff however the average concentrations of n p and na k cl in the qlk spring are lower than in sinkholes table 1 indicating they are not replenished during the underground runoff or affected by other hydrogeochemical processes ca2 mg2 and hco3 mainly control the characteristics of hydrochemistry in qlk system the variation of which are consistent with the conductivity however after heavy rainfall events the n and p concentrations are significantly higher than their natural baseline values furthermore they are accumulated at the beginning of the responses the indication is that the concentrated recharge input has polluted karst groundwater which is a severe environmental problem 4 1 3 hydrochemical variations under different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity and precipitation directly control the recharge process of sinkholes and indirectly affect the hydrochemical response of karst springs rainfall events lower than the runoff threshold cannot produce the overland flow and change the water quantity and quality of the karst spring because no effective recharge is formed e g 9 mm on june 18 and 6 mm on june 30 the response of discharge flow is slight when the rainfall intensity is small and the response of different components in groundwater presents different characteristics for example the discharge rate of qlk spring increased slightly after the rainfall events on june 19 and 23 the ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations decrease slightly initially and then increase gradually but the tin and po4 3 responses in the qlk spring are not apparent though the peak concentrations in the sinkholes reach 6 46 mg l and 0 47 mg l respectively few pollutants can be brought into the ground when the volume of concentrated recharge is limited the responses of all hydrochemical components of qlk spring are obvious when the rainfall intensity is large enough usually with the hourly rainfall larger than 10 mm in the recharge area at that time the overland flow at the sinkholes is generated efficiently and the discharge flow of the spring increases considerably for example the discharge rate increased significantly on june 27 july 1 and 3 furthermore ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations exhibit corresponding negative impulse responses meanwhile n and p accumulate at both sinkholes and qlk spring indicating that the concentrated recharge carrying the pollutants directly contaminates the karst spring it also shows that heavy rainfall events are essential driving factors for the accumulation of pollutants in sinkholes and karst groundwater however the concentrations of pollutants also decrease affected by dilution when the recharge rate is huge for example n and p concentrations in qlk spring on june 27 were observed to be lower on july 1 and 3 4 2 hydrochemical source identification 4 2 1 chemical weathering the primary lithology of the exposed strata in the study area is pure dolomite and limestone the soil overlain on the karst depression is mainly weathered from the muddy dolomite ions such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 are from karstification and their concentrations represent the degrees of karst weathering process fluvial action over time gradually dissolves the surrounding soil and rocks producing high ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations significantly contributing to the hydrogeochemical formations of the aquifer system the formations of sr2 and so4 2 are probably related to the dissolution of celestite strontianite and gypsum in the stratum results of the saturation indices si show that calcite dolomite gypsum celestite and strontianite in the qlk system are unsaturated fig 4 suggesting they have a tendency for continuous dissolution the si of dolomite and calcite are higher than that of other minerals further indicating that the dissolution of carbonate rocks dominates the hydrochemical evolution of the qlk system during this study it was observed that after rainfall events the si of dolomite and calcite in sha continued to rise while the si of celestine strontianite and gypsum exhibited low values during peak flow due to dilution notably the shb is affected more by dilution making the si of all these minerals low during the peak recharge flow period furthermore the catchment area of sha is larger so it is more affected by soil leaching during the overland flow process in addition the si of all these minerals were observed to be higher in the qlk spring than in the sinkholes the si of minerals in qlk decrease only when the effect of dilution on ion concentrations is greater than that of the dissolution under high flowrate conditions in summary the chemical weathering of soil and rock determines the main chemical composition of the sinkholes and spring water in the qlk system mixing a large amount of low concentration water caused by rainfall dilutes the original groundwater and changes the original water in the aquifer from relatively saturated to more unsaturated it not only causes ion concentrations and mineral si to decrease during peak discharge rates but also makes the groundwater continuously dissolve minerals to reach a new water rock equilibrium 4 2 2 agricultural and domestic pollution the possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus include rainfall human activities and other factors richa et al 2022 the pollution from rainfall can be almost negligible due to the limited content of such elements in the rainfall table 1 accordingly agricultural and domestic activities are the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus in the study area previous studies have shown that the total inorganic nitrogen tin cl method can effectively screen groundwater contaminants 2 5 mg l and 7 mg l are considered boundary concentrations for tin and cl human contamination respectively panno et al 2006b 2006a in addition tin concentrations higher than 15 mg l indicate significant contamination by human animal waste zhang et al 2014 tin concentrations between 2 5 mg l and 15 mg l are thought to be mainly polluted by nitrogen fertilizer ren et al 2022 in this study cl concentrations in all samples in the qlk system are lower than 7 mg l while tin concentrations are lower than 15 mg l fig 5 however the tin concentrations from various samples are higher than 2 5 mg l suggesting contaminants from agricultural sources especially n fertilizers cl and tin are accumulated in the sinkholes and spring outlet under rainstorm conditions this effect is significant in sinkholes at the beginning of overland flow process the cl concentrations in shb samples are higher than 3 mg l at the beginning and then decrease to 2 mg l at the same time the tin concentrations in shb samples are higher than 4 mg l at the beginning and then decrease to 2 5 mg l the magnitude of variation in cl is minimal even at peak concentration the cl concentrations are lower than 7 mg l as the karst aquifers in the study area are composed of pure carbonate rocks and the cl concentration in rainfall is only 0 59 mg l it can be considered that the accumulation of cl at the beginning of rainstorms is mainly affected by domestic pollution in the catchment area of sha fig 1c 5 is used for domestic activity 10 is occupied by agriculture and the rest is forest for shb less than 1 of the catchment area is used for domestic activity and 18 for agriculture the more densely populated residential areas produce higher cl concentrations in sha than shb after the contaminated water is transported into the aquifer through sinkholes the qlk spring eventually becomes polluted thereby increasing the concentration of tin significantly for example tin concentrations observed at the qlk spring remained above 2 5 mg l after increasing during the rainfall event on june 27 fig 3 in general domestic and agricultural activities in the recharge area have polluted the groundwater environment of qlk spring the agricultural areas in the study area are much larger than residential areas so agricultural pollution is more serious than domestic pollution however with agriculture being the mainstay of the local economy contaminants from this source cannot be ignored some nutrients in fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus are absorbed by plants while the rest enter the soil when the rainfall intensity is large enough nutrients in the soil can be dissolved into the overland flow then pollute the karst aquifer through the concentrated recharge of the sinkholes for karst aquifer systems with larger recharge areas the accumulation effect of this pollution will be more significant and the negative impact will be stronger if the overland flow in karst depressions consolidates non point source agricultural pollution into point source pollution 4 3 hydrochemical migration processes 4 3 1 water rock interactions the migration and conversion processes of solute can be analyzed by comparing the flux changes between the input of the sinkhole and the output of the karst spring the weighted mean values of the solutes in sinkholes and spring during a typical rainfall such as on june 27 were calculated by eqs 4 7 the ratios of qlk pulse increment and input through conduits were also calculated by eqs 8 9 table 2 fig 6 during the rainstorm the response characteristics of different hydrochemical components to the input of sinkholes were observed to be variable the groundwater residence time in the qlk system is too short for isotope exchange as such the output value of deuterium and oxygen isotopes are consistent with the input with the rc within 1 in addition the rc of na k and cl concentrations are within 15 these chemical components are limited in pure carbonate rocks and are mainly derived from external sources so they do not increase significantly when flowing through a typical karst aquifer system the results of the computations show that it is feasible to analyze the hydrochemical migration process of karst groundwater by flux analysis and comparison of the weighted average values the analysis found that the fluxes of ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 for the qlk output increase significantly compared with those from the conduits the rc of ca2 mg2 and hco3 is 20 while the rc of sr2 is up to 271 it is noteworthy that alkaline sr a key soil element is sensitive to hydrological dynamics meanwhile groundwater with a longer residence time and sufficient water rock interaction has a higher sr2 concentration as such it can be better used to reveal the water rock interactions for our study area the sr2 concentration in rainfall was found to be very low at only 0 004 mg l as for observations at sha and shb typical sr2 concentrations after overland flow are 0 065 mg l and 0 054 mg l respectively after leaching in the aquifer the sr2 concentration increases significantly to 0 219 mg l in the qlk spring which is 3 7 times higher sr2 than the input through conduits the variation of sr2 concentration indicates that the influence of water rock interaction on groundwater hydrochemical composition is significant although the response time of water quantity and quality in qlk to rainfall is short fig 3 the influx of new water dilutes the main hydrochemical components of karst groundwater but the total amount of these solutes are essentially increasing overall water rock interaction occurs in the whole process from rainfall to sinkhole to karst spring especially in karst aquifer 4 3 2 conversion of nitrogen nitrogen is an element with multiple valence states which has a variety of forms in aqueous solutions and undergoes redox reactions with environmental changes this study observed that the inorganic nitrogen indicators from the qlk spring significantly exceed their natural baseline values during underground flooding high flow event the peak concentrations of n nh4 n no2 n no3 observed from qlk spring reach 1 01 mg l 0 019 mg l and 4 25 mg l respectively as for the flux n nh4 n no2 and tin concentrations from qlk are lower than the input through conduits however n no3 and tin concentrations are similar to the input table 2 fig 6 it shows that some conversion processes may be occurring between inorganic nitrogen nitrogen in nitrogenous fertilizer mainly exists in n nh4 and partly in n no3 perrin et al 2008 raza et al 2020 at the beginning of the overland flow on june 27 n nh4 was the main form of inorganic nitrogen in sha and shb at 76 and 45 respectively with the continuation of the recharge process the proportion of n nh4 of tin in the sinkholes gradually decreased while n no3 became the main formation accounting for more than 95 on the other hand n no3 was always the main form of inorganic nitrogen in qlk spring accounting for more than 70 fig 7 a in addition the peak concentration of n nh4 was always earlier than other forms of inorganic nitrogen in both sinkholes and qlk spring fig 2 fig 3 indicating that n nh4 enters the karst water cycle before n no3 furthermore the do concentrations of all samples are higher than 2 mg l table 1 which is not conducive to denitrification desimone and howes 1998 trudell et al 1986 all these shreds of evidence indicate the existence of nitrification in qlk system 10 2 n h 4 3 o 2 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 11 2 n o 2 o 2 2 n o 3 after spreading nh4 from nitrogenous fertilizers is oxidized in soil by autotrophic bacteria during nitrification resulting in no3 and h ions meanwhile nitric acid can replace carbonic acid in the dissolution of carbonate rock the equation of which will change from eq 12 to eq 13 12 ca 1 x mg x co 3 co 2 h 2 o h c o 3 1 x ca 2 x mg 2 2 h c o 3 13 ca 1 x mg x co 3 hno 3 h c o 3 1 x ca 2 x mg 2 n o 3 in this situation the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water will change from 0 5 to 1 perrin et al 2008 fig 8 b for qlk system the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in sha shb and qlk are 0 51 0 58 and 0 57 respectively fig 7b the impact of n fertilizer in shb is more significant than sha with the larger agricultural activity area so the effect of nitrification on carbonate rock dissolution in shb is more significant qlk spring receives recharge from both sha and shb at the same time the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in sha is very close to 0 5 but the ratio of qlk is closer to shb deviating from the 1 2 ratio line it shows that nitrification not only occurs on the surface but also impacts karst spring changing the ratio from 0 51 in sha to 0 57 in qlk 4 3 3 storage of pollutants from the foregoing discussion we can deduce that underground flood drives pollutant migration in karst aquifer system from the plot of tin po4 3 vs discharge rate of qlk fig 8a it can be seen that both tin and po4 3 concentrations and the discharge rate of qlk were low before the underground flood therefore during the baseflow tin and po4 3 concentrations can be considered as their natural background value tin is 1 9 mg l po4 3 is 0 1 mg l accordingly during the underground flood tin and po4 3 concentrations increase with the rise of discharge rate manifesting as accumulated discharges of pollutants however tin and po4 3 concentrations are low affected by dilution when the discharge rate of qlk exceeds a certain threshold about 1500l s it is worth mentioning that as the underground floods recede tin and po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring do not return to pre rainfall levels like the discharge flow and other solutes tin and po4 3 concentrations remain relatively high for a long time until they rise again in the next rainfall for example tin and po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring are about 3 5 mg l and 0 3 mg l after the underground flood in rainfall event on june 27 which are 1 75 times and 3 times of its natural background value beyond that po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring have a specific linear positive correlation with tin concentrations c po4 3 0 088c tin 0 059 r2 0 63 fig 8b indicating that they show similar characteristics in the water cycle have not only the same sources but also the same migration path this phenomenon also exists in other karst areas dominated by agricultural activities e g gao et al 2020 when the sinkhole recharge is small for example during the rainfall events on june 19 and 23 n and p were accumulated at the sinkholes but no significant concentration response was observed in qlk spring the small amount of recharge water is insufficient to drive pollutants into the aquifer or a small amount of pollution cannot be reflected in the spring due to dilution but when the recharge rate is large enough n and p in qlk spring show an accumulation process synchronized with the sinkholes the flux calculation results show that the total output flux is smaller than the total input flux although n and p concentrations in qlk spring are higher after rain incredibly about 20 of po4 3 is not released from karst aquifers fig 6 however there is no leaching or other sources of n and p in the aquifer which indicates the storage of pollutants this phenomenon is widespread in solute transport of karst groundwater under heavy rainfall recharge conditions water level in karst conduits rises rapidly resulting in underground flooding the head difference drives water and solutes in the conduits into the fissures connected with the conduits after the rainfall event the hydraulic gradient reverses and the conduits become discharge spaces for the surrounding fissures water carrying solute in fractures is slowly released into conduit at a low velocity during this process some solutes are retained in the fractures and cannot return to the conduits due to the low velocity resulting in the solute input from the sinkholes cannot be discharged through the karst spring in time and when the hydrodynamic condition is stronger the amount of storage is greater and the times taken for the solute concentration in karst spring to return to the background value is longer ji et al 2022 therefore the concentration decay tails of n and p during the rainstorm on june 27 are more remarkable than that on july 1 and 3 after heavy rainfall events some pollutants are stored in the karst aquifer system and delayed release which has negative impacts on the ecological health of the karst aquifer system 4 3 4 conceptual model of solute migration from the analysis carried out above the conceptual model of solute migration from sinkholes to karst spring is summarized in fig 9 the concentrations of all hydrochemical components in sinkholes increase during the overland flow process the leaching of calcium rich alkaline soil makes the water in sinkholes present typical karst water chemical characteristics simultaneously pollutants produced by agricultural and domestic activities are brought into the groundwater once the rainfall is intense enough nutrients accumulated in the sinkholes are flushed into subsurface system through the conduits resulting in the pollution of karst aquifer fig 9a after entering the karst aquifer the water recharged by sinkholes migrates through karst conduits and fractures and finally reaches the karst spring the ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 concentrations in the karst spring show negative impulse responses with the arrival of new water during this process water rock interaction occurs continuously and mineral dissolution causes increasing amounts of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 affected by dilution the peak n and p concentrations in the karst spring are lower than in sinkholes and the hydrochemistry of karst springs shows different response characteristics under different rain intensities the pollutants mainly remain in soil and karst fissures during small rainfall events once the rainfall is heavy enough to create underground flooding e g the hourly rainfall larger than 10 mm pollutants in the soil and fissures are flushed into the sinkholes and karst spring reflecting the accumulation of pollutants at the beginning response of chemograph importantly there is a transformation process from unsaturated zone to saturated zone in the fissures during underground flooding and again becomes unsaturated zone in karst system after the rainfall events which can be called transient saturated zone fig 9c in the process of solute migration in karst conduits and fissures on the one hand the form and proportion of solutes are transformed by geochemical reactions such as nitrification on the other hand the phenomenon of solute storage caused by the storage and re release process between karst conduits and fissures makes part of the solute store in karst aquifers frank et al 2019 ji et al 2022 or the transient saturated zone fig 9b c since ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 always exist in the karst groundwater system and their fluxes continuously rise with the water rock interaction the storage phenomenon is not apparent in the solute formed by dissolution and filtration however this storage phenomenon controls external inputs such as n and p significantly the concentrated recharge from the sinkholes as well as the storage detention and delayed release of pollutants between karst conduits and fissures e g transient saturated zone are problems that cannot be ignored for safe utilization of karst groundwater resources and the prevention control and remediation of karst groundwater pollution which brings significant challenges to the protection of karst groundwater 5 conclusions in this study the sources and migration mechanisms accumulation conversion and storage of contaminates driven by concentrated recharge conditions in a typical karst system were studied and elucidated in addition the hydrological processes defined by the rainfall sinkholes karst spring integrated system were monitored and analyzed to establish a basis for assessing groundwater quantity and quality the results of the assessment and analysis show that the concentrations of all hydrochemical components increase significantly from rainfall to concentrated confluence in the sinkholes nitrogen and phosphorus are accumulated at the beginning of the recharge processes the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 in qlk spring are higher than in sinkholes while the average concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in qlk spring are lower than in sinkholes a significant accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred both in sinkholes and qlk spring after heavy rainfall events the chemical characteristics of the water in sinkholes and spring exhibit typical karst water characteristics with leaching components such as ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 the chemical weathering of soil and rock determines the main chemical composition of the sinkholes and spring water in the qlk system mixing with new water increases the potential of water rock reactions in addition the domestic and agricultural activities in the recharge area have polluted the groundwater environment furthermore the tin cl analysis shows that nitrogen pollution mainly comes from n fertilizer nutrients in the soil can pollute the karst aquifer through the concentrated recharge from sinkholes the migration processes of solutes were analyzed by comparing the flux calculation it can be seen that the calculated fluxes of ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 in qlk output increase dramatically indicating water rock interaction in the karst aquifer is significant however pollutants including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations decrease because of conversion storage and detention functions in karst aquifer or transient saturated zone nitrification occurs in both surface runoff generation and karst aquifer changing the composition of inorganic nitrogen the head difference drives the groundwater and solutes in the conduit into the fractured medium connected to the conduit during the underground flooding some pollutants are transiently stored in the fissures or the transient saturated zone due to solute storage and detention then released from fissure water to conduit water in the recession periods or the next recharge events it is one of the critical contents in this study to identify the sources of pollutants and analyze the solute migration mechanism along the hydrological process of karst depressions by monitoring the quantity and quality of water from sinkholes to karst spring the results show that the pollution caused by the concentrated recharge to karst aquifer system during the rainstorm cannot be ignored this study can improve our understanding of the solutes and typical pollutants transport mechanism from sinkholes to karst spring under concentrated recharge conditions

2007,concentrated recharge processes can define water quantity and quality in karst aquifer systems hydrological and hydrochemical dynamics at qinglongkou qlk spring and two sinkholes were synchronously monitored to elucidate solute migration processes under concentrated recharge conditions the results show that the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of the sinkholes and karst spring have corresponding impulse responses after rainfall events the components of the leachate including ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 in qlk spring decrease due to dilution during the periods of concentrated recharge but their fluxes increase by 4 to 271 compared to the sinkholes input owing to the continuous water rock interactions most chemical indicators are diluted along the hydrograph peaks but the pollutants including nitrogen and phosphorus are aggregated to higher values after rainstorms both at sinkholes and spring outlet with total inorganic nitrogen and po4 3 concentrations up to 11 34 mg l and 1 16 mg l during heavy rainfall events the nutrients from agricultural activities are easily dissolved into overland flow and nitrification mainly controls the nitrogen conversion in karst aquifer system pollutant fluxes of karst spring are lower than that of sinkholes due to solute storage and pollutant concentrations are 2 3 times higher than their natural background values in spring outlet after rainstorms accumulation and storage of pollutants are problems that cannot be underestimated for the clean utilization of karst water resources and the prevention control and repair of karst groundwater pollution which pose severe threats to the karst water quality keywords karst spring sinkhole pollutant accumulation conversion storage data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the karst water shortage both in quantity and quality caused by complex karst hydrogeological structure and highly vulnerability of karst groundwater are seriously threatening the development and utilization of water resources and ecological security in karst areas goldscheider et al 2020 liu et al 2022 on the one hand hydrochemical processes and variations in karst areas are more dynamic than in non karst areas due to the marked heterogeneity in the aquifers chen et al 2017 zhang et al 2020a b for example the xiangxi river basin in southern china has a sensitive hydrological response and significant dynamic changes in spring discharge luo et al 2016b aubach spring and sägebach spring in the northern alps show a high correlation and a simultaneous response to the rainfall event of all recorded water quality parameters frank et al 2022 furthermore karst aquifers are more sensitive to the external environment and their water quality changes are often characterized by natural factors e g precipitation runoff and human activities e g agriculture urbanization tourism jarvie et al 2014 li et al 2020 lv et al 2020 farming activities are usually concentrated in and around karst depressions which can produce large amounts of pollutants mellander et al 2013 radcliff et al 2021 richa et al 2022 in the process of karst water recharge various water sources from the surface carry pollutants from karst depressions into the aquifer system through sinkholes and dolines ghasemizadeh et al 2012 luo et al 2016a yang et al 2020 it is typical to have runoff carrying various solutes through karst conduits and fissures and discharging from springs wang et al 2022 for example nitrogen and phosphorus two of the essential nutrients are most used pollutants in intensive agricultural activities in karst areas liang et al 2022 mellander et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 nitrogen and phosphorus are the primary nutrients in eutrophication monteagudo et al 2012 and the primary pollutants in some karst areas occupied by agricultural activities yang et al 2020 due to the intense karstification of carbonate rocks nitrogen phosphorus potassium and similar nutrients on the surface can easily be transported into karst aquifer system through the sinkholes peterson et al 2002 resulting in karst groundwater pollution understanding the behavior of nitrogen and phosphorus in karst aquifers is imperative for effective groundwater quality management cao et al 2022 opsahl et al 2017 ren et al 2022 studies on hydrological processes have been conducted on concentrated recharge in karst aquifers shokri et al 2022 toran et al 2019 vesper and white 2004 hydrogeochemical methods for testing water quality and sources are widely used in karst areas including isotopic and hydrogeochemical techniques chen et al 2020 luo et al 2022 meanwhile high resolution hydrochemical sampling is a commonly used method in recent years to reveal hydrochemical dynamics and transport mechanisms during rainfall events winston and criss 2004 yang et al 2020 yue et al 2020 in addition mass flux can be used to evaluate the solute migration in karst aquifer system wang et al 2020 zou et al 2018 however it is rare to combine analysis of hydrological and hydrogeochemical processes both at sinkholes and karst spring outlet under concentrated recharge conditions remarkably little attention has been paid to the mechanism of pollutant accumulation and migration in the overland flow before draining into sinkholes and its conversion mechanism in karst aquifer during the underground flooding periods in fact this process directly determines the volume of recharge water quality and controls the general karst groundwater environment notably most groundwater contamination comes from concentrated recharge carrying pollutants in addition understanding the hydrochemical characteristics of karst water input at sinkholes and output at spring outlet is the best approach to determining and establishing the solute migration mechanism in karst aquifers in this work we combine high resolution hydrochemical data isotopes and hydrological calculations to characterize the pollutant sources as well as the chemical transformations and transitions between sinkholes and karst springs after concentrated recharge events the solute migration process from sinkholes to spring outlets is discussed by calculating and comparing the mass fluxes this study aims to 1 present the temporal pattern of hydrochemical components in sinkholes and karst spring 2 identify the dominant source of leaching and pollution components and 3 quantitatively assess the solute migration process from sinkholes to karst spring outlet the results of this study will provide new insights and deeper understanding of solute transport in karst aquifer systems in southern china and support our understanding of the interaction between karst hydrological processes and the surrounding environment to effectively forecast groundwater pollution after rainstorms which may also offer scientific basis for local groundwater resources protection and management 2 study area 2 1 general descriptions the qinglongkou qlk spring is located in zhenzi town xingshan county yichang city hubei province china fig 1 a the study area is in a typical subtropical monsoon climate zone with distinct seasons and abundant rainfall the average annual precipitation is 900 to 1200 mm mainly concentrated from april to september according to the field investigation and analysis of remote sensing images the local karst depressions are important agricultural bases in this mountainous area where tobacco leaves and alpine vegetables are generally cultivated qlk spring is located in the typical karst trough valley area which is one of the vital karst landform types in south china karst depressions and sinkholes are well developed in this area with varied elevations ranging from 1300 to 1700 m driving the recharge area for qlk spring that emerges at 1190 m a s l fig 1 2 2 geology the age of the geological strata in the study area is from sinian to silurian the stratum dips northwest with a relatively gentle angle the lithologies are dominated by thick carbonate and subordinate clastic units with good continuity fig 1c d the loushanguan formation and the qinjiamiao formation in the cambrian age are widespread carbonate units also ordovician strata are dominated by bioclastic limestone with partially thin mud layers thick mudstone and shale units of the silurian and lower cambrian ages constitute the primary clastic rocks in this area luo et al 2016b 2 3 hydrogeology the study area presents a multi layer karst aquifer system structure with the surface water and groundwater frequently converted dolomite and limestone of the cambrian age constitute the primary karst aquifer in the area mudstone and shale of the lower cambrian form the impermeable basement of the karst aquifer system of the cambrian which makes qlk discharge by contact descent spring fig 1c d similarly the zhaidong zd spring is formed by contact decline due to the impermeable basement of clayey dolomite in the first section of the qinjiamiao formation middle cambrian є2q zd is a seasonal spring that breaks down in the dry season because of its small recharge area the prototype karst depression in the north is a recharge area of qlk spring it is easy to produce concentrated confluence in karst depressions in the rainy season even karst waterlogging under heavy rainfall the canyon area of southern erosion is the discharge area qlk spring is a concentrated discharge outlet becoming the source of the gaolan river an eastern tributary of the xiangxi river basin there is no runoff in sinkhole a sha during the dry period runoff formed after rainfall recharges into the karst aquifer through sha and the groundwater finally discharges through qlk spring after flowing through a surface ditch water from zd recharges to the underlying karst aquifer through sinkhole b shb and finally discharges at qlk spring outlet fig 1b c d the flow rate of qlk spring varies from tens of liters per second to several cubic meters per second previous studies have identified the connectivity and distribution of two karst conduits between sha and shb with qlk spring through artificial tracer tests and geophysical exploration luo et al 2016a qlk system is a good field test site with a clear entrance and exit of conduit and a simple hydrogeological structure to study hydrochemical migration processes 3 materials and methods 3 1 hydrological and meteorological data hydrological and meteorological data from the study area were collected to establish the relationship between rainfall and the flow rate of sinkholes and karst spring meteorological data were collected from gujiatang rainfall station gjt and zhangguandian rainfall station zgd in the recharge area of qlk

located in the main catchment area of shb the water level temperature and electrical conductivity ec of karst water were continuously monitored at qlk sha and shb using automatic field equipment model 3001 ltc levelogger solinst canada ltd these measurements were recorded in 15 min steps from june 18 to july 6 2022 the discharge flow has a polynomial relation to the water level of the reservoir for qlk spring outlet and flow rates can be calculated by the relationships between water level and flow rate eq 1 1 q 0 611 h 2 32 636 h where q is the discharge flow rate of qlk spring l s h is the water level of the reservoir in qlk spring outlet cm similar relationships can be found for the two sinkholes the relationship at sha is eq 2 and eq 3 for shb 2 q a 0 058 h a 2 5 887 h a 3 q b 0 13 0 h b 2 6 310 h b where q a and q b are the recharge flow rate of sha and shb respectively l s h a and h b are the water levels of the surface ditches connected to sha and shb respectively cm 3 2 hydrogeochemical sampling and analysis chemical and deuterium oxygen isotope data from water samples were used to study the temporal dynamics of water quality in sinkholes and karst springs from june 18 to july 6 2022 water samples of qlk sha shb and rainfall were collected the samples of qlk were collected by automatic water quality sampler grasp fc 9624 and the rain and sinkhole samples were collected manually the water samples at the sinkholes were collected through a self made sampling bucket at the same position where the hydrological monitoring probe was set and the collected water samples were tested for in situ indicators and pretreated in the field water samples are collected under different hydrological conditions with the time interval varying from half an hour during the rising and falling limb of events to two hours during baseflow some of these samples are selected for laboratory testing based on changes in conductivity 1 liter of each water sample was tested for electrical conductivity ec ph eh and dissolved oxygen using hach hq40d equipment the hco3 concentrations were measured by hydrochloric acid titration after sampling in the field the n no2 n nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were measured by hach dr3900 in the field with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l 0 01 mg l and 0 01 mg l respectively the water samples were filtered with a 0 22 μm filter membrane to measure anions cations and stable deuterium oxygen isotope in which the cationic water samples were acidified with nitric acid to ph 2 hydrogeochemical and deuterium oxygen isotopes were analyzed at the geological survey laboratory china university of geosciences wuhan the stable isotopes were analyzed using an lgr iwa 45ep device and the results were reported as δ18o and δd values representing per mil deviations from the vsmow standard analytical precision is 0 08 and 0 3 respectively anions were analyzed using an ics 2100 instrument with an accuracy of 0 001 mg l analyses of metal elements were carried out with a thermo fisher icap6300 instrument with an accuracy of about 0 001 mg l all samples underwent ionic balance analysis providing results better than 5 of the amount present saturation indices of the main minerals calcite dolomite gypsum celestite and strontium were calculated using phreeqc software to illustrate hydrogeochemical processes and water rock interactions in groundwater the total inorganic nitrogen tin cl method was used to determine the impact of human activities on water quality in the study area 3 3 identification of solute migration process the weighted mean values of solute at each sampling position were calculated to quantify and compare the hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of rainfall sinkholes and spring according to the law of mass conservation the weighted mean values of solute can be calculated by solving the following equations for rainfall the equation is 4 0 t c p t p t d t c p m 0 t p t d t for sinkholes the equation is 5 0 t c in t q in t d t c in m 0 t q in t d t for spring the equation is 6 0 t c out t q out t d t c out m 0 t q out t q bf d t c bf 0 t q bf d t where c p t c i n t c o u t t are the measured hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of rainfall sinkholes and spring respectively mg l or c p m c i n m c o u t m are the weighted mean values of solute of rainfall sinkholes and spring respectively mg l or c b f is hydrochemical components and stable deuterium oxygen isotope of baseflow in spring which is identified by baseflow splitting p t is precipitation mm q i n t is the recharge rate l s q o u t t is the discharge rate l s q b f is the rate of baseflow the weighted mean values of the solute from sha and shb are mixed with quantifying the weighted mean values of the solute from conduits input by the following equation 7 c c v a v b c a v a c b v b where c c is the weighted mean values of solute of conduits input mg l or c a c b are the weighted mean values of solute of sha and shb respectively mg l or v a v b is the total recharge flow volume of sha and shb respectively l the ratios of qlk pulse increment and conduits input mix of sha and shb were calculated to compare the weighted mean values of solute in conduits input with spring output and identify the migration process in karst aquifer by the following equation 8 r c out m c c 100 where r is the ratio of spring output to conduits input c o u t m and c c are the weighted mean values of spring output and conduits input respectively mg l or the changes in the ratio were calculated to make the results more intuitive by the following equation 9 r c r 100 where r c is the variation between r and 1 if r c 0 this would imply that the solute increase during the underground migration if r c 0 it means that the solute has not changed during the underground migration if r c 0 this would imply that the solute decrease during the underground migration the calculation and analysis results of the solute migration process identification methods will be discussed in part 4 4 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemical responses after rainfall events 4 1 1 overland flow at sinkholes sinkholes are the main channels for karst springs to receive concentrated recharge and the recharge water significantly defines the quantity and quality of the springs in the qlk system two sinkholes sha and shb located in karst depressions serve as the recharge points the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of the two sinkholes were observed after rainfall events generally the overland flow is generated at the sinkholes after rainfall events with volumes larger than 10 mm providing an effective recharge to qlk spring however the hydrological and hydrochemical processes of sha and shb are different due to the uneven spatial distribution of precipitation and human activities in mountainous areas fig 2 significant overland flow was produced in sha during the rainfall event on june 27 2022 with a rainfall amount of 67 mm after the rainfall event the flow rate of sha increased in half an hour peaked in six hours and finally receded rapidly n and p concentrations are found to be high values when the overland flow is generated then gradually decrease over time na k and cl concentrations are also high at first and decrease during peak flow but they increase again at the end of the overland flow in contrast ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 concentrations are low at first and then increase steadily fig 2 the underlying hydrological process and response of shb are similar to sha at the beginning of the overland flow the difference is that the flow process of shb is longer due to the recharge from zd which drives the second peak flow however during light rain events the hydrochemical process of shb is similar to sha as observed during the 11 mm shower on june 19 nevertheless during heavier rainstorms as observed on june 23 and 27 with 20 mm and 56 mm respectively the concentrations of all hydrochemical components in shb are higher at the beginning in the overland flow subsequently n and p concentrations decrease sharply and eventually stay at low values similar to the performance in sha in addition the concentrations of other chemical components are lower at the peak flow rate due to dilution fig 2 the values of all ions are extremely low in the rainfall but they increase significantly during the overland flow process from rainfall to sinkholes table 1 meanwhile the pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus accumulated with the overland flow generation contaminate the groundwater system the response processes of the various chemical components are not the same because of the different sources and geological formations which will be discussed in subsequent sections 4 1 2 discharge at qlk spring outlet the hydrological processes of the qlk spring after rainfall events exhibit a pulse like response from the concentrated recharge of sinkholes overall the flow rises fast and recedes slowly the peak discharge flows occur around 5 to 13 h after a storm reaching only single digit cubic meters per second nevertheless the baseflow flow of the qlk spring is usually in the tens of liters per second during the dry periods the spring discharge is mainly composed of groundwater stored in karst fissures the quantity and quality of which are essentially constant the hydrochemistry of qlk spring varies significantly with the rapid flow fluctuation after the rainfall fig 3 due to the recharge by new water with different hydrochemical information from the baseflow after the rainfall events ca2 mg2 sr2 so4 2 and hco3 concentrations of qlk spring decrease rapidly through dilution from new water and then gradually increase as discharge rate declines exhibited by pulse like responses na k and cl concentrations are high at the beginning of the hydrograph response diluted at the peak discharge rate and finally gradually return to pre rainfall levels during small rainfall events as on june 19 and 23 n and p concentrations of qlk spring did not fluctuate significantly despite the flow rate light increase during heavy rainfall events as on june 27 july 1 and 3 n and p concentrations increase at the beginning of the hydrograph response and then gradually decrease exhibiting positive pulse like responses it is worth noting that throughout the monitoring process n and p concentrations of qlk spring did not return to the levels before the rainstorm on june 27 in addition the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 in the qlk spring were observed to be higher than in sinkholes indicating they increase significantly during the underground runoff however the average concentrations of n p and na k cl in the qlk spring are lower than in sinkholes table 1 indicating they are not replenished during the underground runoff or affected by other hydrogeochemical processes ca2 mg2 and hco3 mainly control the characteristics of hydrochemistry in qlk system the variation of which are consistent with the conductivity however after heavy rainfall events the n and p concentrations are significantly higher than their natural baseline values furthermore they are accumulated at the beginning of the responses the indication is that the concentrated recharge input has polluted karst groundwater which is a severe environmental problem 4 1 3 hydrochemical variations under different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity and precipitation directly control the recharge process of sinkholes and indirectly affect the hydrochemical response of karst springs rainfall events lower than the runoff threshold cannot produce the overland flow and change the water quantity and quality of the karst spring because no effective recharge is formed e g 9 mm on june 18 and 6 mm on june 30 the response of discharge flow is slight when the rainfall intensity is small and the response of different components in groundwater presents different characteristics for example the discharge rate of qlk spring increased slightly after the rainfall events on june 19 and 23 the ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations decrease slightly initially and then increase gradually but the tin and po4 3 responses in the qlk spring are not apparent though the peak concentrations in the sinkholes reach 6 46 mg l and 0 47 mg l respectively few pollutants can be brought into the ground when the volume of concentrated recharge is limited the responses of all hydrochemical components of qlk spring are obvious when the rainfall intensity is large enough usually with the hourly rainfall larger than 10 mm in the recharge area at that time the overland flow at the sinkholes is generated efficiently and the discharge flow of the spring increases considerably for example the discharge rate increased significantly on june 27 july 1 and 3 furthermore ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations exhibit corresponding negative impulse responses meanwhile n and p accumulate at both sinkholes and qlk spring indicating that the concentrated recharge carrying the pollutants directly contaminates the karst spring it also shows that heavy rainfall events are essential driving factors for the accumulation of pollutants in sinkholes and karst groundwater however the concentrations of pollutants also decrease affected by dilution when the recharge rate is huge for example n and p concentrations in qlk spring on june 27 were observed to be lower on july 1 and 3 4 2 hydrochemical source identification 4 2 1 chemical weathering the primary lithology of the exposed strata in the study area is pure dolomite and limestone the soil overlain on the karst depression is mainly weathered from the muddy dolomite ions such as ca2 mg2 and hco3 are from karstification and their concentrations represent the degrees of karst weathering process fluvial action over time gradually dissolves the surrounding soil and rocks producing high ca2 mg2 and hco3 concentrations significantly contributing to the hydrogeochemical formations of the aquifer system the formations of sr2 and so4 2 are probably related to the dissolution of celestite strontianite and gypsum in the stratum results of the saturation indices si show that calcite dolomite gypsum celestite and strontianite in the qlk system are unsaturated fig 4 suggesting they have a tendency for continuous dissolution the si of dolomite and calcite are higher than that of other minerals further indicating that the dissolution of carbonate rocks dominates the hydrochemical evolution of the qlk system during this study it was observed that after rainfall events the si of dolomite and calcite in sha continued to rise while the si of celestine strontianite and gypsum exhibited low values during peak flow due to dilution notably the shb is affected more by dilution making the si of all these minerals low during the peak recharge flow period furthermore the catchment area of sha is larger so it is more affected by soil leaching during the overland flow process in addition the si of all these minerals were observed to be higher in the qlk spring than in the sinkholes the si of minerals in qlk decrease only when the effect of dilution on ion concentrations is greater than that of the dissolution under high flowrate conditions in summary the chemical weathering of soil and rock determines the main chemical composition of the sinkholes and spring water in the qlk system mixing a large amount of low concentration water caused by rainfall dilutes the original groundwater and changes the original water in the aquifer from relatively saturated to more unsaturated it not only causes ion concentrations and mineral si to decrease during peak discharge rates but also makes the groundwater continuously dissolve minerals to reach a new water rock equilibrium 4 2 2 agricultural and domestic pollution the possible sources of nitrogen and phosphorus include rainfall human activities and other factors richa et al 2022 the pollution from rainfall can be almost negligible due to the limited content of such elements in the rainfall table 1 accordingly agricultural and domestic activities are the primary source of nitrogen and phosphorus in the study area previous studies have shown that the total inorganic nitrogen tin cl method can effectively screen groundwater contaminants 2 5 mg l and 7 mg l are considered boundary concentrations for tin and cl human contamination respectively panno et al 2006b 2006a in addition tin concentrations higher than 15 mg l indicate significant contamination by human animal waste zhang et al 2014 tin concentrations between 2 5 mg l and 15 mg l are thought to be mainly polluted by nitrogen fertilizer ren et al 2022 in this study cl concentrations in all samples in the qlk system are lower than 7 mg l while tin concentrations are lower than 15 mg l fig 5 however the tin concentrations from various samples are higher than 2 5 mg l suggesting contaminants from agricultural sources especially n fertilizers cl and tin are accumulated in the sinkholes and spring outlet under rainstorm conditions this effect is significant in sinkholes at the beginning of overland flow process the cl concentrations in shb samples are higher than 3 mg l at the beginning and then decrease to 2 mg l at the same time the tin concentrations in shb samples are higher than 4 mg l at the beginning and then decrease to 2 5 mg l the magnitude of variation in cl is minimal even at peak concentration the cl concentrations are lower than 7 mg l as the karst aquifers in the study area are composed of pure carbonate rocks and the cl concentration in rainfall is only 0 59 mg l it can be considered that the accumulation of cl at the beginning of rainstorms is mainly affected by domestic pollution in the catchment area of sha fig 1c 5 is used for domestic activity 10 is occupied by agriculture and the rest is forest for shb less than 1 of the catchment area is used for domestic activity and 18 for agriculture the more densely populated residential areas produce higher cl concentrations in sha than shb after the contaminated water is transported into the aquifer through sinkholes the qlk spring eventually becomes polluted thereby increasing the concentration of tin significantly for example tin concentrations observed at the qlk spring remained above 2 5 mg l after increasing during the rainfall event on june 27 fig 3 in general domestic and agricultural activities in the recharge area have polluted the groundwater environment of qlk spring the agricultural areas in the study area are much larger than residential areas so agricultural pollution is more serious than domestic pollution however with agriculture being the mainstay of the local economy contaminants from this source cannot be ignored some nutrients in fertilizers such as nitrogen and phosphorus are absorbed by plants while the rest enter the soil when the rainfall intensity is large enough nutrients in the soil can be dissolved into the overland flow then pollute the karst aquifer through the concentrated recharge of the sinkholes for karst aquifer systems with larger recharge areas the accumulation effect of this pollution will be more significant and the negative impact will be stronger if the overland flow in karst depressions consolidates non point source agricultural pollution into point source pollution 4 3 hydrochemical migration processes 4 3 1 water rock interactions the migration and conversion processes of solute can be analyzed by comparing the flux changes between the input of the sinkhole and the output of the karst spring the weighted mean values of the solutes in sinkholes and spring during a typical rainfall such as on june 27 were calculated by eqs 4 7 the ratios of qlk pulse increment and input through conduits were also calculated by eqs 8 9 table 2 fig 6 during the rainstorm the response characteristics of different hydrochemical components to the input of sinkholes were observed to be variable the groundwater residence time in the qlk system is too short for isotope exchange as such the output value of deuterium and oxygen isotopes are consistent with the input with the rc within 1 in addition the rc of na k and cl concentrations are within 15 these chemical components are limited in pure carbonate rocks and are mainly derived from external sources so they do not increase significantly when flowing through a typical karst aquifer system the results of the computations show that it is feasible to analyze the hydrochemical migration process of karst groundwater by flux analysis and comparison of the weighted average values the analysis found that the fluxes of ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 for the qlk output increase significantly compared with those from the conduits the rc of ca2 mg2 and hco3 is 20 while the rc of sr2 is up to 271 it is noteworthy that alkaline sr a key soil element is sensitive to hydrological dynamics meanwhile groundwater with a longer residence time and sufficient water rock interaction has a higher sr2 concentration as such it can be better used to reveal the water rock interactions for our study area the sr2 concentration in rainfall was found to be very low at only 0 004 mg l as for observations at sha and shb typical sr2 concentrations after overland flow are 0 065 mg l and 0 054 mg l respectively after leaching in the aquifer the sr2 concentration increases significantly to 0 219 mg l in the qlk spring which is 3 7 times higher sr2 than the input through conduits the variation of sr2 concentration indicates that the influence of water rock interaction on groundwater hydrochemical composition is significant although the response time of water quantity and quality in qlk to rainfall is short fig 3 the influx of new water dilutes the main hydrochemical components of karst groundwater but the total amount of these solutes are essentially increasing overall water rock interaction occurs in the whole process from rainfall to sinkhole to karst spring especially in karst aquifer 4 3 2 conversion of nitrogen nitrogen is an element with multiple valence states which has a variety of forms in aqueous solutions and undergoes redox reactions with environmental changes this study observed that the inorganic nitrogen indicators from the qlk spring significantly exceed their natural baseline values during underground flooding high flow event the peak concentrations of n nh4 n no2 n no3 observed from qlk spring reach 1 01 mg l 0 019 mg l and 4 25 mg l respectively as for the flux n nh4 n no2 and tin concentrations from qlk are lower than the input through conduits however n no3 and tin concentrations are similar to the input table 2 fig 6 it shows that some conversion processes may be occurring between inorganic nitrogen nitrogen in nitrogenous fertilizer mainly exists in n nh4 and partly in n no3 perrin et al 2008 raza et al 2020 at the beginning of the overland flow on june 27 n nh4 was the main form of inorganic nitrogen in sha and shb at 76 and 45 respectively with the continuation of the recharge process the proportion of n nh4 of tin in the sinkholes gradually decreased while n no3 became the main formation accounting for more than 95 on the other hand n no3 was always the main form of inorganic nitrogen in qlk spring accounting for more than 70 fig 7 a in addition the peak concentration of n nh4 was always earlier than other forms of inorganic nitrogen in both sinkholes and qlk spring fig 2 fig 3 indicating that n nh4 enters the karst water cycle before n no3 furthermore the do concentrations of all samples are higher than 2 mg l table 1 which is not conducive to denitrification desimone and howes 1998 trudell et al 1986 all these shreds of evidence indicate the existence of nitrification in qlk system 10 2 n h 4 3 o 2 2 n o 2 2 h 2 o 4 h 11 2 n o 2 o 2 2 n o 3 after spreading nh4 from nitrogenous fertilizers is oxidized in soil by autotrophic bacteria during nitrification resulting in no3 and h ions meanwhile nitric acid can replace carbonic acid in the dissolution of carbonate rock the equation of which will change from eq 12 to eq 13 12 ca 1 x mg x co 3 co 2 h 2 o h c o 3 1 x ca 2 x mg 2 2 h c o 3 13 ca 1 x mg x co 3 hno 3 h c o 3 1 x ca 2 x mg 2 n o 3 in this situation the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in water will change from 0 5 to 1 perrin et al 2008 fig 8 b for qlk system the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in sha shb and qlk are 0 51 0 58 and 0 57 respectively fig 7b the impact of n fertilizer in shb is more significant than sha with the larger agricultural activity area so the effect of nitrification on carbonate rock dissolution in shb is more significant qlk spring receives recharge from both sha and shb at the same time the molar ratio between ca2 mg2 and hco3 in sha is very close to 0 5 but the ratio of qlk is closer to shb deviating from the 1 2 ratio line it shows that nitrification not only occurs on the surface but also impacts karst spring changing the ratio from 0 51 in sha to 0 57 in qlk 4 3 3 storage of pollutants from the foregoing discussion we can deduce that underground flood drives pollutant migration in karst aquifer system from the plot of tin po4 3 vs discharge rate of qlk fig 8a it can be seen that both tin and po4 3 concentrations and the discharge rate of qlk were low before the underground flood therefore during the baseflow tin and po4 3 concentrations can be considered as their natural background value tin is 1 9 mg l po4 3 is 0 1 mg l accordingly during the underground flood tin and po4 3 concentrations increase with the rise of discharge rate manifesting as accumulated discharges of pollutants however tin and po4 3 concentrations are low affected by dilution when the discharge rate of qlk exceeds a certain threshold about 1500l s it is worth mentioning that as the underground floods recede tin and po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring do not return to pre rainfall levels like the discharge flow and other solutes tin and po4 3 concentrations remain relatively high for a long time until they rise again in the next rainfall for example tin and po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring are about 3 5 mg l and 0 3 mg l after the underground flood in rainfall event on june 27 which are 1 75 times and 3 times of its natural background value beyond that po4 3 concentrations in qlk spring have a specific linear positive correlation with tin concentrations c po4 3 0 088c tin 0 059 r2 0 63 fig 8b indicating that they show similar characteristics in the water cycle have not only the same sources but also the same migration path this phenomenon also exists in other karst areas dominated by agricultural activities e g gao et al 2020 when the sinkhole recharge is small for example during the rainfall events on june 19 and 23 n and p were accumulated at the sinkholes but no significant concentration response was observed in qlk spring the small amount of recharge water is insufficient to drive pollutants into the aquifer or a small amount of pollution cannot be reflected in the spring due to dilution but when the recharge rate is large enough n and p in qlk spring show an accumulation process synchronized with the sinkholes the flux calculation results show that the total output flux is smaller than the total input flux although n and p concentrations in qlk spring are higher after rain incredibly about 20 of po4 3 is not released from karst aquifers fig 6 however there is no leaching or other sources of n and p in the aquifer which indicates the storage of pollutants this phenomenon is widespread in solute transport of karst groundwater under heavy rainfall recharge conditions water level in karst conduits rises rapidly resulting in underground flooding the head difference drives water and solutes in the conduits into the fissures connected with the conduits after the rainfall event the hydraulic gradient reverses and the conduits become discharge spaces for the surrounding fissures water carrying solute in fractures is slowly released into conduit at a low velocity during this process some solutes are retained in the fractures and cannot return to the conduits due to the low velocity resulting in the solute input from the sinkholes cannot be discharged through the karst spring in time and when the hydrodynamic condition is stronger the amount of storage is greater and the times taken for the solute concentration in karst spring to return to the background value is longer ji et al 2022 therefore the concentration decay tails of n and p during the rainstorm on june 27 are more remarkable than that on july 1 and 3 after heavy rainfall events some pollutants are stored in the karst aquifer system and delayed release which has negative impacts on the ecological health of the karst aquifer system 4 3 4 conceptual model of solute migration from the analysis carried out above the conceptual model of solute migration from sinkholes to karst spring is summarized in fig 9 the concentrations of all hydrochemical components in sinkholes increase during the overland flow process the leaching of calcium rich alkaline soil makes the water in sinkholes present typical karst water chemical characteristics simultaneously pollutants produced by agricultural and domestic activities are brought into the groundwater once the rainfall is intense enough nutrients accumulated in the sinkholes are flushed into subsurface system through the conduits resulting in the pollution of karst aquifer fig 9a after entering the karst aquifer the water recharged by sinkholes migrates through karst conduits and fractures and finally reaches the karst spring the ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 concentrations in the karst spring show negative impulse responses with the arrival of new water during this process water rock interaction occurs continuously and mineral dissolution causes increasing amounts of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 affected by dilution the peak n and p concentrations in the karst spring are lower than in sinkholes and the hydrochemistry of karst springs shows different response characteristics under different rain intensities the pollutants mainly remain in soil and karst fissures during small rainfall events once the rainfall is heavy enough to create underground flooding e g the hourly rainfall larger than 10 mm pollutants in the soil and fissures are flushed into the sinkholes and karst spring reflecting the accumulation of pollutants at the beginning response of chemograph importantly there is a transformation process from unsaturated zone to saturated zone in the fissures during underground flooding and again becomes unsaturated zone in karst system after the rainfall events which can be called transient saturated zone fig 9c in the process of solute migration in karst conduits and fissures on the one hand the form and proportion of solutes are transformed by geochemical reactions such as nitrification on the other hand the phenomenon of solute storage caused by the storage and re release process between karst conduits and fissures makes part of the solute store in karst aquifers frank et al 2019 ji et al 2022 or the transient saturated zone fig 9b c since ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 always exist in the karst groundwater system and their fluxes continuously rise with the water rock interaction the storage phenomenon is not apparent in the solute formed by dissolution and filtration however this storage phenomenon controls external inputs such as n and p significantly the concentrated recharge from the sinkholes as well as the storage detention and delayed release of pollutants between karst conduits and fissures e g transient saturated zone are problems that cannot be ignored for safe utilization of karst groundwater resources and the prevention control and remediation of karst groundwater pollution which brings significant challenges to the protection of karst groundwater 5 conclusions in this study the sources and migration mechanisms accumulation conversion and storage of contaminates driven by concentrated recharge conditions in a typical karst system were studied and elucidated in addition the hydrological processes defined by the rainfall sinkholes karst spring integrated system were monitored and analyzed to establish a basis for assessing groundwater quantity and quality the results of the assessment and analysis show that the concentrations of all hydrochemical components increase significantly from rainfall to concentrated confluence in the sinkholes nitrogen and phosphorus are accumulated at the beginning of the recharge processes the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 sr2 hco3 and so4 2 in qlk spring are higher than in sinkholes while the average concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in qlk spring are lower than in sinkholes a significant accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred both in sinkholes and qlk spring after heavy rainfall events the chemical characteristics of the water in sinkholes and spring exhibit typical karst water characteristics with leaching components such as ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 the chemical weathering of soil and rock determines the main chemical composition of the sinkholes and spring water in the qlk system mixing with new water increases the potential of water rock reactions in addition the domestic and agricultural activities in the recharge area have polluted the groundwater environment furthermore the tin cl analysis shows that nitrogen pollution mainly comes from n fertilizer nutrients in the soil can pollute the karst aquifer through the concentrated recharge from sinkholes the migration processes of solutes were analyzed by comparing the flux calculation it can be seen that the calculated fluxes of ca2 mg2 sr2 and hco3 in qlk output increase dramatically indicating water rock interaction in the karst aquifer is significant however pollutants including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations decrease because of conversion storage and detention functions in karst aquifer or transient saturated zone nitrification occurs in both surface runoff generation and karst aquifer changing the composition of inorganic nitrogen the head difference drives the groundwater and solutes in the conduit into the fractured medium connected to the conduit during the underground flooding some pollutants are transiently stored in the fissures or the transient saturated zone due to solute storage and detention then released from fissure water to conduit water in the recession periods or the next recharge events it is one of the critical contents in this study to identify the sources of pollutants and analyze the solute migration mechanism along the hydrological process of karst depressions by monitoring the quantity and quality of water from sinkholes to karst spring the results show that the pollution caused by the concentrated recharge to karst aquifer system during the rainstorm cannot be ignored this study can improve our understanding of the solutes and typical pollutants transport mechanism from sinkholes to karst spring under concentrated recharge conditions

2008,karst aquifers a significant source of drinking water worldwide are vulnerable to anthropogenic pollutants because of their special hydrogeological conditions however distinguishing the nitrogen transformation process is difficult owing to the heterogeneity of karst media therefore the process of nitrogen transformation in different karst aquifer media remains poorly understood in this study multiple stable isotopic and physicochemical indicators are combined the sources of water and nitrogen are analysed and the degree of openness and redox conditions of different media are discussed to elucidate the nitrate sources and n transformation in groundwater with different degrees of openness water isotopes indicate local meteoric groundwater origin however different karst aquifer media have different degrees of openness resulting in the highest deuterium oxygen isotope values in surface water followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water based on the evidence from isotope and physicochemical indicators different karst aquifer media have different redox processes isolated cave water environments were under anoxic conditions dominated by sulfate reduction reactions fissure water was under temporary anoxic or sub anoxic conditions dominated by denitrification reactions conduit water and karst surface water were between micro oxygen and oxidising conditions and nitrification was the key process this phenomenon was observed because the diversity of karst media produces different conservation conditions and openness the nitrate isotope and bayesian mixing model indicate that the main sources of nitrate in karst groundwater in the study area are mostly associated with manure and sewage wastes and a few are from soil organic nitrogen atmospheric deposition and chemical fertilizer this study helps identify the migration and transformation patterns and processes of nitrogen in different karst aquifer media providing a scientific basis for the restoration and remediation of contaminated karst groundwater keywords karst groundwater karst heterogeneity nitrogen karst aquifers media oxidation reduction reaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction approximately 20 of earth s ice free land surface is karstic goldscheider et al 2020 hosting karst groundwater systems mainly formed via the dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly limestones and dolomites karst groundwater is a key source of drinking water and human activities for a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 1989 yang et al 2020 but karst groundwater is particularly susceptible to anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrate einsiedl and mayer 2006 katz 2019 although nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth high nitrate concentrations can seriously threaten aquatic ecosystems puckett et al 2008 exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater can lead to pests and diseases in plants and human health problems e g methemoglobinemia and dna damage katz 2019 karst groundwater systems are mainly formed through the natural dissolution of carbonate rocks resulting in non homogeneous flow systems characterised by cavities fissures and grikes making karst groundwater naturally vulnerable ford and williams 2007 on the one hand the karst aquifer has highly developed conduits and fissures with various recharge sources namely point recharge e g ponors and diffuse recharge coxon 2011 which makes it easy for pollutants enter the groundwater system and transported rapidly mccormack et al 2016 runoff in karst areas mainly consists of conduit flow and fissure flow when recharged by external water sources pollutants enter the aquifer with water and spread rapidly along conduits and fissures pronk et al 2006 on the other hand the shallow soil layer in karst areas and the weak adsorption filtration and degradation of pollutants by the soil layer during the infiltration of surface water into the groundwater coxon 2011 result in a limited ability to self purify nitrogen pollutants and a long lasting impact on groundwater wang 1998 therefore the situation of nitrogen pollution in karst groundwater is critical and has exposed the world to serious environmental and health challenges niu et al 2014 the many factors in karst hydrological systems that influence groundwater nitrate pollution can be classified into two main categories land use and hydrogeological characteristics e g degree of surface water and groundwater connectivity soil permeability water recharge flow patterns the reduced nitrate concentrations within karst aquifers may be caused by naturally occurring processes such as denitrification and dilution katz 2019 however triple water rainwater surface water groundwater conversion in karst areas is rapid and accompanied by rapid material transformation yuan et al 1994 karst aquifers are often characterised by high permeability and short residence times vesper and white 2003 therefore many studies have concluded that karst groundwater systems have low denitrification potential musgrove et al 2016 however subsequent studies have confirmed that denitrification reactions might occur in karst groundwater too einsiedl and mayer 2006 panno et al 2001 yang et al 2020 used a dual nitrate isotope technique combined with corresponding water chemistry data to demonstrate that the intensity of nitrification and denitrification in karst groundwater varies under different land use conditions karst subterranean rivers in urban areas are dominated by denitrification and suburban rivers are dominated by nitrification ren et al 2022 provided hydrogeochemical and isotopic evidence that nitrification is the dominant n transformation process in the babu karst aquifer in guizhou china and that denitrification may still occur locally the abundance of nh4 high do in the water and short transport times provide favourable conditions for nitrification in a karst conduit visser et al 2021 investigated groundwater monitoring wells in southwestern germany the connection of monitoring wells to different parts of the fracture and fissure network might favour transitory anoxic or suboxic conditions through thermodynamic and hydrogeological evidence einsiedl and mayer 2006 showed that denitrification might occur in the porous rock of karstic aquifers orr et al 2016 investigations showed that shallow intervals contain hydraulically active fractures where denitrification occurs the findings of this study highlight the influence of bedrock hydrogeological conditions on the mobility of aqueous nitrogen wang et al 2022 collected samples at different depths in a karst borehole during four sampling periods during rainfall events rapid denitrification was observed in karst groundwater systems during rainfall events nitrate in shallow groundwater mainly originates from chemical fertilisers nitrate in deep groundwater originates from the storage of nitrate in the karst matrix yue et al 2020 used high frequency isotope sampling and in situ nitrate sensing to explore nitrate export and transformation in a karst critical zone they confirmed that the spatial storage of nitrate and the extent to which these zones are connected with hydrological flow pathways in the karst influence nitrate loading in emergent waters and that high rainfall events accelerate nitrate export yue et al 2019 used sensor technology to understand nitrate dynamics in this karst system they revealed that the timing of nitrate loss is dependent on the interaction of land use hydrology and karst architecture and that no3 export varies by season in response to source availability and karst aquifer studies on the transport and transformation of nitrogen in karst media have mainly focused on variations over different timescales additionally studies have begun to recognise that there may be differences in the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen in different types of karst media but few studies have focused on this topic yuan 1978 classified the ancient and hard karst media of china into isolated water filled caves conduits and fissures based on the heterogeneity of karst water distribution atkinson 1985 referring to data from china yuan 1982 classified karst aquifers into three types of media pore fissure and conduit aquifers smart and hobbs 1986 further classified karst media into five categories related to groundwater recharge fugacity and runoff four types of karst aquifers i e extremely sensitive very sensitive moderately sensitive and mildly sensitive and non aquifers based on studies of nitrification and denitrification in karst groundwater and the phenomena found during the analysis of various indicators of groundwater we hypothesised that different types of karst i e karst pools conduits fissures isolated caves sensitivities degrees of confinement and the existence of different n transformation processes lead to differences in the reaction processes of nitrogen to prove this hypothesis we selected boreholes from different karst media in the karst plain and analysed the mechanism of the influence of the karst media on nitrogen transformation by using data from long term observations to overcome the limitations of using nitrate isotopes alone we further verified whether different media of karst aquifers affect the transport and transformation of inorganic nitrogen pollutants and explored the patterns and mechanisms involved in this study multiple isotopic methods together with physicochemical indicators environmental parameters e g do eh the siar mixing model redox conditions and the content of reaction products e g nh4 no3 no2 were used to determine the source and transformation of nitrogen in the groundwater therefore the main objectives of this integrated analysis were as follows 1 determine the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in different karst media 2 determine the mechanisms of n species enrichment and transformation in the different karst aquifer media e g conduits fissures and 3 identify the potential sources of no3 in karst water at different levels of development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zengpiyan 110 15 110 18 e and 25 12 25 17 n a typical peak forest plain landscape is at the southwest foot of dushan hill in the south of guilin city south china and has two mountains in the area xiangren hill and dushan hill with an area of approximately 2 000 km2 dushan hill an isolated peak in the peak forest plain the northwest side is a steep cliff approximately 60 70 and the south east side is a gentle slope approximately 20 30 is a typical rock formation sloping gently to the south east and forming a one sided mountain the site is developed in dongcun formation limestone d3d upper devonian guilin formation limestone d3g upper devonian tangjiawan formation dolomite and limestone d2t middle devonian xindu formation sandstone and shale interbedded with iron ore d2x are exposed upstream to the west the peaks are surrounded by the quaternary with cover lithologies containing chalky clay and gravel thickness 0 30 m fig 1 the groundwater of zengpiyan belongs to the lijiang river this water is divided into three main types karst conduit water karst fissure water and pore water from the quaternary according to borehole data the karst aquifer medium in this area is primarily a network of karst fissures and small conduits and flow velocity is slow qin et al 2011 within 25 m below the bedrock surface lapies grikes and caves are commonly developed and distributed in a network with good connectivity and frequent surface water and groundwater exchange wang 2018 the main groundwater runoff zone of the area is divided into an ns oriented karst conduit runoff system and a nw se oriented conduit fissure runoff system wang 2019 wang et al 2019 monitored the annual variation in groundwater level in the study area there was a variation of 6 8 m in the water level of the isolated peak mountain and less than 2 m in the plain area water level monitoring of different types of karst boreholes in the plain area showed that the water level of each borehole responded almost synchronously to rainfall the water level observations by guo et al 2021 in 2018 of two boreholes in retort rock showed that boreholes zk9 and zk21 represent the groundwater in the pipeline concentrated flow zone and matrix fracture zone respectively the groundwater in both boreholes was sensitive to rainfall and the difference among the water level curve water level initiation time and peak time of the two was almost negligible the monitoring data of wang et al 2017 in 2016 in the retort rock showed that the water level response curve waveforms of surface pool p3 isolated caves zk10 and karst fissures zk15 in the study area were essentially the same for different seasons of rainfall indicating that the water levels of different media are closely linked in this study area the source of groundwater in the study area is complex and influenced by various factors and the types of pollutants and pollution pathways are diverse regarding water recharge in addition to the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation in the vertical direction it also receives groundwater confluence from peak cluster depressions in the west resulting in abundant groundwater resources groundwater drainage is influenced by the lijiang river and its tributary valleys the recharge areas of groundwater in zengpiyan are mainly towns and woodlands with a relatively small area of agricultural land in the early days of guilin s industrial development high pollution industries such as nitrogen fertiliser plants chemical plants and brick factories were located close to the study area the pollution situation has improved as a result of the relocation of enterprises in the later stages of urban planning but the degradation of pollutants remains a lengthy process there are schools hospitals commercial areas and residential communities around the area and the domestic sewage discharged during their daily operations also affects groundwater quality 2 2 sampling sites zengpiyan was used as the study area fourteen sampling points were set up considering the differences in groundwater flow direction and aquifer media in the study area the distribution of some sampling points is shown in fig 1 the sampling depth was 10 m below the surface we continuously monitored the water level of the karst pools st to reflect the water level changes at each sampling point in the study area fig 2 groundwater samples were collected monthly from april to december 2019 nitrate isotope samples were collected once in april 2019 including one sample zk10 from an isolated karst cave with poor hydraulic connectivity eight samples from fissure boreholes four samples from conduit boreholes and one sample from a surface karst pool borehole y8 at the foot of xiangren hill was upstream of the ground hydrogeological unit boreholes zk6 zk7 zk8 zk9 zk10 zk11 zk20 y4 zk15 zk21 and zk22 were in the groundwater runoff zone the karst pool st was located downstream of the zengpiyan hydrogeological unit based on the literature and drilling data the sampling points were classified into four types according to openness sample zk10 from an isolated cave with poor hydraulic connectivity which can be regarded as a closed system zk7 zk8 zk15 zk20 zk21 zk22 y4 and y8 which are karst fissure media zk6 zk9 zk11 and sd a karst cave with water which are karst conduit media fig s1 and the st is a surface karst pool which is an open system 2 3 water quality and isotope analysis t water

sources of no3 to groundwater no3 in the study area torres martínez et al 2021 the mixed model calculations were implemented using the siar stable isotope analysis in r software package and were

characteristics the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are summarised in table s1 few differences in groundwater temperature were observed among different degrees of karst development the mean values of water temperature for isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 21 0 c 21 8 c 21 5 c and 22 6 c respectively the four types of groundwater temperature trends are similar with a general trend from rising to declining peaking in august which is in line with the air temperature fig 3 d the difference is that isolated cave water zk10 and fissure water show that the change is relatively smooth whereas surface water exposed to air changes significantly the mean values of do in isolated cave water zk10 karst fissure water karst conduit water and surface water were 2 1 mg l 1 89 mg l 3 37 mg l and 6 43 mg l respectively the do concentrations were the highest in surface water the difference between zk10 and fissure water do was small and conduit water was approximately 1 76 times higher than that of fissure water subject to seasonal changes do in the four different types of water showed different patterns of variation but generally showed an increasing tendency the do concentrations were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer fig 3 a the concentration of doc in different types of groundwater changed slightly with mean values of 0 48 mg l for isolated cave water zk10 0 55 mg l for fissure water 0 54 mg l for conduit water and 0 42 mg l for surface water fissure water conduit water and surface water have the same tendency first increasing and then decreasing minimum in july fig 3 b the doc data for september differed significantly from that of the other months because of the operating instrument error of the measurement personnel and were not counted the mean values of eh in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 29 2 mv 310 1 mv 371 4 mv and 381 5 mv respectively they varied similarly with a gradual decrease throughout the sampling period fig 3 b the oxidation reduction potentials of isolated cave water zk10 were chronically low but they were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer which differs from other medium this phenomenon is observed because zk10 is an isolated water filled cave which is poorly hydraulically connected to the surrounding water and only hydraulically or air linked to the conduits under certain water level conditions the reasons for this difference include the conditions of the aqueous medium microorganisms the content of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen su et al 2016 table s1 the ec of four types of water showed a decreasing trend with high values in spring and summer and low values in autumn and winter the samples in isolated cave water zk10 were the lowest mean 393 63 μs cm and fissure water and conduit water were similar mean 526 76 μs cm and 523 44 μs cm but the coefficient of variation in fissure water was approximately twice that in conduit water the mean value for surface water was 510 0 μs cm the difference between the isolated cave water zk10 and the other three media karst water is significant which is related to former s poor hydraulic connectivity 3 2 hydro geo chemistry the total hardness values of the samples were as follows isolated cave water zk10 7 95 74 58 mg l mean 45 78 mg l fissure water 9 9 145 89 mg l mean 69 37 mg l conduit water 14 37 154 87 mg l mean 74 67 mg l and surface water 23 48 105 51 mg l mean 70 62 mg l table s1 the minimum mean was isolated cave water zk10 and the maximum mean was conduit water the major ion concentrations from the four types of groundwater were plotted on a piper diagram fig 4 a and the samples are grouped in the bottom left corner of the image the determination of anion and cation concentrations in the karst water showed that the water contained large amounts of hco3 ca2 so4 2 and mg2 among them hco3 ca2 and mg2 mainly originate from the aquifers of the dongcun formation limestone guilin formation limestone and tangjiawan formation dolomite and limestone these three ions are strongly associated with karst processes and their high concentrations indicate that groundwater is mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate and rock weathering eqs 2 and 3 table 1 so4 2 is mainly derived from pyrite in the layer of the upper reaches near zengpiyan and sulfite in fly ash and bottom slag is left over from the brickyard wang 2018 which is oxidised to sulfate through rainfall and rock weathering eq 4 table 1 vear and curtis 1981 in addition nitrate may displace oxygen as an electron acceptor during the oxidation of pyrite because of the high nitrate content in groundwater eq 5 table 1 engesgaard and kipp 1992 and eventual so4 2 transport to the surrounding aquifers via groundwater exchange on the surface conduit and fissure waters the cations are dominated by ca2 and the anions are dominated by hco3 and so4 2 isolated cave water zk10 is dominated by ca2 and mg2 cations and hco3 and cl anions table s1 according to the shukarev classification the groundwater samples are dominated by the hco3 ca type fig 4 a however in different types of water there is a certain rule regarding the concentrations of the major anions and cations fig 4 b hco3 concentration fissure water isolated cave water zk10 conduit water surface water so4 2 concentration surface water conduit water fissure water isolated cave water zk10 ca2 concentration as conduit water surface water fissure water isolated cave water zk10 and mg2 concentration isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water surface water 3 3 isotopic compositions the average of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o in isolated cave water zk10 was 34 49 0 53 and 5 63 0 02 n 9 29 01 0 8 and 5 02 0 09 n 67 for fissure water 27 56 0 95 and 4 84 0 99 n 35 for conduit water and 26 83 1 95 and 4 7 0 21 n 9 for surface water regarding mean values the groundwater in zk10 was the lowest and the surface water was the highest fig 6 a which showed the same trend as the degree of aquifer confinement the mean values of nitrate nitrogen isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in isolated cave water zk10 were 11 94 and 6 65 11 97 5 24 and 8 2 3 06 n 8 for fissure water 13 7 0 2 and 7 19 0 99 n 4 for conduit water and 13 53 and 9 72 for surface water 3 4 spatial and temporal variability of n species analysis of the three nitrogen concentrations in groundwater showed that the highest concentration of no3 was found in karst groundwater followed by nh4 and the lowest concentration of no2 table s1 this phenomenon is observed because the n in no2 is 3 valent and has oxidising and reducing properties thus its content is much lower than that of the other two forms of nitrogen by contrast nh4 being positively charged is easily adsorbed by soil particles before entering groundwater therefore nitrate is more likely to enter groundwater than ammonia causing pollution and become the main pollutant in groundwater ammonium nitrogen nitrate and nitrite nitrogen were detected in all the boreholes although their concentrations did not exceed the class iii groundwater quality standard gaqs and iqprc 2017 their concentrations were much higher than those for uninfluenced groundwater from the perspective of the special hydrogeological conditions of the karst area and the nitrogen cycle the pollution risk is high the spatiotemporal variations in the three nitrogen concentrations are shown in fig 5 there are similarities and differences in the concentrations of the three types of nitrogen in water from different boreholes with the largest difference occurring in the nh4 concentration the mean values of nh4 in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 3 16 μm 27 05 μm 2 51 μm and 2 95 μm respectively where the nh4 concentrations in isolated cave water and surface water are stable a highly variable was observed in fissure water suggesting poor hydraulic connectivity in the fissure table s1 fig 5 a throughout the sampling period the nh4 concentrations in groundwater were much lower in summer than in other seasons presumably nh4 was diluted by rainfall and increased water temperature can promote the use of nh4 by microorganisms the degree of aquifer confinement can also affect nitrate concentration in groundwater katz 2019 nitrate concentrations in boreholes mostly showed an increase with increasing connectivity of the karst aquifer media which is consistent with observations in the literature the mean values of no3 concentrations in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 22 52 μm 46 09 μm 81 37 μm and 87 04 μm respectively temporally nitrate concentrations in conduit water and surface water showed a decreasing trend and fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 showed a fluctuating increase in nitrate content which was close to the change in do content fig 3 a and fig 5 b differences in nitrite concentrations were not obvious the mean values of no2 concentrations in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 0 06 μm 0 13 μm 0 14 μm and 0 15 μm respectively nitrite concentrations varied smoothly throughout the sampling period with the lowest nitrite concentrations occurring in the isolated cave water zk10 the data for y8 is anomalous so its date was not counted here 4 discussion 4 1 openness of different karst media based on water isotopes δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o are stable isotopes naturally present in water molecules and have different values based on the different groundwater environments therefore δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o isotopes can be used to identify the source of water and hydrogeological processes in our study the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl zhang et al 2015 were used to identify the sources of water and hydrogeological processes groundwater samples were distributed close to the gmwl and lmwl fig 6 b indicating a local meteoric origin of the groundwater the slope of the regression line for surface water was closest to that of the lmwl but the intercept was lower than that of the lmwl fig 6 b the result reflects the frequent exchange between surface water and the atmospheric and the loss of δ18o h2o is greater than that of δ2h h2o during evaporation hu et al 2019 the slope and intercept of the isolated cave water zk10 were the smallest and δ18o h2o moved mainly on the δ2h h2o axis with an upwards and downwards drift of 2h this phenomenon is observed because of the exchange of isotopes in the h2s h2o system in a reducing environment and the exchange of hydrogen isotopes in various hydrogenous materials which led to vertical variation in δ2h h2o gui and chen 2007 clark and fritz 2013 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o isotopes of water are affected by various factors such as the water vapour source the evaporation effect chemical reaction and mixing the evaporation of groundwater and chemical reactions were affected by the openness karst medium the average values of the four types of karst water isotopes in this study show a clear pattern the mean value of δ18o h2o was highest in surface water followed by conduit water and fissure water fig 6 a therefore the evaporation and chemical reactions of surface water are the most intense followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water to further validate the aforementioned law by deducting the effect of water vapour sources with different rainfall levels during the year we used the d excess d δ2h h2o 8 δ18o h2o value the higher the degree of water rock interaction in the same area and aquifer the more 18o can be released from the rock into the water which can increase the value of δ18o and decrease the value of d excess in the groundwater yin et al 2001 diao et al 2014 the d excess in the rainy season increased in d excess value from zk10 to the surface water fig 6 c this phenomenon occurred due to the evaporation of groundwater during the hot rainy season the evaporation intensity increased from zk10 to the surface water indicating that the degree of openness of the four types of karst water was in the order of surface water conduit water fissure water zk10 regarding the d excess in the dry season of groundwater from fissure water to surface water it has a decreasing trend during the dry season the temperatures are low evaporation is weak and karst groundwater flows slowly and is almost laminar the strength of its water rock action is consistent with the diffuse boundary layer theory the d excess value is affected by water rock interaction the slower the flow velocity is the thicker the diffusion boundary layer is and the more the dissolution flux is resulting in weak water rock interaction liu and dreybrodt 1998 the fissure water flows more slowly than conduit water resulting in weak water rock interaction and a large d excess value in fissure water surface water conduit water and fissure water have increasingly weaker water rock action weaker water flow rates and less openness in that order therefore the rainy and dry seasons indicate that the four types of karst media have different degrees of openness in the order of surface water conduit water fissure water zk10 4 2 redox conditions of different karst media based on physicochemical indicators the oxidation reduction reaction has a significant influence on the water chemical environment and plays a key role in the presence and transport of various organic and inorganic substances in water the sequence of oxidation reduction reactions depends on the chemical composition microbial activity and standard electrode potential borch et al 2010 in karst areas due to differences in the degree of karst development the oxygen content ion concentration and microbial species vary by the aquifer which leads to differences in the oxidation reduction status therefore the determination of oxidation reduction conditions provides a preliminary indication of biogeochemical stages in groundwater at different levels of karst development descriptions of different redox environments have been identified using various parameters such as the redox potential eh indicators of the high sensitivity index o2 no3 fe2 and so4 2 and the content of reduction products e g nh4 hs fe2 and ch4 appelo et al 2004 under the action of microorganisms groundwater undergoes the dissolved oxygen reduction stage no3 reduction stage partial oxidising environment fe iii reduction stage reducing environment so4 2 reduction stage strong reducing environment and co2 reduction stage in sequence reducing environment fig 7 a chapelle and lovley 1992 the optimum environment for the denitrification reaction occurs when eh is less than 231 mv and do is less than 2 mg l fig 7 b in addition the low value of eh indicates a strong reducing environment and the frequency of biological denitrification will increase rivett et al 2008 so4 2 reduction was strongest at eh values between 200 and 100 mv neculita et al 2007 we compared the redox potentials of the water samples collected in each borehole and no clear demarcation boundaries for the oxidation reduction stages of the four types of groundwater were observed there was a large temporal variation in eh with large differences and crossovers in eh among the four types of groundwater fig 7 a multiple redox processes may coexist in the same environment with different dominant roles under the control of different environmental factors the redox potentials of the water samples collected in isolated cave water zk10 are low for a long time from 134 3 to 111 2 mv mean 29 15 mv the h2s concentration at zk10 was higher than that in the other boreholes wang 2018 combined with the standard potentials of the redox electron pairs in the environment and the low concentrations of no3 and so4 2 which suggests that the isolated cave water zk10 may have passed through the nitrate reduction process and was dominated by sulfate reduction eq 6 table 2 fig 7 a in addition the data show that the ca2 concentration in the isolated cave water zk10 is lower than that in other boreholes suggesting that so3 2 was indirectly produced by the so4 2 reduction process in the groundwater and the excess so3 2 combined with ca2 to produce caso3 precipitation eq 7 table 2 wang 2019 therefore we suggest that long term exposure to the reducing environment was one of the reasons for the low ca2 concentration in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water samples had eh values from 46 3 to 484 5 mv mean 310 1 mv and according to the standard electrode potential the environment of fissure water was between suboxic and anoxic fig 7 a and more than 62 of the samples had do values less than 2 mg l fig 7 b combined with the high nh4 concentration and low no3 concentration in fissure water eqs 8a 8b and 9 table 2 we suggest that most of the fissure water was in the no3 reduction stage conduit water samples had eh values from 169 2 to 522 6 mv mean 371 4 mv and 294 3 to 489 1 mv mean 381 5 mv for surface water and the environment of both types of groundwater was between oxic and suboxic more than 73 of the samples in the conduit water had do values higher than 2 mg l and all the samples in the surface water had do values higher than 2 mg l fig 7 b furthermore the low concentrations of nh4 no3 and so4 2 and the high levels of do in conduit water and surface water also indicate that these two types of groundwater are mostly in the dissolved oxygen reduction stage 4 3 nitrogen transformation of different karst media nitrate migration in groundwater is influenced by microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall et al 2007 in identifying the state of their migration and transformation relying on a single indicator is difficult thus this study coupled several indicators to determine the method of identification 4 3 1 hydrochemical identification cl is stable in water not susceptible to physical chemical and microbial influences and its concentration generally only changes when mixing water with different cl concentrations lu et al 2015 thus cl is a good tracer for indicating the source of water pollution studies have shown that the relationship between cl and no3 ec and no3 can initially determine whether changes in no3 concentrations in water are from mixing processes without n form conversion or from denitrification if the increase in nitrate concentration is accompanied by an increase in cl concentration and ec the no3 concentration in the water is likely to be influenced by the mixing process of the n form transformation and denitrification is the dominant nitrogen transformation process altman and parizek 1995 itoh et al 2011 as shown no3 and cl were negatively correlated with fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 and positively correlated with conduit water and surface water with a significant positive correlation between the no3 and cl concentrations in conduit water p less than 0 05 fig 8 a the no3 concentration of isolated cave water zk10 was negatively correlated with ec and fissure water conduit water and surface water were positively correlated with ec however the correlation was nonsignificant in fissure water and the no3 concentrations of conduit water and surface water were significantly positively correlated with ec p less than 0 01 fig 8 b the no3 concentration in conduit water and surface water was positively correlated with the cl concentration and ec this finding suggests that the mixing process without n form conversion in surface water and conduit water is one of the likely causes of the no3 concentration however the linear relationship between no3 and cl concentrations in the conduit and surface water was nonsignificant which may be due to karst heterogeneity in the vertical direction yuan et al 2016 and parts of the borehole were in a suboxic or anoxic state producing local denitrification we observed a poor linear relationship between no3 and cl and no3 and ec in the fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 combined with the low dissolved oxygen low no3 and high nh4 concentrations in fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 eqs 8a 8b and 9 table 2 we conclude that denitrification is the key process in fissure and isolated cave waters 4 3 2 nitrate and water isotopic indicators δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 indicate nitrate sources and are powerful tools for identifying nitrate transformation processes theoretically two thirds of the nitrate is produced by ambient water and one third by atmospheric oxygen 23 5 andersson and hooper 1983 kendall 1998 thus δ18o no3 values can be used to indicate whether nitrification occurs the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in no3 are not only dependent on their source but are also influenced by many biological processes andersson and hooper 1983 isotopic fractionation occurs when nitrogen fixation assimilation nitrification denitrification and ammonia volatilisation occur but among these factors nitrification and denitrification have the greatest impact on nitrogen identification li et al 2002 chen et al 2007 in nitrification nitrifying bacteria first use lighter 14n resulting in an enrichment of δ15n in the subsequently produced nitrate in denitrification microorganisms usually change the lighter 14n in nitrate to n2o and n2 under suitable conditions resulting in an increase in the abundance of 15n in the remaining nitrate leading to an increase in δ15n values sebilo et al 2003 kaushal et al 2011 therefore the relationship among the δ18o no3 values do and δ15n no3 can be used to jointly determine the process of nitrogen transformation the δ18o no3 values of 60 of the water samples fell within the range of typical δ18o no3 values produced by nitrification 10 to 10 kendall 1998 with a few fissures out of range the δ18o no3 values for the surface and conduit water were close to the theoretical values fig 9 a suggesting that nitrification was the key process in the source of no3 in the surface and conduit water some of the fissure water falls within the typical δ18o no3 values for nitrification but is far from the theoretical line suggesting that nitrification is not the key process in fissure water the δ18o no3 values of groundwater at five fissure waters were greater than 10 with three boreholes zk7 zk15 and zk20 having δ18o no3 values much higher than 10 which may be due to denitrification leading to isotopic fractionation a low oxygen environment promotes denitrification resulting in large δ15n no3 values in the groundwater negative correlation an oxygen rich environment promotes nitrification resulting in the accumulation of δ15n no3 in the groundwater positive correlation therefore theoretically the lower the dissolved oxygen content the higher the δ15n no3 values which are dominated by denitrification in groundwater dominated by nitrification the higher the do content the higher the δ15n no3 value analysis of the data revealed an inverse trend of do and δ15n no3 in the fissures and the same trend of do and δ15n no3 occurred in the conduit water fig 9 b these results indicate that denitrification is the key process in fissure water and that nitrification is the key process in conduit water 4 3 3 hydrochemical and nitrate isotope indicators nitrate transport in groundwater is influenced by microbial action and a series of biogeochemical processes occur resulting in changes in no3 15n no3 and δ18o no3 due to isotopic fractionation kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 therefore the transformation process of nitrate can be identified based on the changes in no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 specifically when nitrification occurs no3 concentration increases cl is conserved the no3 cl molar ratio should be high and the nitrification reaction also depletes δ15n in nh4 resulting in a decrease in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values xue et al 2009 by contrast during denitrification when the no3 concentration decreases and the no3 cl molar ratio is low the kinetic isotope effect during denitrification preferentially converts lighter 14n and 16o into n2 and n2o resulting in positive values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the remaining nitrate aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 the values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the isolated cave water zk10 were high with a clear trend of enrichment which correlated with the decrease in no3 concentration the no3 cl values from several samples were also low fig 10 a and b indicating that denitrification is the key process in isolated cave water in fissure water no3 concentrations were moderate δ18o no3 values were high δ15n no3 values were low and no3 cl values were low on average but there remained water samples with high no3 cl values thus denitrification and nitrification were simultaneously present and denitrification was predominant conduit and surface water no3 concentrations were high with moderate δ18o no3 δ15n no3 and no3 cl values thus nitrification was the key process and local denitrification was present as shown in fig 5 there are differences in trinitrogen concentrations in different karst media based on the above analysis it is speculated that the reason why the annual average value of ammonia nitrogen in the fissure water is the highest is that the fissure water is in micro oxidation condition the nitrification is week and denitrification is the key process leading to the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen the low concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in conduit and surface water are due to the utilization of ammonia nitrogen in the nitrification reaction for nitrate its concentration is highest in surface and conduit water followed by fissure water and zk10 we suggest that the surface and conduit water are more open and mostly in an oxidizing environment the nitrification reaction is strong and denitrification is weak in the groundwater which leads to the accumulation of nitrate while the denitrification reactions are the key process in fissure water and most of the nitrate being utilised zk10 has passed the denitrification stage resulting in the lowest nitrate concentrations nitrite is the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification reactions in this study there was little variation in concentration among difference karst media with only low concentrations in zk10 it is assumed that the groundwater in zk10 has already passed through the nitrification and denitrification stages and there is little accumulation of nitrite various conceptual models describing the transport of nitrogen pollutants in karst aquifers have been proposed bakalowicz 2005 hartmann et al 2014 a conceptual model of nitrogen transformation in the four types of karst water is presented in fig 11 the four types are isolated cave early forms of karst development karst fissure and karst conduit and surface pool connected to karst conduit boreholes with isolated karst caves have a different transformation process than other boreholes because the former has poor hydraulic connectivity the possible sulfur and nitrogen transformation processes in zk10 are shown in fig 11 combined with the low dissolved oxygen redox potential so4 2 no3 and high h2s concentrations in the groundwater it is suggested that sulfate reduction reaction is strong and in the sulfate reduction stage dark blue arrow while the nitrification and denitrification reactions have passed and the nitrogen conversion reaction is weak light blue arrow medium a fig 11 owing to their rich hydraulic connectivity and good openness in surface and conduit water they have high dissolved oxygen and redox potentials the possible nitrogen transformation processes in surface and conduit water are given in fig 11 considering the low concentrations of reactants nh4 and high concentrations of product no3 in the nitrification reactions with the water chemistry and isotopic evidence we conclude that in surface and conduit water denitrifying bacteria have low respiration rates denitrification is weak light blue arrow and nitrification is the main process of nitrogen conversion dark blue arrow media c and d fig 11 fig 11 illustrates the possible nitrogen transformation processes in fissure water the fissure water environment was in a micro oxidative condition based on the high concentration of nh4 as a reactant in the nitrification reaction and the low concentration of no3 as a reactant in the denitrification reaction as well as the water chemistry and isotopic evidence we assumed that nitrification was weak in the fissure water light blue arrow and that denitrification dominated the nitrogen transformation process dark blue arrow medium b fig 11 4 4 identification of no3 sources determining the sources of pollutants is an essential part of pollution control however sources of groundwater nitrogen pollution are complex and diverse nitrogen enters the groundwater system mainly through the mineralisation of organic nitrogen from ad dead plant residues in the soil organic nitrogen fertilisers and domestic sewage from the surrounding population and inorganic nitrogen is produced and enters the groundwater system as water methods have been developed to investigate sources of nitrogen pollutants in groundwater and stable isotopes of nitrate tracing of nitrate sources have been widely used the range of variation in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from son domestic wastewater fertiliser and atmospheric precipitation varies widely therefore the use of dual isotope tracing of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate can better distinguish among these sources kendall 1998 the results show that 73 of the sample sites fall in the m s source windows fig 12 b with a small proportion from cf and son the stable isotopes of nitrate can initially determine the source of nitrate but other processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation can lead to interference caused by isotope fractionation minet et al 2017 ren et al 2022 the siar model can also consider the isotope fractionation effects parnell et al 2010 this model has been widely used to calculate the contribution ratios of nitrate pollution sources in various water sources such as groundwater rivers and lakes puig et al 2017 el gaouzi et al 2013 yang et al 2013 the rate of contribution of each no3 source calculated by the siar model fig 12 a denitrification fractionation values are based on previous studies of nitrate isotope tracing in this basin zhao et al 2020 showed that the average contribution of m s to no3 was the largest but there were differences among boreholes the contributions of the four potential no3 sources in the isolated cave water zk10 were 42 4 25 6 19 2 and 12 9 for m s son cf and ad respectively notably there were differences among the different fissure boreholes with cf contributing the most to no3 at zk7 zk22 and y4 exceeding 35 and m s contributing the most to no3 on average in the remaining fissure boreholes there was small variation in the contributions of the four potential no3 sources among the conduit boreholes with m s contributing the most to no3 at 39 8 followed by son mean 26 cf mean 20 6 and ad mean 13 7 the contributions of the four potential no3 sources to surface water were 40 8 24 6 19 5 and 15 1 for m s son cf and ad respectively the contribution of each no3 source in zk10 y8 zk8 zk6 zk9 zk11 sd and st were relatively close and presumably in the same direction as the subsurface runoff with strong connectivity which validates the hydrogeological findings fig 1 5 conclusion evidence from water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and hydrogeochemistry suggests that nitrate migration and transformation are closely linked to the degree of karst media development water isotopes indicated that regional groundwater originated mainly from local precipitation without significant evaporation however the degree of karst media development results in different flow velocities which indirectly affects the water rock interaction the mean values of the deuterium oxygen isotope were highest for surface water followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 the main sources of nitrate in groundwater from different karst media were mostly m s with an average contribution of 32 9 followed by son cf and ad 25 4 24 6 and 17 respectively hydrogeochemical and environmental parameters and isotopic evidence suggest that the transformation process of nitrogen in the conduit and surface water is dominated by nitrification with possible local denitrification and the transformation process of nitrogen in fissure water is dominated by denitrification with possible local nitrification and sulfate reduction in isolated cave water these changes are likely attributed to 1 the karst aquifer system containing different media such as conduits fissures isolated caves and other karst forms which show strong inhomogeneity 2 the karst groundwater shows different hydrodynamic conditions during transport which are controlled by the existing karst forms the time of the conduit water circulation cycle is short and the renewal capacity is strong whereas in karst fissures it is slow and the permeability is relatively weak which affects the dissolved oxygen content of groundwater and the reaction and transport of solutes 3 controlled by the existing karst morphology karst groundwater has different degrees of confinement which results in significant differences in the hydrochemical environments of different karst media fissure and isolated cave water environments are prone to temporary anoxic or sub anoxic conditions isolated cave groundwater is a long term reducing environment karst fissure water is between reducing and micro oxygen environments and karst conduit water and karst pool water are between micro oxygen and oxidising environments this study shows that based on the basic characteristics of karst aquifer media heterogeneity the study of karst groundwater chemistry such as elemental transformation processes transformation rates microbial influence mechanisms on transformation simulation of transformation processes and even the treatment of karst groundwater pollutants requires attention to the differences in karst media credit authorship contribution statement jing bao conceptualization methodology writing original draft investigation visualization xisong wu investigation

2008,karst aquifers a significant source of drinking water worldwide are vulnerable to anthropogenic pollutants because of their special hydrogeological conditions however distinguishing the nitrogen transformation process is difficult owing to the heterogeneity of karst media therefore the process of nitrogen transformation in different karst aquifer media remains poorly understood in this study multiple stable isotopic and physicochemical indicators are combined the sources of water and nitrogen are analysed and the degree of openness and redox conditions of different media are discussed to elucidate the nitrate sources and n transformation in groundwater with different degrees of openness water isotopes indicate local meteoric groundwater origin however different karst aquifer media have different degrees of openness resulting in the highest deuterium oxygen isotope values in surface water followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water based on the evidence from isotope and physicochemical indicators different karst aquifer media have different redox processes isolated cave water environments were under anoxic conditions dominated by sulfate reduction reactions fissure water was under temporary anoxic or sub anoxic conditions dominated by denitrification reactions conduit water and karst surface water were between micro oxygen and oxidising conditions and nitrification was the key process this phenomenon was observed because the diversity of karst media produces different conservation conditions and openness the nitrate isotope and bayesian mixing model indicate that the main sources of nitrate in karst groundwater in the study area are mostly associated with manure and sewage wastes and a few are from soil organic nitrogen atmospheric deposition and chemical fertilizer this study helps identify the migration and transformation patterns and processes of nitrogen in different karst aquifer media providing a scientific basis for the restoration and remediation of contaminated karst groundwater keywords karst groundwater karst heterogeneity nitrogen karst aquifers media oxidation reduction reaction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction approximately 20 of earth s ice free land surface is karstic goldscheider et al 2020 hosting karst groundwater systems mainly formed via the dissolution of carbonate rocks mainly limestones and dolomites karst groundwater is a key source of drinking water and human activities for a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 1989 yang et al 2020 but karst groundwater is particularly susceptible to anthropogenic pollutants such as nitrate einsiedl and mayer 2006 katz 2019 although nitrogen is an essential nutrient for plant growth high nitrate concentrations can seriously threaten aquatic ecosystems puckett et al 2008 exposure to nitrate contaminated groundwater can lead to pests and diseases in plants and human health problems e g methemoglobinemia and dna damage katz 2019 karst groundwater systems are mainly formed through the natural dissolution of carbonate rocks resulting in non homogeneous flow systems characterised by cavities fissures and grikes making karst groundwater naturally vulnerable ford and williams 2007 on the one hand the karst aquifer has highly developed conduits and fissures with various recharge sources namely point recharge e g ponors and diffuse recharge coxon 2011 which makes it easy for pollutants enter the groundwater system and transported rapidly mccormack et al 2016 runoff in karst areas mainly consists of conduit flow and fissure flow when recharged by external water sources pollutants enter the aquifer with water and spread rapidly along conduits and fissures pronk et al 2006 on the other hand the shallow soil layer in karst areas and the weak adsorption filtration and degradation of pollutants by the soil layer during the infiltration of surface water into the groundwater coxon 2011 result in a limited ability to self purify nitrogen pollutants and a long lasting impact on groundwater wang 1998 therefore the situation of nitrogen pollution in karst groundwater is critical and has exposed the world to serious environmental and health challenges niu et al 2014 the many factors in karst hydrological systems that influence groundwater nitrate pollution can be classified into two main categories land use and hydrogeological characteristics e g degree of surface water and groundwater connectivity soil permeability water recharge flow patterns the reduced nitrate concentrations within karst aquifers may be caused by naturally occurring processes such as denitrification and dilution katz 2019 however triple water rainwater surface water groundwater conversion in karst areas is rapid and accompanied by rapid material transformation yuan et al 1994 karst aquifers are often characterised by high permeability and short residence times vesper and white 2003 therefore many studies have concluded that karst groundwater systems have low denitrification potential musgrove et al 2016 however subsequent studies have confirmed that denitrification reactions might occur in karst groundwater too einsiedl and mayer 2006 panno et al 2001 yang et al 2020 used a dual nitrate isotope technique combined with corresponding water chemistry data to demonstrate that the intensity of nitrification and denitrification in karst groundwater varies under different land use conditions karst subterranean rivers in urban areas are dominated by denitrification and suburban rivers are dominated by nitrification ren et al 2022 provided hydrogeochemical and isotopic evidence that nitrification is the dominant n transformation process in the babu karst aquifer in guizhou china and that denitrification may still occur locally the abundance of nh4 high do in the water and short transport times provide favourable conditions for nitrification in a karst conduit visser et al 2021 investigated groundwater monitoring wells in southwestern germany the connection of monitoring wells to different parts of the fracture and fissure network might favour transitory anoxic or suboxic conditions through thermodynamic and hydrogeological evidence einsiedl and mayer 2006 showed that denitrification might occur in the porous rock of karstic aquifers orr et al 2016 investigations showed that shallow intervals contain hydraulically active fractures where denitrification occurs the findings of this study highlight the influence of bedrock hydrogeological conditions on the mobility of aqueous nitrogen wang et al 2022 collected samples at different depths in a karst borehole during four sampling periods during rainfall events rapid denitrification was observed in karst groundwater systems during rainfall events nitrate in shallow groundwater mainly originates from chemical fertilisers nitrate in deep groundwater originates from the storage of nitrate in the karst matrix yue et al 2020 used high frequency isotope sampling and in situ nitrate sensing to explore nitrate export and transformation in a karst critical zone they confirmed that the spatial storage of nitrate and the extent to which these zones are connected with hydrological flow pathways in the karst influence nitrate loading in emergent waters and that high rainfall events accelerate nitrate export yue et al 2019 used sensor technology to understand nitrate dynamics in this karst system they revealed that the timing of nitrate loss is dependent on the interaction of land use hydrology and karst architecture and that no3 export varies by season in response to source availability and karst aquifer studies on the transport and transformation of nitrogen in karst media have mainly focused on variations over different timescales additionally studies have begun to recognise that there may be differences in the transport and transformation processes of nitrogen in different types of karst media but few studies have focused on this topic yuan 1978 classified the ancient and hard karst media of china into isolated water filled caves conduits and fissures based on the heterogeneity of karst water distribution atkinson 1985 referring to data from china yuan 1982 classified karst aquifers into three types of media pore fissure and conduit aquifers smart and hobbs 1986 further classified karst media into five categories related to groundwater recharge fugacity and runoff four types of karst aquifers i e extremely sensitive very sensitive moderately sensitive and mildly sensitive and non aquifers based on studies of nitrification and denitrification in karst groundwater and the phenomena found during the analysis of various indicators of groundwater we hypothesised that different types of karst i e karst pools conduits fissures isolated caves sensitivities degrees of confinement and the existence of different n transformation processes lead to differences in the reaction processes of nitrogen to prove this hypothesis we selected boreholes from different karst media in the karst plain and analysed the mechanism of the influence of the karst media on nitrogen transformation by using data from long term observations to overcome the limitations of using nitrate isotopes alone we further verified whether different media of karst aquifers affect the transport and transformation of inorganic nitrogen pollutants and explored the patterns and mechanisms involved in this study multiple isotopic methods together with physicochemical indicators environmental parameters e g do eh the siar mixing model redox conditions and the content of reaction products e g nh4 no3 no2 were used to determine the source and transformation of nitrogen in the groundwater therefore the main objectives of this integrated analysis were as follows 1 determine the hydrogeochemical characteristics of groundwater in different karst media 2 determine the mechanisms of n species enrichment and transformation in the different karst aquifer media e g conduits fissures and 3 identify the potential sources of no3 in karst water at different levels of development 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area zengpiyan 110 15 110 18 e and 25 12 25 17 n a typical peak forest plain landscape is at the southwest foot of dushan hill in the south of guilin city south china and has two mountains in the area xiangren hill and dushan hill with an area of approximately 2 000 km2 dushan hill an isolated peak in the peak forest plain the northwest side is a steep cliff approximately 60 70 and the south east side is a gentle slope approximately 20 30 is a typical rock formation sloping gently to the south east and forming a one sided mountain the site is developed in dongcun formation limestone d3d upper devonian guilin formation limestone d3g upper devonian tangjiawan formation dolomite and limestone d2t middle devonian xindu formation sandstone and shale interbedded with iron ore d2x are exposed upstream to the west the peaks are surrounded by the quaternary with cover lithologies containing chalky clay and gravel thickness 0 30 m fig 1 the groundwater of zengpiyan belongs to the lijiang river this water is divided into three main types karst conduit water karst fissure water and pore water from the quaternary according to borehole data the karst aquifer medium in this area is primarily a network of karst fissures and small conduits and flow velocity is slow qin et al 2011 within 25 m below the bedrock surface lapies grikes and caves are commonly developed and distributed in a network with good connectivity and frequent surface water and groundwater exchange wang 2018 the main groundwater runoff zone of the area is divided into an ns oriented karst conduit runoff system and a nw se oriented conduit fissure runoff system wang 2019 wang et al 2019 monitored the annual variation in groundwater level in the study area there was a variation of 6 8 m in the water level of the isolated peak mountain and less than 2 m in the plain area water level monitoring of different types of karst boreholes in the plain area showed that the water level of each borehole responded almost synchronously to rainfall the water level observations by guo et al 2021 in 2018 of two boreholes in retort rock showed that boreholes zk9 and zk21 represent the groundwater in the pipeline concentrated flow zone and matrix fracture zone respectively the groundwater in both boreholes was sensitive to rainfall and the difference among the water level curve water level initiation time and peak time of the two was almost negligible the monitoring data of wang et al 2017 in 2016 in the retort rock showed that the water level response curve waveforms of surface pool p3 isolated caves zk10 and karst fissures zk15 in the study area were essentially the same for different seasons of rainfall indicating that the water levels of different media are closely linked in this study area the source of groundwater in the study area is complex and influenced by various factors and the types of pollutants and pollution pathways are diverse regarding water recharge in addition to the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation in the vertical direction it also receives groundwater confluence from peak cluster depressions in the west resulting in abundant groundwater resources groundwater drainage is influenced by the lijiang river and its tributary valleys the recharge areas of groundwater in zengpiyan are mainly towns and woodlands with a relatively small area of agricultural land in the early days of guilin s industrial development high pollution industries such as nitrogen fertiliser plants chemical plants and brick factories were located close to the study area the pollution situation has improved as a result of the relocation of enterprises in the later stages of urban planning but the degradation of pollutants remains a lengthy process there are schools hospitals commercial areas and residential communities around the area and the domestic sewage discharged during their daily operations also affects groundwater quality 2 2 sampling sites zengpiyan was used as the study area fourteen sampling points were set up considering the differences in groundwater flow direction and aquifer media in the study area the distribution of some sampling points is shown in fig 1 the sampling depth was 10 m below the surface we continuously monitored the water level of the karst pools st to reflect the water level changes at each sampling point in the study area fig 2 groundwater samples were collected monthly from april to december 2019 nitrate isotope samples were collected once in april 2019 including one sample zk10 from an isolated karst cave with poor hydraulic connectivity eight samples from fissure boreholes four samples from conduit boreholes and one sample from a surface karst pool borehole y8 at the foot of xiangren hill was upstream of the ground hydrogeological unit boreholes zk6 zk7 zk8 zk9 zk10 zk11 zk20 y4 zk15 zk21 and zk22 were in the groundwater runoff zone the karst pool st was located downstream of the zengpiyan hydrogeological unit based on the literature and drilling data the sampling points were classified into four types according to openness sample zk10 from an isolated cave with poor hydraulic connectivity which can be regarded as a closed system zk7 zk8 zk15 zk20 zk21 zk22 y4 and y8 which are karst fissure media zk6 zk9 zk11 and sd a karst cave with water which are karst conduit media fig s1 and the st is a surface karst pool which is an open system 2 3 water quality and isotope analysis t water

geochemical analysis laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences nitrate isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were determined using an elemental analyser ea conflo plus in the stable isotope laboratory of the institute of agricultural environment and sustainable development chinese academy of agricultural sciences the standard deviation of δ15n no3 was less than

resources guangxi region and the environmental and geochemical analysis laboratory of the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the analytical quality was 0 5 for δ2h h2o and 0 2 for δ18o h2o based on three internal standards gbw04458 gbw04459 and gbw04460 2 4 siar mixing model the bayesian mixing model can be used to measure the contribution of external environmental sources of no3 to groundwater no3 in the study area torres martínez et al 2021 the mixed model calculations were implemented using the siar stable isotope analysis in r software package and were successfully applied to multiple no3 source calculations zhao et al 2020 considering isotopic fractionation effects parnell 2008 1 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk ñ μ jk ω jk 2 c jk ñ λ jk τ jk 2 ε

used four potential sources as specific isotope values soil organic nitrogen son atmospheric deposition ad manure and sewage wastes m s and chemical fertiliser cf 3 results 3 1 physicochemical characteristics the physicochemical parameters of the groundwater samples are summarised in table s1 few differences in groundwater temperature were observed among different degrees of karst development the mean values of water temperature for isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 21 0 c 21 8 c 21 5 c and 22 6 c respectively the four types of groundwater temperature trends are similar with a general trend from rising to declining peaking in august which is in line with the air temperature fig 3 d the difference is that isolated cave water zk10 and fissure water show that the change is relatively smooth whereas surface water exposed to air changes significantly the mean values of do in isolated cave water zk10 karst fissure water karst conduit water and surface water were 2 1 mg l 1 89 mg l 3 37 mg l and 6 43 mg l respectively the do concentrations were the highest in surface water the difference between zk10 and fissure water do was small and conduit water was approximately 1 76 times higher than that of fissure water subject to seasonal changes do in the four different types of water showed different patterns of variation but generally showed an increasing tendency the do concentrations were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer fig 3 a the concentration of doc in different types of groundwater changed slightly with mean values of 0 48 mg l for isolated cave water zk10 0 55 mg l for fissure water 0 54 mg l for conduit water and 0 42 mg l for surface water fissure water conduit water and surface water have the same tendency first increasing and then decreasing minimum in july fig 3 b the doc data for september differed significantly from that of the other months because of the operating instrument error of the measurement personnel and were not counted the mean values of eh in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 29 2 mv 310 1 mv 371 4 mv and 381 5 mv respectively they varied similarly with a gradual decrease throughout the sampling period fig 3 b the oxidation reduction potentials of isolated cave water zk10 were chronically low but they were higher in autumn and winter than in spring and summer which differs from other medium this phenomenon is observed because zk10 is an isolated water filled cave which is poorly hydraulically connected to the surrounding water and only hydraulically or air linked to the conduits under certain water level conditions the reasons for this difference include the conditions of the aqueous medium microorganisms the content of organic carbon and dissolved oxygen su et al 2016 table s1 the ec of four types of water showed a decreasing trend with high values in spring and summer and low values in autumn and winter the samples in isolated cave water zk10 were the lowest mean 393 63 μs cm and fissure water and conduit water were similar mean 526 76 μs cm and 523 44 μs cm but the coefficient of variation in fissure water was approximately twice that in conduit water the mean value for surface water was 510 0 μs cm the difference between the isolated cave water zk10 and the other three media karst water is significant which is related to former s poor hydraulic connectivity 3 2 hydro geo chemistry the total hardness values of the samples were as follows isolated cave water zk10 7 95 74 58 mg l mean 45 78 mg l fissure water 9 9 145 89 mg l mean 69 37 mg l conduit water 14 37 154 87 mg l mean 74 67 mg l and surface water 23 48 105 51 mg l mean 70 62 mg l table s1 the minimum mean was isolated cave water zk10 and the maximum mean was conduit water the major ion concentrations from the four types of groundwater were plotted on a piper diagram fig 4 a and the samples are grouped in the bottom left corner of the image the determination of anion and cation concentrations in the karst water showed that the water contained large amounts of hco3 ca2 so4 2 and mg2 among them hco3 ca2 and mg2 mainly originate from the aquifers of the dongcun formation limestone guilin formation limestone and tangjiawan formation dolomite and limestone these three ions are strongly associated with karst processes and their high concentrations indicate that groundwater is mainly controlled by the dissolution of carbonate and rock weathering eqs 2 and 3 table 1 so4 2 is mainly derived from pyrite in the layer of the upper reaches near zengpiyan and sulfite in fly ash and bottom slag is left over from the brickyard wang 2018 which is oxidised to sulfate through rainfall and rock weathering eq 4 table 1 vear and curtis 1981 in addition nitrate may displace oxygen as an electron acceptor during the oxidation of pyrite because of the high nitrate content in groundwater eq 5 table 1 engesgaard and kipp 1992 and eventual so4 2 transport to the surrounding aquifers via groundwater exchange on the surface conduit and fissure waters the cations are dominated by ca2 and the anions are dominated by hco3 and so4 2 isolated cave water zk10 is dominated by ca2 and mg2 cations and hco3 and cl anions table s1 according to the shukarev classification the groundwater samples are dominated by the hco3 ca type fig 4 a however in different types of water there is a certain rule regarding the concentrations of the major anions and cations fig 4 b hco3 concentration fissure water isolated cave water zk10 conduit water surface water so4 2 concentration surface water conduit water fissure water isolated cave water zk10 ca2 concentration as conduit water surface water fissure water isolated cave water zk10 and mg2 concentration isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water surface water 3 3 isotopic compositions the average of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o in isolated cave water zk10 was 34 49 0 53 and 5 63 0 02 n 9 29 01 0 8 and 5 02 0 09 n 67 for fissure water 27 56 0 95 and 4 84 0 99 n 35 for conduit water and 26 83 1 95 and 4 7 0 21 n 9 for surface water regarding mean values the groundwater in zk10 was the lowest and the surface water was the highest fig 6 a which showed the same trend as the degree of aquifer confinement the mean values of nitrate nitrogen isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in isolated cave water zk10 were 11 94 and 6 65 11 97 5 24 and 8 2 3 06 n 8 for fissure water 13 7 0 2 and 7 19 0 99 n 4 for conduit water and 13 53 and 9 72 for surface water 3 4 spatial and temporal variability of n species analysis of the three nitrogen concentrations in groundwater showed that the highest concentration of no3 was found in karst groundwater followed by nh4 and the lowest concentration of no2 table s1 this phenomenon is observed because the n in no2 is 3 valent and has oxidising and reducing properties thus its content is much lower than that of the other two forms of nitrogen by contrast nh4 being positively charged is easily adsorbed by soil particles before entering groundwater therefore nitrate is more likely to enter groundwater than ammonia causing pollution and become the main pollutant in groundwater ammonium nitrogen nitrate and nitrite nitrogen were detected in all the boreholes although their concentrations did not exceed the class iii groundwater quality standard gaqs and iqprc 2017 their concentrations were much higher than those for uninfluenced groundwater from the perspective of the special hydrogeological conditions of the karst area and the nitrogen cycle the pollution risk is high the spatiotemporal variations in the three nitrogen concentrations are shown in fig 5 there are similarities and differences in the concentrations of the three types of nitrogen in water from different boreholes with the largest difference occurring in the nh4 concentration the mean values of nh4 in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 3 16 μm 27 05 μm 2 51 μm and 2 95 μm respectively where the nh4 concentrations in isolated cave water and surface water are stable a highly variable was observed in fissure water suggesting poor hydraulic connectivity in the fissure table s1 fig 5 a throughout the sampling period the nh4 concentrations in groundwater were much lower in summer than in other seasons presumably nh4 was diluted by rainfall and increased water temperature can promote the use of nh4 by microorganisms the degree of aquifer confinement can also affect nitrate concentration in groundwater katz 2019 nitrate concentrations in boreholes mostly showed an increase with increasing connectivity of the karst aquifer media which is consistent with observations in the literature the mean values of no3 concentrations in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 22 52 μm 46 09 μm 81 37 μm and 87 04 μm respectively temporally nitrate concentrations in conduit water and surface water showed a decreasing trend and fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 showed a fluctuating increase in nitrate content which was close to the change in do content fig 3 a and fig 5 b differences in nitrite concentrations were not obvious the mean values of no2 concentrations in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water conduit water and surface water were 0 06 μm 0 13 μm 0 14 μm and 0 15 μm respectively nitrite concentrations varied smoothly throughout the sampling period with the lowest nitrite concentrations occurring in the isolated cave water zk10 the data for y8 is anomalous so its date was not counted here 4 discussion 4 1 openness of different karst media based on water isotopes δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o are stable isotopes naturally present in water molecules and have different values based on the different groundwater environments therefore δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o isotopes can be used to identify the source of water and hydrogeological processes in our study the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and local meteoric water line lmwl zhang et al 2015 were used to identify the sources of water and hydrogeological processes groundwater samples were distributed close to the gmwl and lmwl fig 6 b indicating a local meteoric origin of the groundwater the slope of the regression line for surface water was closest to that of the lmwl but the intercept was lower than that of the lmwl fig 6 b the result reflects the frequent exchange between surface water and the atmospheric and the loss of δ18o h2o is greater than that of δ2h h2o during evaporation hu et al 2019 the slope and intercept of the isolated cave water zk10 were the smallest and δ18o h2o moved mainly on the δ2h h2o axis with an upwards and downwards drift of 2h this phenomenon is observed because of the exchange of isotopes in the h2s h2o system in a reducing environment and the exchange of hydrogen isotopes in various hydrogenous materials which led to vertical variation in δ2h h2o gui and chen 2007 clark and fritz 2013 the δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o isotopes of water are affected by various factors such as the water vapour source the evaporation effect chemical reaction and mixing the evaporation of groundwater and chemical reactions were affected by the openness karst medium the average values of the four types of karst water isotopes in this study show a clear pattern the mean value of δ18o h2o was highest in surface water followed by conduit water and fissure water fig 6 a therefore the evaporation and chemical reactions of surface water are the most intense followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water to further validate the aforementioned law by deducting the effect of water vapour sources with different rainfall levels during the year we used the d excess d δ2h h2o 8 δ18o h2o value the higher the degree of water rock interaction in the same area and aquifer the more 18o can be released from the rock into the water which can increase the value of δ18o and decrease the value of d excess in the groundwater yin et al 2001 diao et al 2014 the d excess in the rainy season increased in d excess value from zk10 to the surface water fig 6 c this phenomenon occurred due to the evaporation of groundwater during the hot rainy season the evaporation intensity increased from zk10 to the surface water indicating that the degree of openness of the four types of karst water was in the order of surface water conduit water fissure water zk10 regarding the d excess in the dry season of groundwater from fissure water to surface water it has a decreasing trend during the dry season the temperatures are low evaporation is weak and karst groundwater flows slowly and is almost laminar the strength of its water rock action is consistent with the diffuse boundary layer theory the d excess value is affected by water rock interaction the slower the flow velocity is the thicker the diffusion boundary layer is and the more the dissolution flux is resulting in weak water rock interaction liu and dreybrodt 1998 the fissure water flows more slowly than conduit water resulting in weak water rock interaction and a large d excess value in fissure water surface water conduit water and fissure water have increasingly weaker water rock action weaker water flow rates and less openness in that order therefore the rainy and dry seasons indicate that the four types of karst media have different degrees of openness in the order of surface water conduit water fissure water zk10 4 2 redox conditions of different karst media based on physicochemical indicators the oxidation reduction reaction has a significant influence on the water chemical environment and plays a key role in the presence and transport of various organic and inorganic substances in water the sequence of oxidation reduction reactions depends on the chemical composition microbial activity and standard electrode potential borch et al 2010 in karst areas due to differences in the degree of karst development the oxygen content ion concentration and microbial species vary by the aquifer which leads to differences in the oxidation reduction status therefore the determination of oxidation reduction conditions provides a preliminary indication of biogeochemical stages in groundwater at different levels of karst development descriptions of different redox environments have been identified using various parameters such as the redox potential eh indicators of the high sensitivity index o2 no3 fe2 and so4 2 and the content of reduction products e g nh4 hs fe2 and ch4 appelo et al 2004 under the action of microorganisms groundwater undergoes the dissolved oxygen reduction stage no3 reduction stage partial oxidising environment fe iii reduction stage reducing environment so4 2 reduction stage strong reducing environment and co2 reduction stage in sequence reducing environment fig 7 a chapelle and lovley 1992 the optimum environment for the denitrification reaction occurs when eh is less than 231 mv and do is less than 2 mg l fig 7 b in addition the low value of eh indicates a strong reducing environment and the frequency of biological denitrification will increase rivett et al 2008 so4 2 reduction was strongest at eh values between 200 and 100 mv neculita et al 2007 we compared the redox potentials of the water samples collected in each borehole and no clear demarcation boundaries for the oxidation reduction stages of the four types of groundwater were observed there was a large temporal variation in eh with large differences and crossovers in eh among the four types of groundwater fig 7 a multiple redox processes may coexist in the same environment with different dominant roles under the control of different environmental factors the redox potentials of the water samples collected in isolated cave water zk10 are low for a long time from 134 3 to 111 2 mv mean 29 15 mv the h2s concentration at zk10 was higher than that in the other boreholes wang 2018 combined with the standard potentials of the redox electron pairs in the environment and the low concentrations of no3 and so4 2 which suggests that the isolated cave water zk10 may have passed through the nitrate reduction process and was dominated by sulfate reduction eq 6 table 2 fig 7 a in addition the data show that the ca2 concentration in the isolated cave water zk10 is lower than that in other boreholes suggesting that so3 2 was indirectly produced by the so4 2 reduction process in the groundwater and the excess so3 2 combined with ca2 to produce caso3 precipitation eq 7 table 2 wang 2019 therefore we suggest that long term exposure to the reducing environment was one of the reasons for the low ca2 concentration in isolated cave water zk10 fissure water samples had eh values from 46 3 to 484 5 mv mean 310 1 mv and according to the standard electrode potential the environment of fissure water was between suboxic and anoxic fig 7 a and more than 62 of the samples had do values less than 2 mg l fig 7 b combined with the high nh4 concentration and low no3 concentration in fissure water eqs 8a 8b and 9 table 2 we suggest that most of the fissure water was in the no3 reduction stage conduit water samples had eh values from 169 2 to 522 6 mv mean 371 4 mv and 294 3 to 489 1 mv mean 381 5 mv for surface water and the environment of both types of groundwater was between oxic and suboxic more than 73 of the samples in the conduit water had do values higher than 2 mg l and all the samples in the surface water had do values higher than 2 mg l fig 7 b furthermore the low concentrations of nh4 no3 and so4 2 and the high levels of do in conduit water and surface water also indicate that these two types of groundwater are mostly in the dissolved oxygen reduction stage 4 3 nitrogen transformation of different karst media nitrate migration in groundwater is influenced by microbial processes such as nitrification and denitrification kendall et al 2007 in identifying the state of their migration and transformation relying on a single indicator is difficult thus this study coupled several indicators to determine the method of identification 4 3 1 hydrochemical identification cl is stable in water not susceptible to physical chemical and microbial influences and its concentration generally only changes when mixing water with different cl concentrations lu et al 2015 thus cl is a good tracer for indicating the source of water pollution studies have shown that the relationship between cl and no3 ec and no3 can initially determine whether changes in no3 concentrations in water are from mixing processes without n form conversion or from denitrification if the increase in nitrate concentration is accompanied by an increase in cl concentration and ec the no3 concentration in the water is likely to be influenced by the mixing process of the n form transformation and denitrification is the dominant nitrogen transformation process altman and parizek 1995 itoh et al 2011 as shown no3 and cl were negatively correlated with fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 and positively correlated with conduit water and surface water with a significant positive correlation between the no3 and cl concentrations in conduit water p less than 0 05 fig 8 a the no3 concentration of isolated cave water zk10 was negatively correlated with ec and fissure water conduit water and surface water were positively correlated with ec however the correlation was nonsignificant in fissure water and the no3 concentrations of conduit water and surface water were significantly positively correlated with ec p less than 0 01 fig 8 b the no3 concentration in conduit water and surface water was positively correlated with the cl concentration and ec this finding suggests that the mixing process without n form conversion in surface water and conduit water is one of the likely causes of the no3 concentration however the linear relationship between no3 and cl concentrations in the conduit and surface water was nonsignificant which may be due to karst heterogeneity in the vertical direction yuan et al 2016 and parts of the borehole were in a suboxic or anoxic state producing local denitrification we observed a poor linear relationship between no3 and cl and no3 and ec in the fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 combined with the low dissolved oxygen low no3 and high nh4 concentrations in fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 eqs 8a 8b and 9 table 2 we conclude that denitrification is the key process in fissure and isolated cave waters 4 3 2 nitrate and water isotopic indicators δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 indicate nitrate sources and are powerful tools for identifying nitrate transformation processes theoretically two thirds of the nitrate is produced by ambient water and one third by atmospheric oxygen 23 5 andersson and hooper 1983 kendall 1998 thus δ18o no3 values can be used to indicate whether nitrification occurs the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in no3 are not only dependent on their source but are also influenced by many biological processes andersson and hooper 1983 isotopic fractionation occurs when nitrogen fixation assimilation nitrification denitrification and ammonia volatilisation occur but among these factors nitrification and denitrification have the greatest impact on nitrogen identification li et al 2002 chen et al 2007 in nitrification nitrifying bacteria first use lighter 14n resulting in an enrichment of δ15n in the subsequently produced nitrate in denitrification microorganisms usually change the lighter 14n in nitrate to n2o and n2 under suitable conditions resulting in an increase in the abundance of 15n in the remaining nitrate leading to an increase in δ15n values sebilo et al 2003 kaushal et al 2011 therefore the relationship among the δ18o no3 values do and δ15n no3 can be used to jointly determine the process of nitrogen transformation the δ18o no3 values of 60 of the water samples fell within the range of typical δ18o no3 values produced by nitrification 10 to 10 kendall 1998 with a few fissures out of range the δ18o no3 values for the surface and conduit water were close to the theoretical values fig 9 a suggesting that nitrification was the key process in the source of no3 in the surface and conduit water some of the fissure water falls within the typical δ18o no3 values for nitrification but is far from the theoretical line suggesting that nitrification is not the key process in fissure water the δ18o no3 values of groundwater at five fissure waters were greater than 10 with three boreholes zk7 zk15 and zk20 having δ18o no3 values much higher than 10 which may be due to denitrification leading to isotopic fractionation a low oxygen environment promotes denitrification resulting in large δ15n no3 values in the groundwater negative correlation an oxygen rich environment promotes nitrification resulting in the accumulation of δ15n no3 in the groundwater positive correlation therefore theoretically the lower the dissolved oxygen content the higher the δ15n no3 values which are dominated by denitrification in groundwater dominated by nitrification the higher the do content the higher the δ15n no3 value analysis of the data revealed an inverse trend of do and δ15n no3 in the fissures and the same trend of do and δ15n no3 occurred in the conduit water fig 9 b these results indicate that denitrification is the key process in fissure water and that nitrification is the key process in conduit water 4 3 3 hydrochemical and nitrate isotope indicators nitrate transport in groundwater is influenced by microbial action and a series of biogeochemical processes occur resulting in changes in no3 15n no3 and δ18o no3 due to isotopic fractionation kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 therefore the transformation process of nitrate can be identified based on the changes in no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 chen et al 2009 zhang et al 2014 specifically when nitrification occurs no3 concentration increases cl is conserved the no3 cl molar ratio should be high and the nitrification reaction also depletes δ15n in nh4 resulting in a decrease in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values xue et al 2009 by contrast during denitrification when the no3 concentration decreases and the no3 cl molar ratio is low the kinetic isotope effect during denitrification preferentially converts lighter 14n and 16o into n2 and n2o resulting in positive values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the remaining nitrate aravena and robertson 1998 fukada et al 2003 the values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the isolated cave water zk10 were high with a clear trend of enrichment which correlated with the decrease in no3 concentration the no3 cl values from several samples were also low fig 10 a and b indicating that denitrification is the key process in isolated cave water in fissure water no3 concentrations were moderate δ18o no3 values were high δ15n no3 values were low and no3 cl values were low on average but there remained water samples with high no3 cl values thus denitrification and nitrification were simultaneously present and denitrification was predominant conduit and surface water no3 concentrations were high with moderate δ18o no3 δ15n no3 and no3 cl values thus nitrification was the key process and local denitrification was present as shown in fig 5 there are differences in trinitrogen concentrations in different karst media based on the above analysis it is speculated that the reason why the annual average value of ammonia nitrogen in the fissure water is the highest is that the fissure water is in micro oxidation condition the nitrification is week and denitrification is the key process leading to the accumulation of ammonia nitrogen the low concentrations of ammonia nitrogen in conduit and surface water are due to the utilization of ammonia nitrogen in the nitrification reaction for nitrate its concentration is highest in surface and conduit water followed by fissure water and zk10 we suggest that the surface and conduit water are more open and mostly in an oxidizing environment the nitrification reaction is strong and denitrification is weak in the groundwater which leads to the accumulation of nitrate while the denitrification reactions are the key process in fissure water and most of the nitrate being utilised zk10 has passed the denitrification stage resulting in the lowest nitrate concentrations nitrite is the intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification reactions in this study there was little variation in concentration among difference karst media with only low concentrations in zk10 it is assumed that the groundwater in zk10 has already passed through the nitrification and denitrification stages and there is little accumulation of nitrite various conceptual models describing the transport of nitrogen pollutants in karst aquifers have been proposed bakalowicz 2005 hartmann et al 2014 a conceptual model of nitrogen transformation in the four types of karst water is presented in fig 11 the four types are isolated cave early forms of karst development karst fissure and karst conduit and surface pool connected to karst conduit boreholes with isolated karst caves have a different transformation process than other boreholes because the former has poor hydraulic connectivity the possible sulfur and nitrogen transformation processes in zk10 are shown in fig 11 combined with the low dissolved oxygen redox potential so4 2 no3 and high h2s concentrations in the groundwater it is suggested that sulfate reduction reaction is strong and in the sulfate reduction stage dark blue arrow while the nitrification and denitrification reactions have passed and the nitrogen conversion reaction is weak light blue arrow medium a fig 11 owing to their rich hydraulic connectivity and good openness in surface and conduit water they have high dissolved oxygen and redox potentials the possible nitrogen transformation processes in surface and conduit water are given in fig 11 considering the low concentrations of reactants nh4 and high concentrations of product no3 in the nitrification reactions with the water chemistry and isotopic evidence we conclude that in surface and conduit water denitrifying bacteria have low respiration rates denitrification is weak light blue arrow and nitrification is the main process of nitrogen conversion dark blue arrow media c and d fig 11 fig 11 illustrates the possible nitrogen transformation processes in fissure water the fissure water environment was in a micro oxidative condition based on the high concentration of nh4 as a reactant in the nitrification reaction and the low concentration of no3 as a reactant in the denitrification reaction as well as the water chemistry and isotopic evidence we assumed that nitrification was weak in the fissure water light blue arrow and that denitrification dominated the nitrogen transformation process dark blue arrow medium b fig 11 4 4 identification of no3 sources determining the sources of pollutants is an essential part of pollution control however sources of groundwater nitrogen pollution are complex and diverse nitrogen enters the groundwater system mainly through the mineralisation of organic nitrogen from ad dead plant residues in the soil organic nitrogen fertilisers and domestic sewage from the surrounding population and inorganic nitrogen is produced and enters the groundwater system as water methods have been developed to investigate sources of nitrogen pollutants in groundwater and stable isotopes of nitrate tracing of nitrate sources have been widely used the range of variation in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from son domestic wastewater fertiliser and atmospheric precipitation varies widely therefore the use of dual isotope tracing of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate can better distinguish among these sources kendall 1998 the results show that 73 of the sample sites fall in the m s source windows fig 12 b with a small proportion from cf and son the stable isotopes of nitrate can initially determine the source of nitrate but other processes such as denitrification and anaerobic ammonia oxidation can lead to interference caused by isotope fractionation minet et al 2017 ren et al 2022 the siar model can also consider the isotope fractionation effects parnell et al 2010 this model has been widely used to calculate the contribution ratios of nitrate pollution sources in various water sources such as groundwater rivers and lakes puig et al 2017 el gaouzi et al 2013 yang et al 2013 the rate of contribution of each no3 source calculated by the siar model fig 12 a denitrification fractionation values are based on previous studies of nitrate isotope tracing in this basin zhao et al 2020 showed that the average contribution of m s to no3 was the largest but there were differences among boreholes the contributions of the four potential no3 sources in the isolated cave water zk10 were 42 4 25 6 19 2 and 12 9 for m s son cf and ad respectively notably there were differences among the different fissure boreholes with cf contributing the most to no3 at zk7 zk22 and y4 exceeding 35 and m s contributing the most to no3 on average in the remaining fissure boreholes there was small variation in the contributions of the four potential no3 sources among the conduit boreholes with m s contributing the most to no3 at 39 8 followed by son mean 26 cf mean 20 6 and ad mean 13 7 the contributions of the four potential no3 sources to surface water were 40 8 24 6 19 5 and 15 1 for m s son cf and ad respectively the contribution of each no3 source in zk10 y8 zk8 zk6 zk9 zk11 sd and st were relatively close and presumably in the same direction as the subsurface runoff with strong connectivity which validates the hydrogeological findings fig 1 5 conclusion evidence from water δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and hydrogeochemistry suggests that nitrate migration and transformation are closely linked to the degree of karst media development water isotopes indicated that regional groundwater originated mainly from local precipitation without significant evaporation however the degree of karst media development results in different flow velocities which indirectly affects the water rock interaction the mean values of the deuterium oxygen isotope were highest for surface water followed by conduit water fissure water and isolated cave water zk10 the main sources of nitrate in groundwater from different karst media were mostly m s with an average contribution of 32 9 followed by son cf and ad 25 4 24 6 and 17 respectively hydrogeochemical and environmental parameters and isotopic evidence suggest that the transformation process of nitrogen in the conduit and surface water is dominated by nitrification with possible local denitrification and the transformation process of nitrogen in fissure water is dominated by denitrification with possible local nitrification and sulfate reduction in isolated cave water these changes are likely attributed to 1 the karst aquifer system containing different media such as conduits fissures isolated caves and other karst forms which show strong inhomogeneity 2 the karst groundwater shows different hydrodynamic conditions during transport which are controlled by the existing karst forms the time of the conduit water circulation cycle is short and the renewal capacity is strong whereas in karst fissures it is slow and the permeability is relatively weak which affects the dissolved oxygen content of groundwater and the reaction and transport of solutes 3 controlled by the existing karst morphology karst groundwater has different degrees of confinement which results in significant differences in the hydrochemical environments of different karst media fissure and isolated cave water environments are prone to temporary anoxic or sub anoxic conditions isolated cave groundwater is a long term reducing environment karst fissure water is between reducing and micro oxygen environments and karst conduit water and karst pool water are between micro oxygen and oxidising environments this study shows that based on the basic characteristics of karst aquifer media heterogeneity the study of karst groundwater chemistry such as elemental transformation processes transformation rates microbial influence mechanisms on transformation simulation of transformation processes and even the treatment of karst groundwater pollutants requires attention to the differences in karst media credit authorship contribution statement jing bao conceptualization methodology writing original draft investigation visualization xisong wu investigation

2009,parametric budyko models express the ratio of annual actual evapotranspiration et to annual precipitation p as a function of dryness index i e annual potential evapotranspiration et0 p denoted as di and model parameter at a catchment generally the model parameter is assumed to reflect factors besides di especially the underlying surface features however recent studies have revealed its relations with di which forces us to further examine its connotation we revisited the derivation of three parametric budyko equations and found that model parameter was essentially a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system then taking 15 typical catchments in the chinese loess plateau as the study area we explored the controls of budyko fu model parameter w and their differences in temporal between years and spatial between catchments processes as expected w was affected by both climate and underlying surface factors specifically di climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi influenced w in both temporal and spatial processes besides catchment relief ratio cr and relative infiltration capacity ks i r also affected w in spatial process sai was strongly correlated with di and its close relationship with w essentially conveyed di s influence considering the inherent connection between di and the inverse w di was not included in the empirical formula for w sai and ndvi remained independent in temporal process and the empirical formula for w with these two factors modeled annual et well mae 15 03 mm in spatial process sai ndvi cr and ks i r were interconnected and by using any one the spatial variation of et was captured adequately mae 11 16 11 74 11 27 and 10 43 mm respectively our results demonstrate theoretically and empirically the importance of viewing budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective and focusing on the differences of its controls in spatiotemporal processes keywords evapotranspiration budyko framework lumped parameter climate and underlying surface system spatiotemporal processes chinese loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction based on the observed empirical relation among actual evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p at a catchment budyko 1974 postulated that the long term average evapotranspiration ratio et p was dominantly controlled by the balance et0 p or dryness index di between atmospheric evaporative demand represented by et0 and water supply represented by p and proposed the original non parametric budyko equation for more than half a century several analytical functional forms of budyko models with one or more parameters have been developed to explain these observed deviations around the deterministic budyko curve among which the budyko fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 and the mezentsev choudhury yang equation denoted as budyko mcy equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008 have found to be typical representative and got widespread successful applications the model parameters in these two equations are represented by w and n respectively notably w and n are analogous and a statistical relationship of w n 0 72 has been deduced in a previous study yang et al 2008 as the budyko fu equation was proposed model parameter w was perceived to be related to the underlying surface characteristics such as topography vegetation and soil fu 1981 1996 yang et al 2008 derived the budyko mcy equation and also linked model parameter n with non climatic catchment characteristics in previous studies some scholars directly described model parameter as landscape li et al 2016 liu et al 2021a yang et al 2021 land surface shao et al 2019 yu et al 2021 land specific liu et al 2021b or underlying surface ni et al 2022 yang et al 2022 parameter already in 1974 budyko 1974 realized the intra annual mismatch between p and et0 influenced precipitation partitioning as he observed that et p increased slightly with a parallel change in monthly p and et0 wolock and mccabe 1999 potter et al 2005 and hickel and zhang 2006 applied different simplified models to analyze the influence of intra annual distribution of water and energy on water balance subsequently various climate seasonality indexes were proposed and incorporated into the parameterization for model parameter de lavenne and andréassian 2018 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2022a petersen et al 2012 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2012 notably the climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai devised by liu et al 2018a has been widely applied in the research on the coupled water energy balance because it considers both the phase mismatch and amplitude difference between p and et0 cheng et al 2022 liu et al 2021a ning et al 2019 snow fraction f s is another climate factor affecting hydrological partitioning and has attracted wide attention liu et al 2022b liu et al 2022d berghuijs et al 2014 argued that higher f s was statistically correlated with increased annual runoff in the contiguous united states zhang et al 2015 reported a similar result in china ascribed to the increased runoff and decreased energy due to snowmelt in spring therefore several studies argued that model parameter represented the joint effects of land surface properties and climate factors besides di berghuijs and woods 2016a liu et al 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 noticeably some recent studies have identified p and et0 or di as influencing factors of model parameter for example jiang et al 2015 incorporated p into an empirical formula for n in weihe river basin in china yang et al 2016 combined the budyko mcy model with the stochastic model for soil moisture dynamics of porporato et al 2004 and derived the expression of n including di mean rainfall depth per event rooting depth and plant available water content these studies provide new insights into the controls of model parameter however intuitively it seems to be inconsistent with traditional cognition and somewhat redundant as the original budyko model has already incorporated p and et0 or di as the first control of catchment water balance but such a close relationship has also been confirmed in many other studies gao et al 2016 guillén et al 2021 huang et al 2022 li et al 2021b reaver et al 2022 saha et al 2020 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 it seems that many factors with potential physical meanings are related to model parameter even including p and et0 or di these new and emerging results on the controls of model parameter reflect the deepening of research on the coupled water energy balance although current studies have dug out diverse influencing factors of model parameter an intriguing and unanswered question arises why so many factors are associated with it which poses great challenge in interpreting its connotation on the other hand despite great achievements made on the influencing factors of budyko model parameter see table s1 several studies threw doubts on parametric model for example greve et al 2015 argued that budyko model parameter had no a prior physical meaning sposito 2017 critically pointed out that the statistical relationship between model parameter and biophysical characteristics may be spurious because the current physical interpretation of model parameter was not derived rigorously from mathematical reasoning reaver et al 2022 further argued that parametric budyko models were underdetermined and the current physical interpretations of model parameter were unfounded as we briefly outlined various viewpoints on budyko model parameter we also noticed that the general conclusions on the influence of its controls have not been reached among the existing studies the importance of vegetation has drawn extensive interests and been well documented donohue et al 2007 donohue et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 however previous studies have revealed its positive negative and non significant effects on model parameter for instance yang et al 2009 found in china that the vegetation coverage was positively correlated with model parameter in the yellow river basin and the inland river basin but negatively correlated in the hai river basin padrón et al 2017 assembled a global dataset of 2733 catchments and suggested that the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was not significantly correlated with w for any climate type another example is about the f s some scholars argued that a precipitation shift from snow to rain decreased the streamflow and the larger f s was conducive to increase runoff rather than et berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2015 however li et al 2021b and ning et al 2019 observed opposite behaviors in the chinese loess plateau clp where f s was positively associated with budyko model parameter these inconsistent results may be related to not only the spatial heterogeneity of controls on precipitation partitioning but also the differences in the perspectives analyzed i e from temporal or spatial processes catchment scale hydrologic behavior generally reflects the complex interaction of climate vegetation topography and soil donohue et al 2012 gentine et al 2012 milly 1994 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2013b yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 among which topography and soil generally change slightly in temporal process while climate and vegetation have relatively evident interannual variations however the influences of factors with obvious interannual variations on precipitation partitioning also vary temporally and spatially ning et al 2019 showed that climate seasonality and vegetation had significant effects on the inter annual variation of w in the clp but the effects of climate seasonality gradually weakened with increasing time scales in the spatial process f s and vegetation coverage played dominant roles most of the previous studies focused on the spatial process and paid less attention to the temporal process several recent studies analyzed the influencing factors of the time varying budyko model parameter jiang et al 2015 li et al 2021b wang et al 2022 a common feature of these studies is that the influencing factors revealed all included temperature et0 or p which was very interesting as these climatic factors were seldom found in the studies on spatial process a possible reason for this is that the temporal variations in the underlying surface conditions are comparatively small and thus the effects of climate factors are amplified this demonstrates the significant differences in the influencing factors of model parameter in spatiotemporal processes it is crucial to realize such differences for understanding the coupled water energy balance at a catchment more deeply the primary concern here is how we should view model parameter and whether there exists a unified understanding of its influencing factors in light of this we first reviewed three widely employed parametric budyko equations theoretically and proposed a unified understanding on model parameter from earth system science perspective on this basis taking the clp as an example we 1 comprehensively explored the climate and underlying surface factors affecting w 2 analyzed the correlation between factors and their differences in spatiotemporal processes then 3 developed the empirical formulae for w to estimate spatiotemporal variations in et with considering collinearity problems it is expected that the theoretical review and empirical test here advance the understanding of budyko model parameter and catchment water balance 2 theoretical interpretation of the budyko model parameter the parametric budyko equations have the following general form zhou et al 2015b 1 et p f et 0 p c where et is annual evapotranspiration mm p is annual precipitation mm et0 is annual potential evapotranspiration mm and c is the model parameter that adjusts the partitioning of p into et and runoff r a larger model parameter indicates larger et p this free parameter provides great flexibility in moving budyko curves in budyko space the three parametric budyko equations of interest here are presented in table 1 budyko mcy equation was sourced from mezentsev 1955 and choudhury 1999 and the formal mathematical derivation was given by yang et al 2008 in the mathematical reasoning yang et al 2008 suggested that et was an implicit function of p et0 and et and started their mathematical reasoning from the implicit function eq 5 in their 2008 paper 2 et f 1 p et 0 e t ultimately the analytically derived parametric budyko equation can be expressed as follows 3 et f 2 p et 0 n in eq 2 et serves as both the dependent variable and one of the independent variables in eq 3 the model parameter n replaces the independent variable et therefore it can be inferred straightforward that when interpreting model parameter we should consider all factors affecting et likewise we noticed similar theoretical basis of the mathematical reasoning by fu 1981 where he defined residual evaporation et0 et and residual precipitation p et and presented the partial derivative of et with respect to p and et0 as the initial step in his mathematical procedure both partial derivatives are expressed as functions of et see eqs 1 and 2 in zhang et al 2004 which indirectly implied that et was expressed as an implicit function as eq 2 budyko fu equation was proposed by dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning fu 1981 and later gained wide popularity in hydrological studies after being revisited by zhang et al 2004 fu 1996 realized the need for a more general and convenient method to determine the model parameter and deduced a calculating formula for w as a function of p r and other terms related to the underlying surface characteristics this can be expressed as follows 4 w 1 a p 365 b 1 r p r p k where a b and k reflect the effects of the underlying surface characteristics with fitting values of 0 2928 1 210 and 0 393 for mountain and plateau areas 0 4852 1 541 and 0 140 for plain areas and 0 9518 0 403 and 0 530 for sichuan basin respectively it is clear that the ratio of r to p reflects not only the underlying surface characteristics such as topography vegetation and soil but also the climate factors affecting et wang and tang 2014 applied the generalized proportionality hypothesis for mean annual water balance at a catchment and derived a one parameter budyko equation referred to as the budyko wt equation according to this hypothesis p has a priority to meet the demand for initial evaporation e0 and the remaining water p e0 is left for the competition between r and continuing evaporation et e0 the potential for continuing evaporation is denoted as et0 e0 and the potential for r is the remaining water after consumption by e0 based on the assumption that the ratio of continuous evaporation to its potential is equal to that of r to its potential the budyko wt equation was derived with model parameter ε expressed as e0 et a higher ε indicates a higher proportion of e0 in total et and thus less water available for r and continuing evaporation therefore a higher ε means a larger et p noticeably budyko wt equation explicitly presents the model parameter as a function of et chen and wang 2015 wang and tang 2014 similarly the expression of budyko fu model parameter eq 4 indirectly contains et because r can be expressed by p et since model parameter is a function of et all factors affecting et may also affect model parameter naturally this conveys strongly that climate and underlying surface factors jointly affect budyko model parameter specifically climate factors not only include the widely recognized rainfall intensity climate seasonality snow fraction etc but also contain p and et0 or di from the perspective of earth system science all these factors are interconnected and influence each other and the relationships among them also vary across temporal and spatial processes thus the budyko model parameter should be a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system in the following we take the clp as an example to test the factors of model parameter and their relations and the analyses are conducted between years temporal process and between catchments spatial process respectively note that here the analysis of spatial process is conducted on mean annual scale 3 case study 3 1 materials and methods 3 1 1 study area the clp is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river in china and spans the sub humid semi arid and arid climatic zones from the southeast to the northwest owing to the highly erodible loess sparse vegetation coverage and high intensity of rainstorms the clp has long suffered severe soil erosion in recent decades with the implementation of a series of ecological restoration measures such as the grain for green project the regional vegetation coverage and ecological environment have improved substantially chen et al 2015 li et al 2017 liu and lei 2015 zhang et al 2022a in this study 15 typical catchments in the clp are selected for analysis and fig 1 shows their distribution together with the meteorological and hydrological stations these catchments were located in areas with significant vegetation restoration in the clp many studies on et have been conducted in this region and can be available for reference gao et al 2016 li et al 2021b liang et al 2015 the mean annual 1960 2020 p and et 0 using the penman equation penman 1948 for these catchments were 295 513 mm and 1155 1305 mm respectively 3 1 2 data collection monthly streamflow data of the 15 hydrological stations in the clp were collected from the loess plateau subcenter of the national earth system science data center https loess geodata cn because the selected ndvi data only covered the period of 1982 2015 streamflow data were chosen to be maximally consistent with the ndvi data and the record length of streamflow data in the 15 catchments ranged from 23 to 34 years daily meteorological data were acquired from the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration https data cma cn seven daily meteorological variables including precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature mean atmospheric pressure sunshine duration and mean wind speed were extracted from 138 meteorological stations within and around the clp the above daily meteorological variables were then used to calculate daily et0 based on the penman equation penman 1948 and the computation of all terms in the equation followed the method and procedure given in fao 56 allen et al 1998 penman equation is expressed as follows 5 et 0 δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 e s e a where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the air temperature kpa γ is the psychometric constant kpa r n is the net radiation mm day g is the heat flux into the ground mm day often neglected at daily scale e s and e a are the saturated and actual vapor pressure taken at the air temperature kpa respectively the wind function f u 2 can be represented as f u 2 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 penman 1948 where u 2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m height m s and is converted from the wind speed at 10 m height u 10 m s by u 2 u 10 2 10 1 7 daily et0 of all the meteorological stations were aggregated into the monthly values the monthly values were then spatially interpolated using the kriging algorithm finally catchment scale monthly et0 was obtained by arithmetically averaging the gridded data in each catchment and further they were summed to annual values ndvi data were sourced from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms ndvi 3 g v1 dataset https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources nasa arc ecocast gimms ndvi3g v1p0 the dataset spans from 1982 to 2015 and has the longest record length currently available with the spatial and temporal resolution of 1 12 approximately 8 km and 15 days respectively a digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution was from aster gdem v2 https yceo yale edu aster gdem global elevation data the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks dataset was derived from the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters https globalchange bnu edu cn research soil3 the dataset was developed by dai et al 2013 and included a variety of soil hydraulic parameters with vertical depths of 0 1 383 m divided into seven layers following bai et al 2019 the ks was calculated by taking the top five layers namely 0 49 3 cm soil depths all data were spatially averaged over each catchment on the arcgis platform 3 1 3 influencing factors of model parameter on long term scale the water storage change δs is negligible while on annual scale it is generally necessary to consider the potential influence of the interannual variation in δs we conducted water balance analysis on the scale of hydrological year from may to april of the next year to minimize the impact of δs gao et al 2017 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2020 et calculated based on the water balance equation et p r was used as the observed et etobs and w was then solved numerically in budyko fu equation six explanatory variables of w were selected in this study including di sai f s ndvi catchment relief ratio cr and relative infiltration capacity ks i r several climate seasonality indexes have been proposed to quantify the mismatch between p and et0 within a year among which the sai proposed by liu et al 2018a has been found to perform better in explaining the variations in w ning et al 2019 in the construction process liu et al 2018a referred to the concept of phase shifts of seasonal p and et0 proposed by berghuijs and woods 2016b which provides a more reasonable description of seasonal distribution of p and et0 the proposed index represents not only the seasonal amplitude difference between p and et0 but also the phase mismatch between them 6a p t p 1 δ p s i n 2 π τ t s p 12 6b et 0 t et 0 1 δ et 0 s i n 2 π τ t s et 0 12 6c sai δ p 2 2 δ p δ et 0 d i cos 2 π τ s p s et 0 12 δ et 0 d i 2 1 2 where p t and e t 0 t are monthly p and et0 p and e t 0 are their monthly averages τ is a seasonal period of 0 5 year 6 months in tropical regions and 1 year 12 months in other regions δ p and δ e t 0 are relative amplitudes of p and et0 respectively s p and s e t 0 are phase shifts of p and et0 respectively we determined sai with a fixed phase calculated by mean monthly p and et0 because it was more closely related to w than that with an annual varying phase calculated by monthly p and et0 each year ning et al 2019 the larger the sai the great the mismatch between the intra annual water supply and demand f s is the fraction of precipitation falling as snow over a particular period it was reported that precipitation phase shift affected precipitation partitioning berghuijs et al 2014 we calculate f s using the daily temperature and daily precipitation same to the method employed by berghuijs et al 2014 i e the daily precipitation with daily mean temperature below 1 was considered fully as snowfall cr is the altitude difference in a certain area and quantitatively reflects the topographic roughness dem data can be used to obtain cr quickly and conveniently the key is to determine the optimal threshold window which can be obtained using the mean change point method han et al 2012 after calculating the cr for each catchment we divided it by the cr of the clp to make it a dimensionless form following yang et al 2007 the ratio of ks to the mean precipitation intensity ir is used to represent the relative infiltration capacity where ir is the ratio of total precipitation to total precipitation days mm day in a year for a catchment 3 2 results 3 2 1 relationships of w with its explanatory variables in the interannual process linear and power regressions were used to analyze the relationships between w and its influencing factors considering the distribution characteristics of the data points table 2 it can be observed that the power function relationships between w and di reached a very significant level p 0 01 in 11 catchments and a significant level p 0 05 in one catchment but was not statistically significant p 0 05 in the other three c6 c8 and c12 fig 2 generally there existed a negative correlation between w and di on annual scale we found quite interestingly very significant power function relationships p 0 01 between w and sai in 11 catchments except for c5 c6 c8 and c12 which were very similar to the w di relationships in the interannual process w and f s were linearly correlated in only one catchment p 0 05 whereas there was no significant relationship in the other 14 catchments ndvi produced positive effects on w in the interannual process while the linear relationship between them was significant in 10 catchments p 0 05 but not significant in the other five catchments p 0 05 our findings suggested that di sai and ndvi had significant effects on model parameter w whilst f s had no significant effect on w in the 15 selected catchments in the clp in terms of spatial process w had very significant relationships with di sai ndvi cr and ks i r p 0 01 but no significant relationship with f s fig 3 the r2 was the highest between w and ks i r r2 0 50 followed by that between w and cr r2 0 48 ndvi r2 0 46 sai r2 0 46 and di r2 0 40 it can be also observed that w increased with ndvi and cr but decreased with the increasing ks i r sai and di this suggested that large ndvi and cr contributed to et while large ks i r di and sai were favorable for r with all else being equal 3 2 2 interrelations between explanatory variables before establishing functions for w to estimate the spatiotemporal variations in et we investigated the interrelations between influencing factors from table 2 it can be found that the relationships of w with di or sai were somewhat similar it can also be observed from the scatterplots fig 3 a b that the distributions of data points di w and sai w were relatively consistent we therefore surmise that di and sai may be correlated to some extent as shown in fig 4 di and sai were indeed closely related in both the temporal and spatial processes with the linear correlation coefficients r all reaching over 0 90 considering that the mathematical expression of sai contains di explicitly we could infer that the value of sai was largely influenced by di and the relationship between sai and w actually conveyed di s influence in light of results above we could conclude that w had close relationships with di sai and ndvi in the interannual process whereas no significant relationship was observed between w and f s consequently di sai and ndvi affected w in the interannual process the pearson correlation coefficients displayed in fig 5 showed negative relationships between di and ndvi in all 15 catchments however the negative correlations were significant in only five catchments p 0 05 broadly we could conclude that di was weakly related to ndvi and they were relatively independent of each other on annual scale given the highly linear correlation between di and sai we could deduce that sai and ndvi would also show a relatively independent relationship as confirmed by ning et al 2019 further the relationships among influencing factors of w in spatial process were also explored as shown in fig 6 di sai ndvi cr and ks i r were intimately interconnected more specifically di and ndvi were closely related with r2 being as high as 0 85 the negative correlation between them indicated that the drier the climate the lower the vegetation cover additionally there also existed negative correlations between ndvi and ks i r ks i r and cr as well as cr and di while positive linear correlations were observed between ks i r and di and between cr and ndvi the relationships between sai with ndvi cr and ks i r in spatial process were rather consistent with these between di and the three factors because di and sai were strongly correlated 3 2 3 formulae for w to estimate spatiotemporal variations in et in the above empirical analysis in the clp w was obtained by numerically solving the budyko fu equation i e the inverse method the inverse method can actually be viewed as expressing w as an implicit function of p et0 and et i e water balance based et therefore w obtained in this way was inevitably related to di intrinsically considering this feature of the inverse method we did not include di to construct the empirical formula for w in the interannual process sai and ndvi were the two main factors affecting w and they showed relatively independent relationships based on the combined annual dataset of the 15 catchments we analyzed the relationship of w with sai and ndvi respectively as depicted in fig 7 sai and ndvi had inverse impacts on w the r2 of w with sai and ndvi were 0 29 and 0 33 respectively and both reached a very significant level p 0 01 according to the relationships shown in fig 7 and the lower boundary of w i e w 1 the empirical formula for w in temporal process based on sai and ndvi was determined by the least square method as follows 7 w 1 2 88 sai 0 32 ndvi 0 46 r adj 2 0 39 p 0 01 the modeled annual w was compared against wobs calculated by budyko fu equation fig s1 a it can be found that the eq 7 provided reasonable estimates of w in interannual process indicated by a small mean absolute error mae of 0 39 a cross validation test was applied to assess the performance of w empirical formula in et estimation in particular data from 14 catchments were selected to construct the empirical formula for w using the least square method and data from the remaining one was left for validation the calibration validation process was repeated 15 times the modeled et etmod was plotted against etobs in fig 8 a the r2 was 0 96 and the mae was 15 03 mm indicating that budyko fu equation with the empirical formula for w constructed by sai and ndvi together can capture the interannual variations in et well in spatial process sai ndvi cr and ks i r were found to affect w collectively and these four factors were closely related to each other fig 6 the stepwise regression analysis showed that there existed multicollinearity problems among these factors implying that they could not be included into the empirical formula for w together therefore we used sai ndvi cr and ks i r separately to model w as follows 8 w 1 2 31 s a i 0 72 r adj 2 0 42 p 0 01 9 w 1 2 92 n d v i 0 57 r adj 2 0 41 p 0 01 10 w 1 1 88 cr 0 44 r adj 2 0 42 p 0 01 11 w 1 11 58 ks ir 0 39 r adj 2 0 47 p 0 01 sai ndvi cr and ks i r accounted for 42 41 42 and 47 of the variances in w respectively fig s1 b e presented the comparisons of w modeled by the above four empirical formulae against those calculated using budyko fu equation good agreement can be found with relatively small mae of 0 27 0 27 0 27 and 0 24 respectively next comparisons of etmol using eqs 8 11 against etobs were made by calculating r2 and mae fig 8 b e as expected the four formulae all exhibited a good coherence in et estimation with mae of 11 16 11 74 11 27 and 10 43 mm respectively indicating a reasonably accurate prediction of mean annual et estimated using sai ndvi cr or ks i r 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective budyko 1974 found that there existed systematic deviations from the mean dependence presented by his non parametric equation indicating that the variation in et could not be explained only by the climate factors represented by p and et0 thus directly promoting subsequent establishment of a series of parametric budyko equations the introduction of adjustable model parameter allows the curve to move freely in budyko space thus greatly expanding the flexibility and application of budyko framework du et al 2016 guo et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 potter et al 2005 wu et al 2017 xiong and guo 2012 in a recent study reaver et al 2022 argued that the model parameter in parametric budyko equation was a proxy variable for et p which could actually be directly proved by the implicit function form of the model parameter i e w g p e t 0 e t besides reaver et al 2022 raised doubt on the assumptions and interpretations of parametric equations however considering the curve fitting of water balance data the parametric budyko equation has a great practical value in hydrological studies because it is impossible to reproduce the water balance characteristics of different catchments using the entirely deterministic and non parametric curve much previous efforts have been devoted to establishing empirical formulas for budyko model parameter to estimate et compared with the non parametric equations they should all improve the estimation performance of et without exception li et al 2013 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2019 xu et al 2013a yang et al 2007 if turning back to the non parametric equation we really come full circle from this point of view parametric budyko equation is necessary the problem here is the lack of scientific consensus and reasonable explanation for model parameter it is widely held that budyko model parameter represents the underlying surface characteristics subsequent studies found that some climate factors such as climate seasonality and snow fraction also affected the model parameter table s1 through theoretical and data analyses we revealed that di was also an important influencing factor of model parameter in the clp climate vegetation topography and soil were intimately interconnected over long term scale which was consistent with the viewpoint in earth system science that the components of the earth system were coupled to each other earth system science considers the earth as a whole and recognizes it as an integrative interactive and dynamics system most importantly it emphasizes the interrelation and interaction between the various parts within the system lenton 2016 steffen et al 2020 notably et refers to the water phase transition from liquid to vapor and plays a critical role in global water cycle and energy exchanges it involves various biological and physical processes in the climate and underlying surface system in the vertical direction atmospheric state serves as its upper boundary while soil or vegetation constitutes the lower boundary liu et al 2022c hydrological processes usually represent the interactions of climate topography vegetation soil etc likewise as a transparent framework for analyzing the hydrological processes the budyko models characterize these integrated effects through the model parameter therefore the model parameter can be regarded as a lumped variable reflecting the integrative effects of the climate and underlying surface system in practice model parameter can be characterized by one or more factors while considering the variation in their coupled relationships during temporal or spatial processes among multiple physiogeographic elements the role of vegetation has attracted extensive attention as it is taken as an indicator integrating the effects of climate soil and topography on water balance however we should also realize the role of factors coupled with vegetation for example li et al 2013 suggested that low vegetation coverage may be related to large seasonal phase mismatch between precipitation and radiation gentine et al 2012 found that the deeper rooting structure of plants buffered the phase difference between precipitation and radiation these results actually reflected the coupled relations between the vegetation characteristics coverage and rooting depth and the climate seasonality in addition plant rooting depth has also been associated with climate feng et al 2012 laio et al 2006 found that the rooting depth was the deepest in the environments where p and et0 were approximately equal guswa 2008 further pointed out that increasing wetness produced deeper roots in arid environments in humid environments the rooting depth generally decreased with increasing wetness another factor related to the rooting depth was the plant available soil water holding capacity pawc which was incorporated into the expression for the parameter of the ecohydrological model developed by porporato et al 2004 another parametric budyko equation cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 shen et al 2017 yang et al 2016 by definition pawc is related to both the soil hydraulic properties and the vegetation characteristic another coupled relation to mention is that between vegetation type and di one such support was the work of budyko 1974 who initially employed the radiative dryness index one of di expressions to classify the different ecosystems as tundra forest steppe semidesert and desert consequently various physiogeographic elements cannot be viewed in isolation instead they are related to each other budyko model parameter actually can be the proxy for the interconnections among them in addition it is imperative to consider budyko model parameter as a lumped variable integrating the effects of catchment underlying surface and climate factors for proper application of budyko model and reasonable interpretation of the results for example the empirical formula for model parameter varies across studies implying the spatial difference of controls of precipitation partitioning from the perspective of earth system science this spatial difference reflected the regional differentiation of the physiogeographic environments greve et al 2015 mentioned that the specific dependence of model parameter on biophysical features may vary greatly between catchments and it was impossible to directly predict model parameter for ungauged catchments however because of the complexity of hydrological processes and the diversity of catchment groups analyzed general results usually did not exist chen et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 guillén et al 2021 li and quiring 2021 it is expected that the results obtained in one catchment group should not be extrapolated arbitrarily to other groups however the results obtained in the same catchment group could be transferable in temporal process to a certain degree we suggest that the model parameter in budyko framework be termed as a lumped parameter or just model parameter instead of being related to underlying surface characteristics unilaterally this allows us to not only view model parameter more comprehensively but also be aware of the climate impact on model parameter in this way when conducting attribution analysis based on the budyko framework we can reappraise the relative contribution of climate change and human activities on hydrological change with the improved interpretation of model parameter 4 2 differences of factors influencing w in temporal and spatial processes in this study w was negatively correlated with di and sai while positively correlated with ndvi in both spatial and temporal processes a larger sai implies a greater mismatch between p and et0 in a year therefore the proportion of et in p will decrease and the proportion of r will increase leading to the negative correlation between sai and w liu et al 2018a ning et al 2019 the reason why w and ndvi are positively correlated is that increased vegetation cover helps to reduce surface runoff increase rainfall infiltration and leads to more plant transpiration and evaporation of intercepted precipitation li et al 2013 ning et al 2017 the general explanation for the effect of topography on water balance is that steep sloping land is conducive to runoff generation therefore cr is expected to be negatively correlated with w however the effect of cr on catchment water balance in the clp is particular ning et al 2019 showed that the positive correlation between cr and w can be attributed to the large scale ecological restoration projects in this region the grain for green project in particular requires that cropland on steep slopes 25 be returned to forest and grassland these measures resulted in a positive correlation between the vegetation coverage and slope in other words the steeper the terrain the higher the vegetation coverage in the clp moreover the steeper the terrain the less interference there is from human activities and the better the natural recovery of vegetation thus w is larger f s has been found to exert impacts on precipitation partitioning abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 berghuijs et al 2014 li et al 2021b ning et al 2021 some studies showed that the increase of f s would lead to a higher percentage of r than et thus resulting in a negative correlation between w and f s liu et al 2022b liu et al 2022d zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 attributed this to the increase in snowmelt runoff and decrease in available energy due to snowmelt that is different from the results presented here in this study the average f s of the 15 catchments was only 0 04 far less than the threshold of 0 15 defined by berghuijs et al 2014 to identify snow affected catchments less snow in winter will evaporate or infiltrate quickly after the snowfall is melt instead of flowing away through channels to generate runoff in fact snowmelt runoff in china has mostly been observed in the northeastern part qi et al 2022 tian et al 2018 northwest inland region sorg et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and the source region of the yellow river liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2022b there are few reports on snowmelt runoff in the clp therefore the greater the proportion of snow in p the more water is available for evaporation and thus f s is positively correlated with w however in this study the positive relationships between w and f s were not significant in both the interannual and spatial processes two studies particular relevant here are these conducted by li et al 2021b and ning et al 2019 as they also examined the effect of f s on model parameter n and w respectively in the clp catchments but both reported a significant positive correlation p 0 01 it is worth noting that li et al 2021b used combined dataset averaged in a 9 year moving window from 14 catchments while ning et al 2019 used the mean annual values from 30 nested catchments one explanation for this discrepancy could stem from the spatiotemporal scales of analyses that is using data either from the moving window method or from nested catchments could confuse and complicate the role of f s in model parameter further analyses are required to investigate the reasons for the differences related to the different spatiotemporal scales in the interannual process the relationships between di and ndvi were not significant in most catchments fig 5 however in spatial process di and ndvi showed a very significant power function relationship with r2 being as high as 0 85 p 0 01 fig 6 a we interpret these different relations as the result of the large scale vegetation restoration projects implemented in the clp in recent decades afforestation and reforestation can significantly increase the vegetation coverage over a short period resulting in a lag response of vegetation growth to annual p and et0 nonetheless on long term scale vegetation has enough time to adapt to the regional climate and buffer human intervention to some extent gan et al 2021 gentine et al 2012 therefore there is a close relationship between di and ndvi on long term scale in spatial process the influencing factors of model parameter exhibited more coupled relations di sai ndvi cr and ks i r were closely related indicating that climate vegetation topography and soil interacted with each other on long term scale this interaction reflects the co evolution of the climate vegetation topography and soil in a catchment berghuijs et al 2020 gentine et al 2012 sivapalan 2006 troch et al 2015 yao and wang 2022 zhang et al 2022c yang et al 2009 found a significant positive correlation between slope tan β and ks i r r2 0 15 p 0 05 in the empirical formula for n established for 30 catchments in the hai river basin of china bai et al 2019 found that di and ndvi also showed strong correlation r2 0 69 when analyzing the influencing factors of budyko model parameter in 286 small catchments in china these studies emphasize that the interaction of various factors should be considered when analyzing the controls of budyko model parameter in the spatial process there are more coupled relations among the influencing factors driven by the co evolution considering the potential multicollinearity among factors and the availability of data it is suggested that relatively independent factors derived from easily accessible data be parameterized into the budyko model for better et modeling 4 3 limitations and uncertainties 4 3 1 effects of obtaining w by inverse method determining the model parameter w is the prerequisite for analyzing its controls and interpreting its connotation in this study the widely used inverse method was adopted to calculate w buzacott and vervoort 2021 guillén et al 2021 jaramillo et al 2018 kim and chun 2021 liu et al 2018a yang et al 2008 namely that w was obtained through solving the budyko fu equation using water balance based et we also noticed in some studies that model parameter was taken as a fixed value optimized with modeled et and water balance based et of multiple catchments donohue et al 2011 potter and zhang 2009 zhang and brutsaert 2021 zhang et al 2008 the optimization can be carried out for all catchments or for different catchments groups categorized by different factor such as the vegetation type and precipitation seasonality essentially the process of getting the optimized value reflects the idea of the inverse method because the modeled et needs to be calculated using the budyko equation the inverse method can actually be viewed as expressing w as an implicit function of p et0 and et guo et al 2019 implying the inherent relations between w with p and et0 or di therefore di was not used to construct the empirical formula for w in this study however the theoretical analysis demonstrated that the correlation between w and di was not only a mathematical problem caused by the inverse method but also a fact that can be supported by the solid theoretical evidence from the mathematical derivation of parametric budyko equations and the model parameter expression on the other hand previous studies have revealed the close relationships between w and vegetation topography soil and other factors from the perspective of earth system science the coupling correlations between climate and these factors also make w and di interrelated 4 3 2 effects of ignoring δs in annual water balance previous studies have investigated the role of δs in catchment water balance calculations han et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang 2012 considering the effect of δs one should be cautious when applying the budyko model on annual scale following existing studies we conducted the analysis on the scale of hydrological year without incorporating δs in the water balance calculation ning et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2020 this may lead to some uncertainties to explore these uncertainties we used a reconstructed monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace total water storage anomaly fields li et al 2021a li et al 2020 this data has relatively high spatial resolution 0 5 and long times series 1979 2020 and has been widely employed to quantify δs guan et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 zou et al 2022 fig s2 showed the distribution of δs and δs p in the 15 catchments the results showed that δs was approximately 20 40 mm year in the 15 catchments δs p roughly varied from 5 to 10 indicating that δs was relatively small relative to p fig s3 displayed the distribution of annual water balance data points and budyko curves with and without considering δs we found that in two cases the discrepancy of distributions of the data points was rather small and the best fit budyko curves basically coincided additionally et and w in two cases were all linearly correlated with small bias fig s4 further we evaluated the influencing factors of w in interannual process when considering δs table s2 and fig s5 we noted that w and di still exhibited a close relationship in most catchments besides sai and ndvi had a significant effect on w whereas the relationship between f s and w was not significant overall the relationships between w with di sai ndvi and f s were consistent with those obtained when ignoring δs therefore ignoring δs in interannual process had no impact on the conclusion of influencing factors of w more importantly the main conclusion namely the connotation interpretation of the budyko model parameter will not be affected however this does affect the regression coefficients in the w empirical formula it should be noted that grace based δs is more appropriate for large global basins because of its coarse resolution hasan and tarhule 2020 macedo et al 2019 tourian et al 2018 additionally this method was recently criticized for application in areas affected by coal mining chen et al 2020 sun et al 2022 therefore grace data was not used to quantify δs in annual water balance in this study instead we conducted the analysis on the scale of hydrological year we found that even if the grace data was used to incorporate δs in the water balance calculation the conclusions of this study will not change future development of δs dataset with higher spatial resolution and longer covering period will facilitate the application of the budyko model on finer spatiotemporal scales 5 conclusion budyko framework serves as a convenient and powerful tool for the analysis of coupled water energy balance at a catchment in recent years the understanding of budyko model parameter has been deepening but there is still no general agreement on its essential property this study reviewed three parametric budyko equations and proposed that model parameter is a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system instead of being related only to underlying surface conditions or factors besides di then based on budyko fu equation and hydrometeorological data of 15 typical catchments in the clp the controls of model parameter w including climate and underlying surface factors were comprehensively analyzed and the differences between temporal and spatial processes were explored our results showed that w integrated the effects of climate di and sai and underlying surface factors ndvi cr and ks i r on water balance in the clp specifically w and di were closely related in spatiotemporal processes sai and di were strongly and linearly correlated and the relationship between sai and w indirectly conveyed di s influence both f s and ndvi exerted positive effects on w while only the latter reached a significant level in the interannual process di sai and ndvi were the three main factors influencing w whereas in spatial process di sai ndvi cr and ks i r all had significant impacts on w and these five factors were closely related considering the inherent connection between di and the inverse w di was not included in the empirical formula for w combined with budyko fu equation the empirical formula for w based on sai and ndvi in temporal process and that respectively based on sai ndvi cr and ks i r in spatial process all performed acceptably in estimating et for the 15 catchments this study presents a deeper interpretation of budyko model parameter and emphasizes the importance of viewing budyko model parameter and analyzing its controls from the earth system science perspective credit authorship

2009,parametric budyko models express the ratio of annual actual evapotranspiration et to annual precipitation p as a function of dryness index i e annual potential evapotranspiration et0 p denoted as di and model parameter at a catchment generally the model parameter is assumed to reflect factors besides di especially the underlying surface features however recent studies have revealed its relations with di which forces us to further examine its connotation we revisited the derivation of three parametric budyko equations and found that model parameter was essentially a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system then taking 15 typical catchments in the chinese loess plateau as the study area we explored the controls of budyko fu model parameter w and their differences in temporal between years and spatial between catchments processes as expected w was affected by both climate and underlying surface factors specifically di climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi influenced w in both temporal and spatial processes besides catchment relief ratio cr and relative infiltration capacity ks i r also affected w in spatial process sai was strongly correlated with di and its close relationship with w essentially conveyed di s influence considering the inherent connection between di and the inverse w di was not included in the empirical formula for w sai and ndvi remained independent in temporal process and the empirical formula for w with these two factors modeled annual et well mae 15 03 mm in spatial process sai ndvi cr and ks i r were interconnected and by using any one the spatial variation of et was captured adequately mae 11 16 11 74 11 27 and 10 43 mm respectively our results demonstrate theoretically and empirically the importance of viewing budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective and focusing on the differences of its controls in spatiotemporal processes keywords evapotranspiration budyko framework lumped parameter climate and underlying surface system spatiotemporal processes chinese loess plateau data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction based on the observed empirical relation among actual evapotranspiration et potential evapotranspiration et0 and precipitation p at a catchment budyko 1974 postulated that the long term average evapotranspiration ratio et p was dominantly controlled by the balance et0 p or dryness index di between atmospheric evaporative demand represented by et0 and water supply represented by p and proposed the original non parametric budyko equation for more than half a century several analytical functional forms of budyko models with one or more parameters have been developed to explain these observed deviations around the deterministic budyko curve among which the budyko fu equation fu 1981 zhang et al 2004 and the mezentsev choudhury yang equation denoted as budyko mcy equation choudhury 1999 mezentsev 1955 yang et al 2008 have found to be typical representative and got widespread successful applications the model parameters in these two equations are represented by w and n respectively notably w and n are analogous and a statistical relationship of w n 0 72 has been deduced in a previous study yang et al 2008 as the budyko fu equation was proposed model parameter w was perceived to be related to the underlying surface characteristics such as topography vegetation and soil fu 1981 1996 yang et al 2008 derived the budyko mcy equation and also linked model parameter n with non climatic catchment characteristics in previous studies some scholars directly described model parameter as landscape li et al 2016 liu et al 2021a yang et al 2021 land surface shao et al 2019 yu et al 2021 land specific liu et al 2021b or underlying surface ni et al 2022 yang et al 2022 parameter already in 1974 budyko 1974 realized the intra annual mismatch between p and et0 influenced precipitation partitioning as he observed that et p increased slightly with a parallel change in monthly p and et0 wolock and mccabe 1999 potter et al 2005 and hickel and zhang 2006 applied different simplified models to analyze the influence of intra annual distribution of water and energy on water balance subsequently various climate seasonality indexes were proposed and incorporated into the parameterization for model parameter de lavenne and andréassian 2018 liu et al 2018a liu et al 2022a petersen et al 2012 wang et al 2019 wang et al 2021 yang et al 2012 notably the climate seasonality and asynchrony index sai devised by liu et al 2018a has been widely applied in the research on the coupled water energy balance because it considers both the phase mismatch and amplitude difference between p and et0 cheng et al 2022 liu et al 2021a ning et al 2019 snow fraction f s is another climate factor affecting hydrological partitioning and has attracted wide attention liu et al 2022b liu et al 2022d berghuijs et al 2014 argued that higher f s was statistically correlated with increased annual runoff in the contiguous united states zhang et al 2015 reported a similar result in china ascribed to the increased runoff and decreased energy due to snowmelt in spring therefore several studies argued that model parameter represented the joint effects of land surface properties and climate factors besides di berghuijs and woods 2016a liu et al 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 noticeably some recent studies have identified p and et0 or di as influencing factors of model parameter for example jiang et al 2015 incorporated p into an empirical formula for n in weihe river basin in china yang et al 2016 combined the budyko mcy model with the stochastic model for soil moisture dynamics of porporato et al 2004 and derived the expression of n including di mean rainfall depth per event rooting depth and plant available water content these studies provide new insights into the controls of model parameter however intuitively it seems to be inconsistent with traditional cognition and somewhat redundant as the original budyko model has already incorporated p and et0 or di as the first control of catchment water balance but such a close relationship has also been confirmed in many other studies gao et al 2016 guillén et al 2021 huang et al 2022 li et al 2021b reaver et al 2022 saha et al 2020 wang et al 2022 wang et al 2018 it seems that many factors with potential physical meanings are related to model parameter even including p and et0 or di these new and emerging results on the controls of model parameter reflect the deepening of research on the coupled water energy balance although current studies have dug out diverse influencing factors of model parameter an intriguing and unanswered question arises why so many factors are associated with it which poses great challenge in interpreting its connotation on the other hand despite great achievements made on the influencing factors of budyko model parameter see table s1 several studies threw doubts on parametric model for example greve et al 2015 argued that budyko model parameter had no a prior physical meaning sposito 2017 critically pointed out that the statistical relationship between model parameter and biophysical characteristics may be spurious because the current physical interpretation of model parameter was not derived rigorously from mathematical reasoning reaver et al 2022 further argued that parametric budyko models were underdetermined and the current physical interpretations of model parameter were unfounded as we briefly outlined various viewpoints on budyko model parameter we also noticed that the general conclusions on the influence of its controls have not been reached among the existing studies the importance of vegetation has drawn extensive interests and been well documented donohue et al 2007 donohue et al 2010 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2001 zhang et al 2016 however previous studies have revealed its positive negative and non significant effects on model parameter for instance yang et al 2009 found in china that the vegetation coverage was positively correlated with model parameter in the yellow river basin and the inland river basin but negatively correlated in the hai river basin padrón et al 2017 assembled a global dataset of 2733 catchments and suggested that the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was not significantly correlated with w for any climate type another example is about the f s some scholars argued that a precipitation shift from snow to rain decreased the streamflow and the larger f s was conducive to increase runoff rather than et berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2022b zhang et al 2015 however li et al 2021b and ning et al 2019 observed opposite behaviors in the chinese loess plateau clp where f s was positively associated with budyko model parameter these inconsistent results may be related to not only the spatial heterogeneity of controls on precipitation partitioning but also the differences in the perspectives analyzed i e from temporal or spatial processes catchment scale hydrologic behavior generally reflects the complex interaction of climate vegetation topography and soil donohue et al 2012 gentine et al 2012 milly 1994 wang et al 2016 xu et al 2013b yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 among which topography and soil generally change slightly in temporal process while climate and vegetation have relatively evident interannual variations however the influences of factors with obvious interannual variations on precipitation partitioning also vary temporally and spatially ning et al 2019 showed that climate seasonality and vegetation had significant effects on the inter annual variation of w in the clp but the effects of climate seasonality gradually weakened with increasing time scales in the spatial process f s and vegetation coverage played dominant roles most of the previous studies focused on the spatial process and paid less attention to the temporal process several recent studies analyzed the influencing factors of the time varying budyko model parameter jiang et al 2015 li et al 2021b wang et al 2022 a common feature of these studies is that the influencing factors revealed all included temperature et0 or p which was very interesting as these climatic factors were seldom found in the studies on spatial process a possible reason for this is that the temporal variations in the underlying surface conditions are comparatively small and thus the effects of climate factors are amplified this demonstrates the significant differences in the influencing factors of model parameter in spatiotemporal processes it is crucial to realize such differences for understanding the coupled water energy balance at a catchment more deeply the primary concern here is how we should view model parameter and whether there exists a unified understanding of its influencing factors in light of this we first reviewed three widely employed parametric budyko equations theoretically and proposed a unified understanding on model parameter from earth system science perspective on this basis taking the clp as an example we 1 comprehensively explored the climate and underlying surface factors affecting w 2 analyzed the correlation between factors and their differences in spatiotemporal processes then 3 developed the empirical formulae for w to estimate spatiotemporal variations in et with considering collinearity problems it is expected that the theoretical review and empirical test here advance the understanding of budyko model parameter and catchment water balance 2 theoretical interpretation of the budyko model parameter the parametric budyko equations have the following general form zhou et al 2015b 1 et p f et 0 p c where et is annual evapotranspiration mm p is annual precipitation mm et0 is annual potential evapotranspiration mm and c is the model parameter that adjusts the partitioning of p into et and runoff r a larger model parameter indicates larger et p this free parameter provides great flexibility in moving budyko curves in budyko space the three parametric budyko equations of interest here are presented in table 1 budyko mcy equation was sourced from mezentsev 1955 and choudhury 1999 and the formal mathematical derivation was given by yang et al 2008 in the mathematical reasoning yang et al 2008 suggested that et was an implicit function of p et0 and et and started their mathematical reasoning from the implicit function eq 5 in their 2008 paper 2 et f 1 p et 0 e t ultimately the analytically derived parametric budyko equation can be expressed as follows 3 et f 2 p et 0 n in eq 2 et serves as both the dependent variable and one of the independent variables in eq 3 the model parameter n replaces the independent variable et therefore it can be inferred straightforward that when interpreting model parameter we should consider all factors affecting et likewise we noticed similar theoretical basis of the mathematical reasoning by fu 1981 where he defined residual evaporation et0 et and residual precipitation p et and presented the partial derivative of et with respect to p and et0 as the initial step in his mathematical procedure both partial derivatives are expressed as functions of et see eqs 1 and 2 in zhang et al 2004 which indirectly implied that et was expressed as an implicit function as eq 2 budyko fu equation was proposed by dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning fu 1981 and later gained wide popularity in hydrological studies after being revisited by zhang et al 2004 fu 1996 realized the need for a more general and convenient method to determine the model parameter and deduced a calculating formula for w as a function of p r and other terms related to the underlying surface characteristics this can be expressed as follows 4 w 1 a p 365 b 1 r p r p k where a b and k reflect the effects of the underlying surface characteristics with fitting values of 0 2928 1 210 and 0 393 for mountain and plateau areas 0 4852 1 541 and 0 140 for plain areas and 0 9518 0 403 and 0 530 for sichuan basin respectively it is clear that the ratio of r to p reflects not only the underlying surface characteristics such as topography vegetation and soil but also the climate factors affecting et wang and tang 2014 applied the generalized proportionality hypothesis for mean annual water balance at a catchment and derived a one parameter budyko equation referred to as the budyko wt equation according to this hypothesis p has a priority to meet the demand for initial evaporation e0 and the remaining water p e0 is left for the competition between r and continuing evaporation et e0 the potential for continuing evaporation is denoted as et0 e0 and the potential for r is the remaining water after consumption by e0 based on the assumption that the ratio of continuous evaporation to its potential is equal to that of r to its potential the budyko wt equation was derived with model parameter ε expressed as e0 et a higher ε indicates a higher proportion of e0 in total et and thus less water available for r and continuing evaporation therefore a higher ε means a larger et p noticeably budyko wt equation explicitly presents the model parameter as a function of et chen and wang 2015 wang and tang 2014 similarly the expression of budyko fu model parameter eq 4 indirectly contains et because r can be expressed by p et since model parameter is a function of et all factors affecting et may also affect model parameter naturally this conveys strongly that climate and underlying surface factors jointly affect budyko model parameter specifically climate factors not only include the widely recognized rainfall intensity climate seasonality snow fraction etc but also contain p and et0 or di from the perspective of earth system science all these factors are interconnected and influence each other and the relationships among them also vary across temporal and spatial processes thus the budyko model parameter should be a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system in the following we take the clp as an example to test the factors of model parameter and their relations and the analyses are conducted between years temporal process and between catchments spatial process respectively note that here the analysis of spatial process is conducted on mean annual scale 3 case study 3 1 materials and methods 3 1 1 study area the clp is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yellow river in china and spans the sub humid semi arid and arid climatic zones from the southeast to the northwest owing to the highly erodible loess sparse vegetation coverage and high intensity of rainstorms the clp has long suffered severe soil erosion in recent decades with the implementation of a series of ecological restoration measures such as the grain for green project the regional vegetation coverage and ecological environment have improved substantially chen et al 2015 li et al 2017 liu and lei 2015 zhang et al 2022a in this study 15 typical catchments in the clp are selected for analysis and fig 1 shows their distribution together with the meteorological and hydrological stations these catchments were located in areas with significant vegetation restoration in the clp many studies on et have been conducted in this region and can be available for reference gao et al 2016 li et al 2021b liang et al 2015 the mean annual 1960 2020 p and et 0 using the penman equation penman 1948 for these catchments were 295 513 mm and 1155 1305 mm respectively 3 1 2 data collection monthly streamflow data of the 15 hydrological stations in the clp were collected from the loess plateau subcenter of the national earth system science data center https loess geodata cn because the selected ndvi data only covered the period of 1982 2015 streamflow data were chosen to be maximally consistent with the ndvi data and the record length of streamflow data in the 15 catchments ranged from 23 to 34 years daily meteorological data were acquired from the national meteorological information centre of the china meteorological administration https data cma cn seven daily meteorological variables including precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature mean temperature mean atmospheric pressure sunshine duration and mean wind speed were extracted from 138 meteorological stations within and around the clp the above daily meteorological variables were then used to calculate daily et0 based on the penman equation penman 1948 and the computation of all terms in the equation followed the method and procedure given in fao 56 allen et al 1998 penman equation is expressed as follows 5 et 0 δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ f u 2 e s e a where δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve at the air temperature kpa γ is the psychometric constant kpa r n is the net radiation mm day g is the heat flux into the ground mm day often neglected at daily scale e s and e a are the saturated and actual vapor pressure taken at the air temperature kpa respectively the wind function f u 2 can be represented as f u 2 0 26 1 0 54 u 2 penman 1948 where u 2 is the daily average wind speed at 2 m height m s and is converted from the wind speed at 10 m height u 10 m s by u 2 u 10 2 10 1 7 daily et0 of all the meteorological stations were aggregated into the monthly values the monthly values were then spatially interpolated using the kriging algorithm finally catchment scale monthly et0 was obtained by arithmetically averaging the gridded data in each catchment and further they were summed to annual values ndvi data were sourced from the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms ndvi 3 g v1 dataset https iridl ldeo columbia edu sources nasa arc ecocast gimms ndvi3g v1p0 the dataset spans from 1982 to 2015 and has the longest record length currently available with the spatial and temporal resolution of 1 12 approximately 8 km and 15 days respectively a digital elevation model dem at 30 m resolution was from aster gdem v2 https yceo yale edu aster gdem global elevation data the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks dataset was derived from the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters https globalchange bnu edu cn research soil3 the dataset was developed by dai et al 2013 and included a variety of soil hydraulic parameters with vertical depths of 0 1 383 m divided into seven layers following bai et al 2019 the ks was calculated by taking the top five layers namely 0 49 3 cm soil depths all data were spatially averaged over each catchment on the arcgis platform 3 1 3 influencing factors of model parameter on long term scale the water storage change δs is negligible while on annual scale it is generally necessary to consider the potential influence of the interannual variation in δs we conducted water balance analysis on the scale of hydrological year from may to april of the next year to minimize the impact of δs gao et al 2017 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2020 et calculated based on the water balance equation et p r was used as the observed et etobs and w was then solved numerically in budyko fu equation six explanatory variables of w were selected in this study including di sai f s ndvi catchment relief ratio cr and relative infiltration capacity ks i r several climate seasonality indexes have been proposed to quantify the mismatch between p and et0 within a year among which the sai proposed by liu et al 2018a has been found to perform better in explaining the variations in w ning et al 2019 in the construction process liu et al 2018a referred to the concept of phase shifts of seasonal p and et0 proposed by berghuijs and woods 2016b which provides a more reasonable description of seasonal distribution of p and et0 the proposed index represents not only the seasonal amplitude difference between p and et0 but also the phase mismatch between them 6a

and e t 0 are their monthly averages τ is a seasonal period of 0 5 year 6 months in tropical regions and 1 year 12 months in other regions δ p and δ e t 0 are relative amplitudes of p and et0 respectively s p and s e t 0 are phase shifts of p and et0 respectively we determined sai with a fixed phase calculated by mean monthly p and et0 because it was more closely related to w than that with an annual varying phase calculated by monthly p and et0 each year ning et al 2019 the larger the sai the great the mismatch between the intra annual water supply and demand f s is the fraction of precipitation falling as snow over a particular period it was reported that precipitation phase shift affected precipitation partitioning berghuijs et al 2014 we calculate f s using the daily temperature and daily precipitation same to the method employed by berghuijs et al 2014 i e the daily precipitation with daily mean temperature below 1 was considered fully as snowfall cr is the altitude difference in a certain area and quantitatively reflects the topographic roughness dem data can be used to obtain cr quickly and conveniently the key is to determine the optimal threshold window which can be obtained using the mean change point method han et al 2012 after calculating the cr for each catchment we divided it by the cr of the clp to make it a dimensionless form following yang et al 2007 the ratio of ks to the mean precipitation intensity ir is used to represent the relative infiltration capacity where ir is the ratio of total precipitation to total precipitation days mm day in a year for a catchment 3 2 results 3 2 1 relationships of w with its explanatory variables in the interannual process linear and power regressions were used to analyze the relationships between w and its influencing factors considering the distribution characteristics of the data points table 2 it can be observed that the power function relationships between w and di reached a very significant level p 0 01 in 11 catchments and a significant level p 0 05 in one catchment but was not statistically significant p 0 05 in the other three c6 c8 and c12 fig 2 generally there existed a negative correlation between w and di on annual scale we found quite interestingly very significant power function relationships p 0 01 between w and sai in 11 catchments except for c5 c6 c8 and c12 which were very similar to the w di relationships in the interannual process w and f s were linearly correlated in only one catchment p 0 05 whereas there was no significant relationship in the other 14 catchments ndvi produced positive effects on w in the interannual process while the linear relationship between them was significant in 10 catchments p 0 05 but not significant in the other five catchments p 0 05 our findings suggested that di sai and ndvi had significant effects on model parameter w whilst f s had no significant effect on w in the 15 selected catchments in the clp in terms of spatial process w had very significant relationships with di sai ndvi cr and ks i r p 0 01 but no significant relationship with f s fig 3 the r2 was the highest between w and ks i r r2 0 50 followed by that between w and cr r2 0 48 ndvi r2 0 46 sai r2 0 46 and di r2 0 40 it can be also observed that w increased with ndvi and cr but decreased with the increasing ks i r sai and di this suggested that large ndvi and cr contributed to et while large ks i r di and sai were favorable for r with all else being equal 3 2 2 interrelations between explanatory variables before establishing functions for w to estimate the spatiotemporal variations in et we investigated the interrelations between influencing factors from table 2 it can be found that the relationships of w with di or sai were somewhat similar it can also be observed from the scatterplots fig 3 a b that the distributions of data points di w and sai w were relatively consistent we therefore surmise that di and sai may be correlated to some extent as shown in fig 4 di and sai were indeed closely related in both the temporal and spatial processes with the linear correlation coefficients r all reaching over 0 90 considering that the mathematical expression of sai contains di explicitly we could infer that the value of sai was largely influenced by di and the relationship between sai and w actually conveyed di s influence in light of results above we could conclude that w had close relationships with di sai and ndvi in the interannual process whereas no significant relationship was observed between w and f s consequently di sai and ndvi affected w in the interannual process the pearson correlation coefficients displayed in fig 5 showed negative relationships between di and ndvi in all 15 catchments however the negative correlations were significant in only five catchments p 0 05 broadly we could conclude that di was weakly related to ndvi and they were relatively independent of each other on annual scale given the highly linear correlation between di and sai we could deduce that sai and ndvi would also show a relatively independent relationship as confirmed by ning et al 2019 further the relationships among influencing factors of w in spatial process were also explored as shown in fig 6 di sai ndvi cr and ks i r were intimately interconnected more specifically di and ndvi were closely related with r2 being as high as 0 85 the negative correlation between them indicated that the drier the climate the lower the vegetation cover additionally there also existed negative correlations between ndvi and ks i r ks i r and cr as well as cr and di while positive linear correlations were observed between ks i r and di and between cr and ndvi the relationships between sai with ndvi cr and ks i r in spatial process were rather consistent with these between di and the three factors because di and sai were strongly correlated 3 2 3 formulae for w to estimate spatiotemporal variations in et in the above empirical analysis in the clp w was obtained by numerically solving the budyko fu equation i e the inverse method the inverse method can actually be viewed as expressing w as an implicit function of p et0 and et i e water balance based et therefore w obtained in this way was inevitably related to di intrinsically considering this feature of the inverse method we did not include di to construct the empirical formula for w in the interannual process sai and ndvi were the two main factors affecting w and they showed relatively independent relationships based on the combined annual dataset of the 15 catchments we analyzed the relationship of w with sai and ndvi respectively as depicted in fig 7 sai and ndvi had inverse impacts on w the r2 of w with sai and ndvi were 0 29 and 0 33 respectively and both reached a very significant level p 0 01 according to the relationships shown in fig 7 and the lower boundary of w i e w 1 the empirical formula for w in temporal process based on sai and ndvi was determined by the least square method as follows 7 w 1 2 88 sai 0 32 ndvi 0 46 r adj 2 0 39 p 0 01 the modeled annual w was compared against wobs calculated by budyko fu equation fig s1 a it can be found that the eq 7 provided reasonable estimates of w in interannual process indicated by a small mean absolute error mae of 0 39 a cross validation test was applied to assess the performance of w empirical formula in et estimation in particular data from 14 catchments were selected to construct the empirical formula for w using the least square method and data from the remaining one was left for validation the calibration validation process was repeated 15 times the modeled et etmod was plotted against etobs in fig 8 a the r2 was 0 96 and the mae was 15 03 mm indicating that budyko fu equation with the empirical formula for w constructed by sai and ndvi together can capture the interannual variations in et well in spatial process sai ndvi cr and ks i r were found to affect w collectively and these four factors were closely related to each other fig 6 the stepwise regression analysis showed that there existed multicollinearity problems among these factors implying that they could not be included into the empirical formula for w together therefore we used sai ndvi cr and ks i r separately to model w as follows 8 w 1 2 31 s a i 0 72 r adj 2 0 42 p 0 01 9 w 1 2 92 n d v i 0 57 r adj 2 0 41 p 0 01 10 w 1 1 88 cr 0 44 r adj 2 0 42 p 0 01 11 w 1 11 58 ks ir 0 39 r adj 2 0 47 p 0 01 sai ndvi cr and ks i r accounted for 42 41 42 and 47 of the variances in w respectively fig s1 b e presented the comparisons of w modeled by the above four empirical formulae against those calculated using budyko fu equation good agreement can be found with relatively small mae of 0 27 0 27 0 27 and 0 24 respectively next comparisons of etmol using eqs 8 11 against etobs were made by calculating r2 and mae fig 8 b e as expected the four formulae all exhibited a good coherence in et estimation with mae of 11 16 11 74 11 27 and 10 43 mm respectively indicating a reasonably accurate prediction of mean annual et estimated using sai ndvi cr or ks i r 4 discussion 4 1 interpreting budyko model parameter from earth system science perspective budyko 1974 found that there existed systematic deviations from the mean dependence presented by his non parametric equation indicating that the variation in et could not be explained only by the climate factors represented by p and et0 thus directly promoting subsequent establishment of a series of parametric budyko equations the introduction of adjustable model parameter allows the curve to move freely in budyko space thus greatly expanding the flexibility and application of budyko framework du et al 2016 guo et al 2019 jiang et al 2015 potter et al 2005 wu et al 2017 xiong and guo 2012 in a recent study reaver et al 2022 argued that the model parameter in parametric budyko equation was a proxy variable for et p which could actually be directly proved by the implicit function form of the model parameter i e w g p e t 0 e t besides reaver et al 2022 raised doubt on the assumptions and interpretations of parametric equations however considering the curve fitting of water balance data the parametric budyko equation has a great practical value in hydrological studies because it is impossible to reproduce the water balance characteristics of different catchments using the entirely deterministic and non parametric curve much previous efforts have been devoted to establishing empirical formulas for budyko model parameter to estimate et compared with the non parametric equations they should all improve the estimation performance of et without exception li et al 2013 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2019 xu et al 2013a yang et al 2007 if turning back to the non parametric equation we really come full circle from this point of view parametric budyko equation is necessary the problem here is the lack of scientific consensus and reasonable explanation for model parameter it is widely held that budyko model parameter represents the underlying surface characteristics subsequent studies found that some climate factors such as climate seasonality and snow fraction also affected the model parameter table s1 through theoretical and data analyses we revealed that di was also an important influencing factor of model parameter in the clp climate vegetation topography and soil were intimately interconnected over long term scale which was consistent with the viewpoint in earth system science that the components of the earth system were coupled to each other earth system science considers the earth as a whole and recognizes it as an integrative interactive and dynamics system most importantly it emphasizes the interrelation and interaction between the various parts within the system lenton 2016 steffen et al 2020 notably et refers to the water phase transition from liquid to vapor and plays a critical role in global water cycle and energy exchanges it involves various biological and physical processes in the climate and underlying surface system in the vertical direction atmospheric state serves as its upper boundary while soil or vegetation constitutes the lower boundary liu et al 2022c hydrological processes usually represent the interactions of climate topography vegetation soil etc likewise as a transparent framework for analyzing the hydrological processes the budyko models characterize these integrated effects through the model parameter therefore the model parameter can be regarded as a lumped variable reflecting the integrative effects of the climate and underlying surface system in practice model parameter can be characterized by one or more factors while considering the variation in their coupled relationships during temporal or spatial processes among multiple physiogeographic elements the role of vegetation has attracted extensive attention as it is taken as an indicator integrating the effects of climate soil and topography on water balance however we should also realize the role of factors coupled with vegetation for example li et al 2013 suggested that low vegetation coverage may be related to large seasonal phase mismatch between precipitation and radiation gentine et al 2012 found that the deeper rooting structure of plants buffered the phase difference between precipitation and radiation these results actually reflected the coupled relations between the vegetation characteristics coverage and rooting depth and the climate seasonality in addition plant rooting depth has also been associated with climate feng et al 2012 laio et al 2006 found that the rooting depth was the deepest in the environments where p and et0 were approximately equal guswa 2008 further pointed out that increasing wetness produced deeper roots in arid environments in humid environments the rooting depth generally decreased with increasing wetness another factor related to the rooting depth was the plant available soil water holding capacity pawc which was incorporated into the expression for the parameter of the ecohydrological model developed by porporato et al 2004 another parametric budyko equation cong et al 2015 donohue et al 2012 shen et al 2017 yang et al 2016 by definition pawc is related to both the soil hydraulic properties and the vegetation characteristic another coupled relation to mention is that between vegetation type and di one such support was the work of budyko 1974 who initially employed the radiative dryness index one of di expressions to classify the different ecosystems as tundra forest steppe semidesert and desert consequently various physiogeographic elements cannot be viewed in isolation instead they are related to each other budyko model parameter actually can be the proxy for the interconnections among them in addition it is imperative to consider budyko model parameter as a lumped variable integrating the effects of catchment underlying surface and climate factors for proper application of budyko model and reasonable interpretation of the results for example the empirical formula for model parameter varies across studies implying the spatial difference of controls of precipitation partitioning from the perspective of earth system science this spatial difference reflected the regional differentiation of the physiogeographic environments greve et al 2015 mentioned that the specific dependence of model parameter on biophysical features may vary greatly between catchments and it was impossible to directly predict model parameter for ungauged catchments however because of the complexity of hydrological processes and the diversity of catchment groups analyzed general results usually did not exist chen et al 2022 cheng et al 2022 guillén et al 2021 li and quiring 2021 it is expected that the results obtained in one catchment group should not be extrapolated arbitrarily to other groups however the results obtained in the same catchment group could be transferable in temporal process to a certain degree we suggest that the model parameter in budyko framework be termed as a lumped parameter or just model parameter instead of being related to underlying surface characteristics unilaterally this allows us to not only view model parameter more comprehensively but also be aware of the climate impact on model parameter in this way when conducting attribution analysis based on the budyko framework we can reappraise the relative contribution of climate change and human activities on hydrological change with the improved interpretation of model parameter 4 2 differences of factors influencing w in temporal and spatial processes in this study w was negatively correlated with di and sai while positively correlated with ndvi in both spatial and temporal processes a larger sai implies a greater mismatch between p and et0 in a year therefore the proportion of et in p will decrease and the proportion of r will increase leading to the negative correlation between sai and w liu et al 2018a ning et al 2019 the reason why w and ndvi are positively correlated is that increased vegetation cover helps to reduce surface runoff increase rainfall infiltration and leads to more plant transpiration and evaporation of intercepted precipitation li et al 2013 ning et al 2017 the general explanation for the effect of topography on water balance is that steep sloping land is conducive to runoff generation therefore cr is expected to be negatively correlated with w however the effect of cr on catchment water balance in the clp is particular ning et al 2019 showed that the positive correlation between cr and w can be attributed to the large scale ecological restoration projects in this region the grain for green project in particular requires that cropland on steep slopes 25 be returned to forest and grassland these measures resulted in a positive correlation between the vegetation coverage and slope in other words the steeper the terrain the higher the vegetation coverage in the clp moreover the steeper the terrain the less interference there is from human activities and the better the natural recovery of vegetation thus w is larger f s has been found to exert impacts on precipitation partitioning abatzoglou and ficklin 2017 berghuijs et al 2014 li et al 2021b ning et al 2021 some studies showed that the increase of f s would lead to a higher percentage of r than et thus resulting in a negative correlation between w and f s liu et al 2022b liu et al 2022d zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 attributed this to the increase in snowmelt runoff and decrease in available energy due to snowmelt that is different from the results presented here in this study the average f s of the 15 catchments was only 0 04 far less than the threshold of 0 15 defined by berghuijs et al 2014 to identify snow affected catchments less snow in winter will evaporate or infiltrate quickly after the snowfall is melt instead of flowing away through channels to generate runoff in fact snowmelt runoff in china has mostly been observed in the northeastern part qi et al 2022 tian et al 2018 northwest inland region sorg et al 2012 wang et al 2010 and the source region of the yellow river liu et al 2018b zhang et al 2022b there are few reports on snowmelt runoff in the clp therefore the greater the proportion of snow in p the more water is available for evaporation and thus f s is positively correlated with w however in this study the positive relationships between w and f s were not significant in both the interannual and spatial processes two studies particular relevant here are these conducted by li et al 2021b and ning et al 2019 as they also examined the effect of f s on model parameter n and w respectively in the clp catchments but both reported a significant positive correlation p 0 01 it is worth noting that li et al 2021b used combined dataset averaged in a 9 year moving window from 14 catchments while ning et al 2019 used the mean annual values from 30 nested catchments one explanation for this discrepancy could stem from the spatiotemporal scales of analyses that is using data either from the moving window method or from nested catchments could confuse and complicate the role of f s in model parameter further analyses are required to investigate the reasons for the differences related to the different spatiotemporal scales in the interannual process the relationships between di and ndvi were not significant in most catchments fig 5 however in spatial process di and ndvi showed a very significant power function relationship with r2 being as high as 0 85 p 0 01 fig 6 a we interpret these different relations as the result of the large scale vegetation restoration projects implemented in the clp in recent decades afforestation and reforestation can significantly increase the vegetation coverage over a short period resulting in a lag response of vegetation growth to annual p and et0 nonetheless on long term scale vegetation has enough time to adapt to the regional climate and buffer human intervention to some extent gan et al 2021 gentine et al 2012 therefore there is a close relationship between di and ndvi on long term scale in spatial process the influencing factors of model parameter exhibited more coupled relations di sai ndvi cr and ks i r were closely related indicating that climate vegetation topography and soil interacted with each other on long term scale this interaction reflects the co evolution of the climate vegetation topography and soil in a catchment berghuijs et al 2020 gentine et al 2012 sivapalan 2006 troch et al 2015 yao and wang 2022 zhang et al 2022c yang et al 2009 found a significant positive correlation between slope tan β and ks i r r2 0 15 p 0 05 in the empirical formula for n established for 30 catchments in the hai river basin of china bai et al 2019 found that di and ndvi also showed strong correlation r2 0 69 when analyzing the influencing factors of budyko model parameter in 286 small catchments in china these studies emphasize that the interaction of various factors should be considered when analyzing the controls of budyko model parameter in the spatial process there are more coupled relations among the influencing factors driven by the co evolution considering the potential multicollinearity among factors and the availability of data it is suggested that relatively independent factors derived from easily accessible data be parameterized into the budyko model for better et modeling 4 3 limitations and uncertainties 4 3 1 effects of obtaining w by inverse method determining the model parameter w is the prerequisite for analyzing its controls and interpreting its connotation in this study the widely used inverse method was adopted to calculate w buzacott and vervoort 2021 guillén et al 2021 jaramillo et al 2018 kim and chun 2021 liu et al 2018a yang et al 2008 namely that w was obtained through solving the budyko fu equation using water balance based et we also noticed in some studies that model parameter was taken as a fixed value optimized with modeled et and water balance based et of multiple catchments donohue et al 2011 potter and zhang 2009 zhang and brutsaert 2021 zhang et al 2008 the optimization can be carried out for all catchments or for different catchments groups categorized by different factor such as the vegetation type and precipitation seasonality essentially the process of getting the optimized value reflects the idea of the inverse method because the modeled et needs to be calculated using the budyko equation the inverse method can actually be viewed as expressing w as an implicit function of p et0 and et guo et al 2019 implying the inherent relations between w with p and et0 or di therefore di was not used to construct the empirical formula for w in this study however the theoretical analysis demonstrated that the correlation between w and di was not only a mathematical problem caused by the inverse method but also a fact that can be supported by the solid theoretical evidence from the mathematical derivation of parametric budyko equations and the model parameter expression on the other hand previous studies have revealed the close relationships between w and vegetation topography soil and other factors from the perspective of earth system science the coupling correlations between climate and these factors also make w and di interrelated 4 3 2 effects of ignoring δs in annual water balance previous studies have investigated the role of δs in catchment water balance calculations han et al 2020 shao et al 2021 wang 2012 considering the effect of δs one should be cautious when applying the budyko model on annual scale following existing studies we conducted the analysis on the scale of hydrological year without incorporating δs in the water balance calculation ning et al 2017 wang et al 2021 zhou et al 2015a zhou et al 2020 this may lead to some uncertainties to explore these uncertainties we used a reconstructed monthly gravity recovery and climate experiment grace total water storage anomaly fields li et al 2021a li et al 2020 this data has relatively high spatial resolution 0 5 and long times series 1979 2020 and has been widely employed to quantify δs guan et al 2022 xiong et al 2022 zou et al 2022 fig s2 showed the distribution of δs and δs p in the 15 catchments the results showed that δs was approximately 20 40 mm year in the 15 catchments δs p roughly varied from 5 to 10 indicating that δs was relatively small relative to p fig s3 displayed the distribution of annual water balance data points and budyko curves with and without considering δs we found that in two cases the discrepancy of distributions of the data points was rather small and the best fit budyko curves basically coincided additionally et and w in two cases were all linearly correlated with small bias fig s4 further we evaluated the influencing factors of w in interannual process when considering δs table s2 and fig s5 we noted that w and di still exhibited a close relationship in most catchments besides sai and ndvi had a significant effect on w whereas the relationship between f s and w was not significant overall the relationships between w with di sai ndvi and f s were consistent with those obtained when ignoring δs therefore ignoring δs in interannual process had no impact on the conclusion of influencing factors of w more importantly the main conclusion namely the connotation interpretation of the budyko model parameter will not be affected however this does affect the regression coefficients in the w empirical formula it should be noted that grace based δs is more appropriate for large global basins because of its coarse resolution hasan and tarhule 2020 macedo et al 2019 tourian et al 2018 additionally this method was recently criticized for application in areas affected by coal mining chen et al 2020 sun et al 2022 therefore grace data was not used to quantify δs in annual water balance in this study instead we conducted the analysis on the scale of hydrological year we found that even if the grace data was used to incorporate δs in the water balance calculation the conclusions of this study will not change future development of δs dataset with higher spatial resolution and longer covering period will facilitate the application of the budyko model on finer spatiotemporal scales 5 conclusion budyko framework serves as a convenient and powerful tool for the analysis of coupled water energy balance at a catchment in recent years the understanding of budyko model parameter has been deepening but there is still no general agreement on its essential property this study reviewed three parametric budyko equations and proposed that model parameter is a lumped variable representing the integrative effects of climate and underlying surface system instead of being related only to underlying surface conditions or factors besides di then based on budyko fu equation and hydrometeorological data of 15 typical catchments in the clp the controls of model parameter w including climate and underlying surface factors were comprehensively analyzed and the differences between temporal and spatial processes were explored our results showed that w integrated the effects of climate di and sai and underlying surface factors ndvi cr and ks i r on water balance in the clp specifically w and di were closely related in spatiotemporal processes sai and di were strongly and linearly correlated and the relationship between sai and w indirectly conveyed di s influence both f s and ndvi exerted positive effects on w while only the latter reached a significant level in the interannual process di sai and ndvi were the three main factors influencing w whereas in spatial process di sai ndvi cr and ks i r all had significant impacts on w and these five factors were closely related considering the inherent connection between di and the inverse w di was not included in the empirical formula for w combined with budyko fu equation the empirical formula for w based on sai and ndvi in temporal process and that respectively based on sai ndvi cr and ks i r in spatial process all performed acceptably in estimating et for the 15 catchments this study presents a deeper interpretation of budyko model parameter and emphasizes the importance of viewing budyko model parameter and analyzing its controls from the earth system science perspective credit authorship
